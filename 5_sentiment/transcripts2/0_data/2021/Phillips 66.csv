At the start of this last year, we could not have envisioned the unprecedented challenges that we faced in 2020. We're proud of and grateful to the many people who worked diligently and tirelessly to develop the COVID-19 vaccines. We're optimistic about the positive impact the vaccines will have on economic recovery in the months ahead. 
In the fourth quarter, we had an adjusted loss of $507 million or $1.16 per share. Market conditions remain challenged. Our Refining business continue to be affected by demand destruction associated with the pandemic. For the year, we had an adjusted loss of $382 million or $0.89 per share. We operated well and included major growth projects in our midstream segment, including the Gray Oak Pipeline, our largest pipeline project to date, and the Sweeny Hub Phase 2 expansion. 
We took early decisive steps to reduce cost and capital spending, secure additional liquidity and suspend our share repurchases. We exceeded $500 million in cost reductions to cut capital spending by more than $700 million. These actions, combined with cash flow generation from our diversified portfolio, provided us with financial flexibility to maintain our strong investment-grade credit ratings, sustain the dividend and to navigate the crisis. Our focus continues to be on the well-being of our company, our employees and our communities. 
In 2020, we contributed $32 million to charitable organizations, including $6 million for COVID-19 and disaster relief. 
Even with the distractions and the challenges of the pandemic, our people remain focused on safe, reliable operations and execution of our strategy. 2020 was the safest year in the history of our company. Our total recordable injury rate of 0.11 was 30% better than our industry leading rate in 2019. Our process safety improved by 60%, and our environmental performance was our best ever. 
In 2020, we generated $2.1 billion of operating cash flow and returned $2 billion to shareholders. Since we formed the company, we've returned approximately $28 billion to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases and exchanges. We remain committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. 
Entering 2021, there's still uncertainty in the market. We'll continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation. 
In December, we announced our 2021 capital budget of $1.7 billion, and that includes Phillips 66 Partners. This is a reduction compared to recent years the capital for debt repayment. In 2020, we added approximately $4 billion of debt. We plan to reduce debt to pre-COVID levels as cash generation improves. 
Our 2021 capital budget includes $1.1 billion of sustaining capital for reliability, safety and environmental projects. In addition, $600 million of growth capital is directed towards in-flight projects and investments in renewable fuels. 
During the quarter, we advanced our growth program. At the Sweeny Hub Frac 2 commenced operations in September, and Frac 3 started operations in October. We plan to resume construction of our fourth fractionator in the second half of 2021. Upon completion, the Sweeny Hub will have 550,000 barrels a day of fractionation capacity supported by long-term customer commitments. 
At the South Texas Gateway Terminal, the second dock commenced crude oil export operations in the fourth quarter. On expected completion in the first quarter of 2021, the terminal will have 8.6 million barrels of storage capacity and up to 800,000 barrels per day of dock throughput capacity. Phillips 66 Partners owns a 25% interest in the terminal. 
Phillips 66 Partners continued the construction of the C2G Pipeline, connecting its clean storage caverns to petrochemical facilities in the Corpus Christi area. The project is backed by long-term commitments and expected to be completed in mid-2021. 
At the Beaumont Terminal, we completed the fourth dock, bringing total dock capacity to 800,000 barrels per day. The terminal has a total crude and product storage capacity of 16.8 million barrels. Since acquiring the terminal in 2014, we've doubled the dock capacity and more than doubled its storage capacity. 
In Chemicals, CPChem is advancing optimization and debottleneck opportunities. This includes recently approved product -- projects at Cedar Bayou facility that will increase production of ethylene and polyethylene. In addition, CPChem is developing an expansion of its normal alcohol production. 
During the quarter, CPChem announced its first production of polyethylene from recycled plastics at its Cedar Bayou facility and received ISCC class certification. CPChem remains committed to finding sustainable solutions, including the elimination of plastic waste in the environment. 
We're advancing our Rodeo Renewed project at the San Francisco refinery. We expect to complete the diesel hydrotreater conversion in mid-2021, which will produce 8,000 barrels per day. Full conversion of the facility in early 2024 to produce over 50,000 barrels a day of renewable fuels. 
This capital-efficient investment is expected to deliver strong returns and will reduce the plant's greenhouse gas emissions by 50%. This project helps California to meet its low carbon objectives. 
In Marketing, we recently acquired 106 retail sites in the Central region through a joint venture. This aligns with our strategy of securing long-term placement of the Phillips 66 6 refinery production and extending participation in the value chain of retail. 
We've also advanced our digital transformation efforts, fostered innovation across our company and implemented new technologies, including digital systems for work processes, artificial intelligence to predict maintenance requirements and optimize processing unit performance. Our company is making investments to competitively position us for a low-carbon future. 
Earlier this month, we announced our emerging energy organization. This proves charge was establishing a lower carbon business platform. We will pursue opportunities within our portfolio such as renewable fuels and work with our company's Energy Research and Innovation Group to commercialize emerging energy technologies. For example, in collaboration with Georgia Tech, Phillips 66 received a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy that will support development of the electrolysis technology that has the potential to convert CO2 into clean fuels. Our company is committed to addressing the global climate challenge, at the same time deliver shareholder returns. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results."

We generated operat",1320,"Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our fourth quarter results. 
We reported a loss of $539 million. Excluding special items, we had an adjusted loss of $507 million or $1.16 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $639 million, including distributions from equity affiliates of $400 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $506 million, including $239 million for growth projects. We paid $393 million in dividends during the fourth quarter. 
Moving to Slide 5. This slide shows the $506 million reduction in adjusted results from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Chemicals adjusted pretax income increased quarter-over-quarter, while the other segments declined. The income tax variance relates to favorable tax impacts we had in the third quarter related to our ability under the CARES Act to carry back net operating losses previous periods. 
Slide 6 shows our midstream results. Fourth quarter adjusted pretax income was $323 million, a decrease of $31 million from the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $196 million, down $6 million from the previous quarter. The decrease was due to lower pipeline and terminal volumes driven by lower refinery utilization. This was partially offset by higher equity earnings on the Bakken pipeline. 
NGL and other adjusted pretax income was $86 million. The $16 million decrease from the prior quarter was due to lower equity earnings as well as reduced propane and butane trading results. This was partially offset by higher fractionation volumes, reflecting the ramp-up of Sweeny fracs 2 and 3, which demonstrated operations above design capacity. The Sweeny fractionation complex averaged 376,000 barrels per day during the fourth quarter. 
Also at the Sweeny Hub, the Freeport LPG export facility loaded a record 39 cargoes in the fourth quarter. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $41 million was down $9 million from the previous quarter, reflecting lower Sand Hills pipeline equity earnings and timing of maintenance costs. 
Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. Fourth quarter adjusted pretax income was $203 million, up $71 million from the third quarter. Olefins and polyolefins adjusted pretax income was $216 million. The $68 million increase from the previous quarter is due to higher polyethylene margins, partially offset by higher turnaround and maintenance costs. 
Global O&P utilization was 101%, supported by global consumer demand, including free packaging and medical supplies. CPChem polyethylene sales volumes set a new record in 2020. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S increased $8 million, primarily due to higher earnings from international equity affiliates driven by improved margins. During the fourth quarter, we received $215 million in cash distributions from CPChem. 
Turning to refining on Slide 8. Refining fourth quarter adjusted pretax loss was $1.1 billion compared to an adjusted pretax loss of $970 million last quarter. Both periods reflect the continued impact of challenging market conditions. The decreased results in the fourth quarter were largely driven by higher turnaround and maintenance activity. Pretax turnaround costs were $76 million, up from $41 million in the prior quarter. Maintenance costs increased primarily at the Alliance Refinery. We shut down Alliance in mid-September in preparation for Hurricane Sally, and it remained down for planned turnaround and maintenance activities during the fourth quarter. 
The refinery safely resumed operations earlier this month. 
Crude utilization was 69% compared with 77% last quarter. The fourth quarter clean product yield was 86%. 
Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the fourth quarter was $7.84 per barrel compared to $8.17 per barrel in the third quarter. Realized margin was $2.18 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 28%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 22%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. We make less gasoline and more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. During the quarter, the distillate crack improved $2.48 per barrel, while the gasoline crack decreased $1.74 per barrel, resulting in a modest improvement of our capture from the prior quarter. Losses from secondary products of $1.20 per barrel or $0.60 per barrel improved from the previous quarter due to improved NGL prices relative to crude. Losses from feedstock were $0.46 per barrel compared to $0.35 per barrel last quarter. 
The other category reduced realized margins by $3.08 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, clean product realizations and inventory impacts. 
Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted fourth quarter pretax income was $221 million compared with $417 million in the prior quarter. Marketing and Other decreased $185 million due to lower realized margins, reflecting rising prices during the quarter. We were also impacted by lower volumes related to COVID-19. And while marketing and other results were lower in the fourth quarter, full year 2020 adjusted pretax income of $1.24 billion was the highest since spin-off in 2012. 
Specialties decreased $11 million, largely due to lower finished lubricant margins. Refined product exports in the fourth quarter were 103,000 barrels per day. 
On Slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pretax costs of $235 million, an increase of $22 million from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to lower capitalized interest and higher employee-related expenses. 
Slide 12 shows the change in cash for the quarter. We started the quarter with a $1.5 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $639 million. This included a working capital benefit of $403 million, primarily due to the year-end drawdown of inventory. 
Net debt issuances were $1.4 billion. This included $1.75 billion in senior notes and repayment of $500 million on the term line. Phillips 66 Partners drew $125 million on its revolver. Capital spending was $506 million. We paid $393 million in dividends, Our ending cash balance was $2.5 billion. At December 31, we had $7.8 billion of committed liquidity, reflecting $2.5 billion of consolidated cash plus available capacity on our credit facilities of $5 billion at Phillips 66 and $300 million at Phillips 66 Partners. 
On Slide 13, we summarize our financial results for the year. In 2020, we had an adjusted loss of $382 million or $0.89 per share. We generated $2.1 billion of operating cash flow. Distributions from equity affiliates totaled $1.7 billion, including $632 million from CPChem. At the end of the fourth quarter, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 38%. 
Slide 14 shows full year cash flow. We began 2020 with a cash balance of $1.6 billion. Cash from operations was $2.4 billion, excluding working capital. It was a working capital use of approximately $300 million. We received a net $4.1 billion from our financing activities. We added $3.75 billion of debt at Phillips 66  and approximately $400 million at Phillips 66 Partners. As cash generation recovers, we will prioritize debt repayment. We remain committed to a conservative balance sheet and strong investment-grade credit ratings. 
Capital spending was $2.9 billion. We returned $2 billion to shareholders through $1.6 billion of dividends and $443 million of share repurchases. We suspended our share repurchase program in March. 
This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. 
In Chemicals, we expect the first quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, crude utilization will be adjusted according to market conditions. In January, utilization has been in the low 70% range. We expect first quarter pretax turnaround expenses to be between $200 million and $230 million. We anticipate first quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $240 million and $250 million pretax. For 2021, we plan full year turnaround expenses to be between $550 million and $600 million pretax. We expect corporate and other costs to be between $950 million and $1 billion pretax for the year. We anticipate full year D&A of about $1.5 billion. And finally, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the low 20% range. 
With that, we will now open the line for questions."

So first, kudos to the team on strong performance. 
Simultaneously, while the benefits of diversification and taking care of business, like you did last year, were clear. The pace of change in the industry seems to be quickening not only as it relates to energy policy. and likely future energy mix, but also that which investors expect from their investments in the sector. So I've got a couple of questions. 
One, how do you think -- how do you guys think about how to navigate this evolving and changing environment; two,  more tactical and strategic dexterity likely to be needed maybe more than in the past? Or do you think it's about the same? And then three, are there obvious implications for financial strategy for Phillips 66 along the way? So 3 questions."

So let's start at the top with kind of the overview. I think that for us, capital discipline -- capital allocation remains core to our strategy and what we do. That's returning capital to shareholders",755,"Okay. You gave me a lot to unpack there, Doug. Thanks. So let's start at the top with kind of the overview. I think that for us, capital discipline -- capital allocation remains core to our strategy and what we do. That's returning capital to shareholders. It's returns above our weighted average cost of capital on what we choose to invest in as a company. So those are our guiding lines or guiding stars as we think about this, when we think about energy transition. 
I tend to think about it in 3 buckets. near term, midterm and longer term, Doug, in terms of our response and how we're going to navigate through it. Clearly, in the near term, we're building a renewable fuels pathway. What we're doing -- so this year, midyear, we'll start up the first part of Rodeo 8,000 barrels a day. And by 2024, we'll have a full facility conversion, more than 50,000 barrels a day there. We're working with price renewables for 11,000 barrels a day of renewable coming out of that facility. We're kind of co-processing about 3,000 barrels a day at Humber today in the U.K. moving to 5,000 barrels a day. 
And so as we think about -- as we approach to the middle point of the decade, we should have $1 billion-ish of EBITDA at our renewable fuels business. So that's certainly one pathway we think about. 
The second bucket is kind of more the medium term. And as you know, we're a supplier of specialty graphite and to go into the anode production lithium-ion batteries, and we continue to work to improve that. to help improve battery performance but also lower cost. And so I think as we see EVs grow and they're going to grow, EV sales global are going to grow, that portion of the business is also going to grow. And I think we can make nice contributions there in terms of what we bring to batteries and battery technologies. 
And then maybe the third one is around hydrogen, and that's longer term. Certainly, today, we're building hydrogen fueling stations in Europe. So that's a first step. We're working in the United Kingdom with the Giga STAK consortium, which is taking offshore wind, electrolysis to make green hydrogen. We're using that in our Humber Refinery to reduce the carbon content of our fuels produced at Humber. 
And so as I think about hydrogen, our industry as big consumers and producers of hydrogen, we really understand it. I think that hydrogen moving into transportation fuels in a big way is probably decades out. But we'll continue to build a pathway around hydrogen for the longer term. You may have seen that we got a grant from the DOE, and we talked about it in the opening comments today, But that's really around our solid oxide fuel cell technology and taking CO2 and running through the fuel cell than to produce clean fuels. And so there's probably a pathway there for us, too. So our idea is we want to participate in energy transition. We want to do it where we can invest and earn returns that are above our weighted average cost of capital. We certainly want to exploit the technology base we have that use existing equipment where we can and convert it if we need to, like what we're doing at Rodeo. We try to find capital-efficient solutions where we can earn great returns. 
I think the other thing I want to point out here, Doug, is you think about the challenges that we have before us of providing reliable, affordable funded energy, at the same time, addressing the climate is something that's going to take a whole approach of the industry. But I think about the 10 million people that work in the industry today. They're problem solvers, they're engineers, they're scientists, they're marketing people. They're people that understand the complexity of the energy business today And I think they're some of the best people on the planet that are positioned to help solve this dual challenge that we have. And so I'm an optimist always. And I think that this industry and our company certainly will have big roles to play in the energy transition as we move forward. 
And I know you asked 3 questions, and I don't know if I answered 3, but I did the best I could with that. But maybe you want to ask me -- go ahead, if you want to follow up."

I think that it's early to do that in terms of how we've reoriented kind of the capital plan here in response to COVID, but also, I think as injury itself, has kind of paused in terms of the upstream and the midstream opportunities available to us. Certainly, we're probably going to run $200 million to $300 million under the growth plans we announced at that day and simply because we're not going to do Rodeo pipeline. We're not going to do pipeline and some of the other things that we had laid into the plan that we just stopped working on. But we may well find other opportunities. So you have Rodeo renew that's going to come in. It's going to be a big, big EBITDA generator that wasn't in those numbers. 
Vantage 66 would continue to prosecute that. If you remember, somewhere $600 million or so of that was around our value chain strategy optimization work we're going to do. And all that's mid-cycle predicated. So we've done a lot of work around there. We haven't been in mid-cycle conditions. And so in 2020, we're not achieving the results we thought we achieved there. But I think as we move into 2021 and into 2022, we're pretty optimistic that we get back to a recovery to mid-cycle conditions around that part of the portfolio.

And utilization, let's call it, system-wide, I think 69%, and you're running low 70s in January. 
Do you have a view on sort of the trajectory of utilization for the industry, recognizing in the near term, it's going to be very much demand dependent. And is there a good rule of thumb of refining utilization, when it gets to a certain level, you think the business is back to generating pretax profit?"

I think when we think about the near-term future and how do we get back to higher utilizations, it all kind of starts with the vaccines that Greg referenced in his opening comments, right? We got to get people back to a normal life and back out on the road using their cars, going to school, going to work going where soccer mom turn around on the weekend. That's the kind of the first step in that leads to a demand signal for gasoline and distillate to a lesser extent, and starts pulling utilization is up. I think you'll see we'll be following the market to add capacity back. 
And if you kind of think about the timing, we believe the government will get more efficient getting people vaccinated as the months go by here. But certainly by by summer, we would expect that a good portion of the American public is able to get out and burn the fuels that we make And that should lead to a more normal-type summer level. We don't have a rule of thumb of what we've got to get back to. But obviously, running more is better and starting out our costs over more barrels. Some of our plants get more efficient at higher run rates. The market gets more efficient at higher run rates and we kind of return. 
We always think about -- you got to have that clean product crack signal to get utilization up. That leads to covering your cost. And then really, we need more normalized crude differentials in the market. And those will all play out together because As utilization arises across the industry, there's going to have to be a pull primarily on Saudi heavy barrels, that should help move the crude spreads back out, and that's really how we capture more and more of our crack an and kind of get back on the path to high utilization rates and a lot more profitability."

I think that demand is still really strong in that segment, and we see that across all regions where there's China, Europe or North America. CPChem has run really well, had record sales volumes. 
The other thing we've seen is we've seen delays in the start-up of new facilities. Part of that's an economic-related part that's just been COVID-related as people have either slowed construction or cost, construction through the density of workers on these big sites. 
So the pine to balances actually look better to us at this point in 2021 than they did at the equivalent point last year. And so I think we're pretty optimistic around operating rates. Margins are -- and the delta of the marker margins, it's not unusual to see CPChem kind of deviate off of IHS marker margins. We've seen that many times in the past. And certainly, it's timing. It's portfolio. It's geography, as you think about that. If you think about the fourth quarter, probably high see polyethylene contract prices were essentially flat. October, November, they go up in December. And then if you think about your contract portfolios, there can be lags of 30 to 60 days of really fully realizing those price increases through the portfolio. So the part of that is just geography. Probably 1/3 of CPChem sales are export-oriented sales. And so if you think about the U.S. market price, usually, your price is higher and it's usually higher by about the price delta. The Asian price has probably been $0.20 under the North American price. And so you have that geographic mix that also comes into play. when you're looking at that. 
But having said all that, we think that margins are certainly above mid-cycle today, and we have, I think, good line of sight to what we think are above mid-cycle margins for 2021. So we feel confident. I think Tim, you want to talk about propylene use and some of the things going on there, too."

I think really to summarize and Greg, to your comments, what's probably important is you had COVID come along and it really had an impact on a lot of different industries with regard to demand. 
But with regard to Chemicals, what we did see is Demand didn't wane much, especially in the consumables side. So consumables remain very strong, which benefited CPChem, which really has a larger exposure to that, durables really fell off. 
So what you're seeing now, I think, Phil, is as durables are coming back, some of the other competitors out there have more exposure to durables. So you're just seeing that rebalancing that's going on. But it's a good thing overall because if people are out still buying consumables, which is good, and now they're back out buying durables, which is good. So again, building to an economy hopefully that's starting to pivot back towards where it should be."

And we expect about 2/3 of that to come in, in the first half of the year, probably second quarter, and then the remainder towards the end of the year. So that's a significant component of cash generation. And so when you step back and think about it in 2020,  as bad as things were in 2020, we're projecting better conditions in 2021 when you think about the full year '21 for the full year So we had $2.4 billion of preworking capital cash generation in 2020. So we'd expect a stronger number than that, plus the positive impact from working capital. 
And so to us, there's a pretty clear line of sight to not only covering the capital program, which is $1.7 billion, so we've taken a lot out of the capital program relative to previous years. to $1.7 billion of capital, the dividend is $1.6 billion, and then we'd expect to be able to make some progress on paying down some of the debt. And as we've talked before, we have a lot of flexibility around that in terms of debt that's either coming due or debt that is callable without any penalty to do that. 
So I think we pretty confident that we'll be able to make some good progress, not getting all the way to where we want to get to over the next probably couple of years, we'd like to be able to get the debt that we've added over the course  paid down and have the balance sheet back to where we want it to be.

Clearly, we're down -- well, we're up quarter-over-quarter, but our expectation is higher. And with transportation in some of our pipelines being down over what we've projected or have performed that before, truly related to refinery utilization is one key part of that. So that's driving the piece of that. 
In the meantime as well, we've also seen some of the producers out there, which has had an impact clearly on people putting volumes through the pipes. So that's shown up. It's shown up a little more on the crude side. 
The one bright spot we've seen actually has been in the NGL space. And we're anticipating that to continue on here into 2021. But really those -- it's been a little bit. We've brought this new capacity on. In fact, I would say that in the fourth quarter ago, 3Q, 4Q, we had a plus $30 million improvement in our Sweeny Hub And that was really related to bringing on the 2 fracs, 2 and 3, and then subsequently having a record performance with regard to shipments at the LPG export facility, which also contributed to that $30 million increase quarter-over-quarter. Had a little bit with regard to some trading activity with our propane and butane, which we trade around our business to make sure we optimize our system. It's really to make sure we get the right molecule at the right place. 
And so we had a little bit of mark-to-market impact there and also on some inventory, which impacted us. But also, we saw a little bit of an -- when ethane was getting back into the NGL barrel in 3Q, and it's really gone -- now it's going back into [indiscernible] -- where does it impact us? a little bit of our equity ownership in Sand Hills.

The one thing I would add on to is we were talking about energy transition earlier and then for the batteries. And so Humber coke right is going to be a player in that, and if you look at the even the laws in the U.K. after Brexit in their ambitions to have EVs, they want local content produced batteries. So I think that opens up an opportunity for Humber, and we really like where we're sitting today with that. Humber also has the advantage of being dosed U.K. is sitting in a cluster that the government there is very interested in developing the green hydrogen and the blue hydrogen schemes and things like that, that Greg talked about. 
So we see a lot of opportunity in kind of the medium term, I think, for Humber and just beyond being a strong fuels provider in the U.K."

The other big one in there is what we spend to get our products from the refinery gate to market. So there's distribution costs that come back in there And some of those are per barrel, but some of those kind of fall into the fixed category. So we've got tanks rented downstreams or we've got take-or-pays on pipelines that we we need to pay on minimum volumes. That all kind of comes back that those costs then elevate when you've got less volume or pushing through there. So by definition, those costs will come back down in and get smaller as we ramp volumes up here through the first part of 2021.

So back in September -- second half of September, we came down because we had a hurricane point straight out hurricane moved it to last minute, but while we were down since we were only a couple of weeks away from shutting down for some reform or catalyst change work, we decided to stay down. We executed that work. 
And then usually, the market conditions in the fourth quarter in the U.S. Gulf Coast are pretty tough. So we took advantage of that and kept the refinery down and pulled some difficult-to-do turnaround work that we would have done late this year or early next year. We pulled it forward and got it out of the way. So that was a conscious decision to keep all that down. That's -- Alliance, before it came down, was in 180,000 barrel a day range from an operating standpoint. And then Lake Charles with the 2 hurricanes that came running through there, we were just about back up and running after the first one, and then we came back down to the second one. weighted on electricity again for a few days and then came back up. And we've had a couple of operating issues coming back out of that, that we're dealing with. But the most part, like Charles is up and running and processing crude. We restarted Alliance in early January, and they're up and running at kind of for the market rate that we want them to be at. So other than kind of normal turnaround work and stuff that we've got going on. We don't anticipate any other issues in this quarter or next in the Gulf Coast."

We're optimistic about the positive impact the vaccines will have on economic recovery in the months ahead.  
In the fourth quarter, we had an adjusted loss of $507 million or $1.16 per share. Market conditions remained challenged. Our Refining business continue to be affected by demand destruction associated with the pandemic. For the year, we had an adjusted loss of $382 million or $0.89 per share. We operated well, including major growth projects in our midstream segment, including the Gray Oak Pipeline, our largest pipeline project to date, and the Sweeny Hub Phase 2 expansion.  
We took early decisive steps to reduce cost and capital spending, secure additional liquidity and suspend our share repurchases. We exceeded $500 million in cost reductions to cut capital spending by more than $700 million. These actions, combined with cash flow generation from our diversified portfolio, provided us with financial flexibility to maintain our strong investment-grade credit ratings, sustain the dividend and to navigate the crisis. Our focus continues to be on the well-being of our company, our employees and our communities.  
In 2020, we contributed $32 million to charitable organizations, including $6 million for COVID-19 and disaster relief. Even with the distractions and the challenges of the pandemic, our people remain focused on safe, reliable operations and execution of our strategy. 2020 was the safest year in the history of our company. Our total recordable injury rate of 0.11 was 30% better than our industry leading rate in 2019. Our process safety improved by 60%, and our environmental performance was our best ever.  
In 2020, we generated $2.1 billion of operating cash flow and returned $2 billion to shareholders. Since we formed the company, we've returned approximately $28 billion to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases and exchanges. We remain committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. Entering 2021, there's still uncertainty in the market. We'll continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation.
In December, we announced our 2021 capital budget of $1.7 billion, and that includes Phillips 66 Partners. This is a reduction compared to recent years the -- re-up capital for debt repayment. In 2020, we added approximately $4 million of debt. We plan to reduce debt to pre-COVID levels as cash generation improves.
Our 2021 capital budget includes $1.1 billion of sustaining capital for reliability, safety and environmental projects. In addition, $600 million of growth capital is directed towards in-flight projects and investments in renewable fuels.  
During the quarter, we advanced our growth program. At the Sweeny Hub, Frac 2 commenced operations in September, and Frac 3 started operations in October. We plan to resume construction of our fourth fractionator in the second half of 2021. Upon completion, the Sweeny Hub will have 550,000 barrels a day of fractionation capacity supported by long-term customer commitments.
At the South Texas Gateway Terminal, the second dock commenced crude oil export operations in the fourth quarter. On expected completion in the first quarter of 2021, the terminal will have 8.6 million barrels of storage capacity and up to 800,000 barrels per day of dock throughput capacity. Phillips 66 Partners owns a 25% interest in the terminal.
Phillips 66 Partners continued the construction of the C2G Pipeline, connecting its Clemens Storage Caverns to petrochemical facilities in the Corpus Christi area. The project is backed by long-term commitments and expected to be completed in mid-2021.  
At the Beaumont Terminal, we completed the fourth dock, bringing total dock capacity to 800,000 barrels per day. The terminal has a total crude and product storage capacity of 16.8 million barrels. Since acquiring the terminal in 2014, we've doubled the dock capacity and more than doubled its storage capacity.
In Chemicals, CPChem is advancing optimization and debottleneck opportunities. This includes recently approved product -- projects at the Cedar Bayou facility that will increase production of ethylene and polyethylene. In addition, CPChem is developing an expansion of its normal alpha olefins production.
During the quarter, CPChem announced its first production of polyethylene from recycled plastics at its Cedar Bayou facility and received ISCC PLUS Certification. CPChem remains committed to finding sustainable solutions, including the elimination of plastic waste in the environment.
We're advancing our Rodeo Renewed project at the San Francisco refinery. We expect to complete the diesel hydrotreater conversion in mid-2021, which will produce 8,000 barrels per day. Full conversion of the facility in early 2024 could produce over 50,000 barrels a day of renewable fuels.  
This capital-efficient investment is expected to deliver strong returns and will reduce the plant's greenhouse gas emissions by 50%. This project helps California to meet its low carbon objectives.  
In Marketing, we recently acquired 106 retail sites in the Central region through a joint venture. This aligns with our strategy of securing long-term placement of the Phillips 66 refinery production and extending participation in the value chain of retail.
We've also advanced our digital transformation efforts, fostered innovation across our company and implemented new technologies, including digital systems for work processes, artificial intelligence to predict maintenance requirements and optimize processing unit performance. Our company is making investments to competitively position us for a low-carbon future.
Earlier this month, we announced our emerging energy organization. This group is charged with establishing a lower carbon business platform. We will pursue opportunities within our portfolio such as renewable fuels and work with our company's Energy Research & Innovation Group to commercialize emerging energy technologies. 
For example, in collaboration with Georgia Tech, Phillips 66 received a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy that will support development of electrolysis technology that has the potential to convert CO2 into clean fuels. Our company is committed to addressing the global climate challenge, at the same time deliver shareholder returns.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results."

Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our fourth quarter results. We reported a loss of $539 million. Excluding special items, we had an adjusted loss of $507 million or $1.16 per share. We generated operat",1321,"Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our fourth quarter results. 
We reported a loss of $539 million. Excluding special items, we had an adjusted loss of $507 million or $1.16 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $639 million, including distributions from equity affiliates of $400 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $506 million, including $239 million for growth projects. We paid $393 million in dividends during the fourth quarter.  
Moving to Slide 5. This slide shows the $506 million reduction in adjusted results from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Chemicals adjusted pretax income increased quarter-over-quarter, while the other segments declined. The income tax variance relates to favorable tax impacts we had in the third quarter related to our ability under the CARES Act to carry back net operating losses to previous periods.
Slide 6 shows our midstream results. Fourth quarter adjusted pretax income was $323 million, a decrease of $31 million from the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $196 million, down $6 million from the previous quarter. The decrease was due to lower pipeline and terminal volumes driven by lower refinery utilization. This was partially offset by higher equity earnings on the Bakken pipeline.  
NGL and other adjusted pretax income was $86 million. The $16 million decrease from the prior quarter was due to lower equity earnings as well as reduced propane and butane trading results. This was partially offset by higher fractionation volumes, reflecting the ramp-up of Sweeny Fracs 2 and 3, which demonstrated operations above design capacity. The Sweeny fractionation complex averaged 376,000 barrels per day during the fourth quarter.  
Also at the Sweeny Hub, the Freeport LPG export facility loaded a record 39 cargoes in the fourth quarter. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $41 million was down $9 million from the previous quarter, reflecting lower Sand Hills Pipeline equity earnings and timing of maintenance costs.  
Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. Fourth quarter adjusted pretax income was $203 million, up $71 million from the third quarter. Olefins and polyolefins adjusted pretax income was $216 million. The $68 million increase from the previous quarter is due to higher polyethylene margins, partially offset by higher turnaround and maintenance costs.
Global O&P utilization was 101%, supported by global consumer demand, including food packaging and medical supplies. CPChem polyethylene sales volumes set a new record in 2020. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S increased $8 million, primarily due to higher earnings from international equity affiliates driven by improved margins. During the fourth quarter, we received $215 million in cash distributions from CPChem.  
Turning to refining on Slide 8. Refining fourth quarter adjusted pretax loss was $1.1 billion compared to an adjusted pretax loss of $970 million last quarter. Both periods reflect the continued impact of challenging market conditions. The decreased results in the fourth quarter were largely driven by higher turnaround and maintenance activity. 
Pretax turnaround costs were $76 million, up from $41 million in the prior quarter. Maintenance costs increased primarily at the Alliance Refinery. We shut down Alliance in mid-September in preparation for Hurricane Sally, and it remained down for planned turnaround and maintenance activities during the fourth quarter. The refinery safely resumed operations earlier this month. Crude utilization was 69% compared with 77% last quarter. The fourth quarter clean product yield was 86%.  
Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the fourth quarter was $7.84 per barrel compared to $8.17 per barrel in the third quarter. Realized margin was $2.18 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 28%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 22%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. We make less gasoline and more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. 
During the quarter, the distillate crack improved $2.48 per barrel, while the gasoline crack decreased $1.74 per barrel, resulting in a modest improvement of our capture from the prior quarter. Losses from secondary products of $1.20 per barrel or $0.60 per barrel improved from the previous quarter due to improved NGL prices relative to crude. Losses from feedstock were $0.46 per barrel compared to $0.35 per barrel last quarter. The Other category reduced realized margins by $3.08 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, clean product realizations and inventory impacts.  
Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted fourth quarter pretax income was $221 million compared with $417 million in the prior quarter. Marketing and Other decreased $185 million due to lower realized margins, reflecting rising prices during the quarter. We were also impacted by lower volumes related to COVID-19. And while marketing and other results were lower in the fourth quarter, full year 2020 adjusted pretax income of $1.24 billion was the highest since spin-off in 2012.  
Specialties decreased $11 million, largely due to lower finished lubricant margins. Refined product exports in the fourth quarter were 103,000 barrels per day.
On Slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pretax costs of $235 million, an increase of $22 million from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to lower capitalized interest and higher employee-related expenses.  
Slide 12 shows the change in cash for the quarter. We started the quarter with a $1.5 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $639 million. This included a working capital benefit of $403 million, primarily due to the year-end drawdown of inventory.  
Net debt issuances were $1.4 billion. This included $1.75 billion in senior notes and repayment of $500 million on the term loan. Phillips 66 Partners drew $125 million on its revolver. Capital spending was $506 million. We paid $393 million in dividends. Our ending cash balance was $2.5 billion. 
At December 31, we had $7.8 billion of committed liquidity, reflecting $2.5 billion of consolidated cash plus available capacity on our credit facilities of $5 billion at Phillips 66 and $300 million at Phillips 66 Partners.  
On Slide 13, we summarize our financial results for the year. In 2020, we had an adjusted loss of $382 million or $0.89 per share. We generated $2.1 billion of operating cash flow. Distributions from equity affiliates totaled $1.7 billion, including $632 million from CPChem. At the end of the fourth quarter, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 38%.  
Slide 14 shows full year cash flow. We began 2020 with a cash balance of $1.6 billion. Cash from operations was $2.4 billion, excluding working capital. It was a working capital use of approximately $300 million. We received a net $4.1 billion from our financing activities. 
We added $3.75 billion of debt at Phillips 66 and approximately $400 million at Phillips 66 Partners. As cash generation recovers, we will prioritize debt repayment. We remain committed to a conservative balance sheet and strong investment-grade credit ratings.  
Capital spending was $2.9 billion. We returned $2 billion to shareholders through $1.6 billion of dividends and $443 million of share repurchases. We suspended our share repurchase program in March. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items.  
In Chemicals, we expect the first quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, crude utilization will be adjusted according to market conditions. In January, utilization has been in the low 70% range. We expect first quarter pretax turnaround expenses to be between $200 million and $230 million. We anticipate first quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $240 million and $250 million pretax. 
For 2021, we plan full year turnaround expenses to be between $550 million and $600 million pretax. We expect corporate and other costs to be between $950 million and $1 billion pretax for the year. We anticipate full year D&A of about $1.5 billion. And finally, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the low 20% range.
With that, we will now open the line for questions."

So first, kudos to the team on strong performance.  
Simultaneously, while the benefits of diversification and taking care of business, like you did last year, were clear. The pace of change in the industry seems to be quickening not only as it relates to energy policy and likely future energy mix, but also that which investors expect from their investments in the sector. So I've got a couple of questions.  
One, how do you think -- how do you guys think about how to navigate this evolving and changing environment? Two, are tactical and strategic dexterity likely to be needed maybe more than in the past? Or do you think it's about the same? And then three, are there obvious implications for financial strategy for Phillips 66 along the way? So 3 questions."

That's ret",761,"Okay. You gave me a lot to unpack there, Doug. Thanks. So maybe starting with -- just let's start at the top with kind of the overview. 
I think that for us, capital discipline -- capital allocation remains core to our strategy and what we do. That's returning capital to shareholders. It's earning returns above our weighted average cost of capital on what we choose to invest in as a company. So those are our guiding lights or our guiding stars as we think about this and we think about energy transition.  
I tend to think about it in 3 buckets: near term, midterm and longer term, Doug, in terms of our response and how we're going to navigate through it. Clearly, in the near term, we're building a renewable fuels pathway. What we're doing -- so this year, midyear, we'll start up the first part of Rodeo, 8,000 barrels a day. And by 2024, we'll have a full facility conversion, more than 50,000 barrels a day there. We're working with price renewables for 11,000 barrels a day of renewable coming out of that facility. We're kind of co-processing about 3,000 barrels a day at Humber today in the U.K. moving to 5,000 barrels a day.  
And so as we think about -- as we approach to the middle point of the decade, we should have $1 billion-ish of EBITDA at our renewable fuels business. So that's certainly one pathway we think about.  
The second bucket is kind of more the medium term. And as you know, we're a supplier of specialty graphites and to go into the anode production and lithium-ion batteries, and we continue to work to improve that, to help improve battery performance, but also lower cost. And so I think as we see EVs grow and they're willing to grow, EV sales globally are going to grow. Now that portion of the business is also going to grow. And I think we can make nice contributions there in terms of what we bring to batteries and battery technologies.  
And then maybe the third one is around hydrogen, and that's longer term. Certainly, today, we're building hydrogen fueling stations in Europe. So that's a first step. We're working in the United Kingdom with the Gigastack consortium, which is taking offshore wind, electrolysis to make green hydrogen. We're using that in our Humber Refinery to reduce the carbon content of our fuels produced at Humber.  
And so as I think about hydrogen, our industry as big consumers and producers of hydrogen, we really understand it. I think that hydrogen moving into transportation fuels in a big way is probably decades out. But we'll continue to build a pathway around hydrogen for the longer term. 
You may have seen that we got a grant from the DOE, and we talked about it in the opening comments today. But that's really around our solid oxide fuel cell technology and taking CO2 and running through the fuel cell then to produce clean fuels. And so there's probably a pathway there for us, too. 
So our idea is we want to participate in energy transition. We want to do it where we can invest and earn returns that are above our weighted average cost of capital. We certainly want to exploit the technology base we have used existing equipment where we can and convert it if we need to, like what we're doing at Rodeo. We try to find capital-efficient solutions where we can earn great returns.  
I think the other thing I want to point out here, Doug, is you think about the challenges that we have before us of providing reliable, affordable funded energy, at the same time, addressing the climate is something that's going to take a whole approach of the industry. But I think about the 10 million people that work in the industry today. They're problem solvers. They're engineers. They're scientists. They're marketing people. They're people that understand the complexity of the energy business today. And I think they're some of the best people on the planet that are positioned to help solve this dual challenge that we have. 
And so I'm an optimist, always. And I think that this industry and our company certainly will have big roles to play in the energy transition as we move forward. And I know you asked 3 questions, and I don't know if I answered 3, but I did the best I could with that. 
But maybe you want to ask -- go ahead, if you want to follow up."

In terms of how we've reoriented kind of the capital plan here in response to COVID, but also, I think as the industry itself has kind of paused in terms of the upstream and the midstream opportunities available to us. 
Certainly, we're probably going to run $200 million to $300 million under the growth plans we announced at that day and simply because we're not going to do Rodeo pipeline. We're not going to do the ACE Pipeline and some of the other things that we had laid into the plan that we've just stopped working on. But we may well find other opportunities. So you have Rodeo Renew that's going to come in. It's going to be a big, big EBITDA generator that wasn't in those numbers.  
AdvantEdge66, we continue to prosecute that. If you remember, somewhere $600 million or so of that was around our value chain strategy optimization work we're going to do. And all that's mid-cycle predicated. So while we've done a lot of work around there, we haven't been in mid-cycle conditions. And so in 2020, we're not achieving the results we thought we achieved there. But I think as we move into 2021 and into 2022, we're pretty optimistic that we get back to a recovery to mid-cycle conditions around that part of the portfolio.  
So Jeff, I don't know if you want to tag on there or add anything to that, but I think that would be my views."

I think when we think about the near-term future and how do we get back to higher utilizations, it all kind of starts with the vaccines that Greg referenced in his opening comments, right? We got to get people back to a normal life and back out on the road using their cars, going to school, going to work, going where soccer mom turn around on the weekend. 
That's the kind of the first step then that leads to a demand signal for gasoline and distillate to a lesser extent and starts pulling utilizations up. I think you'll see we'll be following the market to add capacity back.  
And if you kind of think about the timing, we believe the government will get more efficient at getting people vaccinated as the months go by here. But certainly by summer, we would expect that a good portion of the American public is able to get out and burn the fuels that we make. And that should lead to a more normal-type summer level. 
We don't have a rule of thumb of what we've got to get back to. But obviously, running more is better and starting out our costs over more barrels. Some of our plants get more efficient at higher run rates. The market gets more efficient at higher run rates and we kind of return.  
We always think about -- you got to have that clean product crack signal to get utilization up. That leads to covering your cost. And then really, we need more normalized crude differentials in the market. And those will all play out together because as utilization arises across the industry, there's going to have to be a pull primarily on Saudi heavy barrels, that should help move the crude spreads back out, and that's really how we capture more and more of our crack and kind of get back on the path to high utilization rates and a lot more profitability."

I think that demand is still really strong in that segment, and we see that across all regions, whether it's China, Europe or North America. CPChem has run really well, had record sales volumes. 
The other thing we've seen is we've seen delays in the start-up of new facilities. Part of that's economic-related, part of that's just been COVID-related as people have either slowed construction or cost construction through the density of workers on these big sites. 
So [ this kind ] of end balances actually look better to us at this point in 2021 than they did at the equivalent point last year. And so I think we're pretty optimistic around operating rates. Margins are -- and the delta of the marker margins, it's not unusual to see CPChem kind of deviate off of IHS marker margins. We've seen that many times in the past. 
And certainly, it's timing. It's portfolio. It's geography, as you think about that. If you think about the fourth quarter, high density polyethylene contract prices were essentially flat. October, November, they go up in December. And then if you think about your contract portfolios, there can be lags of 30 to 60 days of really fully realizing those price increases through the portfolio. 
So the part of that is just geography. Probably 1/3 of CPChem sales are export-oriented sales. And so if you think about the U.S. market price, usually, the Europe price is higher and it's usually higher by about the price delta. The Asian price has probably been $0.20 under the North American price. And so you have that geographic mix that also comes into play when you're looking at that. 
But having said all that, we think that margins are certainly above mid-cycle today, and we have, I think, good line of sight to what we think are above mid-cycle margins for 2021. So we feel confident. 
I think, Tim, you want to talk about propylene and some of the things going on there too?"

But with regard to chemicals, what we did see is Demand didn't wane much, especially in the consumables side. So consumables remained very strong, which benefited CPChem, which really has a larger exposure to that. Durables really fell off. 
So what you're seeing now, I think, Phil, is as durables are coming back, some of the other competitors out there have more exposure to durables. So you're just seeing that rebalancing that's going on. But it's a good thing overall because if people are out still buying consumables, which is good, and now they're back out buying durables, which is good. 
So again, building to an economy hopefully that's starting to pivot back towards where it should be."

So one element of our cash generations in 2021 will certainly be a -- it will show up as positive working capital, and it will because we'll be collecting on the tax receivables. 
So we have a tax receivable at year-end of $1.5 billion. And we expect about 2/3 of that to come in, in the first half of the year, probably second quarter, and then the remainder towards the end of the year. So that's a significant component of cash generation. 
And so when you step back and think about, in 2020, as bad as things were in 2020, we're projecting better conditions in 2021 when you think about the full year '21 compared to full year '20. So we had $2.4 billion of preworking capital cash generation in 2020. So we'd expect a stronger number than that, plus the positive impact from working capital.
And so to us, there's pretty clear line of sight to not only covering the capital program, which is $1.7 billion, so we've taken a lot out of the capital program relative to previous years, to $1.7 billion of capital, the dividend is $1.6 billion, and then we'd expect to be able to make some progress on paying down some of the debt. And as we've talked before, we have a lot of flexibility around that in terms of debt that's either coming due or debt that is callable without any penalty to do that.
So I think we feel pretty confident that we'll be able to make some good progress, not getting all the way to where we want to get to over the next, probably, couple of years, we'd like to be able to get the debt that we've added over the course of 2020 paid down and have the balance sheet back to where we want it to be. 
And that's important to us. It's important that we maintain those strong investment-grade credit ratings, A3 BBB+. We feel good about those. We want to be able to maintain that sort of financial flexibility and strength."

Clearly, we're down -- well, we're up quarter-over-quarter, but our expectation's higher. And with transportation in some of our pipelines being down over what we've projected or have performed that before, truly related to refinery utilization is one key part of that. So that's driving the piece of that.
In the meantime as well, we've also seen some of the producers out there, which has had an impact clearly on people putting volumes through the pipes. So that's shown up. It's shown up a little more on the crude side. 
The one bright spot we've seen actually has been in the NGL space. And we're anticipating that to continue on here into 2021. But really those -- it's been a little bit -- we've brought this new capacity on. In fact, I would say that in the fourth quarter ago, 3Q to 4Q, we had a plus $30 million improvement in our Sweeny Hub, and that was really related to bringing on the 2 Fracs, 2 and 3, and then subsequently having a record performance with regard to shipments at the LPG export facility, which also contributed to that $30 million increase quarter-over-quarter. 
Had a little bit with regard to some trading activity with our propane and butane, which we trade around our business to make sure we optimize our system. It's really to make sure we get the right molecule at the right place. 
And so we had a little bit of mark-to-market impact there and also on some inventory, which impacted us. But also, we saw a little bit of an impact as well in the fourth quarter if you go from 3Q to 4Q on ethane rejection. Ethane was getting back into the NGL barrel in 3Q, and it's really gone -- now it's going back into rejection and so that's impacted some NGL volumes. 
And where does it impact us? A little bit of our equity ownership in Sand Hills. And then the other part is we've got 2 JV fracs as well that had lower volumes and lower margins. Most of it was driven by just cracking a heavier barrel and there were fewer barrels coming down the pipe."

And as you know in the past, we've talked about a 30% debt-to-capital target, that's really more of a sort of guideline. It's an easy number to calculate, and it's a useful indicator.
But ultimately, we're really focused on the credit ratings, maintaining the strong investment-grade credit ratings. And I feel that we added $4 billion over the course of last year.

The other big one in there is what we spend to get our products from the refinery gate to market. So there's distribution costs that come back in there. And some of those are per barrel, but some of those kind of fall into the fixed category. 
So we've got tankers rented downstreams or we've got take-or-pays on pipelines that we need to pay on minimum volumes.

So just wondering what the next steps are in that litigation process? Can Biden step in and shut down the pipeline without kind of going through the adjudication process? And any other thoughts on that?"

So if you kind of look at the 3 refineries that we've got in there, we've got Sweeny, which really operated per the market conditions the entire quarter. Alliance, we chose to have down for the entire quarter. 
So back in September -- second half of September, we came down because we had a hurricane pointed straight at us. Hurricane moved at the last minute, but while we were down since we were only a couple of weeks away from shutting down for some reform or catalyst change work, we decided to stay down. We executed that work. 
And then usually, the market conditions in the fourth quarter in the U.S. Gulf Coast are pretty tough. So we took advantage of that and kept the refinery down and pulled some difficult-to-do turnaround work that we would have done late this year or early next year. We pulled it forward and got it out of the way. 
So that was a conscious decision to keep all that down. That's -- Alliance, before it came down, was in 180,000 barrel a day range from an operating standpoint. And then Lake Charles with the 2 hurricanes that came running through there, we were just about back up and running after the first one, and then we came back down for the second one. Waited on electricity again for a few days and then came back up. 
And we've had a couple of operating issues coming back out of that, that we're dealing with. But the most part, Lake Charles is up and running and processing crude. We restarted Alliance in early January, and they're up and running at kind of for the market rate that we want them to be at. 
So other than kind of normal turnaround work and stuff that we've got going on. We don't anticipate any other issues in this quarter or next in the Gulf Coast."

In the first quarter, we had an adjusted loss of $509 million or $1.16 per share. Our results reflect the impact of the severe winter storms in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Central regions where we experienced reduced volumes, increased utility costs and maintenance and repair costs. We safely resumed operations across our businesses following the storm-related downtime. We're proud of our employees and their commitment to operating excellence, particularly during these challenging times. 
Gasoline diesel demand continues to recover and product inventories have normalized, supporting higher refining margins and utilization rates. We expect continued recovery as we wrap up spring turnarounds and head into the summer driving season. Also, chemicals facilities are back to normal operations with continued strong demand and margins. We remain optimistic about the impact COVID-19 vaccines and monetary stimulus will have on economic recovery in the back half of the year. 
Leading indicators suggests economic growth is accelerating. which supports demand for our products. In the first quarter, we returned $394 million to shareholders and dividends. We remain committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. In February, we repaid $500 million of maturing debt. We will continue with a disciplined approach to capital allocation, including debt repayment as cash generation improves. 
We'll maintain a conservative balance sheet and a strong investment-grade credit rating. The South Texas Gateway terminal commissioned additional storage, bringing the total capacity to 8.6 million barrels. This completes the final construction phase for this project. In addition, the terminal has up to 800,000 barrels per day of export capacity. Gold 66 Partners owns a 25% interest in the terminal. 
Phillips 66 Partners continue construction of the C2G pipeline, connecting its Clemens storage coppers to petrochemical facilities in the Corpus Christi area. The project is backed by long-term commitments and is expected to be completed in mid-2021. At the Sweeny Hub, we plan to resume construction of Frac 4 in the second half of 2021, which will add 150,000 barrels per day. 
On completion, the Sweeny Hub will have 550,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity supported by long-term customer commitments. In Chemicals, CPChem is advancing optimization and debottlenecking opportunities. This includes approved projects at its Cedar Bayou facility that will increase production of ethylene and polyethylene. In addition, CPChem is developing an expansion of its normal  alpha olefins capacity. 
We're advancing our Rodeo Renewed project at the San Francisco refinery. Earlier this month, we began renewable diesel production from the hydrotreater conversion, which will ramp up to 8,000 barrels per day in the third quarter. Subject to promoting and approvals, full conversion of the facilities expected in early 2024. On completion, the facility will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel production capacity. 
This capital-efficient investment is expected to deliver strong returns and reduce the facility's greenhouse gas emissions by 50%. This project will help California meet its low carbon objectives, increasing our focus on lower carbon initiatives across the company. This includes the creation of Emerging Energy Group earlier this year and ongoing research and development by our energy research and innovation organization. 
We've invested in Shell Rock soy processing, a joint venture that plans to construct a new soybean facility in Iowa. We expect the project to be completed in late 2022, and we will purchase 100% of the soybean oil production. We signed an MoU with Southwest Airlines to commercialize sustainable aviation fuel. We launched a technical collaboration with Radian, a leader in sodium ion battery technology to build lower cost, higher-performing animal materials for sodium ion batteries. 
These activities further our commitment to addressing the global climate challenge while delivering attractive shareholder returns. Finally, we'd like to comment on our company's operating excellence. We are honored that our refining, midstream and chemicals businesses were recently recognized for 2020 safety performance. Six of our refineries were recognized by AFPM, including Lake Charles, Ponca City and Santa Maria refineries, which received distinguished safety awards. 
This is the highest annual safety award in our industry and the 5th year in a row that our refineries have received this honor. Our midstream businesses was awarded API Distinguished Pipeline Safety Award for large operators. This is the highest recognition by API from the midstream industry. In addition, we're recognized by the Gas Processors Association for outstanding safety performance in midstream. 
In chemicals, AFPM selected CPChem's Conroe, Orange and Port Author facilities as recipients of the Elite Silver Safety Award. So congratulations to all these facilities well done, we're really proud of you. So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results."

Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our first quarter results. We reported a loss of $654 million. Special items this quarter included an impairment resulting from Phillips 66 Partners decision to exit the Liberty Pipeline project as well as winter storm-related maintenance and repair costs. Excluding these special items, we had an adjusted loss of $509 million or $1.16 per share. 
We generated operating cash flow of $271 million including distributions from equity affiliates of $502 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $331 million, including $174 million for growth projects. We paid $394 million in dividends. 
Moving to Slide 5. This slide shows the change in adjusted results from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, a decrease of $2 million. Improved results in Refining and Marketing and Specialties were offset by lower pretax income in the other segments. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 16%. The rate is influenced by the proportional mix of pretax income from domestic, foreign and MLP sources. 
Slide 6 shows our midstream results. First quarter adjusted pretax income was $276 million, a decrease of $47 million from the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $206 million up $10 million from the previous quarter. The increase was due to lower operating costs and higher equity earnings, partially offset by lower volumes. NGL and Other adjusted pretax income was $36 million. The $50 million decrease from the prior quarter was mainly due to higher operating costs associated with the winter storms. 
The Sweeny fractionation complex averaged 330,000 barrels per day and the Freeport LPG export facility loaded a record 41 cargoes in the first quarter. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $34 million was down $7 million from the previous quarter, mainly due to the winter storms. 
Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. First quarter adjusted pretax income was $184 million, down $19 million from the fourth quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pretax income was $174 million. The $42 million decrease from the previous quarter was primarily due to winter storm impacts which resulted in lower production and higher utility costs. This was partially offset by higher margins, primarily due to tight supplies, low inventory levels and continued strong demand. 
Global O&P utilization was 79% for the quarter. All impacted CPChem facilities safely restarted operations by early April. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S increased $14 million, primarily due to improved margins. During the first quarter, we received $205 million in cash distributions from CPChem. 
Turning to Refining on Slide 8. Refining first quarter adjusted pretax loss was $1 billion, an improvement of $68 million from the fourth quarter. First quarter results reflect the impacts of the winter storms. The improvement was driven by higher realized margins, largely offset by increased turnaround costs as well as higher utilities resulting from the winter storms. 
The increase in realized margins reflects improved crack spreads and the sale of excess electricity to help meet demand in the Texas market, partially offset by lower product differentials and higher RIN costs. Pretax turnaround costs were $192 million, up from $76 million in the prior quarter. We completed the majority of our spring turnaround activity this month. Crude utilization was 74% compared with 69% last quarter. The first quarter clean product yield was 82%. 
Slide 9 covers market capture. The 31 market crack for the first quarter was $1.23 per barrel compared to $7.84 per barrel in the fourth quarter. Realized margin was $4.36 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 33%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 28%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. We make less gasoline and more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. 
During the quarter, the gasoline crack improved $6.38 per barrel, while the distillate crack increased $3.41 per barrel. In addition, we had a lower clean product yield this quarter as a result of turnaround activity and unplanned downtime, which also contributed to the configuration impact. Losses from secondary products of $1.29 per barrel were $0.09 higher than the previous quarter. 
Feedstock costs improved $0.37 per barrel compared with the prior quarter. The other category reduced realized margins by $4.78 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, clean product realizations and inventory impacts. It also reflects revenues from the sale of excess electricity into the growth. 
Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted first quarter pretax income was $290 million compared with $221 million in the prior quarter. Marketing and other increased $30 million due to higher domestic margins, partially offset by lower international margins. Specialties improved $39 million, largely due to improved base oil and finished lubricant margins. Refined product exports in the first quarter were 204,000 barrels per day. 
On Slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pretax costs of $251 million, an increase of $16 million from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to the timing of charitable contributions and environmental expenses. as well as lower capitalized interest. 
Slide 12 shows the change in cash for the quarter. We started the year with a $2.5 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $271 million. This included a working capital benefit of $98 million. In February, we repaid $500 million of floating rate senior notes upon maturity. Capital spending was $331 million, and we paid $394 million in dividends. 
The other category includes a $155 million loan to our WRP joint venture or in the cash balance was $1.4 billion. At March 31, we had $6.7 billion of committed liquidity, reflecting $1.4 billion of consolidated cash plus available capacity on our credit facilities $5 billlion at Phillips 66 and $299 million at Phillips 66 Partners. 
This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the second quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, crude utilization will be adjusted according to market conditions. In April, utilization has been in the mid-80% range. We expect second quarter pretax turnaround expenses to be between $110 million and $140 million. We anticipate second quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $240 million and $250 million pretax. Now we will open the line for questions."

Yes, if you look at even back into 2020, CPChem experienced really strong demand and outstanding operational excellence margins were suppressed a bit by crude oil pricing, frankly, but we saw the record demand, record production coming out of CPChem. And in margins were starting to improve late 2020, a lot of people have moved turnarounds out into 2021. We needed to build some inventory for those turnarounds and then Winter Storm Uri hits and really decimated the inventory in the system. 
So We do see strong fundamentals, and we do see those margins improving even though we didn't realize it in the first quarter because of the winter storm. And so we believe that CPChem will see the benefit of those margins. So on average, the rest of the year, we'll continue to see increase into the second and third quarter, then maybe some seasonal weakness in the fourth quarter. But on average, we should see CPChem at or above mid-cycle margins this year."

And we added $4 billion over the course of last year. We paid off $0.5 billion in the first quarter. Our primary focus from a leverage standpoint is around the credit rating. So we have an ABB rating, so very strong investment grade, but we do have a negative outlook on both. 
And so we want to get back to maintain those ratings and with a stable outlook. And to do that, we need to demonstrate that we're getting debt levels back somewhere towards where they were before the pandemic kicked in. As you think about recovery and cash generation and the things we've done in terms of scaling back our capital and suspension of share repurchases as you start to see cash generation improve, we should actually have quite a lot of flexibility to make progress on paying down debt. 
And once we're on a nice sort of pathway to getting back to somewhere around about that $12 billion level, I think we'll have a lot more flexibility to start considering other alternatives which could entail at some point, we want to get back to the dividend a dividend increase at some point. Again, at the right time, we'd like to be buying our shares back. 
We still think they represent really good value and then potentially growth capital. We've intentionally restrained our growth capital. Our total capital budget this year is $1.7 billion, only $600 million of growth capital. And we're anticipating that for the next couple of years, we'll continue to be pretty constrained in terms of how much we're reinvesting in the business. And part of that's a function of where the opportunities are as well and the availability of that. 
So Then the last thing I'd say is we've got good flexibility with the debt maturities we've got coming up and the sort of callable debt we have. We have easy line of sight to over the next year or 2, assuming the cash generation is there. We've got $3.75 billion of debt that we can take care of either because it's callable or it's maturing."

But really, it's partly it's driven by global demand clearly for LPGs, propanes and butanes and then also growing demand for ethane, both here in the U.S. Gulf Coast, export ethane and just fundamentals in petrochemicals, as Mark just mentioned here, it's strong, and it's growing. 
So in that capacity, NGLs and specialty advantaged NGLs will fill that board. Frac 4, we've got commitments on Frac 4. So actually, we cause while there was some uncertainty in the market last year. And we paused to kind of, okay, let's make sure we're taking care of our liquidity and balance sheet. We paused the project but we actually are looking to start it up in the second half of this year and get frac 4 completed as we continue to build out the hub down at screening. 
And again, there is continued demand. We've been running our facility. You noted that on the cargoes, that was a record level for the quarter for us. But we still see continued demand for LPGs and see that into the future as well as PEPM becomes a bigger piece of that export pie versus rescan"

Now the other The other comment that when we -- over the last year or so where we've been in a depressed margin environment, capture rates just generally are impacted by the fact that you've got costs that flow through here that are on a fixed per barrel basis. 
So there's some freight and the like that it's fixed cost per barrel. So proportionately, that becomes a bigger impact takes a bigger hit out of capture than when you're in a more normalized market environment. But RINs in that other is a big element."

So that accounts for a good part of that delta off the fourth quarter. 
And then we always get into the timing issues between the Gulf Coast and New York Harbor as we go up Colonial Pipeline. And so we saw a pretty negative hit there that really is timing as prices run up, and we'll get it back on the other side eventually.

And as you expect, the underlying cash generation to increase you're effectively delevering, right, on a sort of debt-to-EBITDA basis as you execute on those growth programs.

How that came about? And what kind of economics would this potentially entail? Would it significantly alter the CapEx or scope of the Rodeo project? 
And with the project as it stands, what percentage of that 800 million gallons do you envision would be dedicated to renewable diesel production versus sustainable aviation fuel, renewable naphtha and such?"

In terms of of jets into and out of California and domestically in California. They're the largest airline. So we have an opportunity to work with them, both on public and policymaking, kind of educate policymakers in the public an opportunity to work on R&D with Southwest Airlines. 
You may know that we have energy research and innovation group. I think we're the only one of our peers that have that where we work on lots of different things, including solid oxide fuel cells, battery technology, solar, we want to also work on sustainable aviation fuel and development of that fuel. And then think about improving the economics right now, if you look at the economics, of sustainable aviation fuel versus renewable diesel, renewable diesel makes more sense to produce. 
So we need to think about the economics that can come from thinking about how to make it. It can come from the credits, it could come from the price of the fuel. So we have to think through all of that. And then finally, we're exploring whether we want to have a supply agreement with Southwest Airlines, whether that makes sense. And at the plant, we can produce up to 10,000 barrels a day, that will take some capital We can produce some without any capital going forward. So we're taking a look about at whether we want to spend capital, how much we want to make and how it competes with renewable diesel."

For the rest of the plant, we will need any form of feedstock. So the pant is predicated on mostly low CI feedstock, we'll be buying used cooking oil, fats, but we'll also be buying some vegetable oils, some higher, some lower feedstock. 
And our LP model will kind of dictate to us which feedstock to buy. And it's not just the CI of the feedstock, it's also the transportation, the location, and the cost of the feedstock is the different feedstocks will change in price. It's a benefit of having a hydrotreater in front of the plant where you can kind of run different feedstocks. So our goal, too, is to buy, just like we do in our -- in the crude and gasoline and diesel market, our commercial group buys much more than we need. 
As an example, in the crude market, we buy twice as much crude as the refineries need And that allows us to optimize the crude. So at any given time, we could think about each refinery and what could we have available and what could optimize that refinery at that time. And we plan to do the same thing in the feedstock business. 
So we've been in the feedstock business a while now -- in Hamburg, we've been buying used cooking oil now for almost 4 years, and we've set up our commercial organization to do just that. We have business. We have an office in China, an office in Singapore, one in London and one here in Houston. We have tanks for used cooking oil. In Asia, we have tanks in Europe. And we're moving use cooking all around the world, optimizing that business, and we'll do the same with the other feedstocks as time goes on."

We're further off on diesel and gasoline in Europe where we have business in Germany, about 20% off because they're still on the lockdowns and Australia about 15% off. They're coming out of lockdowns in May 18. So we see some sunlight. And then in Switzerland, they're off about 10%, they're open now I think the U.S. is doing really, really well. If you look at COVID vaccines, 43% of the population has gotten at least one dose, more than 80% of the population over 65 has gotten one dose. 
So we can see a lot of sunlight. Our view going forward is that we expect given the strength of the economy. We've seen lots of container ships. The CDC just said that cruise ships can start up in July. We're seeing a lot of strength in the economy. We think these will be up about 2%. We think ultimately, gasoline is going to be up about that same amount as people start getting out of the house coming back to work. Jet, we think gets down about 25% here in the U.S. We think that will be about 15% as the year goes on. 
That 15% represents mostly international travel where people are still still needing the quarantine, and we think that we don't want travel as much. But if you think about the gasoline and diesel up 2%, roughly and jet down 15%, that whole net-net, that means that we'll be at 2019 levels in the back half of 2021. 
And then on top of that, if you think about the refining capacity, we've shut down over 1 million barrels of refinery capacity since 2019. So we'll be back up to demand levels of 2019 with at least 1 million barrels of refining capacity in the U.S. shut down. So we -- that makes us think -- we're very bullish in the second half of this year for that reason."

In the first quarter, we had an adjusted loss of $509 million or $1.16 per share. Our results reflect the impact of the severe winter storms in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Central regions where we experienced reduced volumes, increased utility costs and maintenance and repair costs. 
We safely resumed operations across our businesses following the storm-related downtime. We're proud of our employees and their commitment to operating excellence, particularly during these challenging times.  
Gasoline diesel demand continues to recover and product inventories have normalized, supporting higher refining margins and utilization rates. We expect continued recovery as we wrap up spring turnarounds and head into the summer driving season. Also, chemicals facilities are back to normal operations with continued strong demand and margins. 
We remain optimistic about the impact COVID-19 vaccines and monetary stimulus will have on economic recovery in the back half of the year. Leading indicators suggests economic growth is accelerating, which supports demand for our products. 
In the first quarter, we returned $394 million to shareholders in dividends. We remain committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. In February, we repaid $500 million of maturing debt. We will continue with a disciplined approach to capital allocation, including debt repayment as cash generation improves. We'll maintain a conservative balance sheet and a strong investment-grade credit rating. 
The South Texas Gateway terminal commissioned additional storage, bringing the total capacity to 8.6 million barrels. This completes the final construction phase for this project. In addition, the terminal has up to 800,000 barrels per day of export capacity. Gold 66 Partners owns a 25% interest in the terminal.  
Phillips 66 Partners continue construction of the C2G Pipeline, connecting its Clemens Storage Caverns to petrochemical facilities in the Corpus Christi area. The project is backed by long-term commitments and is expected to be completed in mid-2021. At the Sweeny Hub, we plan to resume construction of Frac 4 in the second half of 2021, which will add 150,000 barrels per day. Upon completion, the Sweeny Hub will have 550,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity supported by long-term customer commitments. 
In Chemicals, CPChem is advancing optimization and debottlenecking opportunities. This includes approved projects at its Cedar Bayou facility that will increase production of ethylene and polyethylene. In addition, CPChem is developing an expansion of its normal alpha olefins capacity.  
We're advancing our Rodeo Renewed project at the San Francisco refinery. Earlier this month, we began renewable diesel production from the hydrotreater conversion, which will ramp up to 8,000 barrels per day in the third quarter. Subject to permitting and approvals, full conversion of the facility is expected in early 2024. On completion, the facility will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel production capacity.  
This capital-efficient investment is expected to deliver strong returns and reduce the facility's greenhouse gas emissions by 50%. This project will help California meet its lower carbon objectives. 
We're increasing our focus on lower carbon initiatives across the company. This includes the creation of Emerging Energy group earlier this year and ongoing research and development by our energy research and innovation organization.  
We've invested in Shell Rock Soy Processing, a joint venture that plans to construct a new soybean facility in Iowa. We expect the project to be completed in late 2022, and we will purchase 100% of the soybean oil production. 
We signed an MoU with Southwest Airlines to commercialize sustainable aviation fuel. We launched a technical collaboration with Faradion, a leader in sodium-ion battery technology, to develop lower-cost, higher-performing anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. These activities further our commitment to addressing the global climate challenge while delivering attractive shareholder returns. 
Finally, we'd like to comment on our company's operating excellence. We are honored that our refining, midstream and chemicals businesses were recently recognized for 2020 safety performance. Six of our refineries were recognized by AFPM, including Lake Charles, Ponca City and Santa Maria refineries, which received distinguished safety awards.  
This is the highest annual safety award in our industry and the 5th year in a row that our refineries have received this honor. Our midstream businesses was awarded API Distinguished Pipeline Safety Award for large operators. This is the highest recognition by API from the midstream industry. In addition, we're recognized by the Gas Processors Association for outstanding safety performance in midstream.  
In chemicals, AFPM selected CPChem's Conroe, Orange and Port Arthur facilities as recipients of the Elite Silver Safety Award. So congratulations to all these facilities well done, we're really proud of you. 
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results."

Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our first quarter results. We reported a loss of $654 million. Special items this quarter included an impairment resulting from Phillips 66 Partners decision to exit the Liberty Pipeline project as well as winter storm-related maintenance and repair costs. Excluding these special items, we had an adjusted loss of $509 million or $1.16 per share. 
We generated operating cash flow of $271 million, including distributions from equity affiliates of $502 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $331 million, including $174 million for growth projects. We paid $394 million in dividends. 
Moving to Slide 5. This slide shows the change in adjusted results from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, a decrease of $2 million. Improved results in refining and marketing and specialties were offset by lower pretax income in the other segments. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 16%. The rate is influenced by the proportional mix of pretax income from domestic, foreign and MLP sources. 
Slide 6 shows our midstream results. First quarter adjusted pretax income was $276 million, a decrease of $47 million from the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $206 million, up $10 million from the previous quarter. The increase was due to lower operating costs and higher equity earnings, partially offset by lower volumes. NGL and other adjusted pretax income was $36 million. The $50 million decrease from the prior quarter was mainly due to higher operating costs associated with the winter storms. 
The Sweeny fractionation complex averaged 330,000 barrels per day and the Freeport LPG Export facility loaded a record 41 cargoes in the first quarter. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $34 million was down $7 million from the previous quarter, mainly due to the winter storms. 
Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. First quarter adjusted pretax income was $184 million, down $19 million from the fourth quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pretax income was $174 million. The $42 million decrease from the previous quarter was primarily due to winter storm impacts which resulted in lower production and higher utility costs. This was partially offset by higher margins, primarily due to tight supplies, low inventory levels and continued strong demand. 
Global O&P utilization was 79% for the quarter. All impacted CPChem facilities safely restarted operations by early April. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S increased $14 million, primarily due to improved margins. During the first quarter, we received $205 million in cash distributions from CPChem. 
Turning to Refining on Slide 8. Refining first quarter adjusted pretax loss was $1 billion, an improvement of $68 million from the fourth quarter. First quarter results reflect the impacts of the winter storms. The improvement was driven by higher realized margins, largely offset by increased turnaround costs as well as higher utilities resulting from the winter storms. 
The increase in realized margins reflects improved crack spreads and the sale of excess electricity to help meet demand in the Texas market, partially offset by lower product differentials and higher RIN costs. Pretax turnaround costs were $192 million, up from $76 million in the prior quarter. We completed the majority of our spring turnaround activity this month. Crude utilization was 74% compared with 69% last quarter. The first quarter clean product yield was 82%. 
Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the first quarter was $13.23 per barrel compared to $7.84 per barrel in the fourth quarter. Realized margin was $4.36 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 33%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 28%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. We make less gasoline and more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. 
During the quarter, the gasoline crack improved $6.38 per barrel, while the distillate crack increased $3.41 per barrel. In addition, we had a lower clean product yield this quarter as a result of turnaround activity and unplanned downtime, which also contributed to the configuration impact. Losses from secondary products of $1.29 per barrel were $0.09 higher than the previous quarter. 
Feedstock costs improved $0.37 per barrel compared with the prior quarter. The other category reduced realized margins by $4.78 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, clean product realizations and inventory impacts. It also reflects revenues from the sale of excess electricity into the grid. 
Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted first quarter pretax income was $290 million compared with $221 million in the prior quarter. Marketing and other increased $30 million due to higher domestic margins, partially offset by lower international margins. Specialties improved $39 million, largely due to improved base oil and finished lubricant margins. Refined product exports in the first quarter were 204,000 barrels per day. 
On Slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pretax costs of $251 million, an increase of $16 million from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to the timing of charitable contributions and environmental expenses. as well as lower capitalized interest. 
Slide 12 shows the change in cash for the quarter. We started the year with a $2.5 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $271 million. This included a working capital benefit of $98 million. In February, we repaid $500 million of floating rate senior notes upon maturity. Capital spending was $331 million, and we paid $394 million in dividends. 
The other category includes a $155 million loan to our [ WRP ] joint venture. Our ending cash balance was $1.4 billion. At March 31, we had $6.7 billion of committed liquidity, reflecting $1.4 billion of consolidated cash plus available capacity on our credit facilities $5 billion at Phillips 66 and $299 million at Phillips 66 Partners. 
This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the second quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, crude utilization will be adjusted according to market conditions. In April, utilization has been in the mid-80% range. We expect second quarter pretax turnaround expenses to be between $110 million and $140 million. We anticipate second quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $240 million and $250 million pretax. 
Now we will open the line for questions."

Yes, if you look at even back into 2020, CPChem experienced really strong demand and outstanding operational excellence margins were suppressed a bit by crude oil pricing, frankly, but we saw the record demand, record production coming out of CPChem. And margins were starting to improve late 2020. A lot of people have moved turnarounds out into 2021. We needed to build some inventory for those turnarounds and then Winter Storm Uri hits and really decimated the inventory in the system. 
So we do see strong fundamentals, and we do see those margins improving even though we didn't realize it in the first quarter because of the winter storm. And so we believe that CPChem will see the benefit of those margins. So on average, the rest of the year, we'll continue to see increase into the second and third quarter, then maybe some seasonal weakness in the fourth quarter. But on average, we should see CPChem at or above mid-cycle margins this year."

And we added $4 billion over the course of last year. We paid off $0.5 billion in the first quarter. Our primary focus from a leverage standpoint is around the credit rating. So we have an A3 and BBB+ rating, so very strong investment grade, but we do have a negative outlook on both. 
And so we want to get back to maintain those ratings and with a stable outlook. And to do that, we need to demonstrate that we're getting debt levels back somewhere towards where they were before the pandemic kicked in. As you think about recovery and cash generation and the things we've done in terms of scaling back our capital and suspension of share repurchases as you start to see cash generation improve, we should actually have quite a lot of flexibility to make progress on paying down debt. 
And once we're on a nice sort of pathway to getting back to somewhere around about that $12 billion level, I think we'll have a lot more flexibility to start considering other alternatives which could entail at some point, we want to get back to the dividend, get a dividend increase at some point. Again, at the right time, we'd like to be buying our shares back. 
We still think they represent really good value and then potentially growth capital. We've intentionally restrained our growth capital. Our total capital budget this year is $1.7 billion, only $600 million of growth capital. And we're anticipating that for the next couple of years, we'll continue to be pretty constrained in terms of how much we're reinvesting in the business. And part of that's a function of where the opportunities are as well and the availability of that. 
So then the last thing I'd say is we've got good flexibility with the debt maturities we've got coming up and the sort of callable debt we have. We have easy line of sight to over the next year or 2, assuming the cash generation is there. We've got $3.75 billion of debt that we can take care of either because it's callable or it's maturing."

Actually, the fundamentals for NGLs are still good, albeit from the quarter standpoint, we had some puts and takes in there with regard to the winter storm. But the go-forward actually has -- it feels like it's got good strength, partially driven by -- and I'll go back to frac 4 to answer that question. But really, it's partly it's driven by global demand clearly for LPGs, propanes and butanes and then also growing demand for ethane, both here in the U.S. Gulf Coast, export ethane and just fundamentals in petrochemicals, as Mark just mentioned here, it's strong, and it's growing. 
So in that capacity, NGLs and specialty advantaged NGLs will fill that void. Frac 4, we've got commitments on Frac 4. So actually, we paused while there was some uncertainty in the market last year. And we paused to kind of, okay, let's make sure we're taking care of our liquidity and balance sheet. We paused the project but we actually are looking to start it up in the second half of this year and get frac 4 completed as we continue to build out the hub down at Sweeny. 
And again, there is continued demand. We've been running our facility. You noted that on the cargoes, that was a record level for the quarter for us. But we still see continued demand for LPGs and see that into the future as well as petchem becomes a bigger piece of that export pie versus res-com."

Some of it we get through our own liquid blending at our terminals, right, and generate the RINs there for our needs, and it really does pass on downstream to the ultimate consumer. Some of that, it goes through other channels of trade. We're not exposed on the exports. We had 200,000 barrels a day of exports in the quarter.

Now the other comment that when we -- over the last year or so where we've been in a depressed margin environment, capture rates just generally are impacted by the fact that you've got costs that flow through here that are on a fixed per barrel basis. So there's some freight and the like that it's fixed cost per barrel. So proportionately, that becomes a bigger impact takes a bigger hit out of capture than when you're in a more normalized market environment. But RINs in that other is a big element."

So that accounts for a good part of that delta off the fourth quarter. 
And then we always get into the timing issues between the Gulf Coast and New York Harbor as we go up Colonial Pipeline. And so we saw a pretty negative hit there that really is timing as prices run up, and we'll get it back on the other side eventually.

And the question is that is $12 billion is really the right number? Given the unpredictable nature of the refining market and all that, should we even target a much lower bad debt for the company. So that's the first question. Now that doesn't mean that you should not, at the same time, to maybe that increase the shareholder return. But is that one or the other or that we can concurrently to have continue a portion of the free cash flow being drive down the debt or put on the balance sheet until the balance sheet will be a much lower debt level.

And depending on the state of the business, the growth opportunities, other capital allocation sort of priorities, we will optimize in whatever direction makes sense. But I'd also say that while there's -- when you come through a period of extreme volatility and depressed margins like we saw in 2020, that may lead you to conclude that maybe we should just permanently run at a lower debt level. I'd also say that there is -- the business is growing. 
And as you expect, the underlying cash generation to increase, you're effectively delevering, right, on a sort of debt-to-EBITDA basis as you execute on those growth programs.

We want to get back to $6 billion to $7 billion of mid-cycle cash flow, and that creates the optionality for us certainly to invest $1 billion in our sustaining capital to fund our dividend, $1.6 billion and grow that dividend.

It's actually really good for us. It's a learning curve around some of the products -- how to handle the product coming off the unit and everything before we get to the big projects. So we'll continue to ramp that unit up into the third quarter here as some of the logistics to feed the unit to get some of those projects get finished. And we're able to get to the 9,000 barrels a day of input out there of the soybean oil. 
So we've also been able to test our logistics supply chain to bring the soybean oil to Rodeo and that's all worked out really well. And that's key for us as we start learning how to feed a much bigger machine in early '24. Permitting process in California is progressing.

And then think about improving the economics. Right now, if you look at the economics of sustainable aviation fuel versus renewable diesel, renewable diesel makes more sense to produce. 
So we need to think about the economics that can come from thinking about how to make it. It can come from the credits, it could come from the price of the fuel. So we have to think through all of that. And then finally, we're exploring whether we want to have a supply agreement with Southwest Airlines, whether that makes sense.

And it's not just the CI of the feedstock, it's also the transportation, the location, and the cost of the feedstock is the different feedstocks will change in price. It's a benefit of having a hydrotreater in front of the plant where you can kind of run different feedstocks. So our goal, too, is to buy, just like we do in our -- in the crude and the gasoline and diesel market, our commercial group buys much more than we need. 
As an example, in the crude market, we buy twice as much crude as the refineries need And that allows us to optimize the crude. So at any given time, we could think about each refinery and what could we have available and what could optimize at that refinery at that time.

The CDC just said that cruise ships can start up in July. We're seeing a lot of strength in the economy. We think diesel will be up about 2%.

Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone on the call for joining us today. Continued improved demand across CPChem's product lines and resilient operating recovery from the first quarter winter storms contributed record quarterly earnings in our Chemicals segment. Marketing and Specialties reported strong results as demand increased in many of our key domestic regions. Our Midstream segment recovered well from the first quarter winter storms to report solid results. Headwinds continued in our Refining segment as RIN adjusted refined product crack only improved modestly and historically low market capture contributed to continued losses. As more people across the globe are vaccinated, we expect continued economic recovery and further improvement in global refined product demand. In addition, permanent refinery closure announcements have increased to over 3.7 million barrels per day globally with additional closure announcements expected. 
In Midstream, Phillips 66 Partners continued construction of the C2G Pipeline. The project is backed by long-term commitments and is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of this year. At the Sweeny Hub, we recently resumed construction of Frac 4, which will add 150,000 barrels per day of capacity. Upon completion, which is expected in the fourth quarter of 2022, total Sweeny Hub fractionation capacity will increase to 550,000 barrels per day. The fracs are all supported by long-term commitments. CPChem continues to develop 2 world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Qatar. We expect the final investment decision for the U.S. Gulf Coast project next year. The petrochemical project is progressing with front-end engineering and design as planned. Both projects are in partnership with Qatar Petroleum. 
In addition, CPChem began construction of its second world scale unit to produce 1-hexene, utilizing CPChem's proprietary technology. 1-hexene is used for high-performance polyethylene manufacturing and is common in a variety of everyday products, including packaging for food, consumer products and pharmaceuticals. The unit located in Old Ocean, Texas will have a capacity of 266,000 metric tons per year and is expected to start up in 2023. 
In May, CPChem was recognized by the Plastic Industry Association for being among the top 2021 industry innovators in sustainability. The award recognizes CPChem launch of Marlex, a new circular polyethylene, which uses advanced recycling technology to convert plastic waste into high-quality raw materials. We continue to advance our Rodeo Renewed project at the San Francisco refinery. In July, we reached full production rates of 8,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel from the hydrotreater conversion. Subject to permitting approvals, full conversion of the facility is expected in early 2024. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel production capacity. The conversion will reduce emissions from the facility and produce lower carbon transportation fuels. Rodeo, combined with our portfolio of other renewable fuels projects has the potential to supply 1 billion gallons of renewable fuels per year. 
In Marketing, we're converting 600 brand retail sites in California to sell renewable diesel produced by the Rodeo facility. In Switzerland, our retail joint venture continues to add hydrogen fueling stations. Through our joint venture, we're exploring hydrogen as a fuel option for heavy-duty vehicles to support European low-carbon goals and growing demand for sustainable fuels. We're moving forward and preparing for the future, while maintaining our focus on safe, reliable operations and attractive shareholder returns. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results."

Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our second quarter results. We reported earnings of $296 million. Excluding special items, we had adjusted earnings of $329 million or $0.74 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $1.7 billion, including a working capital benefit of $833 million and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $612 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $380 million, including $179 million for growth projects. We paid $394 million in dividends. 
Moving to Slide 5. This slide shows the change in adjusted results from the first quarter to the second quarter, an increase of $838 million. Pretax income improved across all segments, with the largest contribution from Chemicals. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 19%. Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. Second quarter adjusted pretax income was $316 million, an increase of $40 million from the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $224 million, up $18 million from the previous quarter. The increase was due to improved volumes from higher refinery utilization, partially offset by higher costs due to the timing of maintenance and asset integrity work. 
NGL and other adjusted pretax income was $83 million. The $47 million increase from the prior quarter was mainly due to lower operating costs and higher volumes, reflecting recovery from the winter storms. The Sweeny fractionation complex averaged 380,000 barrels per day and the Freeport LPG export facility loaded a record 42 cargoes in the second quarter. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $9 million, was down $25 million from the previous quarter, mainly due to lower mark-to-market hedging results from higher natural gas and NGL prices. 
Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. Second quarter adjusted pretax income was $657 million, up $473 million from the first quarter. This is the highest quarterly earnings for Chemicals since the joint venture was formed in 2000. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pretax income was $593 million. The $419 million increase from the previous quarter was driven by strong demand, high supplies and recovery from the winter storms that contributed to higher margins and lower utility costs. 
The industry chain margin increased over $0.17 per pound to a record $0.62 per pound. Global O&P utilization was 102% for the quarter. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S increased $55 million. The increase primarily reflects improved margins due to tight industry supplies following the winter storms as well as lower turnaround costs. During the second quarter, we received $322 million in cash distributions from CPChem. 
Turning to Refining on Slide 8. Refining second quarter adjusted pretax loss was $706 million, an improvement of $320 million from the first quarter. The improvement was driven by lower utility and turnaround costs and higher volumes. This was partially offset by lower realized margins. Improved market crack spreads were more than offset by higher lower electricity sales in the Texas market, decreased secondary product margins, lower clean product differentials and inventory impacts. Pretax turnaround costs were $118 million, down from $192 million in the prior quarter. 
Crude utilization was 88% compared with 74% last quarter. The second quarter clean product yield was 82%. Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:1 market crack for the second quarter was $17.76 per barrel compared to $13.23 per barrel in the first quarter. Realized margin was $2.92 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 22%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 33%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. Our refineries are more heavily weighted toward distillate production than the market indicator. During the quarter, the gasoline crack improved $5.68 per barrel, while the distillate crack increased $2.20 per barrel. 
Losses from secondary products of $2.38 per barrel or $1.09 per barrel higher than the previous quarter as crude prices strengthened. These stock costs improved $0.36 per barrel compared to the prior quarter. The other category reduced realized margins by $7.84 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, new product realizations and inventory impacts. Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted second quarter pretax income was $479 million compared with $290 million in the prior quarter. Marketing and other increased $181 million due to higher domestic margins and volumes, reflecting strong demand in key markets. Refined product exports in the second quarter were 216,000 barrels per day. Specialties generated second quarter adjusted pretax income of $87 million, up from $79 million in the prior quarter. 
Slide 11 shows the change in cash for the quarter. We started the quarter with a $1.4 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $1.7 billion. This included a working capital benefit of $833 million. In June, we received a $1.1 billion U.S. federal income tax refund, which is reflected in working capital. Cash from operations, excluding working capital, was $910 million, which more than covered $380 million of capital spend and $394 million for the dividend. The other category includes a $90 million loan to our joint venture. Our ending cash balance was $2.2 billion. 
This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the third quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, crude utilization will be adjusted according to market conditions. In July, utilization averaged around 19%. We expect third quarter pretax turnaround expenses to be between $120 million and $150 million. We anticipate third quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $240 million and $250 million pretax. Now we will open the line for questions."

The -- we're still consistent on our mid-cycle margin projection. And of course, we're well above that today. And as we look out into the third quarter, we're seeing the strength continue in the third quarter. We've got cost increases on the table that are being negotiated as we speak. Even if things went forward just as they are today, we're still at record margins. And we think that, that can carry into third quarter. There's a lot of strength in the marketplace, particularly in North America and in Europe. Asia is still kind of lagging, but starting to perk up a little bit. So the real story is the fundamental economic resurgence in the U.S., in North America and Europe. And we believe that there's some upside that will offset some headwinds out in the future as the rest of the global economy kicks in. We're at record margins. Nobody believes those are sustainable for the long term. However, I think we can go from something at the record level to something that's still pretty robust. We see seasonal downturn typically in the fourth quarter, but we've also seen conditions where we can kind of carry through when there's strong enough marketing momentum. And there may be those kind of conditions now. We're particularly focused on high-density polyethylene. And that's still pretty tight in the marketplace. The inventories have not recovered to where CPChem would be comfortable operating. And it's unusual to be there this time of year with hurricane season. We typically want to be a little higher in inventories going into the hurricane season. So there's a number of factors that could lead to sustain this momentum into the third quarter and beyond into the fourth quarter. And then we see the world economy kicking in. About the same time, additional capacity is coming on, say, first half of next year. So there's some good fundamentals out there. And I think it's still got some legs based on the demand that will come to bear as the world economy fully recovers from COVID"

I think we would have all expected maybe on a global basis, Europe and Asia demand ticked back a little better than it did. I think the margins -- the RIN adjusted margins that we saw in the second quarter really across our system are very representative of a global market. So until we start seeing recovery, particularly in Europe because we seem to see products flowing out of Europe into North America and South America, we won't really see RINs get back to where we would like to I think the second piece for us, in particular, is our is more geared towards heavy crudes making diesel. And certainly for the second quarter, it was a gasoline-driven market without much differential on heavy crude. We've seen those widen out here now in July to a much more respectable level. So we think it's headed in the right direction. But I think all of that added up to being challenged in the second quarter to turn a 90% type utilization number into a profit."

We expect distillate cracks to perform as we get toward wintertime. So all in all, I think we've also seen actually markets overseas come back. We have marketing in Europe. And we've seen Europe, Germany, where we market 90% to 95% of demand. Austria, where we market, 100% of demand. So we've seen those markets come back as well. So as Bob said, the overseas markets start to come back, that will help the U.S. cracks, and we should see some profitability in Q3."

One, internally, right, we expected tough operating conditions for a good part of this year. Recovery has been slower than we expected, but we went into this year, trying to reduce some of our heavy maintenance expenses and adjusting turnarounds and all that. And so the guidance Kevin just gave for the third quarter is fairly light for us. So I think that helps the third quarter profitability. You can translate that as we're available to run. So if the cracks are there, we're going to be able to run pretty hard in the third quarter and make money. Around the 66 program that we laid out, so a lot of that is built around margin enhancement, margin improvement. So I would sell -- we ran pretty well in the second quarter, and we're using all those tools that are in our toolkit. The value chain optimization activities that went on in the second quarter were pretty robust. We did a lot of things that we haven't done before or needed to do before, such as we ran a lot of down into our Sweeny refinery, where typically, we'd be running or some of the heavy Canadians. The profitability really wasn't there. And so optimizing around high sulfur into our system. It's just one example about where we're kind of running the circuits. We're pretty happy with the results we're seeing on the operating front. A lot of our initiatives in Refining are around being able to operate well, operate better, operate safer with the smaller environmental footprint, and we're seeing value come out of all of those initiatives. They don't necessarily translate directly to the bottom line where you can see them, but over time, they're paying dividends."

This has been a story of vaccinations, efficiency, lockdowns and people trying to get back to some to normal, and that all translates strictly into the demand that we see for our products. And there's still a question, I think the U.S. is probably lead in terms of demand recovery through this cycle. And so we've seen the impacts of Europe coming to the U.S. We've seen the impacts of not being able to export as much as we'd like to, to South America in places.

We're making progress on paying down debt. We've got sort of clear line of sight to our ability to continue to do that and get the balance sheet back to where we want it to be, then we should feel comfortable on some of the other capital allocation priorities and increasing the dividend is one of those.

That was a good time with regard to the overall supply/demand fundamentals. Global demand was where you wanted it to be on really all of our Midstream products, whether it's crude products and NGLs. So fundamentally, there are big changes in the market. But when you look specifically at 2021, let me just highlight a couple of things for you there that are -- have reared their head. The biggest one that's had the biggest impact is winter storm Uri. When you look at Uri, it impacted our frac significantly down there. and mainly not from the standpoint of damaging the units or any issues there. Even though we did have some costs with the units, that was on utilities. Our utility bill was significant. So from that standpoint, and that's going to be hard to call back for the rest of this year. So on a positive note, I'd just tell you, structurally, we like the NGL business. Demand has been very robust to support chemicals growth, both locally and globally. NGL Production is ramping up. We still see about 1 million barrels in rejection at this point in time. But overall, demand is really good in that space. Our LPG exports have been in a record clip. So overall, the fundamentals feel good that it was a big cost hit as well as lost production hit that we had initially in 1Q, which really on a year-to-date basis stays with us. The last thing I'd just cover in Q2, the overall structure in NGLs has jumped up significantly, as you probably are well aware, propane, butane and ethane. We're at about $0.86, $0.87 on a gallon basis for NGL on a composite. In 2019, it was $0.37. So it's gone up. And with that, we've seen an impact on some mark-to-market we have on some of our inventory. So that's there. That usually turns into a timing issue. But just nonetheless, that shows up in the results in 2Q."

I think your second question was around the permitting status that Rodeo Renewed and the conversion out there of the Refinery to run in renewable fuel. So we continue to develop the environmental impact statement with Contra Costa County. I would characterize that has gone about as well as it could, better than we expected. We're essentially done writing the permit. It's in review right now internally with the county, and we would expect them to probably sometime this month release the permit to begin the public comment period. So that would be pretty much right on our time line, maybe a little bit ahead. And so far, it's been a good cooperative process with the regulators and their permit So we're encouraged and pretty happy where we are. We continue to outreach with all the other stakeholders in Contra Costa County and Northern California, that make sure everybody understands what that project is going to do for the Bay Area and for California in general. So far, so good. And digitization. Yes, third piece. I think was a question around the 66 and cost reductions. And you're right, in a year like 2020, it's hard to say. But I would say we've been able to deliver within bounds of the environment on both sides of the equation. So we've had good optimization opportunities around reduced utilization in our refineries and our ability to get down as low as we did and to make jet go away and all those I think we're much easier because of some of the efforts we had. The second piece I would say is at the when we had the social distance and we had to use alternative work approaches and everything. Our early jump into digitalization allowed our people to get a lot more done without human contact and really was a dividend to us upfront in our ability to keep supporting the operators who were on the units, while minimizing contact with the outside world. And the third piece is we were able to hold the line on costs quite well throughout last year. And in fact, we saw cost reductions in many of kind of our bigger cost items, caps and and those sorts of things that are a big piece of our operating budget. We applied some of the learnings that we got through 66 to those. And I think we got sustainable longer-term price reductions there that will continue to pay out throughout this year. So kind of full steam ahead on all our initiatives there, particularly in Refining."

We got 4.5 million barrels currently, we have about 4.4 million barrels of pipeline egress of another 100,000 barrels on rail. But we've seen, which is something a little different from what we've seen in the past couple of years as we've seen the WCS differential in the Gulf Coast weaken. It's weaken about $2.5 over the past couple of quarters. And when that weakens, so does the hardest differential, you have to have an to get the barrels to the Gulf Coast. And one of the reasons the Gulf Coast is weakening, is because low exports means that you have to have a weaker differential on WCS to get that WCS exported out of the U.S. So as you said, Theresa, we have Enbridge coming online in next quarter, quarter 4, we would think that, that would firm up differentials a bit. But don't forget in the wintertime, we add diluent to crude, and that also increases the volume of crude that has to move. So I view, our forecast is that you'll see differentials somewhere between 12.5% and $13.5 off of WTI going forward."

So I think that's what allows us to be able to have a unique position of building a project that's going to be at an installed cost of about $1 a gallon, which you're right, is lower than anybody else, but it is because if there was a refinery that was custom built to be able to be converted to renewable feedstocks for Rodeo since it's very, very unusual to have 2 hydrocrackers and excess hydrogen capacity on site between our own hydrogen plant and that of our third-party supplier that is built at the site.

So we're learning how the catalyst reacts and what the actual kinetics are around running oil. It's a little bit of a learning for the ultimate project of converting the refinery. And these are really -- these projects really are 2 very separate things in that there was no real work to do to convert 50 to  oil, it was a matter of changing the catalyst that a regular scheduled turnaround and then being able to run it. So it's helpful. I think the bigger picture there is it's very helpful to our commercial organization to learn how to source renewable feedstocks. So logistics are getting them there, some of the peculiar areas around transporting it. Those sorts of things all set us up to be a lot more nimble and ready for when we go from 8,000 barrels a day to 50,000 barrels a day with the renewable conversion.

In the second quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $329 million. We generated operating cash flow of $1.7 billion. Excluding working capital, operating cash flow was $910 million. With the benefit of our diversified portfolio, we generated cash flow in excess of capital spending and dividends during the quarter. We returned $394 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. Since we formed as a company, we've returned over $28 billion to shareholders. A secure competitive dividend will continue to be a top priority for our company. we anticipate a return to dividend growth as cash flow recovers. 
We're committed to disciplined capital allocation, focusing on debt repayment in the near term to support a conservative balance sheet, and maintain our strong investment-grade credit ratings. In July, the Phillips 66 Board of Directors appointed Denise Cade and Doug Terreson to serve as independent directors. We continue to work on board refreshment, recognizing the value, diversity in terms of gender, age, race, ethnicity, tenure, professional experiences and perspectives. We'd like to highlight our recent 2021 sustainability report that can be accessed on our website. We think it's one of our best Our commitment to sustainability is based on operating excellence, environmental stewardship, social responsibility and financial performance will add by strong corporate governance. 
We expanded our commitment to environmental responsibility, setting goal for all of our refineries to achieve top third energy efficiency by 2030. We modified our compensation program to add additional environmental goals. As previously communicated, we will establish meaningful and achievable greenhouse gas emission reduction targets later this year. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark to provide some additional comments."

Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone on the call for joining us today. Continued improved demand across CPChem's product lines and resilient operating recovery from the first quarter winter storms contributed record quarterly earnings in our Chemicals segment. Marketing and Specialties reported strong results as demand increased in many of our key domestic regions. Our Midstream segment recovered well from the first quarter winter storms to report solid results. Headwinds continued in our Refining segment as RIN adjusted refined product crack only improved modestly and historically low market capture contributed to continued losses. As more people across the globe are vaccinated, we expect continued economic recovery and further improvement in global refined product demand. In addition, permanent refinery closure announcements have increased to over 3.7 million barrels per day globally with additional closure announcements expected. 
In Midstream, Phillips 66 Partners continued construction of the C2G Pipeline. The project is backed by long-term commitments and is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of this year. At the Sweeny Hub, we recently resumed construction of Frac 4, which will add 150,000 barrels per day of capacity. Upon completion, which is expected in the fourth quarter of 2022, total Sweeny Hub fractionation capacity will increase to 550,000 barrels per day. The fracs are all supported by long-term commitments. CPChem continues to develop 2 world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Qatar. We expect the final investment decision for the U.S. Gulf Coast project next year. The petrochemical project is progressing with front-end engineering and design as planned. Both projects are in partnership with Qatar Petroleum. 
In addition, CPChem began construction of its second world scale unit to produce 1-hexene, utilizing CPChem's proprietary technology. 1-hexene is used for high-performance polyethylene manufacturing and is common in a variety of everyday products, including packaging for food, consumer products and pharmaceuticals. The unit located in Old Ocean, Texas will have a capacity of 266,000 metric tons per year and is expected to start up in 2023. 
In May, CPChem was recognized by the Plastic Industry Association for being among the top 2021 industry innovators in sustainability. The award recognizes CPChem launch of Marlex, a new circular polyethylene, which uses advanced recycling technology to convert plastic waste into high-quality raw materials. We continue to advance our Rodeo Renewed project at the San Francisco refinery. In July, we reached full production rates of 8,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel from the hydrotreater conversion. Subject to permitting approvals, full conversion of the facility is expected in early 2024. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel production capacity. The conversion will reduce emissions from the facility and produce lower carbon transportation fuels. Rodeo, combined with our portfolio of other renewable fuels projects has the potential to supply 1 billion gallons of renewable fuels per year. 
In Marketing, we're converting 600 brand retail sites in California to sell renewable diesel produced by the Rodeo facility. In Switzerland, our retail joint venture continues to add hydrogen fueling stations. Through our joint venture, we're exploring hydrogen as a fuel option for heavy-duty vehicles to support European low-carbon goals and growing demand for sustainable fuels. We're moving forward and preparing for the future, while maintaining our focus on safe, reliable operations and attractive shareholder returns. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results."

Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our second quarter results. We reported earnings of $296 million. Excluding special items, we had adjusted earnings of $329 million or $0.74 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $1.7 billion, including a working capital benefit of $833 million and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $612 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $380 million, including $179 million for growth projects. We paid $394 million in dividends. 
Moving to Slide 5. This slide shows the change in adjusted results from the first quarter to the second quarter, an increase of $838 million. Pretax income improved across all segments, with the largest contribution from Chemicals. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 19%. Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. Second quarter adjusted pretax income was $316 million, an increase of $40 million from the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $224 million, up $18 million from the previous quarter. The increase was due to improved volumes from higher refinery utilization, partially offset by higher costs due to the timing of maintenance and asset integrity work. 
NGL and other adjusted pretax income was $83 million. The $47 million increase from the prior quarter was mainly due to lower operating costs and higher volumes, reflecting recovery from the winter storms. The Sweeny fractionation complex averaged 380,000 barrels per day and the Freeport LPG export facility loaded a record 42 cargoes in the second quarter. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $9 million, was down $25 million from the previous quarter, mainly due to lower mark-to-market hedging results from higher natural gas and NGL prices. 
Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. Second quarter adjusted pretax income was $657 million, up $473 million from the first quarter. This is the highest quarterly earnings for Chemicals since the joint venture was formed in 2000. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pretax income was $593 million. The $419 million increase from the previous quarter was driven by strong demand, high supplies and recovery from the winter storms that contributed to higher margins and lower utility costs. 
The industry chain margin increased over $0.17 per pound to a record $0.62 per pound. Global O&P utilization was 102% for the quarter. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S increased $55 million. The increase primarily reflects improved margins due to tight industry supplies following the winter storms as well as lower turnaround costs. During the second quarter, we received $322 million in cash distributions from CPChem. 
Turning to Refining on Slide 8. Refining second quarter adjusted pretax loss was $706 million, an improvement of $320 million from the first quarter. The improvement was driven by lower utility and turnaround costs and higher volumes. This was partially offset by lower realized margins. Improved market crack spreads were more than offset by higher lower electricity sales in the Texas market, decreased secondary product margins, lower clean product differentials and inventory impacts. Pretax turnaround costs were $118 million, down from $192 million in the prior quarter. 
Crude utilization was 88% compared with 74% last quarter. The second quarter clean product yield was 82%. Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:1 market crack for the second quarter was $17.76 per barrel compared to $13.23 per barrel in the first quarter. Realized margin was $2.92 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 22%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 33%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. Our refineries are more heavily weighted toward distillate production than the market indicator. During the quarter, the gasoline crack improved $5.68 per barrel, while the distillate crack increased $2.20 per barrel. 
Losses from secondary products of $2.38 per barrel or $1.09 per barrel higher than the previous quarter as crude prices strengthened. These stock costs improved $0.36 per barrel compared to the prior quarter. The other category reduced realized margins by $7.84 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, new product realizations and inventory impacts. Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted second quarter pretax income was $479 million compared with $290 million in the prior quarter. Marketing and other increased $181 million due to higher domestic margins and volumes, reflecting strong demand in key markets. Refined product exports in the second quarter were 216,000 barrels per day. Specialties generated second quarter adjusted pretax income of $87 million, up from $79 million in the prior quarter. 
Slide 11 shows the change in cash for the quarter. We started the quarter with a $1.4 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $1.7 billion. This included a working capital benefit of $833 million. In June, we received a $1.1 billion U.S. federal income tax refund, which is reflected in working capital. Cash from operations, excluding working capital, was $910 million, which more than covered $380 million of capital spend and $394 million for the dividend. The other category includes a $90 million loan to our joint venture. Our ending cash balance was $2.2 billion. 
This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the third quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, crude utilization will be adjusted according to market conditions. In July, utilization averaged around 19%. We expect third quarter pretax turnaround expenses to be between $120 million and $150 million. We anticipate third quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $240 million and $250 million pretax. Now we will open the line for questions."

The -- we're still consistent on our mid-cycle margin projection. And of course, we're well above that today. And as we look out into the third quarter, we're seeing the strength continue in the third quarter. We've got cost increases on the table that are being negotiated as we speak. Even if things went forward just as they are today, we're still at record margins. And we think that, that can carry into third quarter. There's a lot of strength in the marketplace, particularly in North America and in Europe. Asia is still kind of lagging, but starting to perk up a little bit. So the real story is the fundamental economic resurgence in the U.S., in North America and Europe. And we believe that there's some upside that will offset some headwinds out in the future as the rest of the global economy kicks in. We're at record margins. Nobody believes those are sustainable for the long term. However, I think we can go from something at the record level to something that's still pretty robust. We see seasonal downturn typically in the fourth quarter, but we've also seen conditions where we can kind of carry through when there's strong enough marketing momentum. And there may be those kind of conditions now. We're particularly focused on high-density polyethylene. And that's still pretty tight in the marketplace. The inventories have not recovered to where CPChem would be comfortable operating. And it's unusual to be there this time of year with hurricane season. We typically want to be a little higher in inventories going into the hurricane season. So there's a number of factors that could lead to sustain this momentum into the third quarter and beyond into the fourth quarter. And then we see the world economy kicking in. About the same time, additional capacity is coming on, say, first half of next year. So there's some good fundamentals out there. And I think it's still got some legs based on the demand that will come to bear as the world economy fully recovers from COVID"

I think when you look back over the last quarter, I think there were plenty of market signals there for us to run at the utilization rates we're at. There's a lot of moving parts, in particular, the cost of RINs that just continue to increase throughout the quarter. And and we take a pretty good hit in Refining for the full cost of those prints. I think we would have all expected maybe on a global basis, Europe and Asia demand ticked back a little better than it did. I think the margins -- the RIN adjusted margins that we saw in the second quarter really across our system are very representative of a global market. So until we start seeing recovery, particularly in Europe because we seem to see products flowing out of Europe into North America and South America, we won't really see RINs get back to where we would like to I think the second piece for us, in particular, is our is more geared towards heavy crudes making diesel. And certainly for the second quarter, it was a gasoline-driven market without much differential on heavy crude. We've seen those widen out here now in July to a much more respectable level. So we think it's headed in the right direction. But I think all of that added up to being challenged in the second quarter to turn a 90% type utilization number into a profit."

One, internally, right, we expected tough operating conditions for a good part of this year. Recovery has been slower than we expected, but we went into this year, trying to reduce some of our heavy maintenance expenses and adjusting turnarounds and all that. And so the guidance Kevin just gave for the third quarter is fairly light for us. So I think that helps the third quarter profitability. You can translate that as we're available to run. So if the cracks are there, we're going to be able to run pretty hard in the third quarter and make money. Around the 66 program that we laid out, so a lot of that is built around margin enhancement, margin improvement. So I would sell -- we ran pretty well in the second quarter, and we're using all those tools that are in our toolkit. The value chain optimization activities that went on in the second quarter were pretty robust. We did a lot of things that we haven't done before or needed to do before, such as we ran a lot of down into our Sweeny refinery, where typically, we'd be running or some of the heavy Canadians. The profitability really wasn't there. And so optimizing around high sulfur into our system. It's just one example about where we're kind of running the circuits. We're pretty happy with the results we're seeing on the operating front. A lot of our initiatives in Refining are around being able to operate well, operate better, operate safer with the smaller environmental footprint, and we're seeing value come out of all of those initiatives. They don't necessarily translate directly to the bottom line where you can see them, but over time, they're paying dividends."

During the quarter, we -- those differentials we were not getting -- seeing the value for some of those premium products that often can be a benefit to us in the quarter.

There's no question. There's been a lot of stress put on a lot of companies in our industry. But I think we're constructive, particularly as we come in the back half of the year around demand. This has been a story of vaccinations, efficiency, lockdowns and people trying to get back to some to normal, and that all translates strictly into the demand that we see for our products. And there's still a question, I think the U.S. is probably lead in terms of demand recovery through this cycle. And so we've seen the impacts of Europe coming to the U.S. We've seen the impacts of not being able to export as much as we'd like to, to South America in places. And so I think as the world returns to normal, we've got a good shot at getting back to something that looks more like a mid-cycle. I think we said on the last call, we really need to see that 321 frac on a rent adjusted basis get back to about $12.

We're making progress on paying down debt. We've got sort of clear line of sight to our ability to continue to do that and get the balance sheet back to where we want it to be, then we should feel comfortable on some of the other capital allocation priorities and increasing the dividend is one of those. So I think it's a little bit of a long-winded way of saying we don't need to get to all we want to get through on the balance sheet before we make a decision on the dividend.

That was a good time with regard to the overall supply/demand fundamentals. Global demand was where you wanted it to be on really all of our Midstream products, whether it's crude products and NGLs. So fundamentally, there are big changes in the market. But when you look specifically at 2021, let me just highlight a couple of things for you there that are -- have reared their head. The biggest one that's had the biggest impact is winter storm Uri. When you look at Uri, it impacted our frac significantly down there. and mainly not from the standpoint of damaging the units or any issues there. Even though we did have some costs with the units, that was on utilities. Our utility bill was significant. So from that standpoint, and that's going to be hard to call back for the rest of this year. So on a positive note, I'd just tell you, structurally, we like the NGL business. Demand has been very robust to support chemicals growth, both locally and globally. NGL Production is ramping up. We still see about 1 million barrels in rejection at this point in time. But overall, demand is really good in that space. Our LPG exports have been in a record clip. So overall, the fundamentals feel good that it was a big cost hit as well as lost production hit that we had initially in 1Q, which really on a year-to-date basis stays with us. The last thing I'd just cover in Q2, the overall structure in NGLs has jumped up significantly, as you probably are well aware, propane, butane and ethane. We're at about $0.86, $0.87 on a gallon basis for NGL on a composite. In 2019, it was $0.37. So it's gone up. And with that, we've seen an impact on some mark-to-market we have on some of our inventory. So that's there. That usually turns into a timing issue. But just nonetheless, that shows up in the results in 2Q."

I think your second question was around the permitting status that Rodeo Renewed and the conversion out there of the Refinery to run in renewable fuel. So we continue to develop the environmental impact statement with Contra Costa County. I would characterize that has gone about as well as it could, better than we expected. We're essentially done writing the permit. It's in review right now internally with the county, and we would expect them to probably sometime this month release the permit to begin the public comment period. So that would be pretty much right on our time line, maybe a little bit ahead. And so far, it's been a good cooperative process with the regulators and their permit So we're encouraged and pretty happy where we are. We continue to outreach with all the other stakeholders in Contra Costa County and Northern California, that make sure everybody understands what that project is going to do for the Bay Area and for California in general. So far, so good. And digitization. Yes, third piece. I think was a question around the 66 and cost reductions. And you're right, in a year like 2020, it's hard to say. But I would say we've been able to deliver within bounds of the environment on both sides of the equation. So we've had good optimization opportunities around reduced utilization in our refineries and our ability to get down as low as we did and to make jet go away and all those I think we're much easier because of some of the efforts we had. The second piece I would say is at the when we had the social distance and we had to use alternative work approaches and everything. Our early jump into digitalization allowed our people to get a lot more done without human contact and really was a dividend to us upfront in our ability to keep supporting the operators who were on the units, while minimizing contact with the outside world. And the third piece is we were able to hold the line on costs quite well throughout last year. And in fact, we saw cost reductions in many of kind of our bigger cost items, caps and and those sorts of things that are a big piece of our operating budget. We applied some of the learnings that we got through 66 to those. And I think we got sustainable longer-term price reductions there that will continue to pay out throughout this year. So kind of full steam ahead on all our initiatives there, particularly in Refining."

It's weaken about $2.5 over the past couple of quarters. And when that weakens, so does the hardest differential, you have to have an to get the barrels to the Gulf Coast. And one of the reasons the Gulf Coast is weakening, is because low exports means that you have to have a weaker differential on WCS to get that WCS exported out of the U.S. So as you said, Theresa, we have Enbridge coming online in next quarter, quarter 4, we would think that, that would firm up differentials a bit. But don't forget in the wintertime, we add diluent to crude, and that also increases the volume of crude that has to move. So I view, our forecast is that you'll see differentials somewhere between 12.5% and $13.5 off of WTI going forward."

So most of the cost of that project is in either the logistics piece and then the big chunk is the freight themselves. So I think that's what allows us to be able to have a unique position of building a project that's going to be at an installed cost of about $1 a gallon, which you're right, is lower than anybody else, but it is because if there was a refinery that was custom built to be able to be converted to renewable feedstocks for Rodeo since it's very, very unusual to have 2 hydrocrackers and excess hydrogen capacity on site between our own hydrogen plant and that of our third-party supplier that is built at the site. So we've kind of got a perfect storm there. So we're spending money to get all the logistics right, a little bit of metaling up in the hydrocrackers and in the pretreatment unit, and we'll be ready to go."

And these are really -- these projects really are 2 very separate things in that there was no real work to do to convert 50 to  oil, it was a matter of changing the catalyst that a regular scheduled turnaround and then being able to run it.

Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone on the call for joining us today. Continued improved demand across CPChem's product lines and resilient operating recovery from the first quarter winter storms contributed record quarterly earnings in our Chemicals segment. Marketing and Specialties reported strong results as demand increased in many of our key domestic regions. Our Midstream segment recovered well from the first quarter winter storms to report solid results. 
Headwinds continued in our Refining segment as RIN adjusted refined product crack only improved modestly and historically low market capture contributed to continued losses. As more people across the globe are vaccinated, we expect continued economic recovery and further improvement in global refined product demand. In addition, permanent refinery closure announcements have increased to over 3.7 million barrels per day globally with additional closure announcements expected.
In Midstream, Phillips 66 Partners continued construction of the C2G Pipeline. The project is backed by long-term commitments and is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of this year. At the Sweeny Hub, we recently resumed construction of Frac 4, which will add 150,000 barrels per day of capacity. Upon completion, which is expected in the fourth quarter of 2022, total Sweeny Hub fractionation capacity will increase to 550,000 barrels per day. The fracs are all supported by long-term commitments. 
CPChem continues to develop 2 world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar. We expect the final investment decision for the U.S. Gulf Coast project next year. The Ras Laffan petrochemical project is progressing with front-end engineering and design as planned. Both projects are in partnership with Qatar Petroleum. In addition, CPChem began construction of its second world scale unit to produce 1-hexene, utilizing CPChem's proprietary technology. 1-hexene is used for high-performance polyethylene manufacturing and is common in a variety of everyday products, including packaging for food, consumer products and pharmaceuticals. The unit located in Old Ocean, Texas will have a capacity of 266,000 metric tons per year and is expected to start up in 2023. 
In May, CPChem was recognized by the Plastic Industry Association for being among the top 2021 industry innovators in sustainability. The award recognizes CPChem's launch of Marlex, a new circular polyethylene, which uses advanced recycling technology to convert plastic waste into high-quality raw materials. 
We continue to advance our Rodeo Renewed project at the San Francisco refinery. In July, we reached full production rates of 8,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel from the hydrotreater conversion. Subject to permitting and approvals, full conversion of the facility is expected in early 2024. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel production capacity. The conversion will reduce emissions from the facility and produce lower carbon transportation fuels. Rodeo, combined with our portfolio of other renewable fuels projects has the potential to supply 1 billion gallons of renewable fuels per year. 
In Marketing, we're converting 600 branded retail sites in California to sell renewable diesel produced by the Rodeo facility. In Switzerland, our Coop retail joint venture continues to add hydrogen fueling stations. Through our joint venture, we're exploring hydrogen as a fuel option for heavy-duty vehicles to support European low-carbon goals and growing demand for sustainable fuels. We're moving forward and preparing for the future, while maintaining our focus on safe, reliable operations and attractive shareholder returns.

Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our second quarter results. We reported earnings of $296 million. Excluding special items, we had adjusted earnings of $329 million or $0.74 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $1.7 billion, including a working capital benefit of $833 million and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $612 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $380 million, including $179 million for growth projects. We paid $394 million in dividends. 
Moving to Slide 5. This slide shows the change in adjusted results from the first quarter to the second quarter, an increase of $838 million. Pretax income improved across all segments, with the largest contribution from Chemicals. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 19%. 
Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. Second quarter adjusted pretax income was $316 million, an increase of $40 million from the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $224 million, up $18 million from the previous quarter. The increase was due to improved volumes from higher refinery utilization, partially offset by higher costs due to the timing of maintenance and asset integrity work. 
NGL and other adjusted pretax income was $83 million. The $47 million increase from the prior quarter was mainly due to lower operating costs and higher volumes, reflecting recovery from the winter storms. The Sweeny fractionation complex averaged 380,000 barrels per day and the Freeport LPG export facility loaded a record 42 cargoes in the second quarter. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $9 million, was down $25 million from the previous quarter, mainly due to lower mark-to-market hedging results from higher natural gas and NGL prices. 
Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. Second quarter adjusted pretax income was $657 million, up $473 million from the first quarter. This is the highest quarterly earnings for Chemicals since the joint venture was formed in 2000. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pretax income was $593 million. The $419 million increase from the previous quarter was driven by strong demand, tight supplies and recovery from the winter storms that contributed to higher margins and lower utility costs. 
The industry chain margin increased over $0.17 per pound to a record $0.62 per pound. Global O&P utilization was 102% for the quarter. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S increased $55 million. The increase primarily reflects improved margins due to tight industry supplies following the winter storms as well as lower turnaround costs. During the second quarter, we received $322 million in cash distributions from CPChem. 
Turning to Refining on Slide 8. Refining second quarter adjusted pretax loss was $706 million, an improvement of $320 million from the first quarter. The improvement was driven by lower utility and turnaround costs and higher volumes. This was partially offset by lower realized margins. Improved market crack spreads were more than offset by higher RIN costs, lower electricity sales in the Texas market, decreased secondary product margins, lower clean product differentials and inventory impacts. Pretax turnaround costs were $118 million, down from $192 million in the prior quarter. Crude utilization was 88% compared with 74% last quarter. The second quarter clean product yield was 82%. 
Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the second quarter was $17.76 per barrel compared to $13.23 per barrel in the first quarter. Realized margin was $3.92 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 22%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 33%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. Our refineries are more heavily weighted toward distillate production than the market indicator. During the quarter, the gasoline crack improved $5.68 per barrel, while the distillate crack increased $2.20 per barrel. 
Losses from secondary products of $2.38 per barrel were $1.09 per barrel higher than the previous quarter as crude prices strengthened. These stock costs improved $0.36 per barrel compared to the prior quarter. The other category reduced realized margins by $7.84 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, new product realizations and inventory impacts.
Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted second quarter pretax income was $479 million compared with $290 million in the prior quarter. Marketing and other increased $181 million due to higher domestic margins and volumes, reflecting strong demand in key markets. Refined product exports in the second quarter were 216,000 barrels per day. Specialties generated second quarter adjusted pretax income of $87 million, up from $79 million in the prior quarter.
Slide 11 shows the change in cash for the quarter. We started the quarter with a $1.4 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $1.7 billion. This included a working capital benefit of $833 million. In June, we received a $1.1 billion U.S. federal income tax refund, which is reflected in working capital. Cash from operations, excluding working capital, was $910 million, which more than covered $380 million of capital spend and $394 million for the dividend. The other category includes a $90 million loan to our WRB joint venture. Our ending cash balance was $2.2 billion. 
This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the third quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, crude utilization will be adjusted according to market conditions. In July, utilization averaged around 98%. We expect third quarter pretax turnaround expenses to be between $120 million and $150 million. We anticipate third quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $240 million and $250 million pretax. 
Now we will open the line for questions."

The -- we're still consistent on our mid-cycle margin projection. And of course, we're well above that today. And as we look out into the third quarter, we're seeing the strength continue in the third quarter. We've got cost increases on the table that are being negotiated as we speak. Even if things went forward just as they are today, we're still at record margins. And we think that, that can carry into third quarter. 
There's a lot of strength in the marketplace, particularly in North America and in Europe. Asia is still kind of lagging, but starting to perk up a little bit. So the real story is the fundamental economic resurgence in the U.S., in North America and Europe. And we believe that there's some upside that will offset some headwinds out in the future as the rest of the global economy kicks in. We're at record margins. Nobody believes those are sustainable for the long term. However, I think we can go from something at the record level to something that's still pretty robust. 
We see seasonal downturn typically in the fourth quarter, but we've also seen conditions where we can kind of carry through when there's strong enough marketing momentum. And there may be those kind of conditions now. We're particularly focused on high-density polyethylene. And that's still pretty tight in the marketplace. The inventories have not recovered to where CPChem would be comfortable operating. And it's unusual to be there this time of year with hurricane season. We typically want to be a little higher in inventories going into the hurricane season. 
So there's a number of factors that could lead to sustain this momentum into the third quarter and beyond into the fourth quarter. And then we see the world economy kicking in. About the same time, additional capacity is coming on, say, first half of next year. So there's some good fundamentals out there. And I think it's still got some legs based on the demand that will come to bear as the world economy fully recovers from COVID."

I think when you look back over the last quarter, I think there were plenty of market signals there for us to run at the utilization rates we're at. There's a lot of moving parts, in particular, the cost of RINs that just continue to increase throughout the quarter. And we take a pretty good hit in Refining for the full cost of those prints. I think we would have all expected maybe on a global basis, Europe and Asia demand ticked back a little better than it did. I think the margins -- the RIN adjusted margins that we saw in the second quarter really across our system are very representative of a global market. 
So until we start seeing recovery, particularly in Europe because we seem to see products flowing out of Europe into North America and South America, we won't really see RINs get back to where we would like to see. And I think the second piece for us, in particular, is our kit more geared towards heavy crudes making diesel. And certainly for the second quarter, it was a gasoline-driven market without much differential on heavy crude. We've seen those widen out here now in July to a much more respectable level. So we think it's headed in the right direction. But I think all of that added up to being challenged in the second quarter to turn a 90% type utilization number into a profit."

We expect distillate cracks to perform as we get toward wintertime. 
So all in all, I think we've also seen actually markets overseas come back. We have marketing in Europe. And we've seen Europe, Germany, where we market 90% to 95% of demand. Austria, where we market, 100% of demand. So we've seen those markets come back as well. So as Bob said, if the overseas markets start to come back, that will help the U.S. cracks, and we should see some profitability in Q3."

One, internally, right, we expected tough operating conditions for a good part of this year. Recovery has been slower than we expected, but we went into this year, trying to reduce some of our heavy maintenance expenses and adjusting turnarounds and all that. And so the guidance Kevin just gave right for the third quarter is fairly light for us. So I think that helps heading into the third quarter profitability. You can translate that as we're available to run. So if the cracks are there, we're going to be able to run pretty hard in the third quarter and make money. 
Around the advantage 66 program that we laid out, right, so a lot of that is built around margin enhancement, margin improvement. So I would sell -- I think we ran pretty well in the second quarter, and we're using all those tools that are in our toolkit. The value chain optimization activities that went on in the second quarter were pretty robust. We did a lot of things that we haven't done before or needed to do before, such as we ran a lot of resid down into our Sweeny refinery, where typically, we'd be running Maya or some of the heavy Canadians. The profitability really wasn't there. And so optimizing around high sulfur resids into our system. It's just one example about where we're kind of running the circuits. 
We're pretty happy with the results we're seeing on the operating front. A lot of our initiatives in Refining are around being able to operate well, operate better, operate safer with the smaller environmental footprint, and we're seeing value come out of all of those initiatives. They don't necessarily translate directly to the bottom line where you can see them, but over time, they're paying dividends."

During the quarter, we -- those differentials we were not getting -- seeing the value for some of those premium products that often can be a benefit to us in the quarter. So that's one that can move around and come back to the other direction. And then the other component that's also in there, again, it can go both directions, it is inventory impacts.

There's no question. There's been a lot of stress. I put on a lot of companies in our industry. 
But I think we're constructive, particularly as we come in the back half of the year around demand. This has been a story of vaccinations, efficiency, lockdowns and people trying to get back to someone to normal, and that all translates strictly into the demand that we see for our products. And there's still a question, I think the U.S. is probably led in terms of demand recovery through this cycle. And so we've seen the impacts of Europe coming to the U.S. We've seen the impacts of not being able to export as much as we'd like to, to South America and places. 
And so I think as the world returns to normal, we've got a good shot at getting back to something that looks more like a mid-cycle. I think we said on the last call, we really need to see that 3:2:1 crack on a RIN adjusted basis get back to about $12.

There's another $350 million or thereabouts, but we don't expect the remainder to be a 2021 cash item that will roll into next year. So for a variety of reasons, that's not going to be cash this year, although it still will realize itself over time for us on that. 
And then in terms of dividend growth, I think we go back to the earlier comments around as cash generation recovers to something around about mid-cycle, and we're in a position to pay down debt, we're making progress on paying down debt, we've got sort of clear line of sight to our ability to continue to do that and get the balance sheet back to where we want it to be, then we should feel comfortable on some of the other capital allocation priorities and increasing the dividend is one of those. 
So I think it's a little bit of a long-winded way of saying we don't need to get to all we want to get through on the balance sheet before we make a decision on the dividend. We just need to be very comfortable that the structure is there, the cash generation is there. We're making the progress we need to make, and therefore we'll be able to signal that in terms of our confidence to shareholders with the dividend."

But we have the fractionator 2 and fractionator 3 come on stream and actually at the full operation, which probably should least contribute $30 million, $40 million a quarter in the EBITDA, if not more. So trying to reconcile that if the market conditions really change that much or will that get that much worse because NGL price is actually very good in the second quarter? So maybe that someone can help us on that. 
The second question would be just a real quick one. On the renewable, the full plant conversion, just want to see if there's a permit status that you can provide? And also that the last couple of years, you guys have been trying to rebrand the work process and go for digitization. And so just wanted to see if you can give an update on where we are on that? Is that pretty much done with what you guys aim a couple of years ago? I think at the time that the cost savings target was pretty high, but with the pandemic, I mean everything gets can all get messed up. So it's very difficult to reconcile.

The first thing I would say is in 2019, I wish we were back in that macro. That was a good time with regard to the overall supply/demand fundamentals. Global demand was where you wanted it to be on really all of our Midstream products, whether it's crude products and NGLs. So fundamentally, there are big changes in the market. 
But when you look specifically at 2021, let me just highlight a couple things for you there that are -- have reared their head. The biggest one that's had the biggest impact is winter storm Uri. When you look at Uri, it impacted our frac significantly down there and -- mainly not from the standpoint of damaging the units or any issues there. Even though we did have some costs with the units, that was on utilities. Our utility bill was significant.
So from that standpoint, and that's going to be hard to call back for the rest of this year. So on a positive note, I'd just tell you, structurally, we like the NGL business. Demand has been very robust to support chemicals growth, both locally and globally. NGL production is ramping up. We still see about 1 million barrels in rejection at this point in time. But overall, demand is really good in that space. Our LPG exports have been in a record clip.
So overall, the fundamentals feel good that it was a big cost hit as well as lost production hit that we had initially in 1Q, which really on a year-to-date basis stays with us. The last thing I'd just cover in Q2, the overall structure in NGLs has jumped up significantly, as you probably are well aware, propanes, butanes and ethane. We're at about $0.86, $0.87 on a gallon basis for NGL on a composite. In 2019, it was $0.37. So it's gone up. And with that, we've seen an impact on some mark-to-market we have on some of our inventory. So that's there. That usually turns into a timing issue. But just nonetheless, that shows up in the results in 2Q."

We're essentially done writing the permit. It's in review right now internally with the county, and we would expect them to probably sometime this month release the permit to begin the public comment period.
So that would be pretty much right on our time line, maybe a little bit ahead. And so far, it's been a good cooperative process with the regulators and their permit writers. So we're encouraged and pretty happy where we are. We continue to outreach with all the other stakeholders in Contra Costa County and Northern California, that make sure everybody understands what that project is going to do for the Bay Area and for California in general.

So we've had good optimization opportunities around reduced utilization in our refineries and our ability to get down as low as we did and to make jet go away and all those I think we're much easier because of some of the efforts we had. 
The second piece I would say is at the height of COVID when we had the social distance and we had to use alternative work approaches and everything, our early jump into digitalization allowed our people to get a lot more done without human contact and really was a dividend to us upfront in our ability to keep supporting the operators who were on the units, while minimizing contact with the outside world. 
And then third piece is we were able to hold the line on costs quite well throughout last year. And in fact, we saw cost reductions in many of kind of our bigger cost items, caps and [ kims ] and those sorts of things that are a big piece of our operating budget. We applied some of the learnings that we got through A66 to those. And I think we got sustainable longer term price reductions there that will continue to pay out throughout this year.

It's weakened about $2.5 over the past couple of quarters. And when that weakens, so does the hardest WCS differential, you have to have an to have an arm get the barrels to the Gulf Coast. 
And one of the reasons the Gulf Coast is weakening is because low exports means that you have to have a weaker differential on WCS to get that WCS exported out of the U.S. So as you said, Theresa, we have Enbridge coming online in next quarter, quarter 4, we would think that, that would firm up differentials a bit. But don't forget in the wintertime, we add diluent to crude, and that also increases the volume of crude that has to move.

So I think that's what allows us to be able to have a unique position of building a project that's going to be at an installed cost of about $1 a gallon, which you're right, is lower than anybody else, but it is because if there was a refinery that was custom built to be able to be converted to renewable feedstocks Rodeo it's a -- since it's very, very unusual to have 2 hydrocrackers and excess hydrogen capacity on site between our own hydrogen plant and that of our third-party supplier that is built at the site.

CPChem ran at 102% of their capacity in the second quarter, so they really delivered from an operational excellence perspective. But much of that went into rebuilding those inventories. So even though they had such a strong quarter, a lot of those -- a lot of that production went into inventory, and they're still not where they would comfortably be heading into a hurricane season. They like to be prepared for that. They don't plan to have a hurricane, but they're prepared if there are hurricanes to impact that. So I think that's where you're seeing the tightness.

It seems like marketing earnings increased a decent amount this quarter and refining is still kind of in the doldrums in part due to RINs. And I understand there's some accounting and value split between the RIN benefit in marketing versus the cost in refining. So can you just talk about maybe how RINs benefited marketing this quarter and how much of your RIN exposure is being minimized by blending and pass through to consumers?

It's a cost that refining pays and that the crack has passed on the -- the value of the crack is passed on to the consumer who pays for the RIN at the pump. So marketing doesn't see any benefit from the RINs per se. There may be some leakage in that chain, but Marketing doesn't really see any benefit. 
Marketing did have a really very strong quarter in Q2. And a large part of that was we had kind of the right portfolio in the right places. We saw demand jump up in March and then again in June. We have a strong presence in the Rockies and in the Mid-Con, where there were less COVID lockdowns and more movement. We added, as you know, retail in late '19 and also in '20 on the West Coast, and that retail has done better than premise. We also added retail this year in the Mid-Con and Rockies and that retails in better in premise. 
And finally, I'd add how we've been reimaging the stores for the past 3 years. We're up to 85% of the stores reimaged, and we've seen the 2% to 3% jump in volumes and margins in those stores as well. So we've done a lot of things to help our portfolios in the right spots. And so I think that's where we saw the value in marketing in Q2."

We still have a project to get the rail infrastructure to finish, so that we can supply 9,000 barrels a day to make to 8,000 barrels a day of renewable diesel. So we're learning how the catalyst reacts and what the actual kinetics are around running bean oil. It's a little bit of a learning for the ultimate project of converting the refinery. And these are really -- these projects really are 2 very separate things in that there was no real work to do to convert 250 to bean oil, it was a matter of changing the catalyst that a regular scheduled turnaround and then being able to run it. 
So it's helpful. I think the bigger picture there is it's very helpful to our commercial organization to learn how to source renewable feedstocks, so logistics are getting them there, some of the peculiar areas around transporting it. Those sorts of things all set us up to be a lot more nimble and ready for when we go from 8,000 barrels a day to 50,000 barrels a day with the renewable conversion.

We returned $394 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. Since we formed as a company, we've returned over $28 billion to shareholders.

Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone on the call for joining us today. Continued improved demand across CPChem's product lines and resilient operating recovery from the first quarter winter storms contributed record quarterly earnings in our Chemicals segment. Marketing and Specialties reported strong results as demand increased in many of our key domestic regions. Our Midstream segment recovered well from the first quarter winter storms to report solid results. 
Headwinds continued in our Refining segment as RIN adjusted refined product crack only improved modestly and historically low market capture contributed to continued losses. As more people across the globe are vaccinated, we expect continued economic recovery and further improvement in global refined product demand. In addition, permanent refinery closure announcements have increased to over 3.7 million barrels per day globally with additional closure announcements expected.
In Midstream, Phillips 66 Partners continued construction of the C2G Pipeline. The project is backed by long-term commitments and is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of this year. At the Sweeny Hub, we recently resumed construction of Frac 4, which will add 150,000 barrels per day of capacity. Upon completion, which is expected in the fourth quarter of 2022, total Sweeny Hub fractionation capacity will increase to 550,000 barrels per day. The fracs are all supported by long-term commitments. 
CPChem continues to develop 2 world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar. We expect the final investment decision for the U.S. Gulf Coast project next year. The Ras Laffan petrochemical project is progressing with front-end engineering and design as planned. Both projects are in partnership with Qatar Petroleum. In addition, CPChem began construction of its second world scale unit to produce 1-hexene, utilizing CPChem's proprietary technology. 1-hexene is used for high-performance polyethylene manufacturing and is common in a variety of everyday products, including packaging for food, consumer products and pharmaceuticals. The unit located in Old Ocean, Texas will have a capacity of 266,000 metric tons per year and is expected to start up in 2023. 
In May, CPChem was recognized by the Plastic Industry Association for being among the top 2021 industry innovators in sustainability. The award recognizes CPChem's launch of Marlex, a new circular polyethylene, which uses advanced recycling technology to convert plastic waste into high-quality raw materials. 
We continue to advance our Rodeo Renewed project at the San Francisco refinery. In July, we reached full production rates of 8,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel from the hydrotreater conversion. Subject to permitting and approvals, full conversion of the facility is expected in early 2024. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel production capacity. The conversion will reduce emissions from the facility and produce lower carbon transportation fuels. Rodeo, combined with our portfolio of other renewable fuels projects has the potential to supply 1 billion gallons of renewable fuels per year. 
In Marketing, we're converting 600 branded retail sites in California to sell renewable diesel produced by the Rodeo facility. In Switzerland, our Coop retail joint venture continues to add hydrogen fueling stations. Through our joint venture, we're exploring hydrogen as a fuel option for heavy-duty vehicles to support European low-carbon goals and growing demand for sustainable fuels. We're moving forward and preparing for the future, while maintaining our focus on safe, reliable operations and attractive shareholder returns.

Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our second quarter results. We reported earnings of $296 million. Excluding special items, we had adjusted earnings of $329 million or $0.74 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $1.7 billion, including a working capital benefit of $833 million and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $612 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $380 million, including $179 million for growth projects. We paid $394 million in dividends. 
Moving to Slide 5. This slide shows the change in adjusted results from the first quarter to the second quarter, an increase of $838 million. Pretax income improved across all segments, with the largest contribution from Chemicals. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 19%. 
Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. Second quarter adjusted pretax income was $316 million, an increase of $40 million from the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $224 million, up $18 million from the previous quarter. The increase was due to improved volumes from higher refinery utilization, partially offset by higher costs due to the timing of maintenance and asset integrity work. 
NGL and other adjusted pretax income was $83 million. The $47 million increase from the prior quarter was mainly due to lower operating costs and higher volumes, reflecting recovery from the winter storms. The Sweeny fractionation complex averaged 380,000 barrels per day and the Freeport LPG export facility loaded a record 42 cargoes in the second quarter. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $9 million, was down $25 million from the previous quarter, mainly due to lower mark-to-market hedging results from higher natural gas and NGL prices. 
Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. Second quarter adjusted pretax income was $657 million, up $473 million from the first quarter. This is the highest quarterly earnings for Chemicals since the joint venture was formed in 2000. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pretax income was $593 million. The $419 million increase from the previous quarter was driven by strong demand, tight supplies and recovery from the winter storms that contributed to higher margins and lower utility costs. 
The industry chain margin increased over $0.17 per pound to a record $0.62 per pound. Global O&P utilization was 102% for the quarter. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S increased $55 million. The increase primarily reflects improved margins due to tight industry supplies following the winter storms as well as lower turnaround costs. During the second quarter, we received $322 million in cash distributions from CPChem. 
Turning to Refining on Slide 8. Refining second quarter adjusted pretax loss was $706 million, an improvement of $320 million from the first quarter. The improvement was driven by lower utility and turnaround costs and higher volumes. This was partially offset by lower realized margins. Improved market crack spreads were more than offset by higher RIN costs, lower electricity sales in the Texas market, decreased secondary product margins, lower clean product differentials and inventory impacts. Pretax turnaround costs were $118 million, down from $192 million in the prior quarter. Crude utilization was 88% compared with 74% last quarter. The second quarter clean product yield was 82%. 
Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the second quarter was $17.76 per barrel compared to $13.23 per barrel in the first quarter. Realized margin was $3.92 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 22%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 33%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. Our refineries are more heavily weighted toward distillate production than the market indicator. During the quarter, the gasoline crack improved $5.68 per barrel, while the distillate crack increased $2.20 per barrel. 
Losses from secondary products of $2.38 per barrel were $1.09 per barrel higher than the previous quarter as crude prices strengthened. These stock costs improved $0.36 per barrel compared to the prior quarter. The other category reduced realized margins by $7.84 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, new product realizations and inventory impacts.
Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted second quarter pretax income was $479 million compared with $290 million in the prior quarter. Marketing and other increased $181 million due to higher domestic margins and volumes, reflecting strong demand in key markets. Refined product exports in the second quarter were 216,000 barrels per day. Specialties generated second quarter adjusted pretax income of $87 million, up from $79 million in the prior quarter.
Slide 11 shows the change in cash for the quarter. We started the quarter with a $1.4 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $1.7 billion. This included a working capital benefit of $833 million. In June, we received a $1.1 billion U.S. federal income tax refund, which is reflected in working capital. Cash from operations, excluding working capital, was $910 million, which more than covered $380 million of capital spend and $394 million for the dividend. The other category includes a $90 million loan to our WRB joint venture. Our ending cash balance was $2.2 billion. 
This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the third quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, crude utilization will be adjusted according to market conditions. In July, utilization averaged around 98%. We expect third quarter pretax turnaround expenses to be between $120 million and $150 million. We anticipate third quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $240 million and $250 million pretax. 
Now we will open the line for questions."

The -- we're still consistent on our mid-cycle margin projection. And of course, we're well above that today. And as we look out into the third quarter, we're seeing the strength continue in the third quarter. We've got cost increases on the table that are being negotiated as we speak. Even if things went forward just as they are today, we're still at record margins. And we think that, that can carry into third quarter. 
There's a lot of strength in the marketplace, particularly in North America and in Europe. Asia is still kind of lagging, but starting to perk up a little bit. So the real story is the fundamental economic resurgence in the U.S., in North America and Europe. And we believe that there's some upside that will offset some headwinds out in the future as the rest of the global economy kicks in. We're at record margins. Nobody believes those are sustainable for the long term. However, I think we can go from something at the record level to something that's still pretty robust. 
We see seasonal downturn typically in the fourth quarter, but we've also seen conditions where we can kind of carry through when there's strong enough marketing momentum. And there may be those kind of conditions now. We're particularly focused on high-density polyethylene. And that's still pretty tight in the marketplace. The inventories have not recovered to where CPChem would be comfortable operating. And it's unusual to be there this time of year with hurricane season. We typically want to be a little higher in inventories going into the hurricane season. 
So there's a number of factors that could lead to sustain this momentum into the third quarter and beyond into the fourth quarter. And then we see the world economy kicking in. About the same time, additional capacity is coming on, say, first half of next year. So there's some good fundamentals out there. And I think it's still got some legs based on the demand that will come to bear as the world economy fully recovers from COVID."

I think when you look back over the last quarter, I think there were plenty of market signals there for us to run at the utilization rates we're at. There's a lot of moving parts, in particular, the cost of RINs that just continue to increase throughout the quarter. And we take a pretty good hit in Refining for the full cost of those prints. I think we would have all expected maybe on a global basis, Europe and Asia demand ticked back a little better than it did. I think the margins -- the RIN adjusted margins that we saw in the second quarter really across our system are very representative of a global market. 
So until we start seeing recovery, particularly in Europe because we seem to see products flowing out of Europe into North America and South America, we won't really see RINs get back to where we would like to see. And I think the second piece for us, in particular, is our kit more geared towards heavy crudes making diesel. And certainly for the second quarter, it was a gasoline-driven market without much differential on heavy crude. We've seen those widen out here now in July to a much more respectable level. So we think it's headed in the right direction. But I think all of that added up to being challenged in the second quarter to turn a 90% type utilization number into a profit."

We expect distillate cracks to perform as we get toward wintertime. 
So all in all, I think we've also seen actually markets overseas come back. We have marketing in Europe. And we've seen Europe, Germany, where we market 90% to 95% of demand. Austria, where we market, 100% of demand. So we've seen those markets come back as well. So as Bob said, if the overseas markets start to come back, that will help the U.S. cracks, and we should see some profitability in Q3."

One, internally, right, we expected tough operating conditions for a good part of this year. Recovery has been slower than we expected, but we went into this year, trying to reduce some of our heavy maintenance expenses and adjusting turnarounds and all that. And so the guidance Kevin just gave right for the third quarter is fairly light for us. So I think that helps heading into the third quarter profitability. You can translate that as we're available to run. So if the cracks are there, we're going to be able to run pretty hard in the third quarter and make money. 
Around the advantage 66 program that we laid out, right, so a lot of that is built around margin enhancement, margin improvement. So I would sell -- I think we ran pretty well in the second quarter, and we're using all those tools that are in our toolkit. The value chain optimization activities that went on in the second quarter were pretty robust. We did a lot of things that we haven't done before or needed to do before, such as we ran a lot of resid down into our Sweeny refinery, where typically, we'd be running Maya or some of the heavy Canadians. The profitability really wasn't there. And so optimizing around high sulfur resids into our system. It's just one example about where we're kind of running the circuits. 
We're pretty happy with the results we're seeing on the operating front. A lot of our initiatives in Refining are around being able to operate well, operate better, operate safer with the smaller environmental footprint, and we're seeing value come out of all of those initiatives. They don't necessarily translate directly to the bottom line where you can see them, but over time, they're paying dividends."

Obviously, RIN costs were particularly high during the quarter. Product differentials, which is the difference between the market indicator and actual product realizations, that one can move around and go both directions on us. 
During the quarter, we -- those differentials we were not getting -- seeing the value for some of those premium products that often can be a benefit to us in the quarter. So that's one that can move around and come back to the other direction. And then the other component that's also in there, again, it can go both directions, it is inventory impacts.

So it's been -- if you go back -- all the way back to the first quarter of 2020, that's the last time we actually made money as a company. So it's been a long haul as we've kind of come through this. There's no question. There's been a lot of stress. I put on a lot of companies in our industry. 
But I think we're constructive, particularly as we come in the back half of the year around demand. This has been a story of vaccinations, efficiency, lockdowns and people trying to get back to someone to normal, and that all translates strictly into the demand that we see for our products. And there's still a question, I think the U.S. is probably led in terms of demand recovery through this cycle. And so we've seen the impacts of Europe coming to the U.S. We've seen the impacts of not being able to export as much as we'd like to, to South America and places. 
And so I think as the world returns to normal, we've got a good shot at getting back to something that looks more like a mid-cycle. I think we said on the last call, we really need to see that 3:2:1 crack on a RIN adjusted basis get back to about $12.

And then in terms of dividend growth, I think we go back to the earlier comments around as cash generation recovers to something around about mid-cycle, and we're in a position to pay down debt, we're making progress on paying down debt, we've got sort of clear line of sight to our ability to continue to do that and get the balance sheet back to where we want it to be, then we should feel comfortable on some of the other capital allocation priorities and increasing the dividend is one of those. 
So I think it's a little bit of a long-winded way of saying we don't need to get to all we want to get through on the balance sheet before we make a decision on the dividend.

Even though we did have some costs with the units, that was on utilities. Our utility bill was significant.
So from that standpoint, and that's going to be hard to call back for the rest of this year. So on a positive note, I'd just tell you, structurally, we like the NGL business. Demand has been very robust to support chemicals growth, both locally and globally. NGL production is ramping up. We still see about 1 million barrels in rejection at this point in time. But overall, demand is really good in that space. Our LPG exports have been in a record clip.
So overall, the fundamentals feel good that it was a big cost hit as well as lost production hit that we had initially in 1Q, which really on a year-to-date basis stays with us. The last thing I'd just cover in Q2, the overall structure in NGLs has jumped up significantly, as you probably are well aware, propanes, butanes and ethane. We're at about $0.86, $0.87 on a gallon basis for NGL on a composite. In 2019, it was $0.37. So it's gone up. And with that, we've seen an impact on some mark-to-market we have on some of our inventory. So that's there. That usually turns into a timing issue. But just nonetheless, that shows up in the results in 2Q."

I think your second question was around the permitting status that Rodeo Renewed and the conversion out there of the Refinery to run in renewable fuel. So we continue to develop the environmental impact statement with Contra Costa County. I would characterize that has gone about as well as it could, better than we expected. We're essentially done writing the permit. It's in review right now internally with the county, and we would expect them to probably sometime this month release the permit to begin the public comment period.
So that would be pretty much right on our time line, maybe a little bit ahead. And so far, it's been a good cooperative process with the regulators and their permit writers. So we're encouraged and pretty happy where we are. We continue to outreach with all the other stakeholders in Contra Costa County and Northern California, that make sure everybody understands what that project is going to do for the Bay Area and for California in general. So far, so good."

So we've had good optimization opportunities around reduced utilization in our refineries and our ability to get down as low as we did and to make jet go away and all those I think we're much easier because of some of the efforts we had. 
The second piece I would say is at the height of COVID when we had the social distance and we had to use alternative work approaches and everything, our early jump into digitalization allowed our people to get a lot more done without human contact and really was a dividend to us upfront in our ability to keep supporting the operators who were on the units, while minimizing contact with the outside world. 
And then third piece is we were able to hold the line on costs quite well throughout last year. And in fact, we saw cost reductions in many of kind of our bigger cost items, caps and [ kims ] and those sorts of things that are a big piece of our operating budget. We applied some of the learnings that we got through A66 to those. And I think we got sustainable longer term price reductions there that will continue to pay out throughout this year.

It's weakened about $2.5 over the past couple of quarters. And when that weakens, so does the hardest WCS differential, you have to have an to have an arm get the barrels to the Gulf Coast. 
And one of the reasons the Gulf Coast is weakening is because low exports means that you have to have a weaker differential on WCS to get that WCS exported out of the U.S. So as you said, Theresa, we have Enbridge coming online in next quarter, quarter 4, we would think that, that would firm up differentials a bit. But don't forget in the wintertime, we add diluent to crude, and that also increases the volume of crude that has to move. So I view, our forecast is that you'll see differentials somewhere between $12.5 and $13.5 off of WTI going forward."

So I think that's what allows us to be able to have a unique position of building a project that's going to be at an installed cost of about $1 a gallon, which you're right, is lower than anybody else, but it is because if there was a refinery that was custom built to be able to be converted to renewable feedstocks Rodeo it's a -- since it's very, very unusual to have 2 hydrocrackers and excess hydrogen capacity on site between our own hydrogen plant and that of our third-party supplier that is built at the site.

CPChem ran at 102% of their capacity in the second quarter, so they really delivered from an operational excellence perspective. But much of that went into rebuilding those inventories. So even though they had such a strong quarter, a lot of those -- a lot of that production went into inventory, and they're still not where they would comfortably be heading into a hurricane season. They like to be prepared for that. They don't plan to have a hurricane, but they're prepared if there are hurricanes to impact that. So I think that's where you're seeing the tightness.

So as we came out of turnaround and started up the Rodeo hydrotreater and renewable service, actually came up that ran really well. We had almost a full quarter running at low rates. We still have a project to get the rail infrastructure to finish, so that we can supply 9,000 barrels a day to make to 8,000 barrels a day of renewable diesel. So we're learning how the catalyst reacts and what the actual kinetics are around running bean oil. It's a little bit of a learning for the ultimate project of converting the refinery. And these are really -- these projects really are 2 very separate things in that there was no real work to do to convert 250 to bean oil, it was a matter of changing the catalyst that a regular scheduled turnaround and then being able to run it. 
So it's helpful. I think the bigger picture there is it's very helpful to our commercial organization to learn how to source renewable feedstocks, so logistics are getting them there, some of the peculiar areas around transporting it. Those sorts of things all set us up to be a lot more nimble and ready for when we go from 8,000 barrels a day to 50,000 barrels a day with the renewable conversion. I think probably the best thing to come out of it is we did not see anything that made us stop and think about the project to convert the rest of the refinery that we needed to go back and think about our design, pretty much operating as expected."

In the third quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. We generated operating cash flow of $2.2 billion, which meaningfully exceeded our capital spending and dividends during the quarter. We returned $394 million to shareholders through dividends, and in October, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.92 per share. We believe in a secure, competitive and growing dividend. Since we formed as a company, we've returned approximately $29 billion to shareholders and we remain committed to disciplined capital allocation. 
We're seeing signs of sustainable cash generation improvement. We've made good progress on debt repayment, reducing our debt balance by $1 billion so far this year. We're on a path to pre-pandemic level debt, strengthening our balance sheet and supporting our strong investment-grade credit ratings. 
Earlier this week, we announced an agreement to acquire all of the publicly held units of Phillips 66 Partners. The all-equity transaction simplifies our corporate structure and positions us to drive greater value for both Phillips 66 shareholders and Phillips 66 Partners unitholders. We continue to advance the company-wide transformation efforts that we began in 2019. We believe that strengthening our cost position is necessary for long-term competitiveness. We recently initiated an effort to identify opportunities to significantly reduce cost across our portfolio. We're in the process of scoping these reductions and look forward to updating you early next year on our progress. 
Recently, we announced greenhouse gas targets to reduce the carbon emissions intensity from our operations by 2030. Our targets demonstrate our commitment to sustainability and to meeting the world's energy needs today and in the future.

In Refining, we captured a meaningful improvement in realized margins. Midstream had strong earnings in the quarter. In Chemicals, the Olefins and Polyolefins business reported record quarterly earnings, and Marketing and Specialties had its second best quarter ever. 
In Midstream, we continued to advance frac forward the Sweeny Hub with construction approximately 1/3 complete and about 70% of the capital already spent. Additionally, we recently completed construction of Phillips 66 Partners' C2G pipeline. CPChem continues to pursue development of 2 world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar. In addition, CPChem is expanding its alpha-olefins business with a world-scale unit to produce on 1-hexene. 
The Alliance Refinery sustained significant impacts from Hurricane Ida and will remain shut down through the end of this year. We continue to assess future strategic options for the refinery. We continue to progress Rodeo Renewed, which is expected to be completed in early 2024, subject to permitting and approvals. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel production capacity. The conversion will reduce emissions from the facility and produce lower carbon transportation fuels. 
In Marketing, we're converting 600 branded retail sites in California to sell renewable diesel produced by the Rodeo facility. Our Emerging Energy Group is advancing opportunities in renewable fuels, batteries, carbon capture and hydrogen. With our recent investment in NOVONIX, we're expanding our presence in the battery value chain. Additionally, we recently announced a collaboration with Plug Power to identify and advance green hydrogen opportunities. 
We'll continue to focus on lower carbon initiatives that generate strong returns. We're excited about our participation in this dynamic energy transition, and combined with our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and strong returns, we're well positioned for the future. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results."

Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our third quarter results. We reported earnings of $402 million. Special items during the quarter amounted to an after-tax loss of $1 billion, which was largely comprised of an impairment of the Alliance Refinery. Excluding special items, we had adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $3.18 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $2.2 billion, including a working capital benefit of $776 million and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $905 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $552 million. $311 million was for growth projects, including a $150 million investment in NOVONIX. We paid $394 million in dividends. 
Moving to Slide 5. This slide shows the change in adjusted results from the second quarter to the third quarter, an increase of $1.1 billion with a substantial improvement in Refining and continued strong contributions from Midstream, Chemicals, and Marketing and Specialties. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 16%. 
Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. Third quarter adjusted pretax income was $642 million, an increase of $326 million from the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $254 million, up $30 million from the prior quarter. The increase was driven by higher equity earnings from the Bakken and Gray Oak Pipelines. NGL and Other adjusted pretax income was $357 million compared with $83 million in the second quarter. The increase was primarily due to a $224 million unrealized investment gain related to NOVONIX as well as inventory impacts. 
In September, we acquired a 16% interest in NOVONIX. Our investment will be mark-to-market at the end of each reporting period. The Sweeny fractionation complex averaged a record 383,000 barrels per day, and the Freeport LPG export facility loaded 41 cargoes in the third quarter. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $31 million was up $22 million from the previous quarter, mainly due to improved margins and hedging impacts. 
Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. We delivered another strong quarter in Chemicals with adjusted pretax income of $634 million, down $23 million from the second quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins had record adjusted pretax income of $613 million. The $20 million increase from the previous quarter was primarily due to higher polyethylene sales volumes, driven by continued strong demand, partially offset by higher utility costs. Global O&P utilization was 102% for the quarter. 
Adjusted pretax income for SA&S decreased $45 million compared to the second quarter, driven by lower margins, which began to normalize following tight market conditions. During the third quarter, we received $632 million in cash distributions from CPChem. 
Turning to Refining on Slide 8. Refining third quarter adjusted pretax income was $184 million, an improvement of $890 million from the second quarter, driven by higher realized margins across all regions. Realized margins for the quarter increased by 119% to $8.57 per barrel, primarily due to higher market crack spreads, lower RIN costs and improved product differentials. Pretax turnaround costs were $81 million, down from [ $118 million ] in the prior quarter. 
Crude utilization was 86% compared with 88% in the second quarter. Lower utilization reflects downtime at the Alliance Refinery, which was safely shut down on August 28 in advance of Hurricane Ida. The third quarter clean product yield was 84%, up 2% from last quarter, supported by improved FCC operations. 
Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:1 market crack for the third quarter was $19.44 per barrel compared to $17.76 per barrel in the second quarter. Realized margin was $8.57 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 44%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 22%. Market capture was impacted by the configuration of our refineries. Our refineries are more heavily weighted toward distillate production than the market indicator. During the quarter, the distillate crack increased $1.55 per barrel and the gasoline crack improved $1.92 per barrel. 
Losses from secondary products of $1.98 per barrel improved $0.40 per barrel from the previous quarter as NGL prices strengthened. Our fleet advantage of $0.01 per barrel declined by $0.26 per barrel from the prior quarter. The Other category reduced realized margins by $5.01 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, clean product realizations and inventory impacts. 
Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted third quarter pretax income was $547 million compared with $479 million in the prior quarter. Our Marketing business realized continued strong margins and saw increasing demand for products. Marketing and Other increased $62 million from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to higher international margins and volumes, driven by the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. 
Refined product exports in the third quarter were 209,000 barrels per day. Specialties generated third quarter adjusted pretax income of $93 million, up from $87 million in the prior quarter, largely due to improved oil margins. 
On Slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pretax costs of $230 million, an improvement of [ $14 million ] from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to lower costs related to the timing of environmental and employee-related expenses, partially offset by higher net interest expense. 
Slide 12 shows the change in cash for the quarter. We started the quarter with a $2.2 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $2.2 billion. Excluding a working capital benefit of $776 million, our cash from operations was $1.4 billion, which covered $552 million of capital spend, $394 million for the dividend and $500 million of early debt repayment. Our ending cash balance was $2.9 billion. 
This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the fourth quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the fourth quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low 80s. We expect the Alliance Refinery to remain shut down for the full quarter. We expect fourth quarter pretax turnaround expenses to be between $110 million and $140 million. We anticipate fourth quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $240 million and $250 million pretax. Now we will open the line for questions."

We did a nice job in helping the Midstream business. I said the market just doesn't value kind of the drop-down growth-fueled MLPs at this point in time. Consider trading in a 9% yield. We see institutional ownership drop from the 90s into the low 70s. And then from our perspective, cost of capital is real [indiscernible] so it doesn't really provide an attractive view. 
[Audio Gap]
And then I will also say it [indiscernible] provide a clear line of sight to valuation of our Midstream business from some of the spaces, and I'm not certain that really applies today. So you think about these are high-quality Midstream assets. We know them really well. We're able to acquire them for essentially a 9-ish multiple and trade it up into a 10x multiple, which should be from a sum of the parts basis. 
And then I think as we think about the future of Midstream and potential consolidation in Midstream, I think rolling up the PSXP gives us more degrees of freedom to create value with those assets. For a long time, a lot of the strength in [indiscernible] was the MLP was the diversity of the assets. You think about crude oil pipelines and terminals and product pipelines and NGL assets. And we think that by [indiscernible] being able to take those apart in discrete assets, that we can create more value with those as we move into the future. I don't know, Kevin or Mark, if you want to add on to that, you're certainly welcome to do that."

Yes, thanks for that question, Roger. I think -- so the critical path on the whole project, right, is a land use permit in Costa County, and that's the -- in California, you get the opportunity to apply for lots of permits to build something, but this is the big 1 and the most difficult path through. 
So we've been working it since we announced the project. And I would say overall, it's going really well. The environmental impact statement, that's part of obtaining that land use permit, was released for public comment about the middle of October, so that's a 60-day comment period. So that's when you saw in there that they identified an opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of the project is to make the project smaller. 
We actually took that as a good sign because by law, the planning commission staff has to identify lower-impact alternatives to the project. And the fact that the only thing that was put in there was, well, you could just make it smaller to reduce the environmental impact. Reflected to us that they agreed with us, we had taken kind of every environmental step around reduction of emissions from the plant -- shutting down of the carbon plant, everything we can do to reduce the emissions and the greenhouse gas footprint of the future project, and that's really all that's left. 
We take that as by no means that they are advocating or that anyone will advocate for a smaller project being built there. This is the project that makes sense. It's the 1 that uses the equipment that's on the ground and is very cost efficient to go and convert. So we're in the middle of that public comment period. At some point, the county will start releasing the comments to us and we'll respond to those, and the period will close in kind of mid-December. It will take planning staff probably part of the first quarter to work its way through those and we'll be responsive to those. And we still anticipate getting this thing permitted sometime probably late 1Q, and then that freezes up to go start construction."

[ Frac 4 ] will finish up essentially this year going into next year. So there's no big spend in front of us in Midstream. Obviously, we have the Rodeo Renewed project and we're anxious to get started on that next year. But I think that all fits within the guidance we've kind of consistently given here over the last couple of quarters of $2 billion or less for 2022. 
We actually go to our Board for approval of the capital budget in December time frame. But that's -- in round numbers, that's kind of the numbers that we're looking at for 2022. I think that as certainly cash generation is improving, as you can see the results from this quarter, I think we're probably more optimistic today that we're moving towards more of a mid-cycle earnings profile in our Refining business. Our Marketing and Specialties has been performing really, really strong this whole year. has been really strong this year. Midstream has been really strong this year. 
So as we get Refining back to something approaching more mid-cycle, that creates more optionality around the cash and what we do with the cash. But clearly, we're on a glide slope to pay down debt. We want to get back to that $12 billion pre-pandemic level. And as we've mentioned in the opening comments, we've paid $1 billion down so far this year of that. So we're on a glide slope to do that. 
But I think the real model post for us as we start thinking about capital allocation, that first $1 is always going to go to our dividend or sustaining capital. Next $1 goes to dividend and then we think about debt reduction. And then hopefully, we'll get to a point where we start working share repurchases back in.

You've seen the WCS dips come off. A few reasons why, with some refining problems in the Mid-Con barrels got -- WCS barrels got to the Gulf Coast, weakened the dip and the Canadian dips followed. And also, there were some pipeline issues just this past week in Canada, which also helped weakened the dip. We think that dip will strengthen a bit going forward but we're happy where it is now. 
In terms of Brent TIs, the Cushing inventories are at [ 27 million ] barrels currently. We're getting [indiscernible] when that happens, we need to keep crude in the United States. And the best way to do that is to tighten the WTI/Brent differential. So we think it will stay in the $2 to $3 range going forward.

Well, yes, NOVONIX, yes, we've identified 4 key areas that we want to focus on in renewables to generate strong returns. That's renewables, batteries, hydrogen and carbon capture. So this particular opportunity falls under the battery pillar. And as you noted, we've got a very good feedstock that can be used to generate synthetic graphite to go into anodes. 
And we went through a screening process. As these anode producers are looking at ways to provide shorter supply chain options for those that need their services like those that are building electric vehicles. And NOVONIX rose to the top of that screening process in North America. And we like the team, we like the technologies they were employing. They've got a low carbon intensity technology to produce the synthetic graphite. They're locating in a place where they can get low carbon electricity, and it's a great way for us to move up the value chain in battery manufacturing and supporting the growth in electric vehicles."

And so I think that once we are -- we're already making good progress on debt reduction. And when we're in that position of we're clearly back in a mid-cycle type environment, we're generating mid-cycle cash flow, there's a very clear line of sight to the ability to continue to reduce debt down to the levels we want to get to. We should have more flexibility to start thinking about the other alternatives that we have in terms of use of cash. 
So maybe that's a long-winded way of saying we don't believe we have to get all the way to before we think about alternatives as long as the cash generation is there that we can clearly see our ability to delever, continue to delever and consider some of the alternatives around capital allocation."

Part of that is this drive to use more sweet crude even overseas where people -- where hydrogen is costly so desulfurization is costly, so people want to switch to -- or refiners want to switch to more light crude diet.

The Other category is our most volatile category, and we call it Other because everything that is straightforward is in there. So you've got RIN effects in there, you've got inventory effects in there. We've also got product differential effects in there, so on -- particularly in the Atlantic Basin, when European cracks really disconnect from the Atlantic Coast, we'll see the plus or minus in that category. 
Inventory accounting can move numbers in there quite a bit. And there's a few steady things in there like freight to get our products to market and those sorts of things are pretty steady, but the volatility really comes product dips and that also includes the timing of our realizations for the products we move up Colonial Pipeline to the East Coast. That can be very volatile month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. 
The RINs inventories and then just overall market structure in between the places that we buy and sell our products. It's hard to say that the volatility will slow down. It's kind of always there. The bucket is just outsized right now because of the severe RIN impact that we show in the other category, right? That accounts for almost half of that bucket here over the last couple of quarters. 
On the NGL side, butane blending into gasoline, right? You run a fair amount. We'll want to do it if it's economic. So if NGLs prices run up and it doesn't make sense to put it in the gasoline, we won't. Overall, in Refining, as part of our secondary products, right, we make 4%, 5% NGLs off the refining complexes. So the higher the price for NGLs, the better off we are and lowers that usually negative to our income. So overall, it's -- we store a lot of our own butane every year to bring back and blend it in gasoline. But quite frankly, we'll sell it into the market if that makes more sense."

So we really are a fee-based business the way we're structured. 
Now what we do, do, much like what we do with the refining kit is we have a system we're managing around. So as we are buying and selling barrels to optimize our kit, there are opportunities for us to trade around those assets and capture and equip a couple of the corners in that process. But it's really to manage and optimize our system to make sure our barrels, as we buy them from the wellhead all the way to the point, they end up in the marketplace, That's how we try and position those barrels and we play in that.

But we certainly do believe there's opportunities for us to participate in that. And so a big key piece of that is going to be having a concentration of carbon to capture. I mean, you've got to have areas where there's heavy concentration. You've heard some of the stuff about Houston. And there are other metro areas or industrialized areas where there may be opportunities to do that as well. We certainly think with our assets and our structure and the products and the process that we do, that it does make sense. 
Now the next challenges doesn't make economic sense. So we're going to work both sides of that equation with regard to see what makes sense and what fits.

In the third quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. We generated operating cash flow of $2.2 billion, which meaningfully exceeded our capital spending and dividends during the quarter. We returned $394 million to shareholders through dividends, and in October, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.92 per share. We believe in a secure, competitive and growing dividend. Since we formed as a company, we've returned approximately $29 billion to shareholders and we remain committed to disciplined capital allocation. 
We're seeing signs of sustainable cash generation improvement. We've made good progress on debt repayment, reducing our debt balance by $1 billion so far this year. We're on a path to pre-pandemic level debt, strengthening our balance sheet and supporting our strong investment-grade credit ratings. 
Earlier this week, we announced an agreement to acquire all of the publicly held units of Phillips 66 Partners. The all-equity transaction simplifies our corporate structure and positions us to drive greater value for both Phillips 66 shareholders and Phillips 66 Partners unitholders. We continue to advance the company-wide transformation efforts that we began in 2019. We believe that strengthening our cost position is necessary for long-term competitiveness. 
We recently initiated an effort to identify opportunities to significantly reduce cost across our portfolio. We're in the process of scoping these reductions and look forward to updating you early next year on our progress. 
Recently, we announced greenhouse gas targets to reduce the carbon emissions intensity from our operations by 2030. Our targets demonstrate our commitment to sustainability and to meeting the world's energy needs today and in the future. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark to provide some additional comments."

In Refining, we captured a meaningful improvement in realized margins. Midstream had strong earnings in the quarter. In Chemicals, the Olefins and Polyolefins business reported record quarterly earnings, and Marketing and Specialties had its second best quarter ever. 
In Midstream, we continued to advance frac forward the Sweeny Hub with construction approximately 1/3 complete and about 70% of the capital already spent. Additionally, we recently completed construction of Phillips 66 Partners' C2G Pipeline. CPChem continues to pursue development of 2 world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar. In addition, CPChem is expanding its alpha-olefins business with a world-scale unit to produce on 1-hexene. 
The Alliance Refinery sustained significant impacts from Hurricane Ida and will remain shut down through the end of this year. We continue to assess future strategic options for the refinery. We continue to progress Rodeo Renewed, which is expected to be completed in early 2024, subject to permitting and approvals. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel production capacity. The conversion will reduce emissions from the facility and produce lower carbon transportation fuels. 
In Marketing, we're converting 600 branded retail sites in California to sell renewable diesel produced by the Rodeo facility. Our Emerging Energy Group is advancing opportunities in renewable fuels, batteries, carbon capture and hydrogen. With our recent investment in NOVONIX, we're expanding our presence in the battery value chain. Additionally, we recently announced a collaboration with Plug Power to identify and advance green hydrogen opportunities. 
We'll continue to focus on lower carbon initiatives that generate strong returns. We're excited about our participation in this dynamic energy transition, and combined with our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and strong returns, we're well positioned for the future. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results."

Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our third quarter results. We reported earnings of $402 million. Special items during the quarter amounted to an after-tax loss of $1 billion, which was largely comprised of an impairment of the Alliance Refinery. Excluding special items, we had adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $3.18 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $2.2 billion, including a working capital benefit of $776 million and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $905 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $552 million. $311 million was for growth projects, including a $150 million investment in NOVONIX. We paid $394 million in dividends. 
Moving to Slide 5. This slide shows the change in adjusted results from the second quarter to the third quarter, an increase of $1.1 billion with a substantial improvement in Refining and continued strong contributions from Midstream, Chemicals and Marketing and Specialties. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 16%. 
Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. Third quarter adjusted pretax income was $642 million, an increase of $326 million from the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $254 million, up $30 million from the prior quarter. The increase was driven by higher equity earnings from the Bakken and Gray Oak Pipelines. NGL and Other adjusted pretax income was $357 million compared with $83 million in the second quarter. The increase was primarily due to a $224 million unrealized investment gain related to NOVONIX as well as inventory impacts. 
In September, we acquired a 16% interest in NOVONIX. Our investment will be mark-to-market at the end of each reporting period. The Sweeny fractionation complex averaged a record 383,000 barrels per day, and the Freeport LPG export facility loaded 41 cargoes in the third quarter. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $31 million was up $22 million from the previous quarter, mainly due to improved margins and hedging impacts. 
Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. We delivered another strong quarter in Chemicals with adjusted pretax income of $634 million, down $23 million from the second quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins had record adjusted pretax income of $613 million. The $20 million increase from the previous quarter was primarily due to higher polyethylene sales volumes, driven by continued strong demand, partially offset by higher utility costs. Global O&P utilization was 102% for the quarter. 
Adjusted pretax income for SA&S decreased $45 million compared to the second quarter, driven by lower margins, which began to normalize following tight market conditions. During the third quarter, we received $632 million in cash distributions from CPChem. 
Turning to Refining on Slide 8. Refining third quarter adjusted pretax income was $184 million, an improvement of $890 million from the second quarter, driven by higher realized margins across all regions. Realized margins for the quarter increased by 119% to $8.57 per barrel, primarily due to higher market crack spreads, lower RIN costs and improved product differentials. Pretax turnaround costs were $81 million, down from $118 million in the prior quarter. 
Crude utilization was 86% compared with 88% in the second quarter. Lower utilization reflects downtime at the Alliance Refinery, which was safely shut down on August 28 in advance of Hurricane Ida. The third quarter clean product yield was 84%, up 2% from last quarter, supported by improved FCC operations. 
Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:1 market crack for the third quarter was $19.44 per barrel compared to $17.76 per barrel in the second quarter. Realized margin was $8.57 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 44%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 22%. Market capture was impacted by the configuration of our refineries. Our refineries are more heavily weighted toward distillate production than the market indicator. During the quarter, the distillate crack increased $1.55 per barrel and the gasoline crack improved $1.92 per barrel. 
Losses from secondary products of $1.98 per barrel improved $0.40 per barrel from the previous quarter as NGL prices strengthened. Our feedstock advantage of $0.01 per barrel declined by $0.26 per barrel from the prior quarter. The Other category reduced realized margins by $5.01 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, clean product realizations and inventory impacts. 
Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted third quarter pretax income was $547 million compared with $479 million in the prior quarter. Our Marketing business realized continued strong margins and saw increasing demand for products. Marketing and Other increased $62 million from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to higher international margins and volumes, driven by the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. 
Refined product exports in the third quarter were 209,000 barrels per day. Specialties generated third quarter adjusted pretax income of $93 million, up from $87 million in the prior quarter, largely due to improved base oil margins. 
On Slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pretax costs of $230 million, an improvement of $14 million from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to lower costs related to the timing of environmental and employee-related expenses, partially offset by higher net interest expense. 
Slide 12 shows the change in cash for the quarter. We started the quarter with a $2.2 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $2.2 billion. Excluding a working capital benefit of $776 million, our cash from operations was $1.4 billion, which covered $552 million of capital spend, $394 million for the dividend and $500 million of early debt repayment. Our ending cash balance was $2.9 billion. 
This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the fourth quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the fourth quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low 80s. We expect the Alliance Refinery to remain shut down for the full quarter. We expect fourth quarter pretax turnaround expenses to be between $110 million and $140 million. We anticipate fourth quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $240 million and $250 million pretax. Now we will open the line for questions."

Well, I'll take a stab at that and then Kevin and Mark and Tim can help. But first of all, I think probably we ought to acknowledge that PSXP played a significant role in growing our Midstream business. If you look back kind of pre PSXP, so pre 2013",362,"Okay. Well, I'll take a stab at that and then Kevin and Mark and Tim can help. But first of all, I think probably we ought to acknowledge that PSXP played a significant role in growing our Midstream business. If you look back kind of pre PSXP, so pre 2013, kind of Midstream business generated about $500 million of EBITDA, and today, it's $2.1 billion and more than half of that is at the MLP. 
So it did a nice job in helping us build in grow a substantial Midstream business. One thing we're looking at today is that the market just doesn't value kind of the drop-down growth-fueled MLPs at this point in time. Consider trading in a 9% yield. We see institutional ownership drop from the 90s into the low 70s. And then from our perspective, cost of capital is relatively high versus PSX. And so it doesn't really provide an attractive vehicle to fund our growth midstream investments.  
And then I will also say at the very beginning we felt like the MLP provide a clear line of sight to valuation of our Midstream business from some of the parts spaces, and I'm not certain that really applies today. So you think about these are high-quality Midstream assets. We know them really well. We're able to acquire them for essentially a 9-ish multiple and trade it up into a 10x multiple, which should be created from a some of the parts basis. 
And then I think as we think about the future of Midstream and potential consolidation in Midstream, I think rolling up the PSXP gives us more degrees of freedom to create value with those assets. For a long time, a lot of the strength in -- was the MLP was the diversity of the assets. You think about crude oil pipelines and terminals and product pipelines and NGL assets. 
And we think that by being able to take those apart in discrete assets, that we can create more value with those as we move into the future. I don't know, Kevin or Mark, if you want to add on to that, you're certainly welcome to do that."

Roger, the follow-up around reporting on a go-forward basis, as you know, as a fully consolidated entity, what you see today in our Midstream results reflects all of the MLP anyway, so that's fully reflected in our Midstream segment results. But we have to cut back down below in noncontrolling interest for the third-party public ownership. 
And so once this transaction is closed, you will eliminate that noncontrolling interest deduct from our bottom line results. So that's really how it's going to impact the reporting."

Yes, thanks for that question, Roger. I think, so the critical path on the whole project, right, is a land use permit in Costa County, and that's the -- in California, you get the opportunity to apply for lots of permits to build something, but this is the big one and the most difficult path through. 
So we've been working it since we announced the project. And I would say overall, it's going really well. The environmental impact statement, that's part of obtaining that land use permit, was released for public comment about the middle of October, so that's a 60-day comment period. So that's when you saw in there that they identified an opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of the project is to make the project smaller. 
We actually took that as a good sign because by law, the planning commission staff has to identify lower-impact alternatives to the project. And the fact that the only thing that was put in there was, well, you could just make it smaller to reduce the environmental impact. Reflected to us that they agreed with us, we had taken kind of every environmental step around reduction of emissions from the plant, shutting down of the carbon plant, everything we can do to reduce the emissions and the greenhouse gas footprint of the future project, and that's really all that's left. 
We take that as, by no means that they are advocating or that anyone will advocate for a smaller project being built there. This is the project that makes sense. It's the one that uses the equipment that's on the ground and is very cost efficient to go and convert. 
So we're in the middle of that public comment period. At some point, the county will start releasing the comments to us and we'll respond to those, and the period will close in kind of mid-December. It will take planning staff probably part of the first quarter to work its way through those and we'll be responsive to those. And we still anticipate getting this thing permitted sometime probably late 1Q, and then that freezes up to go start construction."

Frac 4  will finish up essentially this year going into next year. So there's no big spend in front of us in Midstream. Obviously, we have the Rodeo Renewed project and we're anxious to get started on that next year. But I think that all fits within the guidance we've kind of consistently given here over the last couple of quarters of $2 billion or less for 2022. 
We actually go to our Board for approval of the capital budget in December time frame. But that's -- in round numbers, that's kind of the numbers that we're looking at for 2022. I think that as -- certainly cash generation is improving, as you can see the results from this quarter, I think we're probably more optimistic today that we're moving towards more of a mid-cycle earnings profile in our Refining business. Our Marketing and Specialties has been performing really, really strong this whole year. Chem has been really strong this year. Midstream has been really strong this year. 
So as we get Refining back to something approaching more mid-cycle, that increase more optionality around the cash and what we do with the cash. But clearly, we're on a glide slope to pay down debt. We want to get back to that $12 billion pre-pandemic level. And as we've mentioned in the opening comments, we've paid $1 billion down so far this year of that.  So we're on a glide slope to do that. 
But I think the real model post for us as we start thinking about capital allocation, that first $1 is always going to go to our dividend or sustaining capital. Next $1 goes to dividend and then we think about debt reduction. And then hopefully, we'll get to a point where we start working share repurchases back in. So Kevin, if you want to add anything to that."

And then if you could take a moment to talk about differentials. One of the things that has surprised, I think, market participants is how tight the spread between Brent and WTI is, which matters for Mid-Con Refining. Do you think this is structural or do you think this widens out as U.S. production comes back?"

You've seen the WCS dips come off. A few reasons why, with some refining problems in the Mid-Con barrels got -- WCS barrels got to the Gulf Coast, weakened the dip and the Canadian dips followed. And also, there were some pipeline issues just this past week in Canada, which also helped weakened the dip. We think that dip will strengthen a bit going forward but we're happy where it is now. 
In terms of Brent TIs, the Brent TI need to stay relatively tight as you've seen Cushing inventories are at 27 million barrels currently. We're getting close to operational means when that happens, we need to keep crude in the United States. And the best way to do that is to tighten the WTI-Brent differential. So we think it will stay in the $2 to $3 range going forward. So we think, by and large, the market is setting up for a good Q4 and certainly a good 2022."

From an ongoing basis, the primary impact from a tax standpoint, excluding the impact of the step-up in basis, is going to be the tax that we will recognize on that, what today is shown as noncontrolling interest, that becomes -- those become our earnings.

We see additional costs come through in power purchases and steam that we -- we're the host for from Cogen that's operated by a third party next door. So there is a cost impact. 
When I think about though, the overall Refining complex in Europe, right, margins have to rise to keep the lowest or the highest cost producer online.

The roll-up does give us a little bit more flexibility though because, one, we have access to all of the cash that previously either was distributed to the LP unitholders as distributions or was excess cash, excess sort of coverage cash becomes available to us for debt reduction.

And so up to this last quarter, it actually wasn't incented to come out. 
We've seen that flip a little bit here recently. There'll be a little bit of pull with a couple of new crackers coming on stream here over the next 2 quarters. But fundamentally, we actually feel that the supply is going to be there and so it will be sufficient. There's also quite an incentive for people to get out there and make sure they're maximizing gas production. And then you are seeing folks out there continue to maintain production. So we're seeing NGL is coming off of the crude side, natural gas side and then with the rejection that's going on, it feels very sufficient here."

I mean, as we think about your balance sheet, that would have you down to about $14.5 billion versus the, I guess, your $12 billion pre-pandemic target. 
As we think about uses of cash in 2022, do you need to get the balance sheet down to that $12 billion level before you start thinking about buybacks? Or at what point does the -- there's a potential for buybacks kind of become a part of the excess cash flow?"

And so I think that once we are -- we're already making good progress on debt reduction. And when we're in that position of we're clearly back in a mid-cycle type environment, we're generating mid-cycle cash flow, there's a very clear line of sight to the ability to continue to reduce debt down to the levels we want to get to. We should have more flexibility to start thinking about the other alternatives that we have in terms of use of cash. 
So maybe that's a long-winded way of saying we don't believe we have to get all the way to $12 billion before we think about alternatives as long as the cash generation is there that we can clearly see our ability to delever -- continue to delever and consider some of the alternatives around capital allocation."

But things seem to be shaping up to be somewhere at least close to mid-cycle. And I think the one component of the sort of refining contribution that's not there right now are the crude differentials, so we're still lagging on heavy crude differentials. 
But there's some light at the end of the tunnel on that as well as we start to see OPEC putting more barrels back into the market. So we could see that start to come back in our favor. But that is probably what's keeping us being a little -- maybe a little bit behind mid-cycle at this point in time but open up to..."

I would say, with low inventories across all products, with jet fuel starting to come back, the government opening up international travel to vaccinated travelers by November 8, I think we'll continue to see the light heavy dips expand. We've seen MEH and also Dubai, Brent both expand quite a bit from late July to now. So I think we'll continue to see that expansion. 
Part of that is this drive to use more sweet crude even overseas where people -- where hydrogen is costly so desulfurization is costly, so people want to switch to -- or refiners want to switch to more light crude diet. So I think things are setting up for a good 2022. We're here, we'll call it, an average year for us, but it may be better than that depending on if inventories continue to decrease. 
Little bit -- realized crack kind of 12 to 19, 3:1 when adjusted. It's kind of $10.50 a barrel, give or take and we're kind of $8.50-ish in this quarter. So we're not quite back to a mid-cycle crack. But to the point that you raised earlier, I think -- well, I don't think we're bullish. I've never been bullish in Refining, so it's not time my grow horns here.

Do you have an ability to capture some of that price strength in the Midstream business? And conversely, is there an impact to your Refining business in the winter due to butane blending?

The Other category is our most volatile category, and we call it Other because everything that isn't straightforward is in there. So you've got RIN effects in there, you've got inventory effects in there. We've also got product differential effects in there, so on -- particularly in the Atlantic Basin, when European cracks really disconnect from the Atlantic Coast, we'll see the plus or minus in that category. 
Inventory accounting can move numbers in there quite a bit. And there's a few steady things in there like freight to get our products to market and those sorts of things are pretty steady, but the volatility really comes, product dips and that also includes the timing of our realizations for the products we move up Colonial Pipeline to the East Coast. That can be very volatile month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. 
The RINs inventories and then between the places that we buy and sell our products. It's hard to say that the volatility will slow down. It's kind of always there. The bucket is just outsized right now because of the severe RIN impact that we show in the other category, right? That accounts for almost half of that bucket here over the last couple of quarters. 
On the NGL side, butane blending into gasoline, right? You run a fair amount. We'll want to do it if it's economic. So if NGLs prices run up and it doesn't make sense to put it in the gasoline, we won't. Overall, in Refining, as part of our secondary products, right, we make 4%, 5% NGLs off the refining complexes. So the higher the price for NGLs, the better off we are and lowers that usually negative to our income. So overall, it's -- we store a lot of our own butane every year to bring back and blend it in gasoline. But quite frankly, we'll sell it into the market if that makes more sense."

I mean it's effectively tripled in price here in the last year. But what we do with our system, we're predominantly -- we're not exposed significantly in the commodity cycle there. So we really are a fee-based business the way we're structured. 
Now what we do, do, much like what we do with the refining kit is we have a system we're managing around. So as we are buying and selling barrels to optimize our kit, there are opportunities for us to trade around those assets and capture and equip a couple of the corners in that process. But it's really to manage and optimize our system to make sure our barrels, as we buy them from the wellhead all the way to the point, they end up in the marketplace, That's how we try and position those barrels and we play in that.

And like everything else in the commodity business, right, we'll let the economics dictate. I think there's plenty of opportunity as sustainable aviation fuel develops and the market develops for that over time to come back and do a debottlenecking or add a little bit of kit at Rodeo Renewed to make more sustainable aviation fuel is there, and will probably make sense, but it's probably going to take more than the $1.50 that the government is anticipating putting out there to make that happen."

But we certainly do believe there's opportunities for us to participate in that. And so a big key piece of that is going to be having a concentration of carbon to capture. I mean, you've got to have areas where there's heavy concentration. You've heard some of the stuff about Houston. And there are other metro areas or industrialized areas where there may be opportunities to do that as well. We certainly think with our assets and our structure and the products and the process that we do, that it does make sense. 
Now the next challenges doesn't make economic sense. So we're going to work both sides of that equation with regard to see what makes sense and what fits.

Marketing and Specialties reported strong results as demand increased in many of our key domestic regions. Our Midstream segment recovered well from the first quarter winter storms to report solid results. 
Headwinds continued in our Refining segment as RIN adjusted refined product crack only improved modestly and historically low market capture contributed to continued losses.

Upon completion, which is expected in the fourth quarter of 2022, total Sweeny Hub fractionation capacity will increase to 550,000 barrels per day. The fracs are all supported by long-term commitments. 
CPChem continues to develop 2 world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar. We expect the final investment decision for the U.S. Gulf Coast project next year. The Ras Laffan petrochemical project is progressing with front-end engineering and design as planned. Both projects are in partnership with Qatar Petroleum. In addition, CPChem began construction of its second world scale unit to produce 1-hexene, utilizing CPChem's proprietary technology. 1-hexene is used for high-performance polyethylene manufacturing and is common in a variety of everyday products, including packaging for food, consumer products and pharmaceuticals. The unit located in Old Ocean, Texas will have a capacity of 266,000 metric tons per year and is expected to start up in 2023. 
In May, CPChem was recognized by the Plastic Industry Association for being among the top 2021 industry innovators in sustainability. The award recognizes CPChem's launch of Marlex, a new circular polyethylene, which uses advanced recycling technology to convert plastic waste into high-quality raw materials. 
We continue to advance our Rodeo Renewed project at the San Francisco refinery. In July, we reached full production rates of 8,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel from the hydrotreater conversion. Subject to permitting and approvals, full conversion of the facility is expected in early 2024. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel production capacity. The conversion will reduce emissions from the facility and produce lower carbon transportation fuels. Rodeo, combined with our portfolio of other renewable fuels projects has the potential to supply 1 billion gallons of renewable fuels per year. 
In Marketing, we're converting 600 branded retail sites in California to sell renewable diesel produced by the Rodeo facility. In Switzerland, our Coop retail joint venture continues to add hydrogen fueling stations. Through our joint venture, we're exploring hydrogen as a fuel option for heavy-duty vehicles to support European low-carbon goals and growing demand for sustainable fuels. We're moving forward and preparing for the future, while maintaining our focus on safe, reliable operations and attractive shareholder returns.
Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results."

Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our second quarter results. We reported earnings of $296 million. Excluding special items, we had adjusted earnings of $329 million or $0.74 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $1.7 billion, including a working capital benefit of $833 million and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $612 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $380 million, including $179 million for growth projects. We paid $394 million in dividends. 
Moving to Slide 5. This slide shows the change in adjusted results from the first quarter to the second quarter, an increase of $838 million. Pretax income improved across all segments, with the largest contribution from Chemicals. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 19%. 
Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. Second quarter adjusted pretax income was $316 million, an increase of $40 million from the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $224 million, up $18 million from the previous quarter. The increase was due to improved volumes from higher refinery utilization, partially offset by higher costs due to the timing of maintenance and asset integrity work. 
NGL and other adjusted pretax income was $83 million. The $47 million increase from the prior quarter was mainly due to lower operating costs and higher volumes, reflecting recovery from the winter storms. The Sweeny fractionation complex averaged 380,000 barrels per day and the Freeport LPG export facility loaded a record 42 cargoes in the second quarter. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $9 million, was down $25 million from the previous quarter, mainly due to lower mark-to-market hedging results from higher natural gas and NGL prices. 
Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. Second quarter adjusted pretax income was $657 million, up $473 million from the first quarter. This is the highest quarterly earnings for Chemicals since the joint venture was formed in 2000. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pretax income was $593 million. The $419 million increase from the previous quarter was driven by strong demand, tight supplies and recovery from the winter storms that contributed to higher margins and lower utility costs. 
The industry chain margin increased over $0.17 per pound to a record $0.62 per pound. Global O&P utilization was 102% for the quarter. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S increased $55 million. The increase primarily reflects improved margins due to tight industry supplies following the winter storms as well as lower turnaround costs. During the second quarter, we received $322 million in cash distributions from CPChem. 
Turning to Refining on Slide 8. Refining second quarter adjusted pretax loss was $706 million, an improvement of $320 million from the first quarter. The improvement was driven by lower utility and turnaround costs and higher volumes. This was partially offset by lower realized margins. Improved market crack spreads were more than offset by higher RIN costs, lower electricity sales in the Texas market, decreased secondary product margins, lower clean product differentials and inventory impacts. Pretax turnaround costs were $118 million, down from $192 million in the prior quarter. Crude utilization was 88% compared with 74% last quarter. The second quarter clean product yield was 82%. 
Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the second quarter was $17.76 per barrel compared to $13.23 per barrel in the first quarter. Realized margin was $3.92 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 22%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 33%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. Our refineries are more heavily weighted toward distillate production than the market indicator. During the quarter, the gasoline crack improved $5.68 per barrel, while the distillate crack increased $2.20 per barrel. 
Losses from secondary products of $2.38 per barrel were $1.09 per barrel higher than the previous quarter as crude prices strengthened. These stock costs improved $0.36 per barrel compared to the prior quarter. The other category reduced realized margins by $7.84 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, new product realizations and inventory impacts.
Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted second quarter pretax income was $479 million compared with $290 million in the prior quarter. Marketing and other increased $181 million due to higher domestic margins and volumes, reflecting strong demand in key markets. Refined product exports in the second quarter were 216,000 barrels per day. Specialties generated second quarter adjusted pretax income of $87 million, up from $79 million in the prior quarter.
Slide 11 shows the change in cash for the quarter. We started the quarter with a $1.4 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $1.7 billion. This included a working capital benefit of $833 million. In June, we received a $1.1 billion U.S. federal income tax refund, which is reflected in working capital. Cash from operations, excluding working capital, was $910 million, which more than covered $380 million of capital spend and $394 million for the dividend. The other category includes a $90 million loan to our WRB joint venture. Our ending cash balance was $2.2 billion. 
This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the third quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, crude utilization will be adjusted according to market conditions. In July, utilization averaged around 98%. We expect third quarter pretax turnaround expenses to be between $120 million and $150 million. We anticipate third quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $240 million and $250 million pretax. 
Now we will open the line for questions."

The -- we're still consistent on our mid-cycle margin projection. And of course, we're well above that today. And as we look out into the third quarter, we're seeing the strength continue in the third quarter. We've got cost increases on the table that are being negotiated as we speak. Even if things went forward just as they are today, we're still at record margins. And we think that, that can carry into third quarter. 
There's a lot of strength in the marketplace, particularly in North America and in Europe. Asia is still kind of lagging, but starting to perk up a little bit. So the real story is the fundamental economic resurgence in the U.S., in North America and Europe. And we believe that there's some upside that will offset some headwinds out in the future as the rest of the global economy kicks in. We're at record margins. Nobody believes those are sustainable for the long term. However, I think we can go from something at the record level to something that's still pretty robust. 
We see seasonal downturn typically in the fourth quarter, but we've also seen conditions where we can kind of carry through when there's strong enough marketing momentum. And there may be those kind of conditions now. We're particularly focused on high-density polyethylene. And that's still pretty tight in the marketplace. The inventories have not recovered to where CPChem would be comfortable operating. And it's unusual to be there this time of year with hurricane season. We typically want to be a little higher in inventories going into the hurricane season. 
So there's a number of factors that could lead to sustain this momentum into the third quarter and beyond into the fourth quarter. And then we see the world economy kicking in. About the same time, additional capacity is coming on, say, first half of next year. So there's some good fundamentals out there. And I think it's still got some legs based on the demand that will come to bear as the world economy fully recovers from COVID."

I think when you look back over the last quarter, I think there were plenty of market signals there for us to run at the utilization rates we're at. There's a lot of moving parts, in particular, the cost of RINs that just continue to increase throughout the quarter. And we take a pretty good hit in Refining for the full cost of those prints. I think we would have all expected maybe on a global basis, Europe and Asia demand ticked back a little better than it did. I think the margins -- the RIN adjusted margins that we saw in the second quarter really across our system are very representative of a global market. 
So until we start seeing recovery, particularly in Europe because we seem to see products flowing out of Europe into North America and South America, we won't really see RINs get back to where we would like to see. And I think the second piece for us, in particular, is our kit more geared towards heavy crudes making diesel. And certainly for the second quarter, it was a gasoline-driven market without much differential on heavy crude. We've seen those widen out here now in July to a much more respectable level. So we think it's headed in the right direction. But I think all of that added up to being challenged in the second quarter to turn a 90% type utilization number into a profit."

We expect distillate cracks to perform as we get toward wintertime. 
So all in all, I think we've also seen actually markets overseas come back. We have marketing in Europe. And we've seen Europe, Germany, where we market 90% to 95% of demand. Austria, where we market, 100% of demand. So we've seen those markets come back as well. So as Bob said, if the overseas markets start to come back, that will help the U.S. cracks, and we should see some profitability in Q3."

One, internally, right, we expected tough operating conditions for a good part of this year. Recovery has been slower than we expected, but we went into this year, trying to reduce some of our heavy maintenance expenses and adjusting turnarounds and all that. And so the guidance Kevin just gave right for the third quarter is fairly light for us. So I think that helps heading into the third quarter profitability. You can translate that as we're available to run. So if the cracks are there, we're going to be able to run pretty hard in the third quarter and make money. 
Around the advantage 66 program that we laid out, right, so a lot of that is built around margin enhancement, margin improvement. So I would sell -- I think we ran pretty well in the second quarter, and we're using all those tools that are in our toolkit. The value chain optimization activities that went on in the second quarter were pretty robust. We did a lot of things that we haven't done before or needed to do before, such as we ran a lot of resid down into our Sweeny refinery, where typically, we'd be running Maya or some of the heavy Canadians. The profitability really wasn't there. And so optimizing around high sulfur resids into our system. It's just one example about where we're kind of running the circuits. 
We're pretty happy with the results we're seeing on the operating front. A lot of our initiatives in Refining are around being able to operate well, operate better, operate safer with the smaller environmental footprint, and we're seeing value come out of all of those initiatives. They don't necessarily translate directly to the bottom line where you can see them, but over time, they're paying dividends."

So it's been -- if you go back -- all the way back to the first quarter of 2020, that's the last time we actually made money as a company. So it's been a long haul as we've kind of come through this. There's no question. There's been a lot of stress. I put on a lot of companies in our industry. 
But I think we're constructive, particularly as we come in the back half of the year around demand. This has been a story of vaccinations, efficiency, lockdowns and people trying to get back to someone to normal, and that all translates strictly into the demand that we see for our products. And there's still a question, I think the U.S. is probably led in terms of demand recovery through this cycle. And so we've seen the impacts of Europe coming to the U.S. We've seen the impacts of not being able to export as much as we'd like to, to South America and places. 
And so I think as the world returns to normal, we've got a good shot at getting back to something that looks more like a mid-cycle. I think we said on the last call, we really need to see that 3:2:1 crack on a RIN adjusted basis get back to about $12. And then I think we'll see the appropriate kind of market captures around that to be able to generate something around $4 billion.

So for a variety of reasons, that's not going to be cash this year, although it still will realize itself over time for us on that. 
And then in terms of dividend growth, I think we go back to the earlier comments around as cash generation recovers to something around about mid-cycle, and we're in a position to pay down debt, we're making progress on paying down debt, we've got sort of clear line of sight to our ability to continue to do that and get the balance sheet back to where we want it to be, then we should feel comfortable on some of the other capital allocation priorities and increasing the dividend is one of those. 
So I think it's a little bit of a long-winded way of saying we don't need to get to all we want to get through on the balance sheet before we make a decision on the dividend. We just need to be very comfortable that the structure is there, the cash generation is there.

So trying to reconcile that if the market conditions really change that much or will that get that much worse because NGL price is actually very good in the second quarter? So maybe that someone can help us on that. 
The second question would be just a real quick one. On the renewable, the full plant conversion, just want to see if there's a permit status that you can provide? And also that the last couple of years, you guys have been trying to rebrand the work process and go for digitization. And so just wanted to see if you can give an update on where we are on that?

The first thing I would say is in 2019, I wish we were back in that macro. That was a good time with regard to the overall supply/demand fundamentals. Global demand was where you wanted it to be on really all of our Midstream products, whether it's crude products and NGLs. So fundamentally, there are big changes in the market. 
But when you look specifically at 2021, let me just highlight a couple things for you there that are -- have reared their head. The biggest one that's had the biggest impact is winter storm Uri. When you look at Uri, it impacted our frac significantly down there and -- mainly not from the standpoint of damaging the units or any issues there. Even though we did have some costs with the units, that was on utilities. Our utility bill was significant.
So from that standpoint, and that's going to be hard to call back for the rest of this year. So on a positive note, I'd just tell you, structurally, we like the NGL business. Demand has been very robust to support chemicals growth, both locally and globally. NGL production is ramping up. We still see about 1 million barrels in rejection at this point in time. But overall, demand is really good in that space. Our LPG exports have been in a record clip.
So overall, the fundamentals feel good that it was a big cost hit as well as lost production hit that we had initially in 1Q, which really on a year-to-date basis stays with us. The last thing I'd just cover in Q2, the overall structure in NGLs has jumped up significantly, as you probably are well aware, propanes, butanes and ethane. We're at about $0.86, $0.87 on a gallon basis for NGL on a composite. In 2019, it was $0.37. So it's gone up. And with that, we've seen an impact on some mark-to-market we have on some of our inventory. So that's there. That usually turns into a timing issue. But just nonetheless, that shows up in the results in 2Q."

We're essentially done writing the permit. It's in review right now internally with the county, and we would expect them to probably sometime this month release the permit to begin the public comment period.
So that would be pretty much right on our time line, maybe a little bit ahead. And so far, it's been a good cooperative process with the regulators and their permit writers. So we're encouraged and pretty happy where we are.

So we've had good optimization opportunities around reduced utilization in our refineries and our ability to get down as low as we did and to make jet go away and all those I think we're much easier because of some of the efforts we had. 
The second piece I would say is at the height of COVID when we had the social distance and we had to use alternative work approaches and everything, our early jump into digitalization allowed our people to get a lot more done without human contact and really was a dividend to us upfront in our ability to keep supporting the operators who were on the units, while minimizing contact with the outside world. 
And then third piece is we were able to hold the line on costs quite well throughout last year. And in fact, we saw cost reductions in many of kind of our bigger cost items, caps and [ kims ] and those sorts of things that are a big piece of our operating budget. We applied some of the learnings that we got through A66 to those. And I think we got sustainable longer term price reductions there that will continue to pay out throughout this year.

It's weakened about $2.5 over the past couple of quarters. And when that weakens, so does the hardest WCS differential, you have to have an to have an arm get the barrels to the Gulf Coast. 
And one of the reasons the Gulf Coast is weakening is because low exports means that you have to have a weaker differential on WCS to get that WCS exported out of the U.S. So as you said, Theresa, we have Enbridge coming online in next quarter, quarter 4, we would think that, that would firm up differentials a bit. But don't forget in the wintertime, we add diluent to crude, and that also increases the volume of crude that has to move.

So I think that's what allows us to be able to have a unique position of building a project that's going to be at an installed cost of about $1 a gallon, which you're right, is lower than anybody else, but it is because if there was a refinery that was custom built to be able to be converted to renewable feedstocks Rodeo it's a -- since it's very, very unusual to have 2 hydrocrackers and excess hydrogen capacity on site between our own hydrogen plant and that of our third-party supplier that is built at the site.

I'm just trying to understand, you have these 2 crackers which you were kind of put on a back burner, you can bring them forward, FID them. I'm just trying to understand, let's say, you do decide that from the point of FID, how long will it take to get the first one and the second one. So if this change is permanent and the demand for plastics is in an up cycle, you can capture a part of it."

So we've got our foot forward on these. We are ready to move, and we're working with contractors to make sure that we're getting the capital cost right. Clearly, the global markets are improving, but there's still some disruption in the world economy. We'd like to see a little clearer path to a fully resolved economic recovery from COVID, get the Delta variant and any other variants behind us, but we are leaning in and ready to move with FID on that project next year."

And then you also have to parse it out by kind of polyethylene because high density, linear low density, low density, all have different inventory levels and different applications. And we're heavily exposed to high density and high density is particularly tight supply now and uncomfortably tight. It's been building. 
CPChem ran at 102% of their capacity in the second quarter, so they really delivered from an operational excellence perspective. But much of that went into rebuilding those inventories. So even though they had such a strong quarter, a lot of those -- a lot of that production went into inventory, and they're still not where they would comfortably be heading into a hurricane season. They like to be prepared for that. They don't plan to have a hurricane, but they're prepared if there are hurricanes to impact that. So I think that's where you're seeing the tightness. It's really from a day of sales perspective with the high growth in demand in North America as well as where we are in the weather cycles in North America."

It seems like marketing earnings increased a decent amount this quarter and refining is still kind of in the doldrums in part due to RINs. And I understand there's some accounting and value split between the RIN benefit in marketing versus the cost in refining. So can you just talk about maybe how RINs benefited marketing this quarter and how much of your RIN exposure is being minimized by blending and pass through to consumers? 
And then the second question, just also on the quarter quickly, co-product realizations, I know we're a relatively larger than normal headwind. How is that looking 3Q quarter-to-date so far?"

It's a cost that refining pays and that the crack has passed on the -- the value of the crack is passed on to the consumer who pays for the RIN at the pump. So marketing doesn't see any benefit from the RINs per se. There may be some leakage in that chain, but Marketing doesn't really see any benefit. 
Marketing did have a really very strong quarter in Q2. And a large part of that was we had kind of the right portfolio in the right places. We saw demand jump up in March and then again in June. We have a strong presence in the Rockies and in the Mid-Con, where there were less COVID lockdowns and more movement. We added, as you know, retail in late '19 and also in '20 on the West Coast, and that retail has done better than premise. We also added retail this year in the Mid-Con and Rockies and that retails in better in premise. 
And finally, I'd add how we've been reimaging the stores for the past 3 years. We're up to 85% of the stores reimaged, and we've seen the 2% to 3% jump in volumes and margins in those stores as well. So we've done a lot of things to help our portfolios in the right spots. And so I think that's where we saw the value in marketing in Q2."

So as we came out of turnaround and started up the Rodeo hydrotreater and renewable service, actually came up that ran really well. We had almost a full quarter running at low rates. We still have a project to get the rail infrastructure to finish, so that we can supply 9,000 barrels a day to make to 8,000 barrels a day of renewable diesel. So we're learning how the catalyst reacts and what the actual kinetics are around running bean oil. It's a little bit of a learning for the ultimate project of converting the refinery. And these are really -- these projects really are 2 very separate things in that there was no real work to do to convert 250 to bean oil, it was a matter of changing the catalyst that a regular scheduled turnaround and then being able to run it. 
So it's helpful. I think the bigger picture there is it's very helpful to our commercial organization to learn how to source renewable feedstocks, so logistics are getting them there, some of the peculiar areas around transporting it. Those sorts of things all set us up to be a lot more nimble and ready for when we go from 8,000 barrels a day to 50,000 barrels a day with the renewable conversion. I think probably the best thing to come out of it is we did not see anything that made us stop and think about the project to convert the rest of the refinery that we needed to go back and think about our design, pretty much operating as expected."
