Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our fourth quarter results. We delivered high-quality quarterly bookings in terms of total volume as well as the product mix, geographic split and the number of new logos landing on PlatformDIGITAL. We extended our global platform entering Greece with the acquisition of the leading colocation interconnection provider in Southeastern Europe and securing customer growth in existing markets around the world with key land purchases and new builds. 
We delivered solid financial results, with core FFO per share, $0.08 ahead of consensus, driven by operational outperformance. 
Finally, we further strengthened the balance sheet, lowering our weighted average cost of debt with the redemption of high coupon debt and preferred equity, while extending our weighted average duration with the issuance of attractively priced long-term capital. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill."

The fourth quarter capped off a transformational year for Digital Realty. We acquired several highly connected assets, including the Westin building in North America and Interxion in EMEA, along with the leading colocation and interconnection providers in Southeastern Europe, significantly expanding our platform in EMEA while trimming noncore assets in North America. 
We delivered record bookings for the full year, an extraordinary performance under any set of circumstances, but particularly amid the headwinds of a global pandemic. 
Our business is increasingly global. In 2020, we nearly doubled the number of countries where Digital Realty has a presence, and EMEA accounted for more than half our fourth quarter bookings, the first time ever a majority of our bookings has been outside the Americas. We more than doubled our cross-connect count in 2020, reflecting the growing concentration of network-dense, highly connected assets on PlatformDIGITAL. 
We landed a record number of new logos in 2020, more than twice as many as our previous record, in fact, driving consistent growth in our enterprise colocation and interconnection business. The vibrant communities on our campus environments are attracting a growing set of new customers, diversifying and solidifying our revenue streams. Service providers and enterprises alike are strengthening their partnership with a select number of trusted global data center partners to help meet their growing needs around the world, and Digital Realty is uniquely well positioned to serve as their partner of choice. 
Let's turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on Page 3. In October, we formally committed to reducing direct and indirect emissions by 68% and  indirect emissions in our value chain by area by 24% by 2030, in line with the 1.5-degree climate change scenario. 
We set our target with science-based targets initiative, along with over 1,000 organizations that have committed to reduce emissions. And we also signed the UN Global Compact business ambition for 1.5-degree C, joining leading companies who have committed to ambitious carbon reduction targets. 
In early December, we announced that our operations in France were on target to achieve a carbon-neutral footprint by the end of the year and are expected to remain carbon neutral through 2030 for both existing facilities and future expansion based on scope 1 and 2 emissions. 
In mid-December, we were honored to receive NAREIT's Leader in the Light award for data center sustainability for the fourth consecutive year. In early January, we issued our fifth green bond extending our lead as the largest U.S. REIT issuer bonds committed to sustainable investments. Our green bond framework is aligned with leading global best practices, including GRESB's Green bond principles as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and Sustainalytics has provided an independent second-party opinion concluding that our green bond program is considered robust, credible and transparent. 
We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society. 
In terms of our social efforts, we recently selected diversity, equity and inclusion as 1 of 4 company-wide philanthropic areas of focus in addition to sustainability, disaster relief and STEM education. As you may be aware, NAREIT recently instituted a dividend through diversity and inclusion program, which I am honored to be co-chairing along with Tom Baltimore of Park Hotels  and Debbie Cafaro of Ventas. Dividends through diversity will promote the recruitment, inclusion and advancement of women, minorities and other underrepresented groups in REITs in the broader commercial real estate industry. 
We have also joined leaders across 85 industries in signing the CEO pledge on CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, an initiative that aims to rally the business community to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace and to cultivate a trusting environment where employees feel empowered to have discussions on these topics. Participating in these programs and others like them is critical to our industry's future because it is the right thing to do and because we serve a broad, diverse community. And we believe that to help our customers prepare for the future, we need industry professionals whose insights and perspectives reflect the communities we serve. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role  in advancing our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities we serve around the world. 
Let's turn now to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to expand our global platform with the acquisition of the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Southeastern Europe, groundbreakings in existing markets across EMEA and strategic land purchase on the continent and in Asia Pacific. 
In early November, we acquired Lambda Helix, the largest carrier-neutral colocation and interconnection provider in Greece, led by an accomplished management team who will continue to manage the business. As leading service providers continue to expand their footprint, we expect Greece and other parts of Southeastern Europe will be major beneficiaries. We are well positioned to capture the key cloud and connectivity deployments that will accelerate the region's digital transformation. 
In Denmark, we began construction on our third data center, adjacent to the 2 existing facilities on our Copenhagen campus and offering direct access to leading global cloud providers, numerous networks, Internet exchanges and a transatlantic subsea cable system. 
We also broke ground on a new data center in Zurich, where we've seen robust demand from leading global service providers. The expansion of our Zurich campus will provide runway for customer growth at the leading cloud and interconnection hub in Switzerland. 
We also acquired a land parcel within 1 kilometer of our highly interconnected campus in Vienna. 
And halfway around the globe in Sydney we are under contract to acquire 2 parcels that will support the development of up to 250 megawatts. These strategic land holdings will provide additional capacity enabling local and global service providers to seamlessly expand adjacent to their existing deployments. 
Let's turn to Page 5 for an update on the Interxion integration. The successful integration of Interxion was our top priority for 2020, and we made excellent progress despite the pandemic. We have built a solid foundation for the assimilation of our businesses, and we are well on our way to achieving the objectives and synergies we outlined when we first announced the transaction. 
I'm proud of what we've accomplished to date and excited about our prospects as we move into the implementation phase in 2021. When we announced the transaction, we stated that the combined company would have enhanced capabilities to address and solve the public and hybrid cloud architecture requirements of our global customer base that would allow us to build upon each company's current relationships with leading global customers while also enabling us to effectively compete in the broader target markets. 
The early results are very promising. We've enjoyed excellent success with global platform providers, and early cross-selling wins have surpassed expectations with numerous referrals between the sales teams. The significant embedded growth potential was another key element of the Interxion investment thesis. We believe the combined organization has already created significant long-term value by executing on the existing development pipeline acquiring the freehold to the land under key positions in Frankfurt and Paris and securing land in key markets to support future growth. 
Let's turn to demand drivers on Page 6. We continue to be fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. As the leading global data center provider, we have a unique vantage point that enables us to detect secular trends as they emerge. We recently introduced the data gravity index, which measures, quantifies and forecast the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. This groundbreaking index is a byproduct of our market intelligence analysis as well as our obsessive focus on understanding customers' deployments and supporting their evolving infrastructure needs. 
Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of data gravity. According to the market intelligence firm, IDC, 80% of the world's data will reside within enterprises by the year 2025. A 451 Research global IT leader survey recently found that 87% of it leaders will need to maintain local copies of critical data at global points of presence to meet regulatory requirements. 
We continue to see these indicators as enterprises expand their private data infrastructure deployments and integrate data exchange with adjacent business and service provider partners across our global platform. 
Digital Realty recently received Frost & Sullivan's APAC Data Center Strategy Innovator Award, recognizing platform digital for providing an innovative global platform enabling enterprises to scale digital transformation in a consistent, modular fashion in addressing the unique infrastructure requirements for integrating private data flows across multiple public platforms. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market-leading innovation to meeting the needs of our global data center customer base. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results."
11041860,699808467,2207023,"Digital Realty Trust, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 8. We signed total bookings of $130 million in the fourth quarter, including a $12 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise-oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less totaled $",1670,"Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 8. We signed total bookings of $130 million in the fourth quarter, including a $12 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise-oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less totaled $31 million, building upon the consistent momentum throughout the year and demonstrating the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand. 
The weighted average lease term was over 8 years. We secured 120 new logos during the quarter, with more than half of those new logos landing in EMEA, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. EMEA accounted for more than half of our fourth quarter bookings, while Asia Pacific contributed over 15%. As Bill mentioned, this was the first time the majority of our bookings were outside the Americas. 
In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a rapidly growing cloud-based cybersecurity provider selected PlatformDIGITAL for multiple environments in London and Boston to facilitate modernization and embrace high-performance compute technology while maintaining an exceptional user experience. 
In New York, the Digital Realty's team's deep understanding of a global retailer's growth strategy enabled us to tailor a solution for their Americas markets on PlatformDIGITAL. We also overcame lockdowns and international travel restrictions to demonstrate to a digital telecom provider how they can leverage PlatformDIGITAL to meet their current and future growth requirements in existing and targeted markets at their required pace. 
A rapidly growing gaming platform expanded their edge to rewire their network and optimize data exchange with third-party clouds, the growth of their existing footprint with us in Northern Virginia and a new deployment in Chicago. Likewise in Chicago, a global exchange operator leveraged PlatformDIGITAL to extend their access into our highly interconnected community. In Singapore, 2 leading global financial services firms expanded with Digital Realty due to our platform offering and long history of operational excellence. While a software developer selected PlatformDIGITAL to expand their proprietary cloud offering into the region. 
Turning to our backlog on Page 10. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced reached an all-time high of $269 million. The step-up from $229 million last quarter reflects $78 million of commencements during the fourth quarter, offset by roughly $118 million of combined space and power leases signed. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at 8.5 months. 
Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 11. We signed $156 million of renewals during the fourth quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average term loan renewals signed during the fourth quarter was a little over 3 years, reflecting a roughly even split in the mix between deals above and below 1 megawatt. 
Cash re-leasing spreads on renewals were plus 1%, and cash rents were positive on renewals above and below 1 megawatt, an encouraging sign for pricing. We retained 79% of expiring leases in line with our long-term historical average. 
In terms of fourth quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy improved 40 basis points, driven primarily by leases commencing on recent deliveries in Ashburn and the sale of a vacant building in Amsterdam. Same capital occupancy was down 40 basis points from the third quarter due to no move-outs, partially offset by positive absorption in Silicon Valley and Chicago. Same capital cash NOI growth has continued to improve since bottoming in 2019 and ticked up slightly to negative 1.6% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, same capital cash NOI growth was negative 1.9% or a little over 100 basis points better than initially expected. 
As a reminder, the Westin Building, Interxion, Lambda Helix and Altus IT are not yet included in the same-store pool, but we expect each of these acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward. 
Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 12. The U.S. dollar softened in the second half of the year, providing a bit of an FX tailwind in the fourth quarter relative to the prior year average. Overall, FX represented roughly a 50 basis point tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. 
In terms of vertical concentration, as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we are fortunate to be primarily serving customers whose businesses are thriving in the current environment, with limited exposure to the sectors most negatively impacted. Rent collections remain in line with our historical average, and requests for rent relief have largely subsided. 
In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have roughly a 50 basis point impact on our full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded. 
In terms of earnings growth, the fourth quarter core FFO per share was down 0.6% year-over-year, but $0.08 ahead of consensus, driven primarily by operational outperformance. For the full year, core FFO per share came in $0.22 or nearly 4% ahead of our initial guidance. As previewed on our third quarter call, we expect to deliver double-digit revenue growth driven by a full year contribution from Interxion and the record colocation and interconnection and overall bookings in 2020. We expect the EBITDA margin will remain in line with the fourth quarter throughout 2021. 
As Bill mentioned, we remain on track to achieve the synergies we underwrote on the Interxion transaction, although the rationale for the deal has always been accelerating revenue growth rather than realizing expense synergies. 
We have already made great strides on our financing plans for the year with a highly successful 1 billion green Eurobond offering in early January at 5/8, in addition to solid progress on the capital recycling front. As always, we expect to remain nimble for the rest of the year, and we may look to capitalize on favorable market conditions to lock in long-term fixed rate financing at attractive coupons across the currencies that support our assets to proactively manage future liabilities. 
In terms of FFO per share guidance, our forecast is largely unchanged from the preliminary outlook we previewed on the third quarter call, although the year-over-year bar has been raised in the interim, given the outperformance in the fourth quarter. At the midpoint, our 2021 guidance represents growth of approximately 4%, which includes near-term dilution from capital recycling. 
In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect the split between the first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately 49/51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect to dip down by about a $0.05 in the first quarter then to ramp up fairly steadily over the rest of the year. 
In terms of the quarterly dividend, the distribution policy is ultimately a Board-level decision. Given the continued growth in our cash flows and taxable income, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend just as we have each and every year since our IPO in 2004. 
Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. During the fourth quarter, we continued to execute on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. 
Fixed charge coverage reached 5.1x, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was slightly elevated at 6.1x as of year-end, but is expected to come back down in line with our long-term range over the course of the year through a combination of proceeds from asset sales and growth in cash flows as leases commenced from the record leasing activity in 2020. 
In mid-October, we redeemed GBP 300 million of our 4.75% sterling bonds due in 2023. We also redeemed $250 million of high coupon Series D preferred at 5 7/8. In early January, we raised $1 billion of 10.5-year green Eurobonds at an all-time low coupon for Digital Realty of 0.625%. We also retired $350 million of 2.75% bonds due in 2023, and we repaid all 3 -- $530 million outstanding on the term loan due in 2023. This successful execution against our financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides the access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. 
As you can see from the chart on Page 14, we've extended our weighted average debt maturity out nearly 7 years while ratcheting our weighted average coupon down to 2.3%. A little over half our debt is Euro-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform post Interxion and acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. 
Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 14, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. 
Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

I can probably kick it off on the question on the multi-megawatt side, and then I'll probably hand it over to Greg to speak to M&A. 
So very pleased with the results overall in terms of 4Q. I think the diversity of the platform really shined through in both categories, not only the less than 1 megawatt in interconnection, but also in the scale or hyperscale plus. 
If you do a quick kind of run-through the regions, EMEA, first time, more than 50% of signings. It was very diverse. There were 6 different markets across EMEA that did a north of 1 megawatt deal each. So it was London, Paris, Marseille, and 2 others that escaped my mind. And then over in the Americas, we had both in Ashburn and also in Hillsboro. And the cast of characters for all these are a combination of the major CSPs, SaaS providers and, call it, the B2C hyperscalers as well. 
And then last but not least, pleased with the result about Brazil, and we signed our second customer into Santiago, Chile. In the hyperscale arena, another top CSP. And then last but not least, had a project with a top 3 CSP down in Sydney. So really diverse contribution from numerous major metros.

I think Andy mentioned to you the regional variances that we've had, meaning first time that EMEA is our largest region for sales and for bookings there. So that was really good and positive. So we feel good about it. And then regarding the industries that I think you might have asked about, those that are work that are taking advantage of the current work-from-home, we're doing more and more quickly with us. And so we're happy about that and how we're supporting them. 
And then also, we're seeing strength from those industries that were strong prior to the pandemic: cloud, digital media, et cetera. And then those that are being kind of suffering a little bit from it, we're seeing them maintain their IT services, and they still got to continue to have our support to go after their mission-critical needs. 
So we're happy about it. And as we mentioned earlier, year-on-year record growth from new logos, stand-alone, really good success from digital and Interxion as we combine the 2 groups. So real happy with the funnel.

Hey, Jon, I hope you're well. Let me -- I guess in the order, let's go to M&A first, and we can talk about divestitures, which are somewhat related.

Let me -- I guess in the order, let's go to M&A first, and we can talk about divestitures, which are somewhat related. 
I think with respect to M&A, as we've said before, look, we remain focused on integrating Interxion while doing a few tuck-in acquisitions, as we would call them, like Altus IT in Croatia and Lambda Helix in Greece. Look, we think the M&A is likely to be more episodic than annual. I think we've already said that. 
And look, as we look at the M&A environment right now, we would say it's probably gotten more competitive over the past year as additional capitals come into the space, but we also think this could serve to benefit us as we seek to dispose of assets in our capital recycling program. I think, look, with respect to our divestitures or capital recycling, our criteria for asset sales remains consistent with our prior commentary. We're seeking to sell noncore assets in select noncore markets. To date, we follow these criteria and dispose of various PBB assets and other quality stand-alone assets that really just are not part of our connected community -- excuse me, connected campus strategy. 
We're about $1.5 billion through the multiyear guidance we gave, which was to sell a few billion of assets over a few years. The good news for us is we don't need to sell these assets. So we have the ability to be strategic and only offer these assets when it's likely that we're going to receive a fair market value for the assets. And we do expect that these asset sales that we'll recycle that capital will provide some of the capital needed for our development program this year and going forward. 
Again, that's really the state of play. Again, tuck-in acquisitions are going to be more focus, deals that are strategic, as both Croatian and Greece where they're highly connected assets in the regions. The assets, combined with the management teams, provide a strong launching pad for further activity in the region. And that's really the way -- that's the way we look at it, and we'll continue to try to find similar deals like these to, to the extent we can."

You may recall a year or 2 ago, in the Ashburn market, we did a almost build-to-suit type project where we built a rather large 36-megawatt shell for a customer that was paying us for that shell on a long-term lease. And then we drop down, built out suite in 6-megawatt or so increments over time. So as those -- as take downs of those suites happen, you're only getting a fraction of the entire economic cost for that customer flowing through our leasing stats because we're already recognized the signing and already realizing the return on the shell. And that phenomenon happened actually in North America and also in Asia Pacific, this particular market. 
Strategically, I mean, it's a great tool in our toolkit that I would say not all competitors can really have, really giving a customer the runway that the desire and the timing flexibility and digital with its scale and breadth of portfolio and as well as our land banks are able to kind of structure those type of transactions that I think is a strategic advantage for those type of customers."

Just kind of rough math if we kind of just hit on the low end of that range, $600 million, use the same type of cap rate we were using for the last outright sale, we did, call it, mid- to low 6 cap, you call it about $40 million of NOI and our share count could be high as 2%. Now that's assuming you sold the entirety of those assets, the first day of the year, and you didn't have any redeployment of proceeds. So when you kind of use appropriate calendarization based on our expectations and also redeploy those proceeds, either paying down debt near term or in lieu of really equity, I would kind of ballpark it in a 50 to 100-ish type basis point headwind to our year-over-year growth, that is."

First, on your base, we definitely had some outperformance in the fourth quarter that we highlighted in the prepared remarks. Some of that was, call it, operational related, just commencing revenue faster. But some of it was out of our control, and FX was a tailwind as you saw the U.S. dollar kind of plummet and then retrench beginning 2021. So that makes a little bit of an apples to oranges comparison between 4Q and the run rate for 2021. 
The answer to your question on the dispositions, we have -- other than a small one-off asset for, I think, $6 million, we have not executed on any of the next leg of capital recycling yet that we framed as a -- at a low range of $600 million, a high range of $1 billion. And we expect the low end of that range to be executed upon in the pretty near-term future here. Hence, when you sell that quantity of assets at -- even at a 6, 6.5 cap rate, you have immediate loss of that income. 
Just to remind you, Matt, and then the broader audience, the dilution near term we think, a, is offset by longer-term accretion. We're selling noncore, slower growing parts of our portfolio and using that capital often in lieu of equity to fund our growth. And two, that dilution is baked within the approximately 4% year-over-year growth. So we're arriving at that year-over-year growth comparison off an outperformance in the last -- back half of this year and absorbing that dilution. So it's not incremental to the guidance that we've already laid out."

One, you've seen now a string of quarters in a row where we have a global platform offering for the hyperscalers and to address their pain points, future-proof their growth and deliver operational excellence across now 49 metros, 6 continents, 24 countries. So the trend has been our friend in terms of success there. I think if you look to our development pipeline, that stepped up about 13% quarter-over-quarter. Now 220 megawatts or so under development, still about 55-ish percent preleased. You've got to imagine there's a lot of hyperscale business in that. I think the returns have been pretty steady in that category, if not stepped up in certain regions. 
I'm not saying or blushing off that some of this business is competitive. I think our most competitive market is certainly the U.S. In that market, I think our value proposition has allowed us to, even in a challenged market like Ashburn, do particularly well with all of our customers, but hyperscalers, in particular. 
And I think if you then look where the pipeline is going and where the growth for our business is going, we're seeing more and more opportunities to generate higher returns from both our colocation and connection offering, but also serving those hyperscalers in places where we have a really differentiated value proposition, certainly, tighter markets like Santa Clara in the U.S., but international markets like Frankfurt, Marseille, Brazil and Singapore as well. 
So listen, not saying that hyperscale became an easy business overnight, but feel very good about what we're delivering to those customers."

The fourth quarter actually, I was pretty pleased with the customer retention and pricing dynamic, in both categories in terms of pricing, in both categories in terms of retention, potentially call it in the 80s and positive mark-to-markets for both above and less than 1 megawatt. 
The impact that we see hit in 2021, but certainly the first quarter of 2021, really goes back to what I mentioned in my -- our call a quarter ago, we ended the year with our largest amount of nonretained capacity in any given market, be it just under 17 megawatts coming back to us. It literally came back to us the 1st of the year. The customer had both physical and economic occupancy of the suite until the year changed. It's across multiple suites, across numerous campuses in Ashburn. We're going to -- we're refurbing that capacity and getting it back out to the market. Of that 17 megawatts, I can tell you, we've already released to a new customer, they haven't commenced yet, but they're selling for it 2.3 megawatts. We're likely to take another 2.3 megawatt suite and convert that to product-type colocation, given the success of our offering in the market. 
And then we've got a pretty strong pipeline for those other opportunities of vacancy, and it's it is a bit serendipitous in our favor that we've had some success in Ashburn despite the broader market challenges is that we're being able to focus all our efforts in re-leasing that capacity because our newest building doesn't come online until roughly the 1st of July. 
So really, it's that downtime until we get the new customers in new shapes and forms, certainly taking a temporal hit to 2021 in the first quarter."

As you can see, Jon, our guidance for recurring CapEx for all of 2020 is roughly the same number as prior year. So $220 million, I believe, or $230-ish million. So we had a little bit of fourth quarter catch up in there. 
Just the only major items, we had a -- we had some refreshed capital on some second-generation space that I think we're converting to colocation when a PDB or a TKF customer had exited.

I think that's a product of the, call it, maturation of our portfolio and re-customering to new types of customers in different shapes of forms.

There's obviously the activity we are seeing coming through our renewal activity, both in the fourth quarter as it trajected throughout the year. And we had consistent progress to the point where we had positive plus 1 megawatt cash renewal spread in 4Q. Some of the stronger markets were renewed and signing through there. Santa Clara was a standout in that renewal. 
We have not -- our guidance includes a slightly negative outlook for the cash mark to markets. But I know we use the language there instead of exact numbers. I think our language is less conservative than it was last year. So I think we're moving into better territory. 
If you look at just the lease expiration schedule in 2021, I think we're getting into a better place, both in volume, mix and mark-to-market relative to recent history. You called out, particularly the greater than 1 megawatt category, which is, call it, 7.5-ish percent of our expirations, down from a high of, call it, over 10% at one point. It's pretty diverse with no market other than Ashburn being even greater than 1%. And the mix and geographically, you're seeing a sizable part component from not only Santa Clara or tighter U.S. market, but also our international markets in the coming contract. 
And then last but not least, just looking at the new signings because I have more of a forward indicator of what to come, the -- by and large, in the greater than megawatt category, we saw pretty good firmness in the pricing. And as I say, strengths in the Americas were, call it, New York, Chicago, I just -- I'm looking at all schedule let me. 
In the greater than 1 megawatt, you had pretty much stability in both Northern Virginia and Portland, again, it goes back to that structure. I mentioned previously, where the customer is taking down shelves at pre-committed rates at their discretion. So really not room for negotiation there and the desire for them to grow with adjacency. And then EMEA, we saw strength in the greater megawatt plus category for Zurich and Marseille were in particular stand out markets. And then last but not least, Singapore, that market has been a star. I think you're going to see that continue into 2021, and that is certainly a market where we're doing a sizable amount of megawatt plus activity as well."

On the schedule, the volume has stepped up about 13% to 221.5 megawatts. The pre-leasing has remained roughly intact at 55%. 
If you go market by market, I think you're accurate in seeing this trend of a larger and larger share of our new capacity capital going outside the United States. The Americas region is a little muted because we delivered capacity that was 400% pre-leased in Ashburn and the shell, which will show up with megawatts on the schedule, I think, in a quarter or so, just hasn't popped in here. But I still think the thesis is constant. And you're seeing also a year-over-year improvement on the yields in the Americas. 
And I think another relevant data point is the non-U.S. markets are also becoming more diverse. In EMEA, as I rattled off at the very beginning of the call, rather ineloquently, was across 6 different EMEA markets with north of a megawatt signings. You can see on the schedule from Amsterdam to Zurich, numerous markets with capacity coming online.

And will leave it at that."

But in general, I think we're looking for one of our good customers that and probably more than 1 to tell us they really want us to go into that market and then they'll sign an anchor lease with us. 
As far as existing markets are concerned, those are almost always expansions with existing customers. And that business, to be quite candid, is fast and furious. In some instances, I would say the challenge is just keeping up with demand in existing markets with -- particularly the hyperscales."

Yes, it stepped down quarter-over-quarter, but it was up 4% from the prior quarter, and 3Q was quite an outsized winner in terms of interconnection signings. 
The cast of characters are similar in terms of the type of verticals industry-wise that we've experienced in the past. Regionally, some of the star, I would say, the EMEA region was definitely a standout in this category, not just in the fourth quarter, but on a full year basis. I believe their interconnection revenue was, call it, up into the double digits type growth trajectory. 
I also -- I know you didn't quite ask this question, I also really look at these things, part and parcel with the less than 1 megawatt signings because they also often go hand-in-hand in terms of our most interconnection rich type customers, day 1 and certainly post landing with digital. I would say we put up the third quarter -- or fourth quarter in a row of consecutive growth in that category off a really strong 3Q. We put a record year up and call the interconnection and less than 1 megawatt of colocation-type signage category. Those are also led by EMEA, but APAC played a great role. We've launched now our colocation offering in Osaka and Singapore and Hong Kong and our first carrier-neutral offering in Seoul, South Korea are right around the corner. So great early days in that category as well, regionally. 
So we're definitely expanding the breadth of the product offering across more and more markets and pleased with the success we're seeing in both the interconnection and the, call it, enterprise and network-oriented less than 1 megawatt category."

I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the fourth quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. 
First, we further strengthened our connections with our customers, meeting more of their needs beyond the U.S. and reaching a much broader set of enterprise customers with our enhanced colocation and interconnection product offerings. We delivered extremely solid current period financial results, delivering full year FFO per share that was nearly 4% above our initial guidance. 
We extended our global platform, providing customers with a gateway into Southeastern Europe and runway for growth around the world with strategic land purchases and new development starts.

The fourth quarter capped off a transformational year for Digital Realty. We acquired several highly connected assets, including the Westin Building in North America and Interxion in EMEA, along with the leading colocation and interconnection providers in Southeastern Europe, significantly expanding our platform in EMEA while trimming noncore assets in North America.  
We delivered record bookings for the full year, an extraordinary performance under any set of circumstances, but particularly amid the headwinds of a global pandemic.  
Our business is increasingly global. In 2020, we nearly doubled the number of countries where Digital Realty has a presence, and EMEA accounted for more than half our fourth quarter bookings, the first time ever a majority of our bookings has been outside the Americas. We more than doubled our cross-connect count in 2020, reflecting the growing concentration of network-dense, highly connected assets on PlatformDIGITAL.  
We landed a record number of new logos in 2020, more than twice as many as our previous record, in fact, driving consistent growth in our enterprise colocation and interconnection business. The vibrant communities on our campus environments are attracting a growing set of new customers, diversifying and solidifying our revenue streams. Service providers and enterprises alike are strengthening their partnership with a select number of trusted global data center partners to help meet their growing needs around the world, and Digital Realty is uniquely well positioned to serve as their partner of choice.  
Let's turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on Page 3. In October, we formally committed to reducing direct and indirect emissions by 68% and  indirect emissions in our value chain by area by 24% by 2030, in line with a 1.5-degree climate change scenario. We set our target with science-based targets initiative, along with over 1,000 organizations that have committed to reduce emissions. And we also signed the UN Global Compact business ambition for 1.5-degree C, joining leading companies who have committed to ambitious carbon reduction targets.  
In early December, we announced that our operations in France were on target to achieve a carbon-neutral footprint by the end of the year and are expected to remain carbon neutral through 2030 for both existing facilities and future expansion based on Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  
In mid-December, we were honored to receive Nareit's Leader in the Light Award for data center sustainability for the fourth consecutive year. In early January, we issued our fifth green bond, extending our lead as the largest U.S. REIT issuer bonds committed to sustainable investments. Our green bond framework is aligned with leading global best practices, including GRESB's green bond principles as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals. And Sustainalytics has provided an independent second-party opinion concluding that our green bond program is considered robust, credible and transparent.  
We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society.  
In terms of our social efforts, we recently selected diversity, equity and inclusion as 1 of 4 company-wide philanthropic areas of focus in addition to sustainability, disaster relief and STEM education. As you may be aware, Nareit recently instituted a dividend through diversity and inclusion program, which I am honored to be co-chairing along with Tom Baltimore of Park Hotels  and Debbie Cafaro of Ventas. Dividends through diversity will promote the recruitment, inclusion and advancement of women, minorities and other underrepresented groups in REITs in the broader commercial real estate industry.  
We have also joined leaders across 85 industries in signing the CEO pledge on CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, an initiative that aims to rally the business community to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace and to cultivate a trusting environment where employees feel empowered to have discussions on these topics. 
Participating in these programs and others like them is critical to our industry's future because it is the right thing to do and because we serve a broad, diverse community. And we believe that to help our customers prepare for the future, we need industry professionals whose insights and perspectives reflect the communities we serve. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role in advancing our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities we serve around the world.  
Let's turn now to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to expand our global platform with the acquisition of the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Southeastern Europe, groundbreakings in existing markets across EMEA and strategic land purchase on the continent and in Asia Pacific.  
In early November, we acquired Lamda Helix, the largest carrier-neutral colocation and interconnection provider in Greece, led by an accomplished management team who will continue to manage the business. As leading service providers continue to expand their footprint, we expect Greece and other parts of Southeastern Europe will be major beneficiaries. We are well positioned to capture the key cloud and connectivity deployments that will accelerate the region's digital transformation.  
In Denmark, we began construction on our third data center, adjacent to the 2 existing facilities on our Copenhagen campus and offering direct access to leading global cloud providers, numerous networks, Internet exchanges and a transatlantic subsea cable system.  
We also broke ground on a new data center in Zurich, where we've seen robust demand from leading global service providers. The expansion of our Zurich campus will provide runway for customer growth at the leading cloud and interconnection hub in Switzerland.  
We also acquired a land parcel within 1 kilometer of our highly interconnected campus in Vienna. And halfway around the globe in Sydney, we are under contract to acquire 2 parcels that will support the development of up to 250 megawatts. 
These strategic land holdings will provide additional capacity, enabling local and global service providers to seamlessly expand adjacent to their existing deployments.  
Let's turn to Page 5 for an update on the Interxion integration. The successful integration of Interxion was our top priority for 2020, and we made excellent progress despite the pandemic. We have built a solid foundation for the assimilation of our businesses, and we are well on our way to achieving the objectives and synergies we outlined when we first announced the transaction. I'm proud of what we've accomplished to date and excited about our prospects as we move into the implementation phase in 2021. 
When we announced the transaction, we stated that the combined company would have enhanced capabilities to address and solve the public and hybrid cloud architecture requirements of our global customer base that would allow us to build upon each company's current relationships with leading global customers while also enabling us to effectively compete in the broader target markets.  
The early results are very promising. We've enjoyed excellent success with global platform providers, and early cross-selling wins have surpassed expectations with numerous referrals between the sales teams. 
The significant embedded growth potential was another key element of the Interxion investment thesis. We believe the combined organization has already created significant long-term value by executing on the existing development pipeline, acquiring the freehold to the land under key positions in Frankfurt and Paris and securing land in key markets to support future growth.  
Let's turn to demand drivers on Page 6. We continue to be fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. As the leading global data center provider, we have a unique vantage point that enables us to detect secular trends as they emerge. We recently introduced the Data Gravity Index, which measures, quantifies and forecasts the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. This groundbreaking index is a byproduct of our market intelligence analysis as well as our obsessive focus on understanding customers' deployments and supporting their evolving infrastructure needs.  
Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of Data Gravity. According to the market intelligence firm, IDC, 80% of the world's data will reside within enterprises by the year 2025. A 451 Research global IT leader survey recently found that 87% of IT leaders will need to maintain local copies of critical data at global points of presence to meet regulatory requirements. We continue to see these indicators as enterprises expand their private data infrastructure deployments and integrate data exchange with adjacent business and service provider partners across our global platform.  
Digital Realty recently received Frost & Sullivan's APAC Data Center Strategy Innovator Award, recognizing PlatformDIGITAL for providing an innovative global platform, enabling enterprises to scale digital transformation in a consistent, modular fashion and addressing the unique infrastructure requirements for integrating private data flows across multiple public platforms. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market-leading innovation to meeting the needs of our global data center customer base. 
Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store.  
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results."

Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 8. We signed total bookings of $130 million in the fourth quarter, including a $12 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise-oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less totaled $",1666,"Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 8. We signed total bookings of $130 million in the fourth quarter, including a $12 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise-oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less totaled $31 million, building upon the consistent momentum throughout the year and demonstrating the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand.  
The weighted average lease term was over 8 years. We secured 120 new logos during the quarter, with more than half of those new logos landing in EMEA, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. EMEA accounted for more than half of our fourth quarter bookings, while Asia Pacific contributed over 15%. As Bill mentioned, this was the first time the majority of our bookings were outside the Americas.  
In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a rapidly growing cloud-based cybersecurity provider selected PlatformDIGITAL for multiple environments in London and Boston to facilitate modernization and embrace high-performance compute technology while maintaining an exceptional user experience.  
In New York, the Digital Realty's team's deep understanding of a global retailer's growth strategy enabled us to tailor a solution for their Americas markets on PlatformDIGITAL. We also overcame lockdowns and international travel restrictions to demonstrate to a digital telecom provider how they can leverage PlatformDIGITAL to meet their current and future growth requirements in existing and targeted markets at their required pace.  
A rapidly growing gaming platform expanded their edge to rewire their network and optimize data exchange with third-party clouds, the growth of their existing footprint with us in Northern Virginia and a new deployment in Chicago. Likewise in Chicago, a global exchange operator leveraged PlatformDIGITAL to extend their access into our highly interconnected community. 
In Singapore, 2 leading global financial services firms expanded with Digital Realty due to our platform offering and long history of operational excellence, while a software developer selected PlatformDIGITAL to expand their proprietary cloud offering into the region.  
Turning to our backlog on Page 10. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced reached an all-time high of $269 million. The step-up from $229 million last quarter reflects $70 million of commencements during the fourth quarter, offset by roughly $118 million of combined space and power leases signed. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at 8.5 months.  
Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 11. We signed $156 million of renewals during the fourth quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average term loan renewals signed during the fourth quarter was a little over 3 years, reflecting a roughly even split in the mix between deals above and below 1 megawatt.  
Cash re-leasing spreads on renewals were plus 1%, and cash rents were positive on renewals above and below 1 megawatt, an encouraging sign for pricing. We retained 79% of expiring leases, in line with our long-term historical average.  
In terms of fourth quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy improved 40 basis points, driven primarily by leases commencing on recent deliveries in Ashburn and the sale of a vacant building in Amsterdam. Same-capital occupancy was down 40 basis points from the third quarter due to no move-outs, partially offset by positive absorption in Silicon Valley and Chicago. Same-capital cash NOI growth has continued to improve since bottoming in 2019 and ticked up slightly to negative 1.6% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, same-capital cash NOI growth was negative 1.9% or a little over 100 basis points better than initially expected.  
As a reminder, the Westin Building, Interxion, Lamda Helix and Altus IT are not yet included in the same-store pool, but we expect each of these acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward.  
Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 12. The U.S. dollar softened in the second half of the year, providing a bit of an FX tailwind in the fourth quarter relative to the prior year average. Overall, FX represented roughly a 50 basis point tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective.  
In terms of vertical concentration, as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we are fortunate to be primarily serving customers whose businesses are thriving in the current environment, with limited exposure to the sectors most negatively impacted. Rent collections remain in line with our historical average, and requests for rent relief have largely subsided. 
In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have roughly a 50 basis point impact on our full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded.  
In terms of earnings growth, the fourth quarter core FFO per share was down 0.6% year-over-year, but $0.08 ahead of consensus, driven primarily by operational outperformance. For the full year, core FFO per share came in $0.22 or nearly 4% ahead of our initial guidance. As previewed on our third quarter call, we expect to deliver double-digit revenue growth driven by a full year contribution from Interxion and the record colocation and interconnection and overall bookings in 2020. We expect the EBITDA margin will remain in line with the fourth quarter throughout 2021.  
As Bill mentioned, we remain on track to achieve the synergies we underwrote on the Interxion transaction, although the rationale for the deal has always been accelerating revenue growth rather than realizing expense synergies.  
We have already made great strides on our financing plans for the year with a highly successful 1 billion green eurobond offering in early January at 5/8, in addition to solid progress on the capital recycling front. As always, we expect to remain nimble for the rest of the year, and we may look to capitalize on favorable market conditions to lock in long-term fixed rate financing at attractive coupons across the currencies that support our assets to proactively manage future liabilities.  
In terms of FFO per share guidance, our forecast is largely unchanged from the preliminary outlook we previewed on the third quarter call, although the year-over-year bar has been raised in the interim, given the outperformance in the fourth quarter. At the midpoint, our 2021 guidance represents growth of approximately 4%, which includes near-term dilution from capital recycling.  
In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect the split between the first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately 49/51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect to dip down by about a $0.05 in the first quarter, then to ramp up fairly steadily over the rest of the year.  
In terms of the quarterly dividend, the distribution policy is ultimately a Board-level decision. Given the continued growth in our cash flows and taxable income, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend just as we have each and every year since our IPO in 2004.  
Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. During the fourth quarter, we continued to execute on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets.  
Fixed charge coverage reached 5.1x, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was slightly elevated at 6.1x as of year-end, but is expected to come back down in line with our long-term range over the course of the year through a combination of proceeds from asset sales and growth in cash flows as leases commenced from the record leasing activity in 2020.  
In mid-October, we redeemed GBP 300 million of our 4.75% sterling bonds due in 2023. We also redeemed $250 million of high coupon series D preferred at 5 7/8. In early January, we raised GBP 1 billion of 10.5-year green eurobonds at an all-time low coupon for Digital Realty of 0.625%. We also retired $350 million of 2.75% bonds due in 2023, and we repaid all 3 -- $530 million outstanding on the term loan due in 2023. This successful execution against our financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides the access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth.  
As you can see from the chart on Page 14, we've extended our weighted average debt maturity out nearly 7 years while ratcheting our weighted average coupon down to 2.3%. A little over half our debt is Euro-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform post Interxion and acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling.  
Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 14, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out-years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy.  
This concludes our prepared remarks. Now we will be pleased to take your questions. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

I can probably kick it off on the question on the multi-megawatt side, and then I'll probably hand it over to Greg to speak to M&A. 
So very pleased with results overall in terms of 4Q. I think the diversity of the platform really shined through in both categories, not only the less than 1 megawatt in interconnection, but also in the scale or hyperscale plus. 
If you do a quick kind of run through the regions, EMEA, first time, more than 50% of signings. It was very diverse. There were 6 different markets across EMEA that did a north of 1 megawatt deal each. So it was London, Paris, Marseille, and 2 others that escaped my mind. And then over in the Americas, we had both in Ashburn and also in Hillsboro. And the cast of characters for all these are a combination of the major CSPs, SaaS providers and, call it, the B2C hyperscalers as well. 
And then last but not least, pleased with the results in both Brazil, and we signed our second customer into Santiago, Chile. In the hyperscale arena, another top CSP. And then last but not least, had a project with a top 3 CSP down in Sydney. So really diverse contribution from numerous major metros. 
And I'll turn it over to Greg to pick up on the M&A piece."

I think Andy mentioned to you the regional variances that we've had, meaning first time that EMEA is our largest region for sales and for bookings there. So that was really good and positive. So we feel good about it.

And then also, we're seeing strength from those industries that were strong prior to the pandemic: cloud, digital media, et cetera. 
And then those that are being -- kind of suffering a little bit from it, we're seeing them maintain their IT services, and they still got to continue to have our support to go after their mission-critical needs. 
So we're happy about it. And as we mentioned earlier, year-on-year record growth from new logos, stand-alone, really good success from digital and Interxion as we combine the 2 groups. So real happy with the funnel.

Let me -- I guess in the order, let's go to M&A first, then we can talk about divestitures, which are somewhat related. 
Look, I think with respect to M&A, as we've said before, look, we remain focused on integrating Interxion while doing a few tuck-in acquisitions, as we would call them, like Altus IT in Croatia and Lamda Helix in Greece. Look, we think the M&A is likely to be more episodic than annual. I think we've already said that. 
And look, as we look at the M&A environment right now, we would say it's probably gotten more competitive over the past year as additional capitals come into the space, but we also think this could serve to benefit us as we seek to dispose of assets in our capital recycling program. 
I think, look, with respect to our divestitures or capital recycling, our criteria for asset sales remains consistent with our prior commentary. We're seeking to sell noncore assets in select noncore markets. To date, we follow these criteria and dispose of various PBB assets and other quality stand-alone assets that really just are not part of our connected community -- excuse me, connected campus strategy. 
We're about $1.5 billion through the multiyear guidance we gave, which was to sell a few billion of assets over a few years. The good news for us is we don't need to sell these assets. So we have the ability to be strategic and only offer these assets when it's likely that we're going to receive a fair market value for the assets. And we do expect that these asset sales, that we'll recycle that capital and we'll provide some of the capital needed for our development program this year and going forward. 
Again, that's really the state of play. Again, tuck-in acquisitions are going to be more focused deals that are strategic, as both Croatian and Greece, where they're highly connected assets in the regions. The assets, combined with the management teams, provide a strong launching pad for further activity in the region, and that's really the way we -- that's the way we look at it. And we'll continue to try to find similar deals like these to the extent we can."

And I think you're mostly talking about the greater than 1 megawatt because I thought we had pretty strong pricing power on the less than a megawatt category, more enterprise network workloads landing in those sites. 
On the greater than 1 megawatt piece, it's a little bit of apples and oranges in comparing each market quarter-over-quarter. You're probably better off going back to the second quarter in terms of more apples-to-apples comparison volume. 
And then in the fourth quarter, we had a particular deal structure that make that skew, that stat lower in terms of reported results. You may recall a year or 2 ago, in the Ashburn market, we did a almost build-to-suit type project where we built a rather large 36-megawatt shell for a customer that was paying us for that shell on a long-term lease. And then we dropped down, built out a suite in 6-megawatt-or-so increments over time. 
So as those -- as take-downs of those suites happen, you're only getting a fraction of the entire economic cost for that customer flowing through our leasing stats because we already recognized the signing and already realizing the return on the shell. And that phenomenon happened actually in North America and also in Asia Pacific, this particular market. 
Strategically, I mean, it's a great tool in our toolkit that I would say not all competitors can really have. Really giving a customer the runway that they desire and the timing flexibility and digital with its scale and breadth of portfolio and as well as our land banks are able to kind of structure those type of transactions that I think is a strategic advantage for those type of customers."

It's a contributor to the, call it, 4Q to 1Q bridging of the quarterly rhythm of core FFO. 
Just kind of rough math. If we kind of just hit the low end of that range, $600 million, use the same type of cap rate we were using for the last outright sale we did, call it, mid- to low 6 cap, you call it about $40 million of NOI and our share count could be as high as 2%. Now that's assuming you sold the entirety of those assets the first day of the year, and you didn't have any redeployment of proceeds. So when you kind of use appropriate calendarization based on our expectations and also redeploy those proceeds, either paying down debt near term or in lieu of really equity, I would kind of ballpark it in a 50- to 100-ish type basis point headwind to our year-over-year growth, that is."

First, on your base, we definitely had some outperformance in the fourth quarter that we highlighted in the prepared remarks. Some of that was, call it, operational-related, just commencing revenue faster. But some of it was out of our control, and FX was a tailwind as you saw the U.S. dollar kind of plummet and then retrench beginning 2021. So that makes a little bit of an apples and oranges comparison between 4Q and the run rate for 2021. 
The answer to your question on the dispositions, we have -- other than a small one-off asset for, I think, $6 million, we have not executed on any of the next leg of capital recycling yet that we framed as a -- at a low range of $600 million, a high range of $1 billion. And we expect the low end of that range to be executed upon in the pretty near-term future here. Hence, when you sell that quantity of assets at -- even at a 6, 6.5 cap rate, you have immediate loss of that income. 
Just to remind you, Matt, and then the broader audience, the dilution near term, we think, a, is offset by longer-term accretion. We're selling noncore, slower growing parts of our portfolio and using that capital often in lieu of equity to fund our growth. And two, that dilution is baked within the approximately 4% year-over-year growth. So we're arriving at that year-over-year growth comparison off a outperformance in the last -- back half of this year and absorbing that dilution. So it's not incremental to the guidance that we've already laid out."

One, you've seen now a string of quarters in a row where we have a global platform offering for the hyperscalers and to address their pain points, future-proof their growth and deliver operational excellence across now 49 metros, 6 continents, 24 countries. So the trend has been our friend in terms of success there. I think if you look to our development pipeline, that stepped up about 13% quarter-over-quarter. Now 220 megawatts or so under development, still about 55-ish percent preleased. You've got to imagine there's a lot of hyperscale business in that. I think the returns have been pretty steady in that category, if not stepped up in certain regions. 
I'm not saying or blushing off that some of this business is competitive. I think our most competitive market is certainly the U.S. In that market, I think our value proposition has allowed us to, even in a challenged market like Ashburn, do particularly well with all of our customers, but hyperscalers, in particular. 
And I think if you then look where the pipeline is going and where the growth for our business is going, we're seeing more and more opportunities to generate higher returns from both our colocation and connection offering, but also serving those hyperscalers in places where we have a really differentiated value proposition, certainly, tighter markets like Santa Clara in the U.S., but international markets like Frankfurt, Marseille, Brazil and Singapore as well. 
So listen, not saying that hyperscale became an easy business overnight, but feel very good about what we're delivering to those customers."

The fourth quarter actually, I was pretty pleased with the customer retention and pricing dynamic in both categories in terms of pricing, in both categories in terms of retention, potentially call it in the 80s and positive mark-to-markets for both above and less than 1 megawatt. 
The impact that we see hitting 2021, but certainly the first quarter of 2021, really goes back to what I mentioned in my -- our call a quarter ago, we ended the year with our largest amount of nonretained capacity in any given market, be it just under 17 megawatts coming back to us. It literally came back to us the 1st of the year. The customer had both physical and economic occupancy of the suite until the year changed. It's across multiple suites, across numerous campuses in Ashburn. We're going to -- we're refurbing that capacity and getting it back out to the market. Of that 17 megawatts, I can tell you, we've already re-leased to a new customer. They haven't commenced yet, but they've signed for it 2.3 megawatts. We're likely to take another 2.3 megawatt suite and convert that to product-type colocation, given the success of our offering in the market. 
And then we've got a pretty strong pipeline for those other opportunities of vacancy, and it's -- it is a bit serendipitous in our favor that we've had some success in Ashburn despite the broader market challenges, is that we're being able to focus all our efforts in re-leasing that capacity because our newest building doesn't come online until roughly the 1st of July. 
So really, it's that downtime until we get the new customers in new shapes and forms, certainly taking a temporal hit to 2021 in the first quarter."

If you look at the -- I think it's schedule 28, recurring CapEx stepped down to as low as $34 million in the first quarter of '20, $38 million in the second quarter of '20, then $53 million and $83 million. So we did have a little bit of a catch-up period in terms of, call it, timing. 
As you can see, Jon, our guidance for recurring CapEx for all of 2020 is roughly the same number as prior year. So $220 million, I believe, or $230-ish million. So we had a little bit of fourth quarter catch-up in there. 
Just the only major items, we had a -- we had some refreshed capital on some second-generation space that I think we're converting to colocation when a PBB or a TKF customer had exited. So that kind of hits -- that's not first generation. So it hits through the recurring CapEx. I think that's a product of the, call it, maturation of our portfolio and re-customering to new types of customers in different shapes and forms. But I wouldn't -- you can't just annualize that as next year. You got to look to our guidance table for a more appropriate view for the full year 2021."

I mean, do you guys have a sense -- maybe if we just think about your greater than 1 megawatt tenant, do you have a sense of where the mark-to-market is on in-place rents versus market rents? 
And then I know you talked about your leasing spreads being relatively flat this year. But I mean, based off the market dynamics that you're seeing, what are your expectations for rent growth over this year and over the next few years? Are we to a point where we can start to see rents start to grow again?"

There's obviously the activity we are seeing coming through our renewal activity, both in the fourth quarter as it trajected throughout the year, and we had consistent progress to the point",415,"I think there's a couple of relevant data points to look at that. There's obviously the activity we are seeing coming through our renewal activity, both in the fourth quarter as it trajected throughout the year, and we had consistent progress to the point where we had positive plus 1 megawatt cash renewal spread in 4Q. Some of the stronger markets were renewed and signing through there. Santa Clara was a standout in that renewal. 
We have not -- our guidance includes a slightly negative outlook for the cash mark-to-markets. But I know we use the language there instead of exact numbers. I think our language is less conservative than it was last year. So I think we're moving into better territory. 
If you look at just the lease expiration schedule in 2021, I think we're getting into a better place, both in volume, mix and mark-to-market relative to recent history. You called out particularly the greater than 1 megawatt category, which is, call it, 7.5-ish percent of our expirations, down from a high of, call it, over 10% at one point. It's pretty diverse with no market other than Ashburn being even greater than 1%. And the mix and geographically, you're seeing a sizable part component from not only Santa Clara or tighter U.S. market, but also our international markets in the coming contract. 
And then last but not least, just looking at the new signings because I have more of a forward indicator of what to come, the -- by and large, in the greater than megawatt category, I saw -- we saw pretty good firmness in the pricing. And as I say, strengths in the Americas were, call it, New York, Chicago -- I'm looking at the wrong schedule. My bad. 
In the greater than 1 megawatt, you had pretty much stability in both Northern Virginia and Portland. Again, it goes back to that structure. I mentioned previously where the customer is taking down shelves at precommitted rates at their discretion. So really not room for negotiation there and the desire for them to grow with adjacency. And then EMEA, we saw strength in the greater than megawatt plus category, for Zurich and Marseille were, in particular, stand-out markets. And then last but not least, Singapore, that market has been a star, and I think you're going to see that continue into 2021. And that is certainly a market where we're doing a sizable amount of megawatt plus activity as well."

And just separately, curious to go back to one of the comments, I think Bill made it at the beginning of the call, describing that some of the larger customers are choosing a select number of global data center partners. I'm curious, just on that theme, are you seeing a greater percentage of your large customers embrace multiple providers? Or are you seeing more of a winner-take-all evolution where one data center provider could take the disproportionate share of business from some of these customers?"

The development pipeline, one, what you're missing from here is because it's a unconsolidated self-managed joint venture. Ascenty is not on the schedule, but we've seen tremendous activity in Latin America, including continued growth in Brazil, not only our first but second customer into Santiago, Chile and probably expect to experience the same in terms of our second customers landing into Mexico City. 
On the schedule, the volume has stepped up about 13% to 221.5 megawatts. The preleasing has remained roughly intact at 55%. If you go market by market, I think you're accurate in seeing this trend of a larger and larger share of our new capacity capital going outside the United States. The Americas region is a little muted because we delivered capacity that was 400% preleased in Ashburn and the shell, which will show up with megawatts on the schedule, I think, in a quarter or so, just hasn't popped in here. But I still think the thesis is constant. And you're seeing also a year-over-year improvement on the yields in the Americas. 
And I think another relevant data point is the non-U.S. markets are also becoming more diverse. In EMEA, as I rattled off at the very beginning of the call, rather ineloquently, was across 6 different EMEA markets with north of a megawatt signings. You can see on the schedule, from Amsterdam to Zurich, numerous markets with capacity coming online. And I think the same phenomenon is going to happen -- or continue to happen in the APAC region as well."

Yes, it stepped down quarter-over-quarter, but it was up 4% from the prior quarter. And 3Q was quite a outsized winner in terms of interconnection signings. 
The cast of characters are similar in terms of the type of verticals industry-wise that we've experienced in the past. Regionally, some of the star -- I would say, the EMEA region was definitely a standout in this category, not just in the fourth quarter, but on a full year basis. I believe their interconnection revenue was, call it, up into the double digits type growth trajectory. 
I also -- I know you didn't quite ask this question, I also really look at these things part and parcel with the less than 1 megawatt signings because they also often go hand-in-hand in terms of our most interconnection rich type customers day 1 and certainly post landing with digital. I would say we put up the third quarter -- or fourth quarter in a row of consecutive growth in that category off a really strong 3Q. We put a record year up and call the interconnection and less than 1 megawatt of colocation-type signage category. Those are also led by EMEA, but APAC played a great role. We've launched now our colocation offering in Osaka, Singapore and Hong Kong, and our first carrier-neutral offering in Seoul, South Korea are right around the corner. So great early days in that category as well, regionally. 
So we're definitely expanding the breadth of the product offering across more and more markets and pleased with the success we're seeing in both the interconnection and the, call it, enterprise and network-oriented less than 1 megawatt category."

The fourth quarter capped off a transformational year for Digital Realty. We acquired several highly connected assets, including the Westin Building in North America and Interxion in EMEA, along with the leading colocation and interconnection providers in Southeastern Europe, significantly expanding our platform in EMEA while trimming noncore assets in North America.  
We delivered record bookings for the full year, an extraordinary performance under any set of circumstances, but particularly amid the headwinds of a global pandemic.  
Our business is increasingly global. In 2020, we nearly doubled the number of countries where Digital Realty has a presence, and EMEA accounted for more than half our fourth quarter bookings, the first time ever a majority of our bookings has been outside the Americas. We more than doubled our cross-connect count in 2020, reflecting the growing concentration of network-dense, highly connected assets on PlatformDIGITAL.  
We landed a record number of new logos in 2020, more than twice as many as our previous record, in fact, driving consistent growth in our enterprise colocation and interconnection business. The vibrant communities on our campus environments are attracting a growing set of new customers, diversifying and solidifying our revenue streams. Service providers and enterprises alike are strengthening their partnership with a select number of trusted global data center partners to help meet their growing needs around the world, and Digital Realty is uniquely well positioned to serve as their partner of choice.  
Let's turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on Page 3. In October, we formally committed to reducing direct and indirect emissions by 68% and  indirect emissions in our value chain by area by 24% by 2030, in line with a 1.5-degree climate change scenario. We set our target with science-based targets initiative, along with over 1,000 organizations that have committed to reduce emissions. And we also signed the UN Global Compact business ambition for 1.5-degree C, joining leading companies who have committed to ambitious carbon reduction targets.  
In early December, we announced that our operations in France were on target to achieve a carbon-neutral footprint by the end of the year and are expected to remain carbon neutral through 2030 for both existing facilities and future expansion based on Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  
In mid-December, we were honored to receive Nareit's Leader in the Light Award for data center sustainability for the fourth consecutive year. In early January, we issued our fifth green bond, extending our lead as the largest U.S. REIT issuer bonds committed to sustainable investments. Our green bond framework is aligned with leading global best practices, including GRESB's green bond principles as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals. And Sustainalytics has provided an independent second-party opinion concluding that our green bond program is considered robust, credible and transparent.  
We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society.  
In terms of our social efforts, we recently selected diversity, equity and inclusion as 1 of 4 company-wide philanthropic areas of focus in addition to sustainability, disaster relief and STEM education. As you may be aware, Nareit recently instituted a dividend through diversity and inclusion program, which I am honored to be co-chairing along with Tom Baltimore of Park Hotels  and Debbie Cafaro of Ventas. Dividends through diversity will promote the recruitment, inclusion and advancement of women, minorities and other underrepresented groups in REITs in the broader commercial real estate industry.  
We have also joined leaders across 85 industries in signing the CEO pledge on CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, an initiative that aims to rally the business community to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace and to cultivate a trusting environment where employees feel empowered to have discussions on these topics. 
Participating in these programs and others like them is critical to our industry's future because it is the right thing to do and because we serve a broad, diverse community. And we believe that to help our customers prepare for the future, we need industry professionals whose insights and perspectives reflect the communities we serve. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role in advancing our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities we serve around the world.  
Let's turn now to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to expand our global platform with the acquisition of the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Southeastern Europe, groundbreakings in existing markets across EMEA and strategic land purchase on the continent and in Asia Pacific.  
In early November, we acquired Lamda Helix, the largest carrier-neutral colocation and interconnection provider in Greece, led by an accomplished management team who will continue to manage the business. As leading service providers continue to expand their footprint, we expect Greece and other parts of Southeastern Europe will be major beneficiaries. We are well positioned to capture the key cloud and connectivity deployments that will accelerate the region's digital transformation.  
In Denmark, we began construction on our third data center, adjacent to the 2 existing facilities on our Copenhagen campus and offering direct access to leading global cloud providers, numerous networks, Internet exchanges and a transatlantic subsea cable system.  
We also broke ground on a new data center in Zurich, where we've seen robust demand from leading global service providers. The expansion of our Zurich campus will provide runway for customer growth at the leading cloud and interconnection hub in Switzerland.  
We also acquired a land parcel within 1 kilometer of our highly interconnected campus in Vienna. And halfway around the globe in Sydney, we are under contract to acquire 2 parcels that will support the development of up to 250 megawatts. 
These strategic land holdings will provide additional capacity, enabling local and global service providers to seamlessly expand adjacent to their existing deployments.  
Let's turn to Page 5 for an update on the Interxion integration. The successful integration of Interxion was our top priority for 2020, and we made excellent progress despite the pandemic. We have built a solid foundation for the assimilation of our businesses, and we are well on our way to achieving the objectives and synergies we outlined when we first announced the transaction. I'm proud of what we've accomplished to date and excited about our prospects as we move into the implementation phase in 2021. 
When we announced the transaction, we stated that the combined company would have enhanced capabilities to address and solve the public and hybrid cloud architecture requirements of our global customer base that would allow us to build upon each company's current relationships with leading global customers while also enabling us to effectively compete in the broader target markets.  
The early results are very promising. We've enjoyed excellent success with global platform providers, and early cross-selling wins have surpassed expectations with numerous referrals between the sales teams. 
The significant embedded growth potential was another key element of the Interxion investment thesis. We believe the combined organization has already created significant long-term value by executing on the existing development pipeline, acquiring the freehold to the land under key positions in Frankfurt and Paris and securing land in key markets to support future growth.  
Let's turn to demand drivers on Page 6. We continue to be fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. As the leading global data center provider, we have a unique vantage point that enables us to detect secular trends as they emerge. We recently introduced the Data Gravity Index, which measures, quantifies and forecasts the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. This groundbreaking index is a byproduct of our market intelligence analysis as well as our obsessive focus on understanding customers' deployments and supporting their evolving infrastructure needs.  
Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of Data Gravity. According to the market intelligence firm, IDC, 80% of the world's data will reside within enterprises by the year 2025. A 451 Research global IT leader survey recently found that 87% of IT leaders will need to maintain local copies of critical data at global points of presence to meet regulatory requirements. We continue to see these indicators as enterprises expand their private data infrastructure deployments and integrate data exchange with adjacent business and service provider partners across our global platform.  
Digital Realty recently received Frost & Sullivan's APAC Data Center Strategy Innovator Award, recognizing PlatformDIGITAL for providing an innovative global platform, enabling enterprises to scale digital transformation in a consistent, modular fashion and addressing the unique infrastructure requirements for integrating private data flows across multiple public platforms. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market-leading innovation to meeting the needs of our global data center customer base. 
Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store.  
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results."

We signed total bookings of $130 million in the fourth quarter, including a $12 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise-oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less totaled $31 million, building upon the consistent momentum throughout the year and demonstrating the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand.  
The weighted average lease term was over 8 years. We secured 120 new logos during the quarter, with more than half of those new logos landing in EMEA, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. EMEA accounted for more than half of our fourth quarter bookings, while Asia Pacific contributed over 15%. As Bill mentioned, this was the first time the majority of our bookings were outside the Americas.  
In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a rapidly growing cloud-based cybersecurity provider selected PlatformDIGITAL for multiple environments in London and Boston to facilitate modernization and embrace high-performance compute technology while maintaining an exceptional user experience.  
In New York, the Digital Realty's team's deep understanding of a global retailer's growth strategy enabled us to tailor a solution for their Americas markets on PlatformDIGITAL. We also overcame lockdowns and international travel restrictions to demonstrate to a digital telecom provider how they can leverage PlatformDIGITAL to meet their current and future growth requirements in existing and targeted markets at their required pace.  
A rapidly growing gaming platform expanded their edge to rewire their network and optimize data exchange with third-party clouds, the growth of their existing footprint with us in Northern Virginia and a new deployment in Chicago. Likewise in Chicago, a global exchange operator leveraged PlatformDIGITAL to extend their access into our highly interconnected community. 
In Singapore, 2 leading global financial services firms expanded with Digital Realty due to our platform offering and long history of operational excellence, while a software developer selected PlatformDIGITAL to expand their proprietary cloud offering into the region.  
Turning to our backlog on Page 10. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced reached an all-time high of $269 million. The step-up from $229 million last quarter reflects $70 million of commencements during the fourth quarter, offset by roughly $118 million of combined space and power leases signed. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at 8.5 months.  
Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 11. We signed $156 million of renewals during the fourth quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average term loan renewals signed during the fourth quarter was a little over 3 years, reflecting a roughly even split in the mix between deals above and below 1 megawatt.  
Cash re-leasing spreads on renewals were plus 1%, and cash rents were positive on renewals above and below 1 megawatt, an encouraging sign for pricing. We retained 79% of expiring leases, in line with our long-term historical average.  
In terms of fourth quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy improved 40 basis points, driven primarily by leases commencing on recent deliveries in Ashburn and the sale of a vacant building in Amsterdam. Same-capital occupancy was down 40 basis points from the third quarter due to no move-outs, partially offset by positive absorption in Silicon Valley and Chicago. Same-capital cash NOI growth has continued to improve since bottoming in 2019 and ticked up slightly to negative 1.6% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, same-capital cash NOI growth was negative 1.9% or a little over 100 basis points better than initially expected.  
As a reminder, the Westin Building, Interxion, Lamda Helix and Altus IT are not yet included in the same-store pool, but we expect each of these acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward.  
Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 12. The U.S. dollar softened in the second half of the year, providing a bit of an FX tailwind in the fourth quarter relative to the prior year average. Overall, FX represented roughly a 50 basis point tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective.  
In terms of vertical concentration, as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we are fortunate to be primarily serving customers whose businesses are thriving in the current environment, with limited exposure to the sectors most negatively impacted. Rent collections remain in line with our historical average, and requests for rent relief have largely subsided. 
In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have roughly a 50 basis point impact on our full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded.  
In terms of earnings growth, the fourth quarter core FFO per share was down 0.6% year-over-year, but $0.08 ahead of consensus, driven primarily by operational outperformance. For the full year, core FFO per share came in $0.22 or nearly 4% ahead of our initial guidance. As previewed on our third quarter call, we expect to deliver double-digit revenue growth driven by a full year contribution from Interxion and the record colocation and interconnection and overall bookings in 2020. We expect the EBITDA margin will remain in line with the fourth quarter throughout 2021.  
As Bill mentioned, we remain on track to achieve the synergies we underwrote on the Interxion transaction, although the rationale for the deal has always been accelerating revenue growth rather than realizing expense synergies.  
We have already made great strides on our financing plans for the year with a highly successful 1 billion green eurobond offering in early January at 5/8, in addition to solid progress on the capital recycling front. As always, we expect to remain nimble for the rest of the year, and we may look to capitalize on favorable market conditions to lock in long-term fixed rate financing at attractive coupons across the currencies that support our assets to proactively manage future liabilities.  
In terms of FFO per share guidance, our forecast is largely unchanged from the preliminary outlook we previewed on the third quarter call, although the year-over-year bar has been raised in the interim, given the outperformance in the fourth quarter. At the midpoint, our 2021 guidance represents growth of approximately 4%, which includes near-term dilution from capital recycling.  
In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect the split between the first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately 49/51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect to dip down by about a $0.05 in the first quarter, then to ramp up fairly steadily over the rest of the year.  
In terms of the quarterly dividend, the distribution policy is ultimately a Board-level decision. Given the continued growth in our cash flows and taxable income, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend just as we have each and every year since our IPO in 2004.  
Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. During the fourth quarter, we continued to execute on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets.  
Fixed charge coverage reached 5.1x, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was slightly elevated at 6.1x as of year-end, but is expected to come back down in line with our long-term range over the course of the year through a combination of proceeds from asset sales and growth in cash flows as leases commenced from the record leasing activity in 2020.  
In mid-October, we redeemed GBP 300 million of our 4.75% sterling bonds due in 2023. We also redeemed $250 million of high coupon series D preferred at 5 7/8. In early January, we raised GBP 1 billion of 10.5-year green eurobonds at an all-time low coupon for Digital Realty of 0.625%. We also retired $350 million of 2.75% bonds due in 2023, and we repaid all 3 -- $530 million outstanding on the term loan due in 2023. This successful execution against our financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides the access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth.  
As you can see from the chart on Page 14, we've extended our weighted average debt maturity out nearly 7 years while ratcheting our weighted average coupon down to 2.3%. A little over half our debt is Euro-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform post Interxion and acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling.  
Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 14, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out-years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy.  
This concludes our prepared remarks. Now we will be pleased to take your questions. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

I can probably kick it off on the question on the multi-megawatt side, and then I'll probably hand it over to Greg to speak to M&A. 
So very pleased with results overall in terms of 4Q. I think the diversity of the platform really shined through in both categories, not only the less than 1 megawatt in interconnection, but also in the scale or hyperscale plus. 
If you do a quick kind of run through the regions, EMEA, first time, more than 50% of signings. It was very diverse. There were 6 different markets across EMEA that did a north of 1 megawatt deal each. So it was London, Paris, Marseille, and 2 others that escaped my mind. And then over in the Americas, we had both in Ashburn and also in Hillsboro. And the cast of characters for all these are a combination of the major CSPs, SaaS providers and, call it, the B2C hyperscalers as well. 
And then last but not least, pleased with the results in both Brazil, and we signed our second customer into Santiago, Chile. In the hyperscale arena, another top CSP. And then last but not least, had a project with a top 3 CSP down in Sydney. So really diverse contribution from numerous major metros. 
And I'll turn it over to Greg to pick up on the M&A piece."

I think Andy mentioned to you the regional variances that we've had, meaning first time that EMEA is our largest region for sales and for bookings there. So that was really good and positive. So we feel good about it. 
And then regarding the industries that I think you might have asked about, those that are work that are taking advantage of the current work-from-home are doing more and more quickly with us. And so we're happy about that and how we're supporting them. 
And then also, we're seeing strength from those industries that were strong prior to the pandemic: cloud, digital media, et cetera. 
And then those that are being -- kind of suffering a little bit from it, we're seeing them maintain their IT services, and they still got to continue to have our support to go after their mission-critical needs. 
So we're happy about it. And as we mentioned earlier, year-on-year record growth from new logos, stand-alone, really good success from digital and Interxion as we combine the 2 groups. So real happy with the funnel.

Let me -- I guess in the order, let's go to M&A first, then we can talk about divestitures, which are somewhat related. 
Look, I think with respect to M&A, as we've said before, look, we remain focused on integrating Interxion while doing a few tuck-in acquisitions, as we would call them, like Altus IT in Croatia and Lamda Helix in Greece. Look, we think the M&A is likely to be more episodic than annual. I think we've already said that. 
And look, as we look at the M&A environment right now, we would say it's probably gotten more competitive over the past year as additional capitals come into the space, but we also think this could serve to benefit us as we seek to dispose of assets in our capital recycling program. 
I think, look, with respect to our divestitures or capital recycling, our criteria for asset sales remains consistent with our prior commentary. We're seeking to sell noncore assets in select noncore markets. To date, we follow these criteria and dispose of various PBB assets and other quality stand-alone assets that really just are not part of our connected community -- excuse me, connected campus strategy. 
We're about $1.5 billion through the multiyear guidance we gave, which was to sell a few billion of assets over a few years. The good news for us is we don't need to sell these assets. So we have the ability to be strategic and only offer these assets when it's likely that we're going to receive a fair market value for the assets. And we do expect that these asset sales, that we'll recycle that capital and we'll provide some of the capital needed for our development program this year and going forward. 
Again, that's really the state of play. Again, tuck-in acquisitions are going to be more focused deals that are strategic, as both Croatian and Greece, where they're highly connected assets in the regions. The assets, combined with the management teams, provide a strong launching pad for further activity in the region, and that's really the way we -- that's the way we look at it. And we'll continue to try to find similar deals like these to the extent we can."

And I think you're mostly talking about the greater than 1 megawatt because I thought we had pretty strong pricing power on the less than a megawatt category, more enterprise network workloads landing in those sites. 
On the greater than 1 megawatt piece, it's a little bit of apples and oranges in comparing each market quarter-over-quarter. You're probably better off going back to the second quarter in terms of more apples-to-apples comparison volume. 
And then in the fourth quarter, we had a particular deal structure that make that skew, that stat lower in terms of reported results. You may recall a year or 2 ago, in the Ashburn market, we did a almost build-to-suit type project where we built a rather large 36-megawatt shell for a customer that was paying us for that shell on a long-term lease. And then we dropped down, built out a suite in 6-megawatt-or-so increments over time. 
So as those -- as take-downs of those suites happen, you're only getting a fraction of the entire economic cost for that customer flowing through our leasing stats because we already recognized the signing and already realizing the return on the shell. And that phenomenon happened actually in North America and also in Asia Pacific, this particular market. 
Strategically, I mean, it's a great tool in our toolkit that I would say not all competitors can really have. Really giving a customer the runway that they desire and the timing flexibility and digital with its scale and breadth of portfolio and as well as our land banks are able to kind of structure those type of transactions that I think is a strategic advantage for those type of customers."

It's a contributor to the, call it, 4Q to 1Q bridging of the quarterly rhythm of core FFO. 
Just kind of rough math. If we kind of just hit the low end of that range, $600 million, use the same type of cap rate we were using for the last outright sale we did, call it, mid- to low 6 cap, you call it about $40 million of NOI and our share count could be as high as 2%. Now that's assuming you sold the entirety of those assets the first day of the year, and you didn't have any redeployment of proceeds. So when you kind of use appropriate calendarization based on our expectations and also redeploy those proceeds, either paying down debt near term or in lieu of really equity, I would kind of ballpark it in a 50- to 100-ish type basis point headwind to our year-over-year growth, that is."

First, on your base, we definitely had some outperformance in the fourth quarter that we highlighted in the prepared remarks. Some of that was, call it, operational-related, just commencing revenue faster. But some of it was out of our control, and FX was a tailwind as you saw the U.S. dollar kind of plummet and then retrench beginning 2021. So that makes a little bit of an apples and oranges comparison between 4Q and the run rate for 2021. 
The answer to your question on the dispositions, we have -- other than a small one-off asset for, I think, $6 million, we have not executed on any of the next leg of capital recycling yet that we framed as a -- at a low range of $600 million, a high range of $1 billion. And we expect the low end of that range to be executed upon in the pretty near-term future here. Hence, when you sell that quantity of assets at -- even at a 6, 6.5 cap rate, you have immediate loss of that income. 
Just to remind you, Matt, and then the broader audience, the dilution near term, we think, a, is offset by longer-term accretion. We're selling noncore, slower growing parts of our portfolio and using that capital often in lieu of equity to fund our growth. And two, that dilution is baked within the approximately 4% year-over-year growth. So we're arriving at that year-over-year growth comparison off a outperformance in the last -- back half of this year and absorbing that dilution. So it's not incremental to the guidance that we've already laid out."

On",302,"Yes, I think the -- a couple of data points that I would say point to our continued confidence in the opportunity set and really differentiated offering that I think allows us to outshine our competitors, especially any fledging or newer competitors. 
One, you've seen now a string of quarters in a row where we have a global platform offering for the hyperscalers and to address their pain points, future-proof their growth and deliver operational excellence across now 49 metros, 6 continents, 24 countries. So the trend has been our friend in terms of success there. I think if you look to our development pipeline, that stepped up about 13% quarter-over-quarter. Now 220 megawatts or so under development, still about 55-ish percent preleased. You've got to imagine there's a lot of hyperscale business in that. I think the returns have been pretty steady in that category, if not stepped up in certain regions. 
I'm not saying or blushing off that some of this business is competitive. I think our most competitive market is certainly the U.S. In that market, I think our value proposition has allowed us to, even in a challenged market like Ashburn, do particularly well with all of our customers, but hyperscalers, in particular. 
And I think if you then look where the pipeline is going and where the growth for our business is going, we're seeing more and more opportunities to generate higher returns from both our colocation and connection offering, but also serving those hyperscalers in places where we have a really differentiated value proposition, certainly, tighter markets like Santa Clara in the U.S., but international markets like Frankfurt, Marseille, Brazil and Singapore as well. 
So listen, not saying that hyperscale became an easy business overnight, but feel very good about what we're delivering to those customers."

The fourth quarter actually, I was pretty pleased with the customer retention and pricing dynamic in both categories in terms of pricing, in both categories in terms of retention, potentially call it in the 80s and positive mark-to-markets for both above and less than 1 megawatt. 
The impact that we see hitting 2021, but certainly the first quarter of 2021, really goes back to what I mentioned in my -- our call a quarter ago, we ended the year with our largest amount of nonretained capacity in any given market, be it just under 17 megawatts coming back to us. It literally came back to us the 1st of the year. The customer had both physical and economic occupancy of the suite until the year changed. It's across multiple suites, across numerous campuses in Ashburn. We're going to -- we're refurbing that capacity and getting it back out to the market. Of that 17 megawatts, I can tell you, we've already re-leased to a new customer. They haven't commenced yet, but they've signed for it 2.3 megawatts. We're likely to take another 2.3 megawatt suite and convert that to product-type colocation, given the success of our offering in the market. 
And then we've got a pretty strong pipeline for those other opportunities of vacancy, and it's -- it is a bit serendipitous in our favor that we've had some success in Ashburn despite the broader market challenges, is that we're being able to focus all our efforts in re-leasing that capacity because our newest building doesn't come online until roughly the 1st of July. 
So really, it's that downtime until we get the new customers in new shapes and forms, certainly taking a temporal hit to 2021 in the first quarter."

So we did have a little bit of a catch-up period in terms of, call it, timing. 
As you can see, Jon, our guidance for recurring CapEx for all of 2020 is roughly the same number as prior year. So $220 million, I believe, or $230-ish million. So we had a little bit of fourth quarter catch-up in there. 
Just the only major items, we had a -- we had some refreshed capital on some second-generation space that I think we're converting to colocation when a PBB or a TKF customer had exited. So that kind of hits -- that's not first generation. So it hits through the recurring CapEx. I think that's a product of the, call it, maturation of our portfolio and re-customering to new types of customers in different shapes and forms.

There's obviously the activity we are seeing coming through our renewal activity, both in the fourth quarter as it trajected throughout the year, and we had consistent progress to the point where we had positive plus 1 megawatt cash renewal spread in 4Q. Some of the stronger markets were renewed and signing through there. Santa Clara was a standout in that renewal. 
We have not -- our guidance includes a slightly negative outlook for the cash mark-to-markets. But I know we use the language there instead of exact numbers. I think our language is less conservative than it was last year. So I think we're moving into better territory. 
If you look at just the lease expiration schedule in 2021, I think we're getting into a better place, both in volume, mix and mark-to-market relative to recent history. You called out particularly the greater than 1 megawatt category, which is, call it, 7.5-ish percent of our expirations, down from a high of, call it, over 10% at one point. It's pretty diverse with no market other than Ashburn being even greater than 1%. And the mix and geographically, you're seeing a sizable part component from not only Santa Clara or tighter U.S. market, but also our international markets in the coming contract. 
And then last but not least, just looking at the new signings because I have more of a forward indicator of what to come, the -- by and large, in the greater than megawatt category, I saw -- we saw pretty good firmness in the pricing. And as I say, strengths in the Americas were, call it, New York, Chicago -- I'm looking at the wrong schedule. My bad. 
In the greater than 1 megawatt, you had pretty much stability in both Northern Virginia and Portland. Again, it goes back to that structure. I mentioned previously where the customer is taking down shelves at precommitted rates at their discretion. So really not room for negotiation there and the desire for them to grow with adjacency. And then EMEA, we saw strength in the greater than megawatt plus category, for Zurich and Marseille were, in particular, stand-out markets. And then last but not least, Singapore, that market has been a star, and I think you're going to see that continue into 2021. And that is certainly a market where we're doing a sizable amount of megawatt plus activity as well."

Ascenty is not on the schedule, but we've seen tremendous activity in Latin America, including continued growth in Brazil, not only our first but second customer into Santiago, Chile and probably expect to experience the same in terms of our second customers landing into Mexico City. 
On the schedule, the volume has stepped up about 13% to 221.5 megawatts. The preleasing has remained roughly intact at 55%. If you go market by market, I think you're accurate in seeing this trend of a larger and larger share of our new capacity capital going outside the United States. The Americas region is a little muted because we delivered capacity that was 400% preleased in Ashburn and the shell, which will show up with megawatts on the schedule, I think, in a quarter or so, just hasn't popped in here. But I still think the thesis is constant. And you're seeing also a year-over-year improvement on the yields in the Americas. 
And I think another relevant data point is the non-U.S. markets are also becoming more diverse. In EMEA, as I rattled off at the very beginning of the call, rather ineloquently, was across 6 different EMEA markets with north of a megawatt signings. You can see on the schedule, from Amsterdam to Zurich, numerous markets with capacity coming online.

Yes, it stepped down quarter-over-quarter, but it was up 4% from the prior quarter. And 3Q was quite a outsized winner in terms of interconnection signings. 
The cast of characters are similar in terms of the type of verticals industry-wise that we've experienced in the past. Regionally, some of the star -- I would say, the EMEA region was definitely a standout in this category, not just in the fourth quarter, but on a full year basis. I believe their interconnection revenue was, call it, up into the double digits type growth trajectory. 
I also -- I know you didn't quite ask this question, I also really look at these things part and parcel with the less than 1 megawatt signings because they also often go hand-in-hand in terms of our most interconnection rich type customers day 1 and certainly post landing with digital. I would say we put up the third quarter -- or fourth quarter in a row of consecutive growth in that category off a really strong 3Q. We put a record year up and call the interconnection and less than 1 megawatt of colocation-type signage category. Those are also led by EMEA, but APAC played a great role. We've launched now our colocation offering in Osaka, Singapore and Hong Kong, and our first carrier-neutral offering in Seoul, South Korea are right around the corner. So great early days in that category as well, regionally. 
So we're definitely expanding the breadth of the product offering across more and more markets and pleased with the success we're seeing in both the interconnection and the, call it, enterprise and network-oriented less than 1 megawatt category."

Definitely, we look at driving value to our customers through our global interconnected platform, which Bill stated in his prepared remarks. But double our cross-connect count in 2020 is pretty impressive. And particularly to EMEA, we are constantly watching exactly how our communities of interest have really grown there with network-dense, highly connected assets as a part of PlatformDIGITAL. But we absolutely align our cross-connect pricing based on the market dynamics within EMEA, and we'll continually evolve our platform to ensure that pricing is aligned with the value that we see these communities of interest continually getting out of the platform. 
But one of the things that we're very happy about is we continually see the attach rate within each of these markets continually increasing. And it's core to our platform going forward that we remove complexity from the customers so that they can get access to that value in a more simplistic fashion. So you'll see that play out over the coming year on exactly how we achieved that, but it's something that we're constantly watching and making sure that the customers are getting the true value that they need in a very simplistic fashion."

I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the fourth quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. 
First, we further strengthened our connections with our customers, meeting more of their needs beyond the U.S. and reaching a much broader set of enterprise customers with our enhanced colocation and interconnection product offerings. We delivered extremely solid current period financial results, delivering full year FFO per share that was nearly 4% above our initial guidance. 
We extended our global platform, providing customers with a gateway into Southeastern Europe and runway for growth around the world with strategic land purchases and new development starts. 
And last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, extending our average duration while further ratcheting down our average cost of debt by locking in attractive pricing on long-term capital and retiring high-coupon debt and preferred equity. 
I'd like to conclude today's call by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family, but particularly our frontline team members and critical data center facility roles who have kept the digital world turning in the midst of this global pandemic. 
I hope all of you stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see many of you in person again later this year. Thank you."

First, we demonstrated our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with efficient and socially responsible capital raises and corporate governance enhancements. We continue to enhance the value of our global platform, extending connectivity offerings globally, recycling capital and investing to fuel high-quality organic growth. 
We delivered solid financial results with core FFO per share up 9% year-over-year and $0.09 ahead of consensus.

Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework. And our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of this framework. Our business is increasingly global with first quarter bookings very evenly balanced across regions. We continue to align PlatformDIGITAL with our customers' digital transformation initiatives by expanding our unique interconnection capabilities focusing on connecting centers of data across our robust, reliable global platform. 
Last, but not least, we continue to advance our initiatives to deliver sustainable growth for all stakeholders. 
Let's turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on Page 3. We were recently honored to be named EPA Energy Star Partner of the Year for Energy Management for the second year in a row. We were also recently honored to receive the 2020 largest financial corporate Green Bond award from climate bonds initiative. We expect to publish our third annual ESG report during the second quarter, providing transparency on our ESG performance for 2020 as well as comprehensive overview of our clean energy commitment, resource conservation, diversity, equity and inclusion and other sustainable business practices. 
We are committed to minimize our impact on the environment while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society. 
In terms of our social efforts, we recently joined leaders across 85 industries in signing the CEO pledge on CEO action for diversity and inclusion, an initiative to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Our Board of Directors also amended our corporate governance guidelines to clarify that director candidate pools must include candidates with diversity of race, ethnicity and gender. 
Finally, in February, our Board of Directors amended our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter to formalize oversight of our ESG programs, including sustainability as well as diversity, equity and inclusion. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role in advancing our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities we serve around the world. 
Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform with 44 projects underway around the world, totaling more than 300 megawatts of incremental capacity scheduled for delivery over the next 18 months. Half of this expansion is underway in EMEA, while the balance is split roughly evenly between the Americas and APAC. 
In EMEA, we continued our extension of the highly connected legacy Interxion campus in Frankfurt. and began construction on the [ Neeman ] expansion campus. During the first quarter, we broke ground on the first 26 megawatts on the expansion campus, which are scheduled for delivery next year. Demand in Frankfurt remains strong, in our campus with access to over 700 carriers and ISPs continues to attract customers from around the world. In France, we are adding capacity in Marseille as well as Paris. 
Demand in Marseille is largely driven by the 14 subsea cables that terminate in our facilities, where we are transforming a former abandoned World War II U boat bunker into a modern and vital communications hub for over half of the world's population. 
In Paris, we continue to develop interactions with Paris Digital Park, while the Donat subsea cable that links Paris to Virginia Beach was connected in our Paris campus during the quarter. We are also expanding our highly connected Brussels campus and breaking ground on another facility in Madrid to serve the broadening needs of service providers as well as enterprises. 
In APAC, we recently announced the grand opening of our third data center in Singapore. We were particularly pleased to be recognized by Singapore's Desmond Lee, Minister of National Development, highlighting the sustainable design of our most energy-efficient data center in the region. Despite some COVID-related construction challenges last year, we were gratified to be able to deliver this highly connected and sustainably designed facility to meet customer needs in our tightest market. 
Finally, in mid-March, we closed on the sale of a portfolio of 11 assets in Europe for approximately $680 million, executing on our strategy of recycling capital from stabilized assets, reinvesting proceeds into higher growth opportunities while prioritizing long-term value creation over near-term earnings growth. 
Let's turn to demand drivers on Page 5. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point that enables us to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on platform digital. In the second half of last year, we introduced to our customers the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool that projects the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. 
In the first quarter of this year, we took the next step and published an industry manifesto enabling connected data communities to guide cross-industry collaboration for our customers as they tackle data gravity head-on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity. Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of data gravity. Market intelligence firm Gartner recently hosted an executive retreat and surveyed over 400 Chief Data and Analytic Officers, with 83% of CEOs expecting to increase investments in digital business with a large percentage of these firms prioritizing digital data products to drive growth. 
With this transition to data-driven businesses, Gartner predicts that by 2024, more than 75% of companies will deploy multiple data hubs to drive mission-critical data analytics, sharing and governance. 
We are seeing growing momentum across our enterprise and service provider customers deploying their own data hubs and analytics environments in multiple metros on PlatformDIGITAL. As I mentioned earlier, Digital Realty was recently named Energy Star Partner of the Year by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for the second consecutive year. This award reflects our sharpened focus on driving sustainable design and operations on PlatformDIGITAL, underpinned by ambitious science-based targets to significantly reduce our carbon footprint by 2030. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market-leading innovation to capture the growing global data center demand opportunity from data-driven businesses. 
Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform to meeting these needs, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees whatever the macro environment may hold in store. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results."

Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. We signed total bookings of $117 million in the first quarter. including a $13 million contribution from Interxion. Network and enterprise-oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less totaled $33 mill",1678,"Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. We signed total bookings of $117 million in the first quarter. including a $13 million contribution from Interxion. Network and enterprise-oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less totaled $33 million, building upon our consistent momentum and demonstrating the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand. The weighted average lease term was over 7 years. We landed 100 new logos during the first quarter with strong showings across all regions, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. 
The mix of our new signings was quite healthy, with APAC and EMEA each contributing approximately 30% and the Americas accounting for the remaining 40%. In addition, nearly 40% of bookings were generated within the megawatt or less plus Interxion category with strength in the e-commerce, gaming and financial services segments. 
In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a particular highlight of the quarter was landing a leading APAC-based diversified digital economy platform in Singapore, where we were able to support this customer's needs across our full product spectrum from colocation and connectivity to a hyperscale dedicated data hall. 
Elsewhere in APAC, a leading cloud service provider expanded with us simultaneously in both Melbourne and Osaka. Subsequent to quarter end, we landed a leading cloud provider to anchor our Tokyo campus in [ Ansi ], where we've assembled a runway of over 100 megawatts of growth capacity as well as key magnetic connectivity solutions. 
In EMEA, an automotive digital technology maker deployed an artificial intelligence, machine learning footprint on PlatformDIGITAL to gain access to a community of leading cloud service providers on our Frankfurt campus. In the Americas, a leading cloud provider expanded on our campuses in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. A Global 2000 industrial manufacturer leveraged a partner to deploy on PlatformDIGITAL to support growing demand enabled by our global platform and runway for growth on our suburban Chicago campus. 
A global digital advertising exchange platform expanded its presence on PlatformDIGITAL to gain access to connected data communities in the Northern Virginia metro area. Also in Ashburn, a leading video game developer selected PlatformDIGITAL to build centers of data exchange. And finally, a global IT service provider expanded in multiple metros across North America to enable new services on PlatformDIGITAL. 
Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced reached another all-time high at $307 million. The step-up from $269 million last quarter reflects $66 million of commencements during the first quarter, offset by roughly $104 million of combined space and power leases signed. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at just under 8 months. 
Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed $193 million of renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the first quarter was a little less than 3 years, reflecting a greater mix of enterprise deals smaller than 1 megawatt. We retained 75% of expiring leases just a bit below our long-term average. Cash re-leasing spreads on renewals were negative 2.1%, which was in line with guidance but weighed down by 2 customers who were new to existing capacity as part of the expansion of their footprint on our platform. These transactions were prime examples of what we mean when we talk about our holistic long-term approach to customer relationship management. 
We believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer that we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And whenever we can, we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business as well as renewals. 
In terms of first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked down 100 basis points, driven by anticipated churn in Ashburn as well as the sale of 11 almost fully leased facilities in Europe. Same capital cash NOI growth was negative 2.8% in the first quarter, in line with guidance and largely driven by the same Ashburn churn. 
As a reminder, our recently acquired Westin Building in Seattle, Interxion across EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia are not yet included in the same-store pool. But we expect each of these acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward. 
Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened in the first quarter but still remains somewhat depressed relative to the prior year average, providing a bit of an FX tailwind in the first quarter. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. 
In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, We also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with a long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 50 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. 
Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded. 
In terms of earnings growth, first quarter core FFO per share was up 9% year-over-year and $0.09 ahead of consensus. The upside relative to our internal forecast was driven by a beat on the top line with an assist from an FX tailwind as well as operating expense savings primarily due to lower property level spending in the COVID-19 environment and a later than budgeted closing on the noncore European portfolio sale. 
A portion of the OpEx savings is likely timing related and represents more of a deferral rather than permanent savings. But substantially, all of the beat flows through to the raise, and we are taking core FFO per share guidance up by $0.075 at the midpoint. 
In terms of the quarterly run rate, we still expect the split between first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately 49-51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 12, we expect to dip down by about $0.10 in the second quarter before ramping up fairly steadily over the rest of the year due to the mid-March closing of the noncore European portfolio sale as well as an expected catch-up in OpEx spend previously budgeted for the first quarter. 
I would like to point out that although we are raising our G&A forecast by $15 million at the midpoint, Our implied EBITDA margin guidance is unchanged as the lion's share of the increase is due to geography on the income statement as we finalize mapping the Interxion cost structure and have recharacterized a portion of Interxion's OpEx spend as overhead. 
In terms of our financing plans, we've already made great strides this year. with a highly successful EUR 1 billion green bond offering in early January at 5/8 in addition to the proceeds from the asset sales in March. As always, we expect to remain nimble for the rest of the year and we may look to capitalize on favorable market conditions to lock in long-term fixed-rate financing at attractive coupons across the currencies that support our assets to proactively manage future liabilities. 
Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 13. As previously mentioned, we closed on the sale of a portfolio of 11 assets in Europe for approximately $680 million and used the proceeds to pay down debt, bringing net debt to adjusted EBITDA back down to 5.6x, in line with our long-term target range. Fixed charge coverage reached an all-time high of 5.8x, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. We continue to execute on our financing strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost and extending the durations of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. 
In early January, we raised $1 billion of 10.5-year green euro bonds at an all-time low coupon for Digital Realty of 0.625%. We also retired 350 million of 2.75% bonds due in 2023, and we repaid all 530 million outstanding on the term loan due in 2023. In mid-April, we announced the redemption of 200 million of preferred stock at 6 5/8, also bring total preferred equity redemptions over the past 12 months to 700 million at a weighted average coupon of just over 6.25, effectively lowering leverage by another 0.3 turns. 
This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 13, we've extended our weighted average debt maturity out to nearly 7 years while ratcheting our weighted average coupon down to 2.3%. A little over 70% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 94% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. 
Finally, as you can see from the left side of the Page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out-years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. 
This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

And then on the -- kind of on the new business that you're bringing on, if you think about your sub-megawatt or low single-digit megawatt colocation wins, any way to characterize how much of that has a high kind of connectivity attach rate to it?

Maybe I'll try to attack some of the numbered questions on the beginning, and I'll hand it over to Corey to talk about our channels and productivity. So just to cut them up in a little bit of order here, so I would characterize -- going to your second question about how much of our less than megawatt colocation is kind of connectivity rich. I would characterize that as a highly connectivity rich piece of our business in terms of the numbers of our customers, the 4,000 customers that we have at Digital, the lion's share of the customer count falls in the -- they sit in typically some of our more highly connected destinations either dating back many years to our legacy Telx business or Interxion or Westin building or where we've organically grown our colocation connectivity suites across North America. 
I think we have 5 markets going to Asia Pacific and elsewhere around the globe. So you typically see fairly sticky, high retention, low churn as well as fairly substantial pricing power quarter after quarter. And you could see that in the retention table in the back of our cell. And the definition didn't change all that much when we migrated from the word colocation to a sizing definition. 
I think the first part of your question was, call it, look at the exploration schedule, I thought I heard it post year-end 2022. I'm not sure my crystal ball can go with that much precision out that far. I would say thematically, we've been working through a few years now of more tougher [ flooding ] when it came to our expirations, and that was in 2020, 2019, 2018. That was in size of the volume of the expirations. That was in the mix of the expirations in terms of kind of going back to more higher -- less pricing power locations, chunkier deals, concentrations of some multi-market, major customer renewals. I think we've done a nice job chopping a fair bit of wood, and the front view mirror on the exploration schedule certainly looks better than what we've come through. And I think you've seen that now in terms of how our mark to market has called -- is progressing in back into a better fashion as we kind of worked through some of those lumpier contracts. And then you're going to see it on the percentages of where the expirations kind of fall between the plus or minus megawatt category. 
So I feel like we're heading in the right direction on the exploration schedule. And I didn't touch on it, but definitely geographically, just by the maturity of our business, much more non-U.S. or out, call it, EMEA, APAC type expirations into the future, which also, call it, higher barrier entry, tougher or high pricing power markets. But I'll turn it to Corey to hit the -- your -- the last part of your question."

But I would tell you that really happy with the progress we're making on channels of our, I'll call, enterprise business nonscale business. The channel is now about 1/4 of the business, so we're pretty happy with the progress there. 
And then your question around new logos and how much of the new logos are adding interconnection to it, we've seen an increase in that. They really kind of just comes through when you think through platform digital and how we're getting many, many more multiuse case deployments, multisite deployments. Most of those look like network connectivity as well as some control hubs. And so we're seeing good progress across those, and we're seeing, I guess, the net of it is the channels bringing us a lot more new logos and those new logos are a little bit more interconnection dense than they were in the past. Hopefully, that answers the question."

I think in terms of, call, lumpier concentrations our Latin America portion of the portfolio was certainly a major contributor. In terms of the top markets for just overall the interconnection signings, in North America, it was some of the usual, the New York metro, Chicago, Atlanta. But also, I did notice we had some pretty strong connectivity growth in both our Northern Virginia campus as well as our Franklin Park Chicago campus, so not necessarily a legacy highly connectivity dense location, but it's great to see some enterprise is landing there and growing their connectivity footprint. 
An answer to -- partly answer Jon Atkin's question, when we track our new logos on a year-over-year growth basis, we don't have this for all of our new logos because we're kind of combining businesses over the last year. But I'll call it the legacy digital subset that were here a year ago, they grew their connectivity footprint north of 10% on a year-over-year basis. So the new loans are growing post landing with us. 
So definitely pleased. And I mean, I think it goes back to a lot of what Corey was saying about our reorientation across the board in terms of bringing some critical puzzle pieces together in terms of our asset profile, our go-to-market strategy led by Corey, our platform, digital and branding to the market and many other elements I think are tied together that's been driving that success."

We did close to 5 megawatts of leasing in total in that market, including the full product suite. 
I would say the lion's share of our focus is on the capacity we got back at the very beginning of the year, some of which I mentioned, we already released or pre-leased on the last call. So really focusing on some of that nonretained capacity on our existing campus.

That said, enterprise demand has been really, really good. It's been strong, broad-based success selling our platform. Andy mentioned it earlier, but early innings with long tail left. We're looking through some of the more macro trends. Gartner's got IT spending getting a 6% growth with about $4.1 trillion annually and only about $400 billion of that going to public cloud. So we think that enterprise demand at the point of presence and the multi-use cases as well as multi-markets that we're going after are going to be there. And we're seeing it continue to sustain.

We did have a beat in terms of our internal forecast and was called in the same ballpark as where consensus was. We've essentially raised a few elements, the revenue, the EBITDA. The G&A piece is really just the P&L geography you're mapping from Interxion integrations.

But just to the housekeeping piece, a little bit of a funky quarter on the margin front. So I've guided you to, call it, to our full year guidance table on the EBITDA margin. We do have a footprint across Texas, Dallas being the largest piece of that. We were impacted by the winter storm. Again, our operational team did a really marvelous job keeping up and running and customers happy. Literally kind of personally got a cold call from a CTO of a global customer who also had their own asset or data center in the market and needed diesel fuel rerouted to them in order to stay running and our operations team sprung it in action with like an hour's notice and kind of really saved that CTO's day. 
But -- so on the power front, power did increase unusually given what the storm. Luckily, one, our team did a nice job hedging in terms of our power cost. Two, while it inflates the expense, it also inflates the reimbursement because we have a sizable portion of our Dallas or Texas footprint is metered power. So reimbursed, So net-net, especially on the size of company, not really a major negative, but certainly funky when you got that spike in power when you look at your EBITDA margins coming through. 
In terms of APAC, I mean I'll turn it to Corey over here, but I mean just really standout quarter across the full customer product spectrum. We're now live with, I believe, 5 -- almost 6 colo projects across our platform from Seoul to Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore and I'm missing one. So we have great success selling into those markets. And then also on the hyperscale or larger footprint front, I mentioned in the prepared remarks, 1 top CSP signed with us both in Osaka and Melbourne.

And within the nonflap, Marseille, Stockholm and Madrid were some of our top EMEA markets. 
So I -- and as you can see on our development table, we've been continuing to increase our footprint of development and building out larger parcels in EMEA on our highly connected campuses there. So I don't -- I'm still pretty really positive about the growth in Europe."

The CSP was a multi-market renewal, multi-market growth. The enterprise was in 1 particular North American market. So we thought it was a very fair commercial compromise and love to see them continue to grow with us. 
I don't -- I mean that bounces around, and we've had worse than that in a given quarter, and we've had much better than that in a given quarter. And I still -- as you saw, we confirm that guidance on the mark to market. So we don't think that's a truly bad omen or anything like that.

And as we worked our way through that year, we outperformed that expectation. It ended up negative, but it was very slightly modestly negative. And then we went to guidance. Our guidance, again, was really in that same territory where it ended up, so a better outlook than the prior year. 
If you look at the overall results here, negative 2%, a cash market across all the products, it's kind of right in line.

Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework. And our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of this framework. Our business is increasingly global with first quarter bookings very evenly balanced across regions. We continue to align PlatformDIGITAL with our customers' digital transformation initiatives by expanding our unique interconnection capabilities focusing on connecting centers of data across our robust, reliable global platform. Last, but not least, we continue to advance our initiatives to deliver sustainable growth for all stakeholders. 
Let's turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on Page 3. We were recently honored to be named EPA ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year for Energy Management for the second year in a row. We were also recently honored to receive the 2020 largest financial corporate Green Bond award from Climate Bonds Initiative. We expect to publish our third annual ESG report during the second quarter, providing transparency on our ESG performance for 2020 as well as a comprehensive overview of our clean energy commitment, resource conservation, diversity, equity and inclusion and other sustainable business practices. 
We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society. 
In terms of our social efforts, we recently joined leaders across 85 industries in signing the CEO pledge on CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, an initiative to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Our Board of Directors also amended our corporate governance guidelines to clarify that director candidate pools must include candidates with diversity of race, ethnicity and gender. 
Finally, in February, our Board of Directors amended our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter to formalize oversight of our ESG programs, including sustainability as well as diversity, equity and inclusion. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role in advancing our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities we serve around the world. 
Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform with 44 projects underway around the world, totaling more than 300 megawatts of incremental capacity scheduled for delivery over the next 18 months. Half of this expansion is underway in EMEA, while the balance is split roughly evenly between the Americas and APAC. 
In EMEA, we continued our extension of the highly connected legacy Interxion campus in Frankfurt. and began construction on the Neckermann expansion campus. During the first quarter, we broke ground on the first 26 megawatts on the expansion campus, which are scheduled for delivery next year. Demand in Frankfurt remains strong. And our campus, with access to over 700 carriers and ISPs, continues to attract customers from around the world. In France, we are adding capacity in Marseille as well as Paris. 
Demand in Marseille is largely driven by the 14 subsea cables that terminate in our facilities, where we are transforming a former abandoned World War II U-boat bunker into a modern and vital communications hub for over half of the world's population. 
In Paris, we continue to develop interactions with Paris Digital Park, while the Dunant subsea cable that links Paris to Virginia Beach was connected in our Paris campus during the quarter. We are also expanding our highly connected Brussels campus and breaking ground on another facility in Madrid to serve the broadening needs of service providers as well as enterprises. 
In APAC, we recently announced the grand opening of our third data center in Singapore. We were particularly pleased to be recognized by Singapore's Desmond Lee, Minister of National Development, highlighting the sustainable design of our most energy-efficient data center in the region. Despite some COVID-related construction challenges last year, we were gratified to be able to deliver this highly connected and sustainably designed facility to meet customer needs in our tightest market. 
Finally, in mid-March, we closed on the sale of a portfolio of 11 assets in Europe for approximately $680 million, executing on our strategy of recycling capital from stabilized assets, reinvesting proceeds into higher growth opportunities while prioritizing long-term value creation over near-term earnings growth. 
Let's turn to demand drivers on Page 5. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point that enables us to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. In the second half of last year, we introduced to our customers the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool that projects the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. 
In the first quarter of this year, we took the next step and published an industry manifesto enabling connected data communities to guide cross-industry collaboration for our customers as they tackle data gravity head-on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity. Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of data gravity. Market intelligence firm Gartner recently hosted an executive retreat and surveyed over 400 Chief Data and Analytic Officers, with 83% of CEOs expecting to increase investments in digital business with a large percentage of these firms prioritizing digital data products to drive growth. 
With this transition to data-driven businesses, Gartner predicts that by 2024, more than 75% of companies will deploy multiple data hubs to drive mission-critical data analytics, sharing and governance. We are seeing growing momentum across our enterprise and service provider customers deploying their own data hubs and analytics environments in multiple metros on PlatformDIGITAL. 
As I mentioned earlier, Digital Realty was recently named ENERGY star Partner of the Year by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for the second consecutive year. This award reflects our sharpened focus on driving sustainable design and operations on PlatformDIGITAL, underpinned by ambitious science-based targets to significantly reduce our carbon footprint by 2030. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market-leading innovation to capture the growing global data center demand opportunity from data-driven businesses. 
Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform to meeting these needs, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees whatever the macro environment may hold in store. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results."

Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. We signed total bookings of $117 million in the first quarter. including a $13 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise-oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less totaled $3",1677,"Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. We signed total bookings of $117 million in the first quarter. including a $13 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise-oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less totaled $33 million, building upon our consistent momentum and demonstrating the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand. The weighted average lease term was over 7 years. We landed 100 new logos during the first quarter with strong showings across all regions, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. 
The mix of our new signings was quite healthy, with APAC and EMEA each contributing approximately 30% and the Americas accounting for the remaining 40%. In addition, nearly 40% of bookings were generated within the megawatt or less plus interconnection category with strength in the e-commerce, gaming and financial services segments. 
In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a particular highlight of the quarter was landing a leading APAC-based diversified digital economy platform in Singapore, where we were able to support this customer's needs across our full product spectrum, from colocation and connectivity to a hyperscale dedicated data hall. 
Elsewhere in APAC, a leading cloud service provider expanded with us simultaneously in both Melbourne and Osaka. Subsequent to quarter end, we landed a leading cloud provider to anchor our Tokyo campus in Inzai, where we've assembled a runway of over 100 megawatts of growth capacity as well as key magnetic connectivity solutions. 
In EMEA, an automotive digital technology maker deployed an artificial intelligence, machine learning footprint on PlatformDIGITAL to gain access to a community of leading cloud service providers on our Frankfurt campus. In the Americas, a leading cloud provider expanded on our campuses in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. A Global 2000 industrial manufacturer leveraged a partner to deploy on PlatformDIGITAL to support growing demand, enabled by our global platform and runway for growth on our suburban Chicago campus. 
A global digital advertising exchange platform expanded its presence on PlatformDIGITAL to gain access to connected data communities in the Northern Virginia metro area. Also in Ashburn, a leading video game developer selected PlatformDIGITAL to build centers of data exchange. And finally, a global IT service provider expanded in multiple metros across North America to enable new services on PlatformDIGITAL. 
Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced reached another all-time high at $307 million. The step-up from $269 million last quarter reflects $66 million of commencements during the first quarter, offset by roughly $104 million of combined space and power leases signed. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at just under 8 months. 
Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed $193 million of renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the first quarter was a little less than 3 years, reflecting a greater mix of enterprise deals smaller than 1 megawatt. We retained 75% of expiring leases, just a bit below our long-term average. Cash re-leasing spreads on renewals were negative 2.1%, which was in line with guidance, but weighed down by 2 customers who were new to existing capacity as part of the expansion of their footprint on our platform. These transactions were prime examples of what we mean when we talk about our holistic, long-term approach to customer relationship management. 
We believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer that we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And whenever we can, we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business as well as renewals. 
In terms of first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked down 100 basis points, driven by anticipated churn in Ashburn as well as the sale of 11 almost fully leased facilities in Europe. Same-capital cash NOI growth was negative 2.8% in the first quarter, in line with guidance and largely driven by the same Ashburn churn. 
As a reminder, our recently acquired Westin Building in Seattle, Interxion across EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia are not yet included in the same-store pool. But we expect each of these acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward. 
Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened in the first quarter but still remains somewhat depressed relative to the prior year average, providing a bit of an FX tailwind in the first quarter. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. 
In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 50 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. 
Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded. 
In terms of earnings growth, first quarter core FFO per share was up 9% year-over-year and $0.09 ahead of consensus. The upside relative to our internal forecast was driven by a beat on the top line with an assist from an FX tailwind as well as operating expense savings primarily due to lower property level spending in the COVID-19 environment and a later than budgeted closing on the noncore European portfolio sale. 
A portion of the OpEx savings is likely timing related and represents more of a deferral rather than permanent savings. But substantially, all of the beat flows through to the raise, and we are taking core FFO per share guidance up by $0.075 at the midpoint. 
In terms of the quarterly run rate, we still expect the split between first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately 49-51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 12, we expect to dip down by about $0.10 in the second quarter before ramping up fairly steadily over the rest of the year due to the mid-March closing of the noncore European portfolio sale as well as an expected catch-up in OpEx spend previously budgeted for the first quarter. 
I would like to point out that although we are raising our G&A forecast by $15 million at the midpoint, our implied EBITDA margin guidance is unchanged as the lion's share of the increase is due to geography on the income statement as we finalize mapping the Interxion cost structure and have recharacterized a portion of Interxion's OpEx spend as overhead. 
In terms of our financing plans, we've already made great strides this year with a highly successful EUR 1 billion green Eurobond offering in early January at 5/8, in addition to the proceeds from the asset sales in March. As always, we expect to remain nimble for the rest of the year, and we may look to capitalize on favorable market conditions to lock in long-term fixed-rate financing at attractive coupons across the currencies that support our assets to proactively manage future liabilities. 
Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 13. As previously mentioned, we closed on the sale of a portfolio of 11 assets in Europe for approximately $680 million and used the proceeds to pay down debt, bringing net debt to adjusted EBITDA back down to 5.6x, in line with our long-term target range. Fixed charge coverage reached an all-time high of 5.8x, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. We continue to execute on our financing strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost and extending the durations of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. 
In early January, we raised $1 billion of 10.5-year green Eurobonds at an all-time low coupon for Digital Realty of 0.625%. We also retired $350 million of 2.75% bonds due in 2023, and we repaid all $530 million (sic) [ $537 million ] outstanding on the term loan due in 2023. In mid-April, we announced the redemption of $200 million of preferred stock at 6.625%, also bring total preferred equity redemptions over the past 12 months to $700 million at a weighted average coupon of just over 6.25%, effectively lowering leverage by another 0.3 turns. 
This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. 
As you can see from the chart on Page 13, we've extended our weighted average debt maturity out to nearly 7 years while ratcheting our weighted average coupon down to 2.3%. A little over 70% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 94% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. 
Finally, as you can see from the left side of the Page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out-years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. 
This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

As we look at your pending lease expirations out through year-end '22, any kind of update you can give us on which markets might have greatest exposure? And is there a way to characterize how much of that you would consider to be highly likely to renew or extend their commitments? 
And then on the -- kind of on the new business that you're bringing on. If you think about your sub-megawatt or low single-digit megawatt colocation wins, any way to characterize how much of that has a high kind of connectivity attach rate to it? And more broadly, I wondered if you could maybe just review initiatives that you have underway to enhance productivity in your direct and indirect channels to manage those ongoing relationships."

Maybe I'll try to attack some of the numbered questions on the beginning, and I'll hand it over to Corey to talk about our channels and productivity. So just to cut them up in a little bit of order here. So I would characterize -- going to your second question about how much of our less than megawatt colocation is kind of connectivity rich. I would characterize that as a highly connectivity rich piece of our business in terms of the numbers of our customers, the 4,000 customers that we have at Digital, the lion's share of the customer count falls in the -- they sit in typically some of our more highly connected destinations, either dating back many years to our legacy Telx business or Interxion or Westin Building or where we've organically grown our colocation connectivity suites across North America. 
I think we have 5 markets across Asia Pacific and elsewhere around the globe. So you typically see fairly sticky, high retention, low churn as well as fairly substantial pricing power quarter after quarter. And you could see that in the retention table in the [ back of our cell ]. And the definition didn't change all that much when we migrated from the word colocation to a sizing definition. 
I think the first part of your question was, call it, look at the expiration schedule, I thought I heard a post year-end 2022. I'm not sure my crystal ball can go with that much precision, out that far. I would say, thematically, we've been working through a few years now of more tougher sledding when it came to our expirations, and that was in 2020, 2019, 2018. That was in size of the volume of the expirations. That was in the mix of the expirations in terms of kind of going back to more higher -- less pricing power locations, chunkier deals, concentrations of some multi-market, major customer renewals. 
I think we've done a nice job chopping a fair bit of wood, and the front view mirror on the expiration schedule certainly looks better than what we've come through. And I think you've seen that now in terms of how our mark to market has called -- has been progressing in back into a better fashion as we kind of worked through some of those lumpier contracts. And then you're going to see it on the percentages of where the expirations kind of fall between the plus or minus megawatt category. 
So it feels  like we're heading in the right direction on the expiration schedule. And I didn't touch on it, but definitely geographically, just by the maturity of our business, much more non-U.S. or out, call it, EMEA, APAC type expirations into the future, which also, call it, higher barrier entry, tougher or high pricing power markets. But I'll turn it to Corey to hit the -- your -- the last part of your question."

But I would tell you that really happy with the progress we're making on channels. Of our, I'll call, enterprise business nonscale business. The channel is now about 1/4 of the business, so we're pretty happy with the progress there. 
And then on your question around new logos and how much of the new logos are adding interconnection to it, we've seen an increase in that. They really kind of just comes through when you think through PlatformDIGITAL and how we're getting many, many more multi-use case deployments, multi-site deployments. Most of those look like network connectivity as well as some control hubs. And so we're seeing good progress across those. And we're seeing, I guess, the net of it is the channels bringing us a lot more new logos and those new logos are a little bit more interconnection dense than they were in the past. Hopefully, that answers the questions."

I think in terms of, call it, lumpier concentrations, our Latin America portion of the portfolio was certainly a major contributor. In terms of the top markets for just overall the interconnection signings, in North America, it was some of the usuals, the New York Metro, Chicago, Atlanta. But also, I did notice we had some pretty strong connectivity growth in both our Northern Virginia campus as well as our Franklin Park, Chicago campus, so not necessarily a legacy highly connectivity dense location, but it's great to see some enterprise is landing there and growing their connectivity footprint. 
In answer to -- partly answer Jon Atkin's question. When we track our new logos on a year-over-year growth basis, we don't have this for all of our new logos because we're kind of combining businesses over the last year. But I'll call it the legacy digital subset that were here a year ago, they grew their connectivity footprint north of 10% on a year-over-year basis. So the new logos are growing post landing with us. 
So definitely pleased. And I mean, I think it goes back to a lot of what Corey was saying about our reorientation across the board in terms of bringing us some of the critical puzzle pieces together in terms of our asset profile, our go-to-market strategy, led by Corey, our PlatformDIGITAL and branding to the market and many other elements, I think, are tied together that's been driving that success."

We kind of ran pretty darn tight on inventory based on that success, which is not necessarily a bad thing given that the Northern Virginia market has been kind of working its way out of the woods for some time now. So we ended the year with our development pipeline 100% pre-leased. We are now under construction and delivering, building our -- in terms of our new build that will come along this summer. We did close to 5 megawatts of leasing in total in that market, including the full product suite. 
I would say the lion's share of our focus is on the capacity we got back at the very beginning of the year, some of which I mentioned, we already released or pre-leased on the last call. So really focusing on some of that non-retained capacity on our existing campus. But also, we did land an anchor deal, a little chunkier enterprise deal into building our kind of on the back half of the year. And then building on it a large shell that, we'll call it, deliver 6-megawatt suites in, call it, every other month type of a fashion.

I would tell you that we're getting closer to the state of normal, if that's what you want to call it. Some of the things are opening up. But we've got a lot of ability around doing tours virtually. We've found a bunch of different ways to augment the needs and take care of our customers during the pandemic. So I feel like we're getting close to it, we're not quite there. 
That said, enterprise demand has been really, really good. It's been strong, broad-based success selling our platform. Andy mentioned it earlier, but early innings with long tail left. And we're looking through some the more macro trends. Gartner's got IT spending getting a 6% growth with about $4.1 trillion annually and only about $400 billion of that going to public cloud. So we think that enterprise demand and the point of presence and the multi-use cases as well as multi-markets that we're going after are going to be there. And we're seeing it continue to sustain. 
So I wouldn't say that it's a complete back to normal. We haven't seen a dip in the enterprise demand. And quite frankly, we think we've done a pretty good job adjusting through it with all the ops and the [indiscernible] working through it. I hope that answers the question. I'm not sure if I did."

I'm not sure that's the case for all providers in the data center world, especially smaller stature. But there's not been disruption today. And I'd say we've looked at our, call it, 300 megawatts of capacity under development as pretty darn insulated to these -- any potential inflation shocks. And we're also keeping a keen eye on that.

But that's something that operating on a global basis has been a big benefit to digital going forward. But we also stay very close to our customers and really watching if they're having trouble procuring infrastructure to deploy their architectures into our facility. 
We haven't seen a material impact on that as well. I know there's been a lot of concern around chip shortages and things like that. But again, just to reiterate, not all chips are the same, and there's a lot of variability out there. And so we have not seen any kind of material impact from customers being able to deploy into the facility.

And so they've also not experienced any slowdown in being able to deploy the massive amount of infrastructure required for their deployments as well."

So while FX did contribute to our, call it, outperformance in the first quarter, and obviously, that flows through the guidance, I would not say that was the only thing that drove our increase in guidance. 
We did have a beat in terms of our internal forecast and was, call it, in the same ballpark as where consensus was. We've essentially raised a few elements, the revenue, the EBITDA. The G&A piece is really just the P&L geography you're mapping from Interxion integrations. And then we also kind of made sure that showed that, that flowed through to the bottom line with, call it, an increase at the midpoint of the range, up, I think, $0.075, so 5% year-over-year growth. And not all due to FX. It was due to some of the operational outperformance.  
Not all of our beat flowed through because some of it was OpEx delayed from 1Q to 2Q, 3Q, 4Q rate of the year. But definitely pleased with the result and, I would say, gave us the confidence to raise it here in the first quarter, which is little.

A little bit of a funky quarter on the margin front. So I've guided to, call it, to our full year guidance table on the EBITDA margin. We do have a footprint across Texas, Dallas being the largest piece of that. We were impacted by the winter storm. Again, our operational team did a really marvelous job keeping up and running and customers happy. Literally got a -- personally got a cold call from a CTO of a global customer who also had their own asset or data center in the market and needed diesel fuel rerouted to them in order to stay running. And our operations team sprung into action within like an hour's notice and kind of really saved that CTO's day. 
But -- so on the power front. Power did increase unusually given what the storm. Luckily, one, our team did a nice job hedging in terms of our power cost. Two, while it inflates the expense, it also inflates the reimbursement because we have a sizable portion of our Dallas or Texas footprint is metered power, so reimbursed. So net-net, especially on the size of company, not really a major negative, but certainly funky when you got that spike in power when you look at your EBITDA margins coming through. 
In terms of APAC, I mean, I'll turn it to Corey over here, but I mean just really standout quarter across the full customer product spectrum. We're now live with, I believe, 5 or almost 6 colo projects across our platform from Seoul to Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore and I'm missing one. So we have great success selling into those markets. 
And then also on the hyperscale or larger footprint front, I mentioned in the prepared remarks 1 top CSP signed with us, both in Osaka and Melbourne.

Our guidance, again, was really in that same territory of where it ended up, so a better outlook than the prior year.

For the second year in a row, we've been voted the ENERGY STAR Partner of the year. And for the fourth consecutive year, We've been voted Nareit Leader in the Light Award for the data center category, and Nareit's only had that Leader in the Light Award for data centers for 4 years. So we're batting 1,000 right now."

We delivered solid financial results with core FFO per share up 9% year-over-year and $0.09 ahead of consensus.

Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework. And our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of this framework. Our business is increasingly global with first quarter bookings very evenly balanced across regions. We continue to align PlatformDIGITAL with our customers' digital transformation initiatives by expanding our unique interconnection capabilities focusing on connecting centers of data across our robust, reliable global platform. Last, but not least, we continue to advance our initiatives to deliver sustainable growth for all stakeholders. 
Let's turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on Page 3. We were recently honored to be named EPA ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year for Energy Management for the second year in a row. We were also recently honored to receive the 2020 largest financial corporate Green Bond award from Climate Bonds Initiative. We expect to publish our third annual ESG report during the second quarter, providing transparency on our ESG performance for 2020 as well as a comprehensive overview of our clean energy commitment, resource conservation, diversity, equity and inclusion and other sustainable business practices. 
We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society. 
In terms of our social efforts, we recently joined leaders across 85 industries in signing the CEO pledge on CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, an initiative to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Our Board of Directors also amended our corporate governance guidelines to clarify that director candidate pools must include candidates with diversity of race, ethnicity and gender. 
Finally, in February, our Board of Directors amended our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter to formalize oversight of our ESG programs, including sustainability as well as diversity, equity and inclusion. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role in advancing our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities we serve around the world. 
Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform with 44 projects underway around the world, totaling more than 300 megawatts of incremental capacity scheduled for delivery over the next 18 months. Half of this expansion is underway in EMEA, while the balance is split roughly evenly between the Americas and APAC. 
In EMEA, we continued our extension of the highly connected legacy Interxion campus in Frankfurt. and began construction on the Neckermann expansion campus. During the first quarter, we broke ground on the first 26 megawatts on the expansion campus, which are scheduled for delivery next year. Demand in Frankfurt remains strong. And our campus, with access to over 700 carriers and ISPs, continues to attract customers from around the world. In France, we are adding capacity in Marseille as well as Paris. 
Demand in Marseille is largely driven by the 14 subsea cables that terminate in our facilities, where we are transforming a former abandoned World War II U-boat bunker into a modern and vital communications hub for over half of the world's population. 
In Paris, we continue to develop interactions with Paris Digital Park, while the Dunant subsea cable that links Paris to Virginia Beach was connected in our Paris campus during the quarter. We are also expanding our highly connected Brussels campus and breaking ground on another facility in Madrid to serve the broadening needs of service providers as well as enterprises. 
In APAC, we recently announced the grand opening of our third data center in Singapore. We were particularly pleased to be recognized by Singapore's Desmond Lee, Minister of National Development, highlighting the sustainable design of our most energy-efficient data center in the region. Despite some COVID-related construction challenges last year, we were gratified to be able to deliver this highly connected and sustainably designed facility to meet customer needs in our tightest market. 
Finally, in mid-March, we closed on the sale of a portfolio of 11 assets in Europe for approximately $680 million, executing on our strategy of recycling capital from stabilized assets, reinvesting proceeds into higher growth opportunities while prioritizing long-term value creation over near-term earnings growth. 
Let's turn to demand drivers on Page 5. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point that enables us to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. In the second half of last year, we introduced to our customers the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool that projects the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. 
In the first quarter of this year, we took the next step and published an industry manifesto enabling connected data communities to guide cross-industry collaboration for our customers as they tackle data gravity head-on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity. Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of data gravity. Market intelligence firm Gartner recently hosted an executive retreat and surveyed over 400 Chief Data and Analytic Officers, with 83% of CEOs expecting to increase investments in digital business with a large percentage of these firms prioritizing digital data products to drive growth. 
With this transition to data-driven businesses, Gartner predicts that by 2024, more than 75% of companies will deploy multiple data hubs to drive mission-critical data analytics, sharing and governance. We are seeing growing momentum across our enterprise and service provider customers deploying their own data hubs and analytics environments in multiple metros on PlatformDIGITAL. 
As I mentioned earlier, Digital Realty was recently named ENERGY star Partner of the Year by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for the second consecutive year. This award reflects our sharpened focus on driving sustainable design and operations on PlatformDIGITAL, underpinned by ambitious science-based targets to significantly reduce our carbon footprint by 2030. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market-leading innovation to capture the growing global data center demand opportunity from data-driven businesses. 
Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform to meeting these needs, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees whatever the macro environment may hold in store. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results."
11041860,709905640,2264259,"Digital Realty Trust, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. We signed total bookings of $117 million in the first quarter. including a $13 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise-oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less totaled $3",1677,"Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. We signed total bookings of $117 million in the first quarter. including a $13 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise-oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less totaled $33 million, building upon our consistent momentum and demonstrating the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand. The weighted average lease term was over 7 years. We landed 100 new logos during the first quarter with strong showings across all regions, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. 
The mix of our new signings was quite healthy, with APAC and EMEA each contributing approximately 30% and the Americas accounting for the remaining 40%. In addition, nearly 40% of bookings were generated within the megawatt or less plus interconnection category with strength in the e-commerce, gaming and financial services segments. 
In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a particular highlight of the quarter was landing a leading APAC-based diversified digital economy platform in Singapore, where we were able to support this customer's needs across our full product spectrum, from colocation and connectivity to a hyperscale dedicated data hall. 
Elsewhere in APAC, a leading cloud service provider expanded with us simultaneously in both Melbourne and Osaka. Subsequent to quarter end, we landed a leading cloud provider to anchor our Tokyo campus in Inzai, where we've assembled a runway of over 100 megawatts of growth capacity as well as key magnetic connectivity solutions. 
In EMEA, an automotive digital technology maker deployed an artificial intelligence, machine learning footprint on PlatformDIGITAL to gain access to a community of leading cloud service providers on our Frankfurt campus. In the Americas, a leading cloud provider expanded on our campuses in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. A Global 2000 industrial manufacturer leveraged a partner to deploy on PlatformDIGITAL to support growing demand, enabled by our global platform and runway for growth on our suburban Chicago campus. 
A global digital advertising exchange platform expanded its presence on PlatformDIGITAL to gain access to connected data communities in the Northern Virginia metro area. Also in Ashburn, a leading video game developer selected PlatformDIGITAL to build centers of data exchange. And finally, a global IT service provider expanded in multiple metros across North America to enable new services on PlatformDIGITAL. 
Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced reached another all-time high at $307 million. The step-up from $269 million last quarter reflects $66 million of commencements during the first quarter, offset by roughly $104 million of combined space and power leases signed. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at just under 8 months. 
Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed $193 million of renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the first quarter was a little less than 3 years, reflecting a greater mix of enterprise deals smaller than 1 megawatt. We retained 75% of expiring leases, just a bit below our long-term average. Cash re-leasing spreads on renewals were negative 2.1%, which was in line with guidance, but weighed down by 2 customers who were new to existing capacity as part of the expansion of their footprint on our platform. These transactions were prime examples of what we mean when we talk about our holistic, long-term approach to customer relationship management. 
We believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer that we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And whenever we can, we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business as well as renewals. 
In terms of first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked down 100 basis points, driven by anticipated churn in Ashburn as well as the sale of 11 almost fully leased facilities in Europe. Same-capital cash NOI growth was negative 2.8% in the first quarter, in line with guidance and largely driven by the same Ashburn churn. 
As a reminder, our recently acquired Westin Building in Seattle, Interxion across EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia are not yet included in the same-store pool. But we expect each of these acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward. 
Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened in the first quarter but still remains somewhat depressed relative to the prior year average, providing a bit of an FX tailwind in the first quarter. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. 
In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 50 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. 
Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded. 
In terms of earnings growth, first quarter core FFO per share was up 9% year-over-year and $0.09 ahead of consensus. The upside relative to our internal forecast was driven by a beat on the top line with an assist from an FX tailwind as well as operating expense savings primarily due to lower property level spending in the COVID-19 environment and a later than budgeted closing on the noncore European portfolio sale. 
A portion of the OpEx savings is likely timing related and represents more of a deferral rather than permanent savings. But substantially, all of the beat flows through to the raise, and we are taking core FFO per share guidance up by $0.075 at the midpoint. 
In terms of the quarterly run rate, we still expect the split between first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately 49-51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 12, we expect to dip down by about $0.10 in the second quarter before ramping up fairly steadily over the rest of the year due to the mid-March closing of the noncore European portfolio sale as well as an expected catch-up in OpEx spend previously budgeted for the first quarter. 
I would like to point out that although we are raising our G&A forecast by $15 million at the midpoint, our implied EBITDA margin guidance is unchanged as the lion's share of the increase is due to geography on the income statement as we finalize mapping the Interxion cost structure and have recharacterized a portion of Interxion's OpEx spend as overhead. 
In terms of our financing plans, we've already made great strides this year with a highly successful EUR 1 billion green Eurobond offering in early January at 5/8, in addition to the proceeds from the asset sales in March. As always, we expect to remain nimble for the rest of the year, and we may look to capitalize on favorable market conditions to lock in long-term fixed-rate financing at attractive coupons across the currencies that support our assets to proactively manage future liabilities. 
Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 13. As previously mentioned, we closed on the sale of a portfolio of 11 assets in Europe for approximately $680 million and used the proceeds to pay down debt, bringing net debt to adjusted EBITDA back down to 5.6x, in line with our long-term target range. Fixed charge coverage reached an all-time high of 5.8x, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. We continue to execute on our financing strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost and extending the durations of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. 
In early January, we raised $1 billion of 10.5-year green Eurobonds at an all-time low coupon for Digital Realty of 0.625%. We also retired $350 million of 2.75% bonds due in 2023, and we repaid all $530 million (sic) [ $537 million ] outstanding on the term loan due in 2023. In mid-April, we announced the redemption of $200 million of preferred stock at 6.625%, also bring total preferred equity redemptions over the past 12 months to $700 million at a weighted average coupon of just over 6.25%, effectively lowering leverage by another 0.3 turns. 
This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. 
As you can see from the chart on Page 13, we've extended our weighted average debt maturity out to nearly 7 years while ratcheting our weighted average coupon down to 2.3%. A little over 70% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 94% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. 
Finally, as you can see from the left side of the Page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out-years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. 
This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

Maybe I'll try to attack some of the numbered questions on the beginning, and I'll hand it over to Corey to talk about our channels and productivity. So just to cut them up in a little bit of order here. So I would characterize -- going to your second question about how much of our less than megawatt colocation is kind of connectivity rich. I would characterize that as a highly connectivity rich piece of our business in terms of the numbers of our customers, the 4,000 customers that we have at Digital, the lion's share of the customer count falls in the -- they sit in typically some of our more highly connected destinations, either dating back many years to our legacy Telx business or Interxion or Westin Building or where we've organically grown our colocation connectivity suites across North America. 
I think we have 5 markets across Asia Pacific and elsewhere around the globe. So you typically see fairly sticky, high retention, low churn as well as fairly substantial pricing power quarter after quarter. And you could see that in the retention table in the [ back of our cell ]. And the definition didn't change all that much when we migrated from the word colocation to a sizing definition. 
I think the first part of your question was, call it, look at the expiration schedule, I thought I heard a post year-end 2022. I'm not sure my crystal ball can go with that much precision, out that far. I would say, thematically, we've been working through a few years now of more tougher sledding when it came to our expirations, and that was in 2020, 2019, 2018. That was in size of the volume of the expirations. That was in the mix of the expirations in terms of kind of going back to more higher -- less pricing power locations, chunkier deals, concentrations of some multi-market, major customer renewals. 
I think we've done a nice job chopping a fair bit of wood, and the front view mirror on the expiration schedule certainly looks better than what we've come through. And I think you've seen that now in terms of how our mark to market has called -- has been progressing in back into a better fashion as we kind of worked through some of those lumpier contracts. And then you're going to see it on the percentages of where the expirations kind of fall between the plus or minus megawatt category. 
So it feels  like we're heading in the right direction on the expiration schedule. And I didn't touch on it, but definitely geographically, just by the maturity of our business, much more non-U.S. or out, call it, EMEA, APAC type expirations into the future, which also, call it, higher barrier entry, tougher or high pricing power markets. But I'll turn it to Corey to hit the -- your -- the last part of your question."

And then a little bit about with the new logos, are we getting an increase in interconnects, I think, are the questions. And Jonathan, if I missed it, then you can always clarify later. 
But I would tell you that really happy with the progress we're making on channels. Of our, I'll call, enterprise business nonscale business. The channel is now about 1/4 of the business, so we're pretty happy with the progress there. 
And then on your question around new logos and how much of the new logos are adding interconnection to it, we've seen an increase in that. They really kind of just comes through when you think through PlatformDIGITAL and how we're getting many, many more multi-use case deployments, multi-site deployments. Most of those look like network connectivity as well as some control hubs. And so we're seeing good progress across those. And we're seeing, I guess, the net of it is the channels bringing us a lot more new logos and those new logos are a little bit more interconnection dense than they were in the past. Hopefully, that answers the questions."

I think in terms of, call it, lumpier concentrations, our Latin America portion of the portfolio was certainly a major contributor. In terms of the top markets for just overall the interconnection signings, in North America, it was some of the usuals, the New York Metro, Chicago, Atlanta. But also, I did notice we had some pretty strong connectivity growth in both our Northern Virginia campus as well as our Franklin Park, Chicago campus, so not necessarily a legacy highly connectivity dense location, but it's great to see some enterprise is landing there and growing their connectivity footprint. 
In answer to -- partly answer Jon Atkin's question. When we track our new logos on a year-over-year growth basis, we don't have this for all of our new logos because we're kind of combining businesses over the last year. But I'll call it the legacy digital subset that were here a year ago, they grew their connectivity footprint north of 10% on a year-over-year basis. So the new logos are growing post landing with us. 
So definitely pleased. And I mean, I think it goes back to a lot of what Corey was saying about our reorientation across the board in terms of bringing us some of the critical puzzle pieces together in terms of our asset profile, our go-to-market strategy, led by Corey, our PlatformDIGITAL and branding to the market and many other elements, I think, are tied together that's been driving that success."

We kind of ran pretty darn tight on inventory based on that success, which is not necessarily a bad thing given that the Northern Virginia market has been kind of working its way out of the woods for some time now. So we ended the year with our development pipeline 100% pre-leased. We are now under construction and delivering, building our -- in terms of our new build that will come along this summer. We did close to 5 megawatts of leasing in total in that market, including the full product suite. 
I would say the lion's share of our focus is on the capacity we got back at the very beginning of the year, some of which I mentioned, we already released or pre-leased on the last call. So really focusing on some of that non-retained capacity on our existing campus. But also, we did land an anchor deal, a little chunkier enterprise deal into building our kind of on the back half of the year. And then building on it a large shell that, we'll call it, deliver 6-megawatt suites in, call it, every other month type of a fashion. So a little tight right now, focused on where we're pushing customers but a longer, larger runway with building [ arc ] coming on in the back half of the year."

And we're looking through some the more macro trends. Gartner's got IT spending getting a 6% growth with about $4.1 trillion annually and only about $400 billion of that going to public cloud. So we think that enterprise demand and the point of presence and the multi-use cases as well as multi-markets that we're going after are going to be there. And we're seeing it continue to sustain.

We did have a beat in terms of our internal forecast and was, call it, in the same ballpark as where consensus was. We've essentially raised a few elements, the revenue, the EBITDA. The G&A piece is really just the P&L geography you're mapping from Interxion integrations.

Not all of our beat flowed through because some of it was OpEx delayed from 1Q to 2Q, 3Q, 4Q rate of the year.

I think they were the highest since you closed the Interxion deal, but we also saw tenant reimbursements pick up. And so I'm just wondering what was behind the pickup in utilities reimbursements. Was that tied to the winter storm in Texas? And then maybe what drove some of the offsetting cost benefits that helped drive EBITDA margins as high as they were."

So maybe I'll try to take in reverse order, and I'm going to, I think, probably bring in Corey here when we circle back to APAC. But just to the housekeeping piece. A little bit of a funky quarter on the margin front. So I've guided to, call it, to our full year guidance table on the EBITDA margin. We do have a footprint across Texas, Dallas being the largest piece of that. We were impacted by the winter storm. Again, our operational team did a really marvelous job keeping up and running and customers happy. Literally got a -- personally got a cold call from a CTO of a global customer who also had their own asset or data center in the market and needed diesel fuel rerouted to them in order to stay running. And our operations team sprung into action within like an hour's notice and kind of really saved that CTO's day. 
But -- so on the power front. Power did increase unusually given what the storm. Luckily, one, our team did a nice job hedging in terms of our power cost. Two, while it inflates the expense, it also inflates the reimbursement because we have a sizable portion of our Dallas or Texas footprint is metered power, so reimbursed. So net-net, especially on the size of company, not really a major negative, but certainly funky when you got that spike in power when you look at your EBITDA margins coming through. 
In terms of APAC, I mean, I'll turn it to Corey over here, but I mean just really standout quarter across the full customer product spectrum. We're now live with, I believe, 5 or almost 6 colo projects across our platform from Seoul to Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore and I'm missing one. So we have great success selling into those markets. 
And then also on the hyperscale or larger footprint front, I mentioned in the prepared remarks 1 top CSP signed with us, both in Osaka and Melbourne. We also had subsequent in the quarter an anchor customer in Inzai in Tokyo. And then Singapore, maybe I'll let Corey kind of talk to some of the success we saw in Singapore."

But I would also tell you that our new logos coming out of that region has tripled in the last year. We're really happy with the team. It's where most of our organic growth as far as the sales team that we're putting out there in place. So we're really happy with it. 
But I wouldn't get focused just on AP. I'd think about the broad-based platform success we're having across all the regions. I think our largest export region this last quarter was EMEA. So we're really excited about just kind of broad-based successful we are, and we think there's a ton of opportunity in  Asia Pacific. And yes, in Singapore, we were pretty successful selling through that large building there that we have.

On the enterprise customer standpoint, within the FLAP, Frankfurt, London and Amsterdam, certainly stood out this quarter in terms of new signings. And within the non-FLAP, Marseille, Stockholm and Madrid were some of our top EMEA markets.

The CSP was a multi-market renewal, multi-market growth. The enterprise was in 1 particular North American market. So we thought it was a very fair commercial compromise and love to see them continue to grow with us. 
I don't -- I mean that bounces around, and we've had worse than that in a given quarter, and we've had much better than that in a given quarter.

And as we worked our way through that year, we outperformed that expectation. It ended up negative, but it was very slightly modestly negative. And then we went to guidance. Our guidance, again, was really in that same territory of where it ended up, so a better outlook than the prior year. 
If you look at the overall results here, negative 2%, cash mark to market across all the products, it's kind of right in line. Even overall, it's kind of -- it's kind of right in line with the language we've described here. So again, I can't promise you every single quarter is going to be positive.

Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our second quarter results. We continue to enhance our product mix with a record contribution from our sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection category. We extended our sustainability leadership with the publication of our third annual ESG report. We raised revenue and EBITDA guidance for the second quarter in a row, setting the stage for accelerating growth in cash flow. Last but not least, we further strengthened the balance sheet with the redemption of high coupon preferred stock and the issuance of low-cost, long-term fixed rate debt. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill."

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework.

Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework. We continue to advance along these lines during the second quarter. Our business continues to globalize. And once again, we generated solid performance and strong bookings across all regions. Our full spectrum product offering continues to blossom with record sub-1-megawatt bookings in the second quarter and regional highs in both EMEA and APAC. Together with interconnection, the sub-1 megawatt category comprise nearly half of our total bookings, demonstrating customers' enthusiastic adoption of Platform Digital to help accomplish their digital transformation initiatives. 
I'll discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3. In June, we were awarded the Green Lease Leader Gold Award from the Institute for Market Transformation and the U.S. Department of Energy for the third year. We remain the only data center provider to receive this award, which recognizes Digital Realty as a leader in the real estate industry that incorporates green leasing provisions to better align our interest with our customers and drive high performance and healthy buildings. 
During the second quarter, we published our third annual ESG report, detailing our 2020 sustainability initiatives, including the utilization of renewable energy for 100% of our energy needs across our entire portfolio in Europe as well as our U.S. colocation portfolio and reaching 50% of our global needs. 
We also reported progress towards our science-based target, ensuring a deep focus on our renewable energy, energy efficiency and supply chain sustainability initiatives. Our ESG report highlights many of our ongoing initiatives, including our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts along with our community involvement. Digital Realty is committed to being an active member of and giving back to the communities where we operate globally. We encourage and celebrate community involvement and employee engagement activities through our Do Better Together initiative. 
We also recently underscored our commitment to transparency and accountability on our diversity, equity and inclusion journey with the publication of our EEO-1 report. Events over the past 1.5 years have demonstrated that now more than ever, ESG belongs at the forefront of our business. I'm proud of our leadership in this area as we advance our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees, and the communities we serve around the world. 
Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We are continuing to invest in our global platform with 39 projects underway around the world as of June 30, totaling nearly 300 megawatts of incremental capacity most of which is scheduled for delivery over the next 12 months. 
We are investing most heavily in EMEA with 19 projects totaling over 150 megawatts of capacity under construction. Most of this capacity is highly connected, including projects in Frankfurt, Marseille, Paris and Zurich. Demand remains strong across these metros and each continues to attract service providers as well as enterprise customers from around the world, many of which contributed to a truly standout performance by the region during the second quarter in the up to 1 megawatt category. 
In North America, over half of our capacity under construction is concentrated in 2 hot markets, Portland and Toronto that can sometimes be overlooked in favor of more traditional North American data center metros. We've had tremendous recent success in these 2 metros. We have 30 megawatts under construction in Portland, or more specifically, Hillsboro, that are now fully preleased. While our Toronto connected campus continues to gain momentum as the premier Canadian hub for global cloud service providers and enterprise customers. 
Finally, in Asia Pacific, we are accelerating our organic growth in this underserved region. We opened our third data center in Singapore, a 50-megawatt facility that received permitting prior to the moratorium on new data center construction. Demand for this scarce capacity is robust, and we have another 18 megawatts largely presold and scheduled to open this quarter. Also coming soon in this region are a pair of MC Digital Realty data centers in Japan. 
With the world's eyes currently on Tokyo for the Olympics, we are opening a new Tokyo facility that's poised to win the gold medal. We are also opening another data center in Osaka this quarter, along with our first data center and the first carrier-neutral offering in Seoul, Korea during the fourth quarter. We are very excited about the opportunity in Seoul. And earlier this morning, we announced that we've acquired another land parcel to expand our connected campus, enabling us to accommodate the hyperscale demand that has been claiming for capacity in our first highly connected facility. 
Finally, earlier this month, we announced our intention to enter India in partnership with Brookfield Infrastructure. Given the success of our existing partnership on the Ascenty platform in Latin America, the complementary skills and expertise that we both bring to this partnership and with the significant growth opportunity available in India, we are excited to expand our footprint in this robust and dynamic market. 
Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on Platform Digital. 
The first of these trends is the growing importance of data gravity for Global 2000 enterprises. Last year, we introduced the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool, which forecasts the growing intensity of enterprise data creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure between key global markets. 
Earlier this year, we took the next step and published an industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities to guide cross-industry collaboration tackle data gravity head-on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity for all companies. Earlier this week, we announced a collaboration with Zayo to further interconnection business through the creation of an open fabric of fabrics. With data sets exploding and data gravity challenges expanding, this initiative will enable multinational enterprises to connect these data oceans through fabric and orchestration. 
Third-party research continues to support data gravity's growing importance. Market Intelligence firm, Gartner, recently conducted its 6th annual survey of Chief Data Officers and less than 35% of these executives reported their business have achieved their data sharing objectives including data exchange with external data sources that drive revenue-generating business outcomes. 
Issues often arise due to multiple data hosting and processing meeting places together with the need for appropriate security controls and the inability to overcome latency challenges with direct private interconnection between many counterparties. Platform Digital was designed to solve these problems. Digital transformation is compounding this enterprise data and connectivity problem. 
Recent research indicates that enterprise workflows utilize an average of 400 unique data sources, while exchanging data with 27 external cloud products. Digital Realty's enterprise and service provider customers are turning to Platform Digital to overcome these issues by deploying their own data hubs and using interconnection to securely exchange data in and across multiple metros. 
Our leadership position is resonating with industry experts and influencers. For the second consecutive year, Digital Realty was named a global leader by IDC Marketscape for data center colocation and interconnection services, further acknowledgment of our consistently improving customer capabilities. This recognition reflects our execution against the platform digital road map, providing unique differentiated value for customers with our fit-for-purpose full-spectrum global capabilities. 
Earlier this month, Cloudscene again ranked Digital Realty as the strongest provider of data center ecosystems in EMEA for the second consecutive year. Digital Realty was ranked second in both North America as well as Latin America and jumped up 3 spots to #7 in Asia. Also in July, GigaOm published their analysis of edge infrastructure capabilities. Digital Realty ranked as an industry leader on multiple criteria across 3 broad categories. Our capabilities were ranked highest in vendor positioning and evaluation metrics comparison; and second, among the key criteria comparison. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business, and the relevance of our platform to meeting customers' needs, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees whatever the macro environment may hold in store. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results."

Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. We signed total bookings of $113 million in the second quarter, including a $13 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise-oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less reached",1560,"Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. 
We signed total bookings of $113 million in the second quarter, including a $13 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise-oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less reached an all-time high of $41 million, demonstrating our consistent momentum and the growing success of Platform digital as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand. The weighted average lease term was over 8 years. We landed 109 new logos during the second quarter, with strong showings across all regions, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. 
The geographic and product mix of our new activity was quite healthy, with APAC and EMEA, each contributing approximately 20%; the Americas representing nearly 50%; and interconnection responsible for a little over 10%. The megawatt or less plus interconnection category accounted for almost half of our total bookings with particular strength in the cloud, content and financial services verticals. 
In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, we landed a top 5 cloud service provider to anchor our new Tokyo campus. Close on the heels of this magnetic customer deployment, Japan's most popular social media applications selected Platform Digital on the same campus. NAVER, the leading Korea-based cloud provider serving the greater APAC region, selected our new carrier-neutral facility in Singapore to support data-intensive workloads for their high-performance computing and AI intensive technology-based platform. 
A European broadcaster leveraging platform digital in Vienna and Frankfurt to rewire their network in favor of data-intensive interconnection with benefits in performance, scalability and cost savings. A Global 2000 enterprise data platform is adopting platform digital in Amsterdam, Dublin and Frankfurt to orchestrate workloads across hundreds of ecosystem applications, delivering improved performance, security, cost savings and simplicity. 
In London, Platform Digital is supporting a top 3 global money center banks fortification of their business continuity capabilities without compromising their data-intensive interconnection requirements. On the continent, our connectivity and operational capabilities are helping 2 independent fintech customers improve performance and enhance access to their connected data communities. 
Finally, in North America, a life sciences digital marketing firm chose Platform Digital to improve their network architecture and enable future growth. 
Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced ticked down from $307 million to $33 million as commencement slightly eclipsed space and power leases signed during the quarter. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at just over 7 months. 
Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed $178 million of renewals during the second quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the second quarter was just under 3 years, again, reflecting a greater mix of enterprise deals smaller than 1 megawatt. We retained 77% of expiring leases, while cash re-leasing spreads on renewals were slightly positive, also reflective of the greater mix of sub-1 megawatt renewals in the total. 
In terms of second quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked down by 60 basis points as we brought additional capacity online across 6 metros during the quarter. Same capital cash NOI growth was negative 1.5% in the second quarter, largely driven by the churn in Ashburn at the beginning of the year. 
As a reminder, the Westin Building in Seattle the interaction platform in EMEA, Lamba Helix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia are not yet included in the same-store pool. So these same capital comparisons are less representative of our underlying business today than usual. 
Let's turn to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. The U.S. dollar fluctuated during the second quarter but remained below the prior year average, providing a bit of an FX tailwind. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. 
In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed-rate debt, a 100 basis point move in benchmark rates would have roughly a 75 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. 
In terms of earnings growth, second quarter core FFO per share was flat year-over-year but down 8% from last quarter driven by noncash deferred tax charge related to the higher corporate tax rate in the U.K., which came into effect during the second quarter. Excluding the tax charge, which was not previously contemplated in our guidance, we outperformed our internal forecast due to a beat on the top line with a slight assist from FX tailwinds as well as operating expense savings partially due to lower property level spending in the COVID-19 environment. 
For the second time this year, we are raising our full year outlook for total revenue and adjusted EBITDA to reflect the underlying momentum in our business. The deferred tax charge does run through core FFO per share. But as you can see from the press release, we are lowering the midpoint by just $0.05, which all else equal, would imply a $0.07 raise excluding the deferred tax charge. 
Since it is noncash, the deferred tax charge does not hit AFFO. Most of the drivers of our guidance table are unchanged, but I would like to point out that we are lowering our expected recurring CapEx spend for the remainder of the year, segment stage for accelerating growth in cash flow. 
As you could see from the bridge chart on Page 12, we expect our bottom line results to improve sequentially over the balance of the year as the deferred tax charge comes out of the quarterly run rate and the momentum in our underlying business continues to accelerate. We do still expect to see some normalization in our cost structure with an increase in property level operating expenses that have been deferred due to COVID, along with an uptick in G&A expense as we returned to the office and resume a more normal travel schedule. So your model should reflect these higher costs. 
Last, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 13. As you may recall, we closed on the sale of a portfolio of noncore assets in Europe for $680 million late in the first quarter, which impacted second quarter adjusted EBITDA to the tune of approximately $10 million. As a result, net debt to adjusted EBITDA was slightly elevated 6x as of the end of the second quarter but is expected to come back down in line with our long-term range over the course of the year through a combination of proceeds from asset sales and growth in cash flows as signed leases commence. 
Fixed charge coverage ticked down slightly also reflecting the near-term impact from asset sales, but remains well above our target and close to an all-time high at 5.4x, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. We continue to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. 
In mid-May, we redeemed $200 million of preferred stock at 6 5/8, which brought total preferred equity redemptions over the prior 12 months to $700 million at a weighted average coupon of just over 6.25, effectively lowering leverage by 0.3 turns. In mid-June, we issued 0.5 million shares under our ATM program, raising approximately $77 million. In early July, we raised another $26 million with the sale of the balance of our Megaport stock. We also took our first trip to the Swiss bond market in early July, raising approximately $595 million in a dual tranche offering of Swiss green bonds with a weighted average maturity of a little over 6.5 years and a weighted average coupon of approximately 0.37%. 
This successful execution against our financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is nearly 6.5 years, and our weighted average coupon is down to 2.2%. over 70% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and serving as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, -- As you can see from the left side of Page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. 
This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Andrew, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

We've been doing a fair bit of that, most recently executed on portfolio in EMEA close to $700 million that was not core or strategic to digital, and it's kind of similar to a transaction. We did back in, I think 2019. So call it focusing our portfolio where we see the most robust and diverse customer growth. So that's 1 leg of the stool that you can see will continue on. We activated this year again. in terms of funding our business plan by recycling that capital into more strategic projects. 
We've also done what I'd call it private capital partnerships. So similarly with that same transaction back in 2019 with Mapletree, we raised 80% stake in $1 billion of core assets, assets that we never really want to part with, and we maintain operational control of as a minority partner -- So I think you'll see us continue to do both, but there is a big difference in our minds. Noncore are things that we're willing to part with 100%. We wish the new owners well. And core really keeping those houses as part of our collective platform and just trying to recycle capital on the slower growth assets, both of which I think at the end of the day, hopefully accelerates our growth and allows us to redeploy that capital into higher return opportunities."

And I think that when you look around the world today, there just aren't that many platforms. I mean, there's not an interaction in Asia.

So definitely moving in the right direction. At the same time, I wouldn't call it standing on the aircraft carrier with the Victory 5G yet. We're still working through some still certain contracts that are above market Hence, we've maintained our, call it, language around our full year guidance of slightly negative. I did some parsing through both categories in the -- in that category, literally 82% of the megawatts that renewed were positive, so close to 2% positive. So it really was like 1 or 2 negative the category to be flat. And and the over left to that is greater than [Audio Gap] positive cash mark-to-markets in terms of the megawatts renewed. 
So I would call it still episodic, moving in a better direction. And that's a thematic thing that I don't think this 1 quarter was a massive inflection point.

What you can see is that I think it's the lowest payout ratio we've had in 5 quarters now. So by the fact that we've increased the guidance, notwithstanding that $0.12, it essentially would have been a raise. And if you backed out the $0.12 to the midpoint of our new guidance, you're close to what would be 6% year-over-year growth on the core. The reason it doesn't all beat in this quarter, to part of your question, Mike, doesn't all flow through is some of the I would say OpEx timing.

That's really a proxy for our enterprise business. On top of that, our best channel quarter ever. We also saw an increase in multisite, multi-region customers, which are all indicative of kind of the strength of the enterprise demand and where we're going. So I would tell you that for the second half, we see strong and sufficient demand across all the regions as they take care of and address the needs for data gravity and hybrid IT architectures, all of which has been driven by enterprise customers across all the regions, We Mentioned the strength in each of the regions, both AP and EMEA as well as North America.

As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I had the leading Japanese social media platform, land with us in Tokyo in addition to a top 5 CSP. I think we announced that as the anchor to our Tokyo campus on the prior call. So I think thematically, 2 things are playing out here. One, the hard work in terms of creating this global platform for these hyperscalers across approaching 50 metropolitan areas on 6 continents, and really trying to be their trusted partner of choice around the globe is certainly benefiting our leasing or signing activity. 
And I would also say we're making some great inroads to whether you call it next tier or next-gen hyperscale I think a couple of quarters, we had a hyperscale win with a Singapore-based technology company. I mentioned the Japanese social media company. We mentioned Korean company Never. So definitely penetrating a broader cast of customers than just top 5 CSPs at the same time."

Michael, why don't I try to tackle those in reverse order. So in terms of maintenance capital, obviously, the older the facility the more you approach end of life on various components. But that's no different than any piece of infrastructure or real estate. So replacing a roof, placing a chiller, you kind of get to these 20-, 30-year end of life and 1 by one. Now the good thing is we've built this portfolio over many years and essentially keep adding newer product to the mix at the same time. So we've been able to keep our recurring CapEx at a pretty modest hit to our AFFO. We actually dialed it back slightly just this for the year, our guidance table. 
So I wouldn't say any material uptick. And we do a lot of maintenance throughout the year in terms of fixed repair, preventative and to ensure that there's no looming infrastructure headaches call it on the horizon. From a pricing standpoint, Obviously, there's smaller nuances, whether it's PUE efficiencies or power densities, which we certainly are innovating and bringing to bear new technologies in terms of legacy facilities. But net-net, the biggest driver is supply and demand in the market. a data center that becomes available for us in Santa Clara or Singapore or Frankfurt or markets that are completely demand outpacing supply, customers are creating the availability and not looking for the birth date. 
So I think that's more of a driver of the pricing activity. So on your first question, I mean, on, call it, 2022, I mean we're only, call it, half time here. So not ready to roll out season 2 or whatever. But I would say a couple of things that set us up for accelerating growth overall. One, I spoke a little bit to the cash mark-to-market position, and it's been improving this year relative to last year and see it arise and where it could continue to improve. Two, this year, we took a significant relative to our ashore took back a significant amount of capacity that we're chopping wood on re-leasing. So that we're having downtime from that vacant capacity in our numbers there you can see in our occupancy as well. And you're going to see that come online as we refill that and have a greater contribution to revenue in 2022 than it does in 2021. So I think those elements and the fact that I think we've now put up I should count this, but I think it's close to 8 pretty darn good quarters of consecutive leasing, right? You obviously have to adjust to our pre-interaction days relative to our denominator, but the leasing has been pretty darn consistent for some quarters now. So I think all those things picture as well as a pretty attractive development pipeline, which will obviously have a greater contribution to 2022 than '21."

So rather than repeat what I think I answered with Mike earlier, I would just tell you that the enterprise demand is strong, and I think we're in a good place going forward.

I think from a supply chain and what we've seen in the industry, we haven't seen any material impacts or delays at this point in time. We work extensively with our customers to understand their needs and their requirements for the infrastructure in their deployments. And so we align their orders to manufacturing dates. There's been some delays, but most of the time, we can signal that right in the beginning of the sales cycle to ensure that they can order them and not miss any kind of delivery dates from that perspective. But Again, it's something we constantly watch with the different types of manufacturers out there. And I think Andy referenced this earlier, our VMI program with the infrastructure that we leverage in delivering our own services, we're way ahead of that. And I think we've really differentiated ourselves with the weight in the market that we can execute, I think, beyond most of the other companies out there.

Frankfurt has been a bit of the TETRAS game in terms of fitting the customers in in certain markets. And in Singapore, that's a market where I don't think we're fully sold out, but it's -- we've raised our rates given the supply demand -- tremendous supply-demand imbalance. We do look at any churn we'll have in that market where we look to re-productize for enterprise colocation and connectivity. Those are the ones -- the name the ones that come top of mind.

Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework. We continue to advance along these lines during the second quarter. Our business continues to globalize. And once again, we generated solid performance and strong bookings across all regions. Our full spectrum product offering continues to blossom with record sub-1 megawatt bookings in the second quarter and regional highs in both EMEA and APAC. Together with interconnection, the sub-1 megawatt category comprised nearly half of our total bookings, demonstrating customers' enthusiastic adoption of PlatformDIGITAL to help accomplish their digital transformation initiatives.  
I'll discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3. In June, we were awarded the Green Lease Leader Gold award from the Institute for Market Transformation and the U.S. Department of Energy for the third year. We remain the only data center provider to receive this award, which recognizes Digital Realty as a leader in the real estate industry that incorporates green leasing provisions to better align our interest with our customers and drive high performance and healthy buildings.  
During the second quarter, we published our third annual ESG report, detailing our 2020 sustainability initiatives, including the utilization of renewable energy for 100% of our energy needs across our entire portfolio in Europe as well as our U.S. colocation portfolio and reaching 50% of our global needs.  
We also reported progress towards our science-based target, ensuring a deep focus on our renewable energy, energy efficiency and supply chain sustainability initiatives. Our ESG report highlights many of our ongoing initiatives, including our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts along with our community involvement. 
Digital Realty is committed to being an active member of and giving back to the communities where we operate globally. We encourage and celebrate community involvement and employee engagement activities through our Do Better Together initiative. 
We also recently underscored our commitment to transparency and accountability on our diversity, equity and inclusion journey with the publication of our EEO-1 report. Events over the past 1.5 years have demonstrated that now more than ever, ESG belongs at the forefront of our business. I'm proud of our leadership in this area as we advance our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees, and the communities we serve around the world.  
Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We are continuing to invest in our global platform with 39 projects underway around the world as of June 30, totaling nearly 300 megawatts of incremental capacity, most of which is scheduled for delivery over the next 12 months.  
We are investing most heavily in EMEA with 19 projects totaling over 150 megawatts of capacity under construction. Most of this capacity is highly connected, including projects in Frankfurt, Marseille, Paris and Zurich. Demand remains strong across these metros and each continues to attract service providers as well as enterprise customers from around the world, many of which contributed to a truly standout performance by the region during the second quarter in the up-to-1 megawatt category.  
In North America, over half of our capacity under construction is concentrated in 2 hot markets, Portland and Toronto that can sometimes be overlooked in favor of more traditional North American data center metros. We've had tremendous recent success in these 2 metros. We have 30 megawatts under construction in Portland, or more specifically, Hillsboro, that are now fully pre-leased, while our Toronto connected campus continues to gain momentum as the premier Canadian hub for global cloud service providers and enterprise customers.  
Finally, in Asia Pacific, we are accelerating our organic growth in this underserved region. We opened our third data center in Singapore, a 50-megawatt facility that received permitting prior to the moratorium on new data center construction. Demand for this scarce capacity is robust, and we have another 18 megawatts largely presold and scheduled to open this quarter. Also coming soon in this region are a pair of MC Digital Realty data centers in Japan.  
With the world's eyes currently on Tokyo for the Olympics, we are opening a new Tokyo facility that's poised to win the gold medal. We are also opening another data center in Osaka this quarter, along with our first data center and the first carrier-neutral offering in Seoul, Korea, during the fourth quarter. We are very excited about the opportunity in Seoul. And earlier this morning, we announced that we've acquired another land parcel to expand our connected campus, enabling us to accommodate the hyperscale demand that has been clamoring for capacity in our first highly connected facility.  
Finally, earlier this month, we announced our intention to enter India in partnership with Brookfield Infrastructure. Given the success of our existing partnership on the Ascenty platform in Latin America, the complementary skills and expertise that we both bring to this partnership and with the significant growth opportunity available in India, we are excited to expand our footprint in this robust and dynamic market.  
Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. The first of these trends is the growing importance of data gravity for Global 2000 enterprises. Last year, we introduced the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool, which forecasts the growing intensity of enterprise data creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure between key global markets.  
Earlier this year, we took the next step and published an industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities to guide cross-industry collaboration, tackle data gravity head-on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity for all companies. 
Earlier this week, we announced a collaboration with Zayo to further interconnection business through the creation of an open fabric-of-fabrics. With data sets exploding and data gravity challenges expanding, this initiative will enable multinational enterprises to connect these data oceans through fabric and orchestration.  
Third-party research continues to support data gravity's growing importance. Market Intelligence firm, Gartner, recently conducted its 6th annual survey of Chief Data Officers and less than 35% of these executives reported their business have achieved their data sharing objectives, including data exchange with external data sources that drive revenue-generating business outcomes.  
Issues often arise due to multiple data hosting and processing meeting places together with the need for appropriate security controls and the inability to overcome latency challenges with direct private interconnection between many counterparties. PlatformDIGITAL was designed to solve these problems. Digital transformation is compounding this enterprise data and connectivity problem.  
Recent research indicates that enterprise workflows utilize an average of 400 unique data sources, while exchanging data with 27 external cloud products. Digital Realty's enterprise and service provider customers are turning to PlatformDIGITAL to overcome these issues by deploying their own data hubs and using interconnection to securely exchange data in and across multiple metros.  
Our leadership position is resonating with industry experts and influencers. For the second consecutive year, Digital Realty was named a global leader by IDC MarketScape for data center colocation and interconnection services, further acknowledgment of our consistently improving customer capabilities. This recognition reflects our execution against the PlatformDIGITAL road map, providing unique differentiated value for customers with our fit-for-purpose, full-spectrum global capabilities.  
Earlier this month, Cloudscene again ranked Digital Realty as the strongest provider of data center ecosystems in EMEA for the second consecutive year. Digital Realty was ranked second in both North America as well as Latin America and jumped up 3 spots to #7 in Asia. Also in July, GigaOm published their analysis of edge infrastructure capabilities. Digital Realty ranked as an industry leader on multiple criteria across 3 broad categories. Our capabilities were ranked highest in vendor positioning and evaluation metrics comparison and second among the key criteria comparison. 
Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business, and the relevance of our platform to meeting customers' needs, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store.  
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results."

We signed total bookings of $113 million in the second quarter, including a $13 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise-oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less reached an all-time high of $41 million, demonstrating our consistent momentum and the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand. The weighted average lease term was over 8 years. We landed 109 new logos during the second quarter, with a strong showings across all regions, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform.  
The geographic and product mix of our new activity was quite healthy, with APAC and EMEA, each contributing approximately 20%; the Americas representing nearly 50%; and interconnection responsible for a little over 10%. The megawatt or less plus interconnection category accounted for almost half of our total bookings with particular strength in the cloud, content and financial services verticals. 
In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, we landed a top 5 cloud service provider to anchor our new Tokyo campus. Close on the heels of this magnetic customer deployment, Japan's most popular social media applications selected PlatformDIGITAL on the same campus. NAVER, the leading Korea-based cloud provider serving the greater APAC region, selected our new carrier-neutral facility in Singapore to support data-intensive workloads for their high-performance computing and AI-intensive technology-based platform.  
A European broadcaster is leveraging PlatformDIGITAL in Vienna and Frankfurt to rewire their network in favor of data-intensive interconnection with benefits in performance, scalability and cost savings. A Global 2000 enterprise data platform is adopting PlatformDIGITAL in Amsterdam, Dublin and Frankfurt to orchestrate workloads across hundreds of ecosystem applications, delivering improved performance, security, cost savings, and simplicity.  
In London, PlatformDIGITAL is supporting a top 3 global money center banks fortification of their business continuity capabilities without compromising their data-intensive interconnection requirements. 
On the continent, our connectivity and operational capabilities are helping 2 independent fintech customers improve performance and enhance access to their connected data communities.  
Finally, in North America, a life sciences digital marketing firm chose PlatformDIGITAL to improve their network architecture and enable future growth.  
Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced ticked down from $307 million to $303 million as commencement slightly eclipsed space and power leases signed during the quarter. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at just over 7 months.  
Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed $178 million of renewals during the second quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the second quarter was just under 3 years, again, reflecting a greater mix of enterprise deals smaller than 1 megawatt. We retained 77% of expiring leases, while cash re-leasing spreads on renewals were slightly positive, also reflective of the greater mix of sub-1 megawatt renewals in the total.  
In terms of second quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked down by 60 basis points as we brought additional capacity online across 6 metros during the quarter. Same capital cash NOI growth was negative 1.5% in the second quarter, largely driven by the churn in Ashburn at the beginning of the year.  
As a reminder, the Westin Building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in EMEA, Lamda Helix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia are not yet included in the same-store pool. So these same capital comparisons are less representative of our underlying business today than usual.  
Let's turn to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. The U.S. dollar fluctuated during the second quarter but remained below the prior year average, providing a bit of an FX tailwind. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective.  
In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed-rate debt, a 100 basis point move in benchmark rates would have roughly a 75 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. 
In terms of earnings growth, second quarter core FFO per share was flat year-over-year but down 8% from last quarter driven by $0.12 noncash deferred tax charge related to the higher corporate tax rate in the U.K., which came into effect during the second quarter. Excluding the tax charge, which was not previously contemplated in our guidance, we outperformed our internal forecast due to a beat on the top line with a slight assist from FX tailwinds as well as operating expense savings, partially due to lower property-level spending in the COVID-19 environment.  
For the second time this year, we are raising our full year outlook for total revenue and adjusted EBITDA to reflect the underlying momentum in our business. The deferred tax charge does run through core FFO per share. But as you can see from the press release, we are lowering the midpoint by just $0.05, which all else equal, would imply a $0.07 raise excluding the deferred tax charge.  
Since it is noncash, the deferred tax charge does not hit AFFO. Most of the drivers of our guidance table are unchanged, but I would like to point out that we are lowering our expected recurring CapEx spend for the remainder of the year, setting a stage for accelerating growth in cash flow.  
As you could see from the bridge chart on Page 12, we expect our bottom line results to improve sequentially over the balance of the year as the deferred tax charge comes out of the quarterly run rate and the momentum in our underlying business continues to accelerate. We do still expect to see some normalization in our cost structure with an increase in property-level operating expenses that have been deferred due to COVID, along with an uptick in G&A expense as we return to the office and resume a more normal travel schedule. So your model should reflect these higher costs.  
Last, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 13. As you may recall, we closed on the sale of a portfolio of noncore assets in Europe for $680 million late in the first quarter, which impacted second quarter adjusted EBITDA to the tune of approximately $10 million. As a result, net debt to adjusted EBITDA was slightly elevated 6x as of the end of the second quarter but is expected to come back down in line with our long-term range over the course of the year through a combination of proceeds from asset sales and growth in cash flows as signed leases commence. 
Fixed charge coverage ticked down slightly, also reflecting the near-term impact from asset sales, but remains well above our target and close to an all-time high at 5.4x, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. 
We continue to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets.  
In mid-May, we redeemed $200 million of preferred stock at 6.625%, which brought total preferred equity redemptions over the prior 12 months to $700 million at a weighted average coupon of just over 6.25%, effectively lowering leverage by 0.3 turns. 
In mid-June, we issued 0.5 million shares under our ATM program, raising approximately $77 million. In early July, we raised another $26 million with the sale of the balance of our Megaport stock. We also took our first trip to the Swiss bond market in early July, raising approximately $595 million in a dual tranche offering of Swiss green bonds with a weighted average maturity of a little over 6.5 years and a weighted average coupon of approximately 0.37%.  
This successful execution against our financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers, enables us to prudently fund our growth. 
As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is nearly 6.5 years, and our weighted average coupon is down to 2.2%. Over 70% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and serving as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. 
Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy.  
This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Andrew, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

We -- as it relates to the CyrusOne situation, which I think is what you probably were alluding to, we think that's a good platform. We have all this respect in the world for both Bruce Duncan and Steve -- and Dave Ferdman. But it gives us more of what we already have.

So noncore capital recycling. We've been doing a fair bit of that. Most recently executed our portfolio in EMEA close to $700 million that was not core or strategic to digital, and it's kind of similar to a transaction we did back in, I think, 2019. So call it, focusing our portfolio where we see the most robust and diverse customer growth. So that's 1 leg of the stool that you can see will continue on. We activated this year again in terms of funding our business plan by recycling that capital into more strategic projects.  
We've also done what I'd call, private capital partnerships. So similarly with that same transaction back in 2019 with Mapletree, we raised 80% stake in $1 billion of core assets, assets that we would never really want to part with, and we maintain operational control of as a minority partner. So I think you'll see us continue to do both, but there is a big difference in our minds. Noncore are things that we're willing to part with 100%. We wish the new owners well. And core, really keeping those assets as part of our collective platform and just trying to recycle capital on the slower growth assets, both of which I think at the end of the day, hopefully accelerates our growth and allows us to redeploy that capital into higher return opportunities."

This is going to be different from that. But we are, again, going in 50-50 joint partners, joint branding and the like, which you've seen in some of our press materials. But here, we're going to be -- and we have some folks that are already residing in the JV, but we're actually going into India here to build a platform.

At the same time, I wouldn't call it to be standing on the aircraft carrier with a victory flag yet. We're still working through some still -- certain contracts that are above market. Hence, we've maintained our, call it, language around our full year guidance of slightly negative. I did some parsing through both categories in the -- in that category, literally 82% of the megawatts that renewed were positive, so close to 2% positive. So it really was like 1 or 2 negative that drove down the category to be flat. And in the -- and the over to left of that is greater than [indiscernible] percent positive cash mark-to-markets in terms of the megawatts renewed. 
So I would call it still episodic, moving in a better direction. And that's a thematic thing that I don't think this 1 quarter was a massive inflection point.

But the $0.12 noncash charge wasn't in that guide, right? So if you strip that out, you actually were really only down about $0.01 quarter-over-quarter, right, for the core FFO. And if you think about rolling that forward to the second half of the year saying you really had an $0.08 core FFO beat, why wouldn't that core FFO per share beat excluding the $0.12, why wouldn't that recur in 3Q and 4Q? What's going to change in those 2 quarters stripping out that onetime charge?"

One, we are increasing the guidance net of the $12 million, right? So the $12 million is a noncash deferred tax hit essentially revaluing the liability that due to the U.K. changing its corporate tax rates by 600 basis points, that $35 million to $0.12 flows through onetime and it's noncash, it does not hit at AFFO, which you can see is that I think it's the lowest payout ratio we've had in 5 quarters now. So by the fact that we've increased the guidance, notwithstanding that $0.12, it essentially would have been a raise. And if you backed out the $0.12 to the midpoint of our new guidance, you're close to what would be 6% year-over-year growth on the core FFO. The reason it doesn't all beat in this quarter, to heart of your question, Mike, doesn't all flow through. And some of the beat I would say is OpEx timing. So timing relative to some of our OpEx spend, which got pushed out from 2Q into the back half of the year."

With regard to enterprise demand, and then Andy, I'll let you handle the hyperscale, I think, was part of his question as well. But in our opening remarks, we mentioned that over $50 million of our business was from the sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection, which is really approaching about 50% of our bookings. That's really a proxy for our enterprise business. On top of that, our best channel quarter ever. We also saw an increase in multisite, multi-region customers, which are all indicative of kind of the strength of the enterprise demand and where we're going. 
So I would tell you that for the second half, we see strong and sufficient demand across all the regions as they take care of and address the needs for data gravity and hybrid IT architectures, all of which have been driven by enterprise customers across all the regions, We Mentioned the strength in each of the regions, both AP and EMEA as well as North America. So we're seeing that kind of flow through. And looking at our funnel, we see strength across all those regions, multiple industries and verticals, financial services to cloud and others. So we're pretty excited about where we are and confident in demand from the enterprise side. And I feel like that's going to continue.

Strong Americas quarter, which is really largely -- we did have a top 5 CSP land with us in Sao Paulo, but the lion's share was Hillsboro and Toronto. So some great wins from hyperscalers in that market. Top 5 hyperscalers landed, both in Paris and Frankfurt or grew with us in Paris and Frankfurt. And then over in APAC. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I had the leading Japanese social media platform, land with us in Tokyo in addition to a top 5 CSP that I think we announced that as the anchor to our Tokyo campus on the prior call. 
So I think thematically, 2 things are playing out here. One, the hard work in terms of creating this global platform for these hyperscalers across approaching 50 metropolitan areas on 6 continents, and really trying to be their trusted partner of choice around the globe is certainly benefiting our leasing or signing activity. 
And I would also say, we're making some great inroads to what you call it, next tier or next-gen hyperscalers. I think a couple of quarters ago, we had a hyperscale win with a Singapore-based technology company. I mentioned the Japanese social media company. We mentioned Korean company NAVER. So definitely penetrating a broader cast of customers than just top 5 CSPs at the same time."

First, if you look at the bookings trajectory and just some of the commentary we just heard as well as just the backlog position, should 2022 be a better year for organic revenue growth and core FFO per share growth relative to 2021? And then secondly, on a separate topic, just curious, as you have a range of assets in your portfolio, some very young, some older, what are you seeing in terms of the maintenance capital and the pricing on facilities that are a bit more tenured relative to maybe some facilities that are a bit newer in vintage?"
11041860,1672557582,2355726,"Digital Realty Trust, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Executives","Sure. Sure. Michael, why don't I try to tackle those in reverse order. So in terms of maintenance capital, obviously, the older the facility the more you approach end of life on various components. But that's no different than any piece of infrastructure",490,"Sure. Sure. Michael, why don't I try to tackle those in reverse order. So in terms of maintenance capital, obviously, the older the facility the more you approach end of life on various components. But that's no different than any piece of infrastructure or real estate. So replacing a roof, placing a chiller, you kind of get to these 20-, 30-year end of life and 1 by one. Now the good thing is we've built this portfolio over many years and essentially keep adding newer product to the mix at the same time. So we've been able to keep our recurring CapEx at a pretty modest hit to our AFFO. We actually dialed it back slightly just this for the year, our guidance table. 
So I wouldn't say any material uptick. And we do a lot of maintenance throughout the year in terms of fixed repair, preventative and to ensure that there's no looming infrastructure headaches, call it, on the horizon. 
From a pricing standpoint, Obviously, there's smaller nuances, whether it's PUE efficiencies or power densities, which we certainly are innovating and bringing to bear new technologies in terms of legacy facilities. But net-net, the biggest driver is supply and demand in the market. a data center that becomes available for us in Santa Clara or Singapore or Frankfurt or markets that are competitively demand outpacing supply, customers are creating the availability and not looking for the birth date. So I think that's more of a driver of the pricing activity. 
So on your first question, I mean, on, call it, 2022, I mean we're only, call it, half time here. So not ready to roll out season 2 or whatever. But I would say a couple of things that set us up for accelerating growth overall. One, I spoke a little bit to the cash mark-to-market position, and it's been improving this year relative to last year and see it arise and where it could continue to improve. Two, this year, we took a significant relative to our churn in the Ashburn, we took back a significant amount of capacity that we're chopping wood on re-leasing. So that we're having downtime from that vacant capacity in our numbers here. You can see in our occupancy as well. And you're going to see that come online as we refill that and have a greater contribution to revenue in 2022 than it does in 2021.
So I think those elements and the fact that I think we've now put up I should count this, but I think it's close to 8 pretty darn good quarters of consecutive leasing, right? You obviously have to adjust to our pre-interaction days relative to our denominator, but the leasing has been pretty darn consistent for some quarters now. So I think all those things, the picture as well as a pretty attractive development pipeline, which will obviously have a greater contribution to 2022 than '21."

But again, it's something we constantly watch with the different types of manufacturers out there.

We have -- I don't think we've done much activity in Santa Clara for several quarters now because that market has been so tight, and we're waiting for new capacity to come online. 
In Atlanta, where we're really solely focused on colo connectivity, our 56 Marietta, which is most highly connected data center in the Southeast is 100% full. We're waiting for an annex building essentially to bring on to call it, several megawatts of colo capacity. Outside the states, Frankfurt has been a bit of the TETRAS game in terms of fitting the customers in, in certain markets. And in Singapore, that's a market where I don't think we're fully sold out, but it's -- we've raised our rates given the supply demand -- tremendous supply-demand imbalance. We do look at any churn we'll have in that market where we look to re-productize for enterprise colocation and connectivity. Those are the ones -- the name the ones that come top of mind.

We delivered solid financial results, with double-digit revenue growth leading to a beat in the current quarter and a raise to the outlook for the balance of the year. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet by raising approximately $600 million of low-coupon Swiss green bonds and over $1 billion of common equity to fund our future growth. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill."

Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework, and we made further progress on each front during the third quarter. We continue to globalize our business with significant bookings and solid performance across regions. Our bookings were diversified by both region and product type, reflecting our unique full-spectrum global product offering. 
We also announced our entry into 2 high-potential emerging markets, India and Nigeria, during the third quarter while expanding our connectivity capabilities by working with Zayo to develop the largest open fabric-of-fabrics that will interconnect key centers of data exchange. We are also extending our capabilities for customers to the edge with the announcement of what will be one of a few strategic partnerships in this arena. 
Let's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3. During the third quarter, Digital Realty was honored to be recognized by GRESB as an overall global sector leader in the technology and science category for exemplary ESG performance, receiving a coveted 5-star rating from this leading global ESG benchmarking organization and reflecting Digital Realty's commitment to being a global leader in ESG. We also became a UN Global Compact signatory in September, aligning our ESG goals and commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals with a global initiative. 
We also advanced our sustainable financing strategy, raising our first-ever Swiss green bonds and publishing the allocation of $440 million of proceeds from our September 2020 Euro Green Bond, which funded sustainable data center development projects in 4 countries across 3 continents certified in accordance with leading sustainable rating standards. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and broader society while advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all of these stakeholders. 
While on the topic of energy, I'm pleased to report that Digital Realty experienced only a small negative impact from the substantial rise in energy costs during the third quarter. In Europe, where concerns of an energy crisis were most acute, we typically contract for energy supplies a year or more in advance, providing price visibility and certainty for our customers. Elsewhere around the world, energy costs are typically passed through to customers, minimizing our direct exposure. We continue to keep a close eye on energy prices, but given the resiliency of our business model, we do not expect rising energy costs to impact our reported results by more than a few pennies. 
Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform. As previously announced, we entered into a joint venture with Brookfield to expand PlatformDIGITAL into India, a giant underserved market with the fifth largest GDP in the world. Like many emerging markets, India presents some unique challenges, underscoring the need for local knowledge and experience. To that end, we were pleased to announce the hiring of Seema Ambastha as CEO for the India joint venture. Seema has years of experience in the Indian IT sector broadly and in the data center industry specifically where she most recently served as a senior executive leader with the NTT Netmagic data center business across India. We believe the India data center market has the potential to experience significant growth over the next decade, and we're thrilled to have such a strong partner and strong leader in this exciting new venture. 
During the third quarter, we continued to expand iColo, our Kenyan data center operator, acquiring a land parcel in Mozambique to build a facility positioned to land subsea cables and other connectivity-focused customers. We also acquired a controlling interest in Medallion Communications, the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Nigeria in partnership with our existing African partner, Pembani Remgro. As the African Internet economy matures, we expect Nigeria will represent a significant growth opportunity, given its large and relatively young population, a growing and diversifying economy as well as a maturing regulatory environment. Given the connectivity of Africa from our existing hub in Marseille, our platform will now offer the market-leading destinations, connecting Africa to Europe and beyond. 
We're also investing to organically expand our capacity. As of September 30, we had 44 projects underway around the world, totaling almost 270 megawatts of incremental capacity with over 250 megawatts scheduled for delivery before the end of 2022. We continue to invest most heavily in EMEA, where we now have 27 projects underway in 15 different markets totaling 150 megawatts of incremental capacity, most of which is highly connected, including significant expansions in Frankfurt, Marseille, Paris and Zurich. Our investment in organic development is a reflection of the strength of demand across EMEA. 
We're being a bit more selective in North America. We're seeing strong demand in Portland where we have a 30-megawatt facility under construction that is 100% pre-leased and scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of next year, while we also have significant projects underway in Northern Virginia, New York and Toronto. 
Finally, in Asia Pacific, we continue to pursue strong organic development, both on our own and with our joint venture partners. We are adding capacity in Hong Kong that will open this quarter and expect to open Korea's first carrier-neutral facility in Seoul in early 2022. We are building a connected campus in Seoul to provide the full spectrum of solutions for our customers. The larger second facility will accommodate up to 64 megawatts of capacity and will be located within 25 kilometers of our first facility. 
Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers, and our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect developing trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. Just over a year ago, we introduced the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool that forecasts the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. 
Earlier this year, we published an industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities to guide cross-industry collaboration, tackle data gravity head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity. Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of data gravity. According to ITC, the amount of digital data created over the next 5 years will be greater than twice the amount of data created since the advent of digital storage. This digital data creation is expected to drive exponential growth in enterprise user data aggregation, storage and exchange, providing a powerful tailwind for data center demand. 
We continue to see enterprise and service provider customers deploying their own data hubs and using interconnection to securely exchange data in multiple metros on PlatformDIGITAL to accommodate their own data creation growth. Recently, for the second consecutive year, Digital Realty was ranked as the only outperformer and global leader by GigaOm for edge colocation. This ranking reflects our continued innovation and the execution of our PlatformDIGITAL road map for delivering global differentiated capabilities and value for our customers and partners. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market-leading innovation to capture the growing global demand opportunity from data-driven businesses. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results."

For the second straight quarter, we signed total bookings of $113 million, this time with a $12 million contribution from interconnection. Deal mix was consistent with the prior 4-quarter average. Sub-1 megawatt deals plus interconnection represented about 40% of the total, while larger deals represented around 60%. Space and power bookings were also well diversified by region, with EMEA and APAC contributing 45% of our total, about the same as the Americas, with interconnection accounting for the remaining 10%. 
The weighted average lease term was a little over 5.5 years, and we landed a record 140 new logos during the third quarter, with strong showings across all regions, demonstrating the power of our global platform. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a leading cloud-native cybersecurity platform is expanding its high-performance computing capabilities by leveraging PlatformDIGITAL in 4 markets across North America and Europe, connecting with cloud providers, improving performance and driving down cost. 
A market-leading autonomous driving technology developer partnered with Digital Realty to tailor an innovative and unique infrastructure solution for simulation workloads. Two major North American energy firms chose Digital Realty to leverage our geographic reach and re-architect their network to interconnect with cloud providers and implement security controls as part of their hybrid IT strategy. A public university in the eastern U.S. is launching a global research initiative with other universities in EMEA and deploying PlatformDIGITAL network hubs across 2 continents and 3 cities to help enable this project. 
A maker of high-performance computing systems is expanding their footprint by deploying on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple regions to guarantee GDPR compliance while enhancing their security, performance and sustainability. And finally, a Global 500 fintech provider is expanding their own hybrid IT availability zones into multiple new metros, using PlatformDIGITAL to support their data-intensive and high-performance computing requirements. 
Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced rose from $303 million to $330 million, and third quarter signings more than offset commencements. The lag between signings and commencements was down slightly from last quarter at just over 7 months. 
Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed $223 million of renewal leases during the third quarter, our largest-ever renewal quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the quarter was a little over 3.5 years. Renewal rates for sub-1 megawatt deals remain consistently positive. Greater than 1 megawatt renewals were skewed by our largest deal of the quarter that combined a sizable 30-megawatt renewal with our largest new deal for the quarter, which will land entirely in existing currently vacant or soon-to-be-vacant capacity across Chicago and Ashburn. Excluding this 1 transaction, our cash mark-to-market would have been a positive 1%. 
This multifaceted transaction was a prime example of what we mean when we talk about our holistic long-term approach to customer relationship management. We believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer that we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And whenever we can, we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business as well as renewals. 
In terms of first quarter operating performance, reported portfolio occupancy ticked down by 50 basis points, largely driven by the sale of fully-leased assets during the quarter. Upon commencement of the large combination renewal expansion lease I mentioned a moment ago, portfolio occupancy is expected to improve by 70 basis points. Same-capital cash NOI growth was negative 5.5% in the third quarter, primarily driven by a spike in property taxes in Chicago, where local assessors have adopted a very aggressive posture along with the impact of the Ashburn churn event in January. 
Of the 70 megawatts we've got back on January 1, approximately 80% has since been released to multiple large and growing customers. As a reminder, the Westin Building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia are not yet included in the same-store pool, so these same-capital comparisons are less representative of our underlying business today than usual. And while we're still in the early stages of our budgeting process, we are optimistic in terms of where our same-store NOI growth goes for 2022. 
Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened during the third quarter, providing a small FX headwind in the third quarter. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. Our Swiss green bond offering during the quarter is a good example of this. 
In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have approximately a 50 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. 
In terms of earnings growth, third quarter core FFO per share was up 7% on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, driven by strong operational execution, cost controls and a reduction in financing costs from the debt refinancings and redemptions of preferred stock over the past year. To avoid any confusion, our core FFO outperformance excludes the benefit of a nearly $20 million promote fee received in connection with the monetization of our joint venture with Prudential. Heading into the final quarter of the year, we have solid momentum so we are raising our full year outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and core FFO per share to reflect this underlying momentum in our business. 
Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 12. We continue to recycle capital by disposing of assets that have limited growth prospects, raising over $100 million in the third quarter for our 20% position in the Prudential JV and some land in Arizona. We also raised approximately $95 million of common equity under our ATM program in July, as well as $950 million of common equity in a September forward equity offering. Our reported leverage ratio remains at 6x, but including committed proceeds from the September forward equity offering, the leverage ratio drops to 5.6x, while our fixed charge coverage improves to 6x. 
We continued to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. Our 2 capital markets transactions this quarter are examples of our prudent approach to balance sheet management. This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. 
As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is over 6 years and our weighted average coupon is down to 2.2%. 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. 
Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 14, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

I'll take your first question and I'll hand it over to Andy to adjust the -- to answer the Singapore REIT. First of all, I think you're right about inflation in terms of the opportunity that it presents. I think there's no doubt that it disproportionately, adversely affects our smaller competitors and widens our competitive moat. Over time, I would expect that rental rate increases will disproportionately accrue to the larger incumbent providers. 
There are basically 2 pieces to the inflation issue: the first is a development; the second is operations. On the development side, we are -- our pipeline is on time and it's on budget, and they're kudos to Erich Sanchack, who leads our operations and procurement team for the vendor management programs that he's put in place, providing us fixed pricing for several years out, for diversifying our vendor mix and for allowing our -- for locking in our general contractors. We have a lot of construction sites around the world, and we're able to move our GCs around and keep them fully occupied. 
And I think our global scale as well as our maturity as a builder gives us a substantial competitive advantage here. But again, I don't think there's any doubt that market rents will eventually need to move up to maintain risk-adjusted returns. And I think that, that's both because of the increase in construction costs that show up in the denominator. But I think for our private competitors who are operating with more leverage, I think you're going to see that show up in the higher interest rates. So to -- I think they're going to have to raise their costs for that reason as well. 
And I think the readthrough here is actually really positive for our renewals because as our rates on new product increase, our rates will also, I expect, increase for renewals. So the bottom line there is that modest inflation, we think, is quite healthy for the business. And in terms of our customers, this shouldn't come as a surprise to them because to the extent that they're doing it themselves, they're seeing this development in their own supply chains. 
Relative to the operations of the P&L, I think as you probably know, our leases provide for significant pass-throughs. So for example, over 90% of our utility costs this last quarter were passed through to customers. We also have rent bumps generally between 2% and 3%. And then we have, I think, the highest operating -- or the best operating leverage of highest margins in the business. So what that means is that labor or labor costs, which I think is what's most susceptible to inflationary pressure, is a relatively low percentage of the revenue component in the income statement. And so with that, I'll hand it over to Andy to talk about the Singapore REIT."

We are kind of heading down the path of exploring essentially an IPO of a portfolio on the Singapore market. This is not our APAC business, which has significant amounts of capacity under construction and land and the like. This is essentially being more analogous to almost like a private capital partner to Digital Realty for stabilized, fully well-leased, high-quality core long-term hold data centers to Digital and our strategy. 
Somewhat analogous to one of our joint ventures that we've done in the past couple of years with that one of which was with a Singapore REIT. We're still working through this. It's a long IPO process. There's no certainty on the outcome or completion. Sizing would be obviously a modest IPO size to begin with. But we do think this option has the merits of being an attractive long-term partner vehicle to Digital Realty."

In North America, as you pointed out, it was in our prepared remarks, we had a sizable signing where we essentially came to the table with a holistic relationship-oriented solution for our customer, combining a renewal that impacted our mark-to-markets as well as the new signing. 
On the renewal, if you pulled that out of our mark-to-markets, we're positive 1%, but it was a 30-megawatt signing so it was a large kind of contributor to that. And on the new signing, I think it was into 4 or so different data halls. It was spread across both Ashburn and Chicago. It was 100% into existing vacant or to-be-vacated capacity, so a direct flow through to the bottom line, not, call it, future re-leasing. And so we think it was an attractive combination of helping a customer grow with us on our campus. And this is a customer we see future growth in years to come. So happy to support them."

We're not whistling by the graveyard on this topic. Obviously, inflation is here and will impact anyone that's called in the development arena.

But one of the things that we've done is partner with AtlasEdge that we think they can provide a significant value in extending our platform deeper into the metro. And so that's something that we're looking at learning and understanding how to gain more intelligence in their new types of infrastructure they're bringing to market. And quite frankly, it expands and enhances our core to edge strategy so that our partners and our customers can get the benefit of extending their existing infrastructure out to the edge when it matures over time. 
I would also say that a critical piece that I think you picked up on, David, which is great, is that we at Digital, we're open, right? This is one of many partners and relationships that we're going to continue to prosecute because we see that there's many types of avenues out into accessing this edge infrastructure. But you're going to see a lot of partnerships over the course of the next couple of quarters where we'll further invest and refine exactly how we're going to prosecute that edge opportunity."

So 90%, if you look at our just P&L, 90% of the power is reimbursed overall. We do pursue a hedging strategy primarily on our deregulated markets where you see potential greater volatility. We're about 85% hedged with contract durations ranging from 1 to 3 years. We also, as you know, are incredibly focused on sustainability. Green power procurement is a massive part of that playbook, and we pride ourselves in what we've done in that efforts to further green our portfolio, including power purchase agreements. 
Some of those have a potentially offsetting impact if in the event that power prices are to surge that provides an incremental hedge to power costs. So where we see it in the event that this elevated power scenario plays out for the duration of 2022, we'd look at it as just a couple of cents, which call it, every $0.01 is just almost $3 million. So not -- I wouldn't say a material headwind at this time."

We're also making great progress on re-leasing the capacity that was vacated at the beginning of this year, a huge portion of signings as -- that I mentioned we did this quarter has been falling into vacant or vacated capacity, so a quick resumption of cash flow from that space that sat idle for a portion of 2021.

And then just going back on some of the portfolio and pricing commentary. Just curious, when you have these large multi-megawatt deals where you're discounting to get new business or you have some repricing risk, is it because some of the needs of the customers are changing? Is it just market rents? Like what are some of the factors that are driving that? And how should investors think about just what might be left in the portfolio to get through on that basis?"

Maybe I'll take the second question and hand off to Chris to talk about what's next on edge. So I mean, listen, we're always in active relationship-oriented dialogues with our customers but especially our largest customers who we're supporting in so many different markets and really the full suite of products from network-oriented deployments, hybrid IT, all the way out to their true massive cloud compute. 
And we just want to -- we try to come to the table with holistic solutions. If they have a renewal that's coming in the coming years, we just make sure that's part of the conversation, right? And it often leads to situations like which recently transpired in the last quarter where they may not take some of the new business out to a full search of the market or say, ""You know what, I've already deployed on your campus and then growing these adjacent data halls is the right move."" So it's really a holistic relationship-oriented approach. 
As it relates to, I think, the heart of your question, yes, we don't like having any mark-to-market go down at all, so a negative 5% quarter is not great. But in the scheme of things, we're still holding our guidance for the full year. We had a positive [ 0-point ] -- a very modest positive last quarter and we're seeing strength in the fourth quarter. And we've been saying for some time, we think the front [indiscernible] of these expirations are getting better in terms of the mix, more higher pricing power footprints as well as more international footprints where we have greater pricing power on these renewals. And that's putting aside incremental uplift potential from this inflation-related impact that Bill kind of highlighted that should manifest itself over time. Chris, do you want to tackle the edge?"

But going 1 step further, and I think you're spot on in that we often talk about the edge evolving from the core out deeper into the metro.

So Europe is 1, in a general sense, North America and APAC.

And a few years ago, we said we were going to sell a few billion dollars of assets over a few years. And again, the reasons that we were recycling out of those assets and redeploying that capital into more core strategic assets remains. Whether they were assets that weren't core to our business or certain markets that weren't core to our business, that's why we're selling assets. We're not just selling assets because there's strong cap rate activity in the market. 
Now that obviously helps. But again, if an asset is core to us, we're not going to sell it just because cap rates are getting better. But again, it does put a little wind at our back to the extent we are selling assets now, given the improved pricing we're seeing in the market. And you're right, we saw strong pricing in our portfolio disposition in Europe this past year. And now on the Prudential deal, we saw very strong pricing, as you said, on the stabilized assets. It was mid-4s, of which we were fortunate to recognize almost $20 million of promote out of that transaction as well. 
So look, your point is right, pricing is strong. We think that bodes well for the sector and for big owners of assets like ourselves. But maybe I'll turn it over to Andy to go ahead and see if he has anything to add."

And the size of that investment, as I said, is very small for a company our size. And as I mentioned, Mozambique is even smaller. And we did that 1 to gain a location that again will play a critical role with the subsea cable activity that will encircle Africa. 
I think as you think about it, right, you look and see in Europe, right, we have Marseille in Western Europe, right, which is a highly connected hub. Then we've done a transaction with Lamda Hellix in Greece, which we believe is going to become a highly connected hub. And as you look at that, so you have Marseille to the west, you have Greece to the east. And as you move down into Africa, right, you look at Nigeria on the west, you look at Kenya in the east, right, and then you look at Mozambique that goes down to the south, and we really view this as really 1 large, like, crossroads of connectivity, if you will, that we think are going to bode well long term for the company."

You could see from the new logo or some of the logos we called out in my prepared remarks, kind of like more old world enterprise, global power firms and universities to burgeoning technologies like autonomous driving. And I think on the hyperscale side, a little bit similar. Some of the, call it, house names of digital growing with us into existing inventory as well as some, call it, next-generation hyperscalers landing with us in Tokyo, which I think was our second and third largest signing.

And then Facebook just put out their earnings last night. They increased their CapEx budget for 2022 by over 50% to somewhere, I think, near $30 billion.

And I think I've been saying that for some time that I think we're heading to more -- better territories. So again, we're not done with the budget and certainly not our guidance for 2022, but it feels like we're -- based on the mix, both product and geos and composition, we're in a better territory than we were certainly at the beginning of this year on that stat. 
We did -- across 4 or so suites, so different buildings across roughly half and half Ashburn and Chicago, a total of about 30 megawatts of new signings with the same customer that also did roughly 30 megawatts of renewals in the same quarter. And you could see this was a really super high renewal quarter overall for us. We've usually been doing like 100 megawatts or just shy of that in that plus than [ 1-megawatt ] LTM standpoint on. And so you can see, I think we had 53 or something in that category this quarter. So a high renewal activity quarter. So hopefully, that paints the picture on those 2. 
Undrawn forward equity offering, yes, we -- listen, we -- the equity offering was again opportunistically derisking our development CapEx plan, and we're able to extend the duration of that contract so we have greater flexibility to essentially feather it into our sources or uses over time at the right time for the business, which hopefully better -- is better measured and help contributes to our earnings growth in the ensuing years. 
Facebook CapEx increasing, I don't think we have got any inside information on that. They're a large customer. We've done -- we did new business with them in the last quarter. But I don't see how it could be a negative necessarily, but I don't want to over-index that is super positive to the industry."

I think Bill's comments to one of the questions, it didn't mean like overnight, the data center industry got a rate reset.

And I think Bill's commentary is that, listen, as this continues to hit costs and delivery or access to the infrastructure is to bring on new supply which is, we believe, is going to be disproportionately impacting smaller subscale newer entrants. That means that our customers have less options in terms of their providers. And I think that as our costs get inflated, we have to examine our rates and on a market-by-market supply and demand and costing basis. 
And listen, I think we're do the -- going to be the best out there in terms of insulating our customers from this. But I think if this period continues for a long time, we haven't had inflation realistically since, call it, the end of the Carter administration. So we're in new territory for many of us. But I think it's -- I think we're going to fare better at the end of the day.

Three, we generated double-digit revenue growth during the third quarter, once again exceeding consensus expectations. And once again, we raised our full year outlook.

Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework, and we made further progress on each front during the third quarter. We continue to globalize our business with significant bookings and solid performance across regions. Our bookings were diversified by both region and product type, reflecting our unique full-spectrum global product offering. 
We also announced our entry into 2 high-potential emerging markets, India and Nigeria, during the third quarter while expanding our connectivity capabilities by working with Zayo to develop the largest open fabric-of-fabrics that will interconnect key centers of data exchange. We are also extending our capabilities for customers to the edge with the announcement of what will be one of a few strategic partnerships in this arena. 
Let's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3. During the third quarter, Digital Realty was honored to be recognized by GRESB as an overall global sector leader in the technology and science category for exemplary ESG performance, receiving a coveted 5-star rating from this leading global ESG benchmarking organization and reflecting Digital Realty's commitment to being a global leader in ESG. We also became a UN Global Compact signatory in September, aligning our ESG goals and commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals with a global initiative. 
We also advanced our sustainable financing strategy, raising our first-ever Swiss green bonds and publishing the allocation of $440 million of proceeds from our September 2020 Euro green bond, which funded sustainable data center development projects in 4 countries across 3 continents certified in accordance with leading sustainable rating standards. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and broader society while advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all of these stakeholders. 
While on the topic of energy, I'm pleased to report that Digital Realty experienced only a small negative impact from the substantial rise in energy costs during the third quarter. In Europe, where concerns of an energy crisis were most acute, we typically contract for energy supplies a year or more in advance, providing price visibility and certainty for our customers. Elsewhere around the world, energy costs are typically passed through to customers, minimizing our direct exposure. We continue to keep a close eye on energy prices, but given the resiliency of our business model, we do not expect rising energy costs to impact our reported results by more than a few pennies. 
Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform. As previously announced, we entered into a joint venture with Brookfield to expand PlatformDIGITAL into India, a giant underserved market with the fifth largest GDP in the world. Like many emerging markets, India presents some unique challenges, underscoring the need for local knowledge and experience. To that end, we were pleased to announce the hiring of Seema Ambastha as CEO for the India joint venture. Seema has years of experience in the Indian IT sector broadly and in the data center industry specifically where she most recently served as a senior executive leader with the NTT Netmagic data center business across India. We believe the India data center market has the potential to experience significant growth over the next decade, and we're thrilled to have such a strong partner and strong leader in this exciting new venture. 
During the third quarter, we continued to expand iColo, our Kenyan data center operator, acquiring a land parcel in Mozambique to build a facility positioned to land subsea cables and other connectivity-focused customers. We also acquired a controlling interest in Medallion Communications, the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Nigeria in partnership with our existing African partner, Pembani Remgro. As the African Internet economy matures, we expect Nigeria will represent a significant growth opportunity, given its large and relatively young population, a growing and diversifying economy as well as a maturing regulatory environment. Given the connectivity of Africa from our existing hub in Marseille, our platform will now offer the market-leading destinations, connecting Africa to Europe and beyond. 
We're also investing to organically expand our capacity. As of September 30, we had 44 projects underway around the world, totaling almost 270 megawatts of incremental capacity with over 250 megawatts scheduled for delivery before the end of 2022. We continue to invest most heavily in EMEA, where we now have 27 projects underway in 15 different markets totaling 150 megawatts of incremental capacity, most of which is highly connected, including significant expansions in Frankfurt, Marseille, Paris and Zurich. Our investment in organic development is a reflection of the strength of demand across EMEA. 
We're being a bit more selective in North America. We're seeing strong demand in Portland where we have a 30-megawatt facility under construction that is 100% pre-leased and scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of next year, while we also have significant projects underway in Northern Virginia, New York and Toronto. 
Finally, in Asia Pacific, we continue to pursue strong organic development, both on our own and with our joint venture partners. We are adding capacity in Hong Kong that will open this quarter and expect to open Korea's first carrier-neutral facility in Seoul in early 2022. We are building a connected campus in Seoul to provide the full spectrum of solutions for our customers. The larger second facility will accommodate up to 64 megawatts of capacity and will be located within 25 kilometers of our first facility. 
Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers, and our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect developing trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. Just over a year ago, we introduced the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool that forecasts the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. 
Earlier this year, we published an industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities to guide cross-industry collaboration, tackle data gravity head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity. Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of data gravity. According to IDC, the amount of digital data created over the next 5 years will be greater than twice the amount of data created since the advent of digital storage. This digital data creation is expected to drive exponential growth in enterprise user data aggregation, storage and exchange, providing a powerful tailwind for data center demand. 
We continue to see enterprise and service provider customers deploying their own data hubs and using interconnection to securely exchange data in multiple metros on PlatformDIGITAL to accommodate their own data creation growth. Recently, for the second consecutive year, Digital Realty was ranked as the only outperformer and global leader by GigaOm for edge colocation. This ranking reflects our continued innovation and the execution of our PlatformDIGITAL road map for delivering global differentiated capabilities and value for our customers and partners. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market-leading innovation to capture the growing global demand opportunity from data-driven businesses. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results."

For the second straight quarter, we signed total bookings of $113 million, this time with a $12 million contribution from interconnection. Deal mix was consistent with the prior 4-quarter average, sub-1 megawatt deals plus interconnection represented about 40% of the total, while larger deals represented around 60%. Space and power bookings were also well diversified by region, with EMEA and APAC contributing 45% of our total, about the same as the Americas, with interconnection accounting for the remaining 10%. 
The weighted average lease term was a little over 5.5 years, and we landed a record 140 new logos during the third quarter, with strong showings across all regions, demonstrating the power of our global platform. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a leading cloud-native cybersecurity platform is expanding its high-performance computing capabilities by leveraging PlatformDIGITAL in 4 markets across North America and Europe, connecting with cloud providers, improving performance and driving down cost. 
A market-leading autonomous driving technology developer partnered with Digital Realty to tailor an innovative and unique infrastructure solution for simulation workloads. Two major North American energy firms chose Digital Realty to leverage our geographic reach and re-architect their network to interconnect with cloud providers and implement security controls as part of their hybrid IT strategy. A public university in the eastern U.S. is launching a global research initiative with other universities in EMEA and deploying PlatformDIGITAL network hubs across 2 continents and 3 cities to help enable this project. 
A maker of high-performance computing systems is expanding their footprint by deploying on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple regions to guarantee GDPR compliance while enhancing their security, performance and sustainability. And finally, a Global 500 fintech provider is expanding their own hybrid IT availability zones into multiple new metros, using PlatformDIGITAL to support their data-intensive and high-performance computing requirements. 
Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced rose from $303 million to $330 million, and third quarter signings more than offset commencements. The lag between signings and commencements was down slightly from last quarter at just over 7 months. 
Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed $223 million of renewal leases during the third quarter, our largest-ever renewal quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the quarter was a little over 3.5 years. Renewal rates for sub-1 megawatt deals remain consistently positive. Greater than 1 megawatt renewals were skewed by our largest deal of the quarter that combined a sizable 30-megawatt renewal with our largest new deal for the quarter, which will land entirely in existing currently vacant or soon-to-be-vacant capacity across Chicago and Ashburn. Excluding this 1 transaction, our cash mark-to-market would have been a positive 1%. 
This multifaceted transaction was a prime example of what we mean when we talk about our holistic long-term approach to customer relationship management. We believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer that we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And whenever we can, we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business as well as renewals. 
In terms of first quarter operating performance, reported portfolio occupancy ticked down by 50 basis points, largely driven by the sale of fully-leased assets during the quarter. Upon commencement of the large combination renewal expansion lease I mentioned a moment ago, portfolio occupancy is expected to improve by 70 basis points. Same-capital cash NOI growth was negative 5.5% in the third quarter, primarily driven by a spike in property taxes in Chicago, where local assessors have adopted a very aggressive posture along with the impact of the Ashburn churn event in January. 
Of the 70 megawatts we've got back on January 1, approximately 80% has since been released to multiple large and growing customers. As a reminder, the Westin Building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia are not yet included in the same-store pool, so these same-capital comparisons are less representative of our underlying business today than usual. And while we're still in the early stages of our budgeting process, we are optimistic in terms of where our same-store NOI growth goes for 2022. 
Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened during the third quarter, providing a small FX headwind in the third quarter. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. Our Swiss green bond offering during the quarter is a good example of this. 
In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have approximately a 50 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. 
In terms of earnings growth, third quarter core FFO per share was up 7% on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, driven by strong operational execution, cost controls and a reduction in financing costs from the debt refinancings and redemptions of preferred stock over the past year. To avoid any confusion, our core FFO outperformance excludes the benefit of a nearly $20 million promote fee received in connection with the monetization of our joint venture with Prudential. Heading into the final quarter of the year, we have solid momentum so we are raising our full year outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and core FFO per share to reflect this underlying momentum in our business. 
Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 12. We continue to recycle capital by disposing of assets that have limited growth prospects, raising over $100 million in the third quarter for our 20% position in the Prudential JV and some land in Arizona. We also raised approximately $95 million of common equity under our ATM program in July, as well as $950 million of common equity in a September forward equity offering. Our reported leverage ratio remains at 6x, but including committed proceeds from the September forward equity offering, the leverage ratio drops to 5.6x, while our fixed charge coverage improves to 6x. 
We continued to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. Our 2 capital markets transactions this quarter are examples of our prudent approach to balance sheet management. This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. 
As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is over 6 years and our weighted average coupon is down to 2.2%. 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. 
Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 14, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

I'll take your first question and I'll hand it over to Andy to adjust the -- to answer the Singapore REIT. First of all, I think you're right about inflation in terms of the opportunity that it presents. I think there's no doubt that it disproportionately, adversely affects our smaller competitors and widens our competitive moat. Over time, I would expect that rental rate increases will disproportionately accrue to the larger incumbent providers. 
There are basically 2 pieces to the inflation issue: the first is development, the second is operations. On the development side, we are -- our pipeline is on time and it's on budget, and they're kudos to Erich Sanchack, who leads our operations and procurement team for the vendor management programs that he's put in place, providing us fixed pricing for several years out, for diversifying our vendor mix and for allowing our -- for locking in our general contractors. We have a lot of construction sites around the world, and we're able to move our GCs around and keep them fully occupied. 
And I think our global scale as well as our maturity as a builder gives us a substantial competitive advantage here. But again, I don't think there's any doubt that market rents will eventually need to move up to maintain risk-adjusted returns. And I think that, that's both because of the increase in construction costs that show up in the denominator. But I think for our private competitors who are operating with more leverage, I think you're going to see that show up in the higher interest rates. So to -- I think they're going to have to raise their costs for that reason as well. 
And I think the readthrough here is actually really positive for our renewals because as our rates on new product increase, our rates will also, I expect, increase for renewals. So the bottom line there is that modest inflation, we think, is quite healthy for the business. And in terms of our customers, this shouldn't come as a surprise to them because to the extent that they're doing it themselves, they're seeing this development in their own supply chains. 
Relative to the operations of the P&L, I think as you probably know, our leases provide for significant pass-throughs. So for example, over 90% of our utility costs this last quarter were passed through to customers. We also have rent bumps generally between 2% and 3%. And then we have, I think, the highest operating -- or the best operating leverage of highest margins in the business. So what that means is that labor or labor costs, which I think is what's most susceptible to inflationary pressure, is a relatively low percentage of the revenue component in the income statement. And so with that, I'll hand it over to Andy to talk about the Singapore REIT."

We are kind of heading down the path of exploring essentially an IPO of a portfolio on the Singapore market. This is not our APAC business, which has significant amounts of capacity under construction and land and the like. This is essentially being more analogous to almost like a private capital partner to Digital Realty for stabilized, fully well-leased, high-quality core long-term hold data centers to Digital and our strategy. 
Somewhat analogous to one of our joint ventures that we've done in the past couple of years with that one of which was with a Singapore REIT. We're still working through this. It's a long IPO process. There's no certainty on the outcome or completion. Sizing would be obviously a modest IPO size to begin with. But we do think this option has the merits of being an attractive long-term partner vehicle to Digital Realty."

On the renewal, if you pulled that out of our mark-to-markets, we're positive 1%, but it was a 30-megawatt signing so it was a large kind of contributor to that. And on the new signing, I think it was into 4 or so different data halls. It was spread across both Ashburn and Chicago. It was 100% into existing vacant or to-be-vacated capacity, so a direct flow through to the bottom line, not, call it, future re-leasing. And so we think it was an attractive combination of helping a customer grow with us on our campus. And this is a customer we see future growth in years to come. So happy to support them."

We're not whistling by the graveyard on this topic. Obviously, inflation is here and will impact anyone that's called in the development arena.

Green power procurement is a massive part of that playbook, and we pride ourselves in what we've done in that efforts to further green our portfolio, including power purchase agreements. 
Some of those have a potentially offsetting impact if in the event that power prices are to surge that provides an incremental hedge to power costs. So where we see it in the event that this elevated power scenario plays out for the duration of 2022, we'd look at it as just a couple of cents, which call it, every $0.01 is just almost $3 million.

I think the trend has been our friend, for now, several quarters of more and more customers attracted to a global platform across 25 countries, 50 metropolitan areas, spanning the full customer spectrum, supporting those -- most of those 4,000 customers in the retail-oriented environments all the way up to the dedicated data halls for hyperscalers who we have in, call it, north of 45 different locations. And I've not seen any dramatic change in that. And I think you can see that now on several quarters of consistent, call it, results. But Corey, I don't know if you have any different observations."

Just curious how you're contemplating the edge in the North America market. And is that something that you're looking to create some further progression on in the near term or is that more of a longer-term ambition? 
And then just going back on some of the portfolio and pricing commentary. Just curious, when you have these large multi-megawatt deals where you're discounting to get new business or you have some repricing risk, is it because some of the needs of the customers are changing? Is it just market rents? Like what are some of the factors that are driving that? And how should investors think about just what might be left in the portfolio to get through on that basis?"

Maybe I'll take the second question and hand off to Chris to talk about what's next on edge. So I mean, listen, we're always in active relationship-oriented dialogues with our customers but especially our largest customers who we're supporting in so many different markets and really the full suite of products from network-oriented deployments, hybrid IT, all the way out to their true massive cloud compute. 
And we just want to -- we try to come to the table with holistic solutions. If they have a renewal that's coming in the coming years, we just make sure that's part of the conversation, right? And it often leads to situations like which recently transpired in the last quarter where they may not take some of the new business out to a full search of the market or say, ""You know what, I've already deployed on your campus and then growing these adjacent data halls is the right move."" So it's really a holistic relationship-oriented approach. 
As it relates to, I think, the heart of your question, yes, we don't like having any mark-to-market go down at all, so a negative 5% quarter is not great. But in the scheme of things, we're still holding our guidance for the full year. We had a positive 0-point -- a very modest positive last quarter and we're seeing strength in the fourth quarter. And we've been saying for some time, we think the front [ review ] of these expirations are getting better in terms of the mix, more higher pricing power footprints as well as more international footprints where we have greater pricing power on these renewals. And that's putting aside incremental uplift potential from this inflation-related impact that Bill kind of highlighted that should manifest itself over time. Chris, do you want to tackle the edge?"

I just want to also commend Giuliano as getting the role of CEO over at AtlasEdge. It's a great opportunity for him and we'll continue to work closely with him. So I appreciate the question, Michael. But going one step further, and I think you're spot on in that we often talk about the edge evolving from the core out deeper into the metro. And I think one aspect of that is no 2 markets are equal, so there's definitely varying degrees of capabilities in each of the markets globally. 
So Europe is one, in a general sense, North America and APAC. We absolutely are pursuing different types of partnerships within all of these markets because, quite frankly, our largest customers are looking for a global solution. And so we're always looking at what is the best path to enable our customers in the most efficient way possible. That's at the core of what is our edge thesis that we continually refine and that's what we referenced even in the prepared remarks, I think, in Bill's section about you'll see other partnerships in different markets just to really helping us prosecute that opportunity when it matures over time."

And a few years ago, we said we were going to sell a few billion dollars of assets over a few years. And again, the reasons that we were recycling out of those assets and redeploying that capital into more core strategic assets remains. Whether they were assets that weren't core to our business or certain markets that weren't core to our business, that's why we're selling assets. We're not just selling assets because there's strong cap rate activity in the market. 
Now that obviously helps. But again, if an asset is core to us, we're not going to sell it just because cap rates are getting better. But again, it does put a little wind at our back to the extent we are selling assets now, given the improved pricing we're seeing in the market. And you're right, we saw strong pricing in our portfolio disposition in Europe this past year. And now on the Prudential deal, we saw very strong pricing, as you said, on the stabilized assets. It was mid-4s, of which we were fortunate to recognize almost $20 million of promote out of that transaction as well. 
So look, your point is right, pricing is strong. We think that bodes well for the sector and for big owners of assets like ourselves. But maybe I'll turn it over to Andy to go ahead and see if he has anything to add."

And another transaction we disclosed was the acquisition of a land parcel in Mozambique, again, with Pembani. That was for $3 million. So I mean, look, these are clearly -- what I would say is these are small Cs that we're planning in these highly connected assets because they are, they're highly connected communities of interest. And we're doing it with a smart local partner in Pembani. And when you look at a market like Nigeria, right, it's got the largest GDP and population in Africa.

We did -- across 4 or so suites, so different buildings across roughly half and half Ashburn and Chicago, a total of about 30 megawatts of new signings with the same customer that also did roughly 30 megawatts of renewals in the same quarter.

So our Santa Clara and Northern -- Santa Clara's an example of that. I mean our leasing success has been certainly a [ healing ] to the Ashburn market. We saw this in Frankfurt. Singapore saw this in terms of supply limitations, driving up pricing, which we've raised pricing there at least 5 times, I think, in the last 12 months. 
And I think Bill's commentary is that, listen, as this continues to hit [ car ] costs and delivery or access to the infrastructure is to bring on new supply which is, we believe, is going to be disproportionately impacting smaller subscale newer entrants, that means that our customers have less options in terms of their providers. And I think that as our costs get inflated, we have to examine our rates and on a market-by-market supply and demand and costing basis. 
And listen, I think we're -- do the -- going to be the best out there in terms of insulating our customers from this. But I know -- I think if this period continues for a long time, we haven't had inflation realistically since, call it, the end of the Carter administration. So we're in new territory for many of us. But I think it's -- I think we're going to fare better at the end of the day. 
And we are insulated in terms of we have rent escalators, fixed bumps in most of our contracts. And I think our scale and purchasing power on an operating side as well as the build cost side provides insulation in addition to some of the other risk mitigations we mentioned earlier in the call."

All these things kind of go into the factors that drive the commercial outcome on those. And it was 30 megawatts all at once, right? So 30 megawatts of new signs for 30 megawatts of renewals, all with a stroke of a pen."

I'd like to wrap our call today by recapping our highlights for the third quarter as outlined here on the last page of the presentation. One, our value proposition is clearly resonating with customers. PlatformDIGITAL attracted a record number of new logos. We had another quarter of strong new bookings and a record level of renewals. Most importantly, customers know that we will do what we say. Even when global supply chains are stressed, Digital Realty delivers. 
Two, we're continuing to extend our global platform. We are investing organically to enhance our global footprint while expanding our platform into India, along with additional strategic connectivity destinations circling the African continent. 
Three, we generated double-digit revenue growth during the third quarter, once again exceeding consensus expectations. And once again, we raised our full year outlook. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, locking in attractively priced long-term debt and supplementing it with equity capital that will be drawn down over the next 18 months to support our global development program. 
I'd like to once again thank the Digital Realty frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world turning. I hope that you all stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see many of you virtually in a couple of weeks at NAREIT and hopefully in person again sometime soon. Thank you."
