Let me start by looking back at the year that just ended.  2020 was a year like no other. We faced a global pandemic, record oil demand destruction and an unprecedented downturn in the energy industry. Despite these turbulent times, Halliburton demonstrated resilience and performed consistently with our execution culture. 
Before we get to our results, I want to address our outstanding employees. I thank you for your hard work and execution throughout the entire year. You answered the call for safety, collaboration and service quality and delivered for Halliburton's customers and our shareholders. 
Now I want to highlight a few of our 2020 accomplishments. We delivered historic bests in all of our key safety and service quality metrics, recordable injury rate, lost time injury rate, vehicle incident rate, environmental recordable rate and nonproductive time. Each of these key metrics improved by over 20%, and most did so for the second year in a row. This was a result of our employees' continued commitment to safety and process execution despite the year's distractions. 
Total company revenue of $14.4 billion outperformed the global rig count decline of 38%, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our business. Our swift and decisive cost actions and service delivery improvements reset our earnings power, allowing us to deliver resilient margin performance. 
Our Completion and Production division finished the year with close to 16% operating margins, exiting the year higher than where they started. These results highlight the success of our structural cost reductions and process improvements. 
Our Drilling and Evaluation division had a strong full year margin performance despite the rig count declines experienced in all regions. We delivered over $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the year, demonstrating our ability to generate strong free cash flow throughout different business environments. 
We increased the breadth and depth of our digital offerings and delivered best-in-class performance across the spectrum of digital technologies. And we successfully launched Halliburton Labs, a collaborative environment where entrepreneurs, academics, investors and industrial labs come together to advance cleaner, affordable energy. 
Now let me share a few points about our fourth quarter performance. We finished the quarter with total company revenue of $3.2 billion, a 9% sequential increase, and adjusted operating income of $350 million, an increase of 27% sequentially. This marks the first quarterly revenue increase since the activity declines began last March. 
Our Completion and Production division, revenue increased 15% sequentially while operating income improved 33%, resulting in an operating margin improvement of 2% over the prior quarter. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue and operating income grew 2% and 11%, respectively. 
Higher rig activity in the Western Hemisphere was offset by rig count declines in the Eastern Hemisphere. International revenue remained flat sequentially. Activity in Latin America improved for the second quarter in a row. Activity declines continued in other regions but at a slower pace compared to the prior quarters. 
And lastly, our North America revenue increased 26% sequentially, driven primarily by increases in both drilling and completions activity in U.S. land. Our overall strong performance was a direct result of our focus on the key strategic priorities that define Halliburton's path now and into the future. We are focused on profitable growth in our strong international franchise, and we are driving strategic changes in North America and building a leaner and more profitable business. 
We are accelerating the deployment and integration of digital technologies, both internally and with our customers. We are driving capital efficiency by advancing our technologies and making strategic choices that lower our CapEx profile. And we are an active participant in advancing a sustainable energy future. 
As we start the new year, we believe that the worst is behind us and look to the future with optimism. Oil prices are back to pre pandemic levels, driven by global vaccine distribution and unfolding demand recovery, OPEC+ discipline and a declining production base. However, some caution is appropriate due to the surge in COVID-19 infections globally and the expected gradual return of spare production capacity. 
Our 5 strategic priorities will continue to drive Halliburton's success as markets around the world stabilize and start to grow. We believe that aligning our actions with these priorities will boost our returns and free cash flow generation both today and as the recovery unfolds. 
We set these priorities according to our long-term view of the market. As oil demand recovers, we expect to see favorable market dynamics and the beginning of a multiyear energy up cycle. However, we believe this recovery will look different than prior cycles. International short-cycle producers will have an opportunity to gain share. 
North American E&Ps will increase spending from current levels that will take a more disciplined approach to growing production in the future. We believe that the overall cost and environmental impact of producing oil and gas will continue to decline due to innovation and technology adoption. As a result, oil and gas will remain a critical and significant component of the energy mix. 
I expect that our gains achieved in 2020, including service delivery improvements, structural cost reductions and capital efficiency, are firmly in place and sustainable. Halliburton is uniquely positioned in all markets and is prepared to deliver on both our customer expectations and our shareholder objectives. 
Our strong international business outperformed the market. Our full year international revenue declined 17%, while rig counts and customer spending were down more than 20%. All regions, except Latin America, declined in the fourth quarter, but at a slower pace. 
In the first quarter, we expect international activity to be impacted by typical weather-related seasonality and the absence of year-end product sales. Activity should bottom during the first quarter and improve as the year unfolds. 
For the full year, we expect activity recovery to vary widely across regions. Latin America will continue its upward momentum off a very low bottom, both onshore and offshore. Asia Pacific is also showing signs of activity improvement. We believe parts of Europe and West Africa will remain slow, especially in the deepwater areas. As for the Middle East and Russia, we believe they will manage activity based on expectations of the economic and demand recovery. 
While the pace of recovery depends on the trajectory of demand improvement, we believe the second half of this year could see a low double-digit increase in international activity year-on-year. Halliburton is well positioned to benefit from this increase. 
Let me be clear. Our target is profitable growth. Against a tough activity backdrop in 2020, we remain focused on increasing profitability and our actions resulted in overall international margin improvement. 
In 2021, we expect that several factors will continue to drive Halliburton's profitable international growth. Halliburton will benefit from our improved position in the international markets this cycle. We are stronger technically, geographically and organizationally. We have exposure to mature field completions and interventions work, a deck of resilient integrated contracts around the world, leveraged to unconventional developments in Latin America and the Middle East and a leading position in key active offshore areas. 
While the international sales cycle tends to be longer, we now have line of sight to activity increases in the coming quarters. Tender activity has picked up recently, led by the NOCs in the Middle East and Latin America, and new opportunities are emerging with operators in other regions. Our customers have also pulled forward mobilization plans for various contracts awarded to Halliburton that were put on hold due to the pandemic. 
Our new drilling technologies are penetrating the market and gaining customer confidence. For example, we exited the year with a threefold increase in our EarthStar deep resistivity sensor revenue. As activity recovers, our technology provides us with a tremendous opportunity to profitably grow revenue. 
We see significant growth potential in the continued international expansion of our production businesses, especially in mature fields around the world. For example, the international artificial lift market tends to be more resilient in this longer cycle. Once an operator puts its field on the specific form of lift, it typically stays on it for many years. We are currently mobilizing for our first multiyear electric submersible pump contract in the Middle East and are excited about the opportunities artificial lift opens for us in the region. 
The construction of our specialty chemicals plant in Saudi Arabia continues to progress towards final completion. When it is complete, Halliburton will have a differentiated value chain in the region that maximizes local content, delivers customized solutions more quickly and shortens customer lead times. I'm excited about these 2 new additions to our international portfolio that provide us with unique growth opportunities. 
Finally, adoption of Halliburton's digital solutions helps our customers to reduce cost per barrel, improve project economics and increase efficiencies. Our Halliburton 4.0 digital offerings in subsurface, well construction and reservoir and production create differentiation and margin growth opportunities for Halliburton. 
We are pleased that in 2021, several international oil companies are deploying DecisionSpace 365 cloud applications to streamline and automate their well construction activities. I believe that digital and other technology advances, geographic expansion of our products and services, along with continued discipline in cost management and capital efficiency should allow Halliburton to continue delivering profitable returns-driven growth in the international markets. 
Turning to North America. The strategic actions we took last year reset Halliburton's earnings power in this critical but structurally smaller market. We are the leader in North America and the only integrated oilfield services company still active in the hydraulic fracturing market. 
In the fourth quarter, our North America business took advantage of the recovery in completions and drilling activity and delivered continued margin improvement even without improved pricing. Completion stage counts increased in the oil basins, but declined modestly in the gas plays. 
While the U.S. land rig count recovered from its August 2020 low of 230 rigs, it is still 60% below the pre pandemic levels. Private and small operators added the most rigs, while large E&Ps and majors moved more slowly. We expect completions activity in North America to continue improving in the first half of 2021 as commodity prices remain supportive and customers complete their backlog of DUCs. Customer consolidation will likely continue, and we expect most operators will remain committed to a disciplined capital program. 
For the full year, provided that the impact of the pandemic moderates economic activity continues to increase and oil price remains solid. I am optimistic that our customers will sustain activity in order to hold their production flat to 2020 exit levels, with completion spend outpacing drilling. 
I'm excited about Halliburton's future in North America, and here's why. We completed the most aggressive set of structural cost reductions in our history, giving us meaningful operating leverage in a recovering market. We also made significant changes to our processes that drive higher contribution margin, for example, how we perform equipment maintenance and provide engineering support. We believe the benefits of these changes will have a meaningful impact on our margins as activity picks up. 
The hydraulic fracturing market structure continues to improve. Utilization of our active equipment is higher than it was at the beginning of last year. The market has continued to rationalize and consolidate. We are seeing competitors either cannibalize idle equipment for parts or use it to beef up working fleets, thus increasing average horsepower per fleet. This will make equipment reactivation to meet growing demand a lot harder for capital-constrained companies and should only accelerate supply and demand balancing. 
As activity starts to increase, Halliburton has a unique competitive advantage and sufficient capacity to respond without adding incremental capital. Our in-house engineering capabilities to refurbish, maintain and continuously improve our fracturing and perforating equipment minimize the cost and time to deliver the necessary equipment to our customers and take advantage of the market recovery. 
We are also well positioned to profitably grow in our competitive nonhydraulic fracturing businesses in North America. For example, in 2020, our artificial lift business developed and implemented new digital capabilities, increased remote operations jobs and solidified its strong market position in North America. We also expect our well construction technology investments to best position Halliburton to outperform as drilling rigs return. 
Using the Halliburton 4.0 digital framework, we continue to collaborate and engineer solutions that maximize our customers' asset value. Last quarter, we launched our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system and successfully completed a customer engagement in West Texas. 
SmartFleet is an industry first, where intelligent automation manages and executes live treatment decisions to optimize subsurface fracture outcomes. By using SmartFleet, the operator was able to consistently visualize and measure fracture propagation and control fracture replacement through automation. 
Importantly, the system provided a level of subsurface control that was previously not possible and enabled the customer to actively drive their completion outcomes in real time. We are building on this success with multiple customer commitments across different basins. I believe this is the biggest step forward in fracturing technology in a long time. 
Let me give you a few more examples of how we are accelerating Halliburton 4.0 digital adoption. In the North Sea, we successfully delivered the first fully automated cement job where the offshore cementing unit executed the work without human intervention. This is an important milestone in reaching the vision of fully autonomous offshore well construction that has significant implications for efficiency, safety and operating costs. 
In 2020, we more than tripled the number of DecisionSpace 365 users on the iEnergy cloud platform. Our customers also increased adoption of the DecisionSpace 365 asset simulator. Operators in Europe, Latin America and Asia ran over 3,000 reservoir simulation scenarios on the iEnergy Cloud with speeds of up to 7x faster than with conventional on-premise simulators. 
Finally, we are teaming up with Accenture to drive the digital transformation of our supply chain. This will result in process efficiencies across large volumes of transactional activities, lower our overall cost and free up resources to drive strategic decision making in support of our operational requirements. 
Next, I want to discuss capital efficiency, a key enabler of our other strategic priorities. Leveraging new materials and design approaches as well as digital innovation, we've been able to significantly reduce CapEx requirements and extend the life of our equipment. We are continuing our iCruise drilling system deployment and are reaping the benefits of a reduced CapEx profile and higher asset velocity. Technology advancements in multiple product service lines in both divisions are allowing us to improve design and service configuration to save time and money, both for our customers and Halliburton. 
Finally, I would like to highlight several important actions we took in alignment with our strategic priority to participate in advancing a sustainable energy future. We are working to reduce the carbon footprint and environmental impact of our own operations and have committed to setting targets through the science-based targets initiative to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. 
With this commitment, Halliburton joins over 1,000 global companies taking science-based climate action. This is important in our journey to align with the latest climate science and contribute to sustainable energy advancement. 
We are also collaborating with our customers to produce oil and gas more efficiently while reducing their emissions. We are currently performing the first electric grid-powered fracturing operation for Cimarex Energy in the Permian Basin. With over 300 stages on multiple wells already completed Halliburton's electric-powered equipment has allowed the customer to achieve pump rates that were 30% to 40% higher than conventional pumps by utilizing the maximum grid power potential. 
Grid-powered electric spreads require substantially less capital, a smaller footprint and are more efficient compared to turbine power. When demand for emission reduction solutions translates to better pricing, I expect we will replace within our planned capital budget some of our conventional fracturing capacity with electric over the course of a normal equipment replacement cycle. 
Halliburton is starting the new year with a clear sense of purpose. We believe that our strategic priorities are the right ones, and our margins in the fourth quarter demonstrated that. We are confident that the actions we have taken are sustainable, and we are well positioned both internationally and in North America for the unfolding market recovery. 
I'll now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Lance?"

Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, an increase of 9%. And adjusted operating income was $350 million, an increase of 27%. During the fourth quarter, we recognized approximately $450 million of pretax impairments and other charges, primarily related to the fair value adjustment of our real estate assets in North America. 
As part of our 2020 structural cost reduction initiative, we reduced the amount of real estate required to run our business. In the second quarter, we decreased our real estate use of North America by roughly 50% by closing, selling, consolidating and reducing the size of many facilities. Subsequently, we conducted a detailed analysis on how we own, lease and operate our remaining real estate footprint. As a result, we concluded that a structured transaction is likely to be advantageous in managing the majority of our North American real estate, which led to the fair value adjustment I just discussed. This initiative is consistent with our strategic priority to achieve capital efficiency in our business, while allowing us to retain flexibility and drive future operating benefits. 
Let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in more detail. In our Completion and Production division, revenue increased $236 million or 15%, while operating income increased $70 million, an increase of 33%. These increases were driven by higher activity in multiple product service lines in North America; increased stimulation activity in Argentina and Kuwait; higher completion tool sales in Africa, Southeast Asia and Norway; and increased well intervention services internationally. These increases were partially offset by lower pressure pumping activity in Saudi Arabia and lower completion tool sales in Eurasia and Australia. 
Our Drilling and Evaluation revenue increased $26 million or 2%, while operating income grew by $12 million or an 11% increase. These increases were primarily due to higher drilling-related services in North America and Brazil; increased wireline activity in North America and Latin America; as well as higher fluid sales in Asia Pacific and Guyana; and increased software sales across all regions. Partially offsetting these increases were lower drilling-related services and project management activity in Europe-Africa CIS, the Middle East and Mexico as well as reduced wireline activity in Asia Pacific and Saudi Arabia. 
Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue increased $254 million, a 26% increase. These results were driven by higher activity in stimulation and artificial lift in U.S. land as well as higher well construction and wireline services activity and year-end completion tools and software sales. 
Latin America revenue grew $46 million or 12%, resulting primarily from increased pressure pumping and wireline activity in Argentina and activity increases in multiple product service lines in Colombia and Ecuador as well as higher fluid sales in Guyana and drilling services in Brazil. These increases were partially offset by reduced activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico. 
Turning to Europe-Africa CIS. Revenue was modestly down by $7 million or a decrease of 1%, resulting primarily from reduced drilling-related services and completion tool sales in Eurasia, coupled with lower drilling-related activity in Norway. These results were partially offset by higher completion tool sales in Africa, Norway and Continental Europe as well as increased stimulation and well intervention services in Algeria and Continental Europe. 
Middle East Asia revenue declined $31 million or 3%, largely attributed to lower activity in multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, reduced drilling activity in United Arab Emirates and decreased project management activity in India. These decreases were partially offset by higher drilling-related services in China, Australia and Malaysia, increased stimulation activity in Kuwait and higher software sales across the region. 
In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $49 million, and we expect it to be approximately the same in the first quarter of 2021. Net interest expense for the quarter was $125 million and should remain essentially flat in the first quarter. 
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 19%. Based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix, we expect our 2021 first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
We generated approximately $638 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter and delivered over $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the full year. As a result, we ended the year with approximately $2.6 billion in cash. We will continue to prioritize reducing leverage in the near term and intend to pay down $685 million of debt coming due this year with cash on hand. 
Capital expenditures during the quarter were $218 million, with our 2020 full year CapEx totaling approximately $730 million. In 2021, we intend to keep our capital expenditures relatively flat at $750 million. We believe that with this level of spend, we will be well equipped to take advantage of the unfolding recovery. 
Finally, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter playing out. As is typical, our results for the first quarter of 2021 will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of year-end product sales, which primarily impact our international and Gulf of Mexico businesses. 
While we anticipate a slower than normal start to the year in some international regions, we also expect activity momentum in North America to continue, with completions activity outpacing drilling activity. As such, in our Completion and Production division, we expect revenue to increase 3% to 5% sequentially and operating margins to decline 150 to 200 basis points, largely due to a different business mix. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate a low single-digit revenue increase sequentially, with operating margins expected to increase by 50 to 75 basis points.

And while it's a structurally lower market or smaller market, you've created a nice cash flow machine there. 
The question in my mind, and you gave some color around this, Jeff, but I wanted to dig in a little further, is the outlook for kind of full year '21. With North America, I know you mentioned you feel like the momentum is still good. But I guess, first is there some peak that we're going to see here some stabilization of activity as the companies remain capital disciplined as you get back to kind of this maintenance level?

And that's predicated on customers, I think, will be certainly rational and capital disciplined. But I think there's also pressure to hold production flat in 2021, which creates a bit of a floor as we look at the full year. 
From an international perspective, I feel confident around the international recovery. And I think in terms of magnitude, the second half of 2021, we believe or I believe, will be up low double digits. So that's fairly solid. And that's based on the tender pipeline that we're seeing and the types of barrels that are produced. Shorter cycle, I think, will lend themselves to that type of uptick. 
And maybe one last word on international outlook. I mean, I think the -- we view 2021 as a bit of a transition year. I mean 2020 was the worst in our history. And we view 2022 is when we see the global rebalancing of supply and demand, which creates the sort of underpinning of a multiyear up cycle. And so that we see Q1 as a bottom and then steadily building from there. That's the kind of momentum that we really like to see going into that supply and demand sort of coming into balance."

So we've got completion tool sales that are falling off and are being replaced. That revenue is being replaced by an improving North America market activity, but not at the same level of profitability. But look, we're encouraged about some of the backlog that we see building in our completion tool business. And I think that also gives us the confidence that Jeff just outlined in terms of the back half of the year, particularly in the international markets. 
As you think about C&P margin progression in 2021, I mean, I'd remind you and others on the call that we're starting from a much higher point in 2021 than we did even in 2020 before the impact of the pandemic. And that's on a much lower activity level. On a full year basis, I would say, Angie, that our expectations is that we still drive mid-teens margins for our C&P division. And look, if we are able to get some pricing momentum, it could go higher than that. But we're happy with what we've done, particularly creating the operating leverage in the business. Jeff has mentioned several times that it's sustainable. And I think it fundamentally drives higher incrementals, at least that's what the management team here is focused on for this next up cycle. 
On D&E margins, again, I think we are starting 2021 higher sequentially, which is typically not the case for our business as we go through some of the seasonality issues that we've mentioned and year-end software sales falling off. So I'm encouraged to see the momentum and margin progression across the end of the year and into the beginning of 2021. And that's coming off, again, a largest rig drop in history for our business and our industry. Our expectations is to get to double-digit margins by the end of the year, end of the year 2021. And I think that we're ready to do that through capitalizing on, obviously, a recovering market that Jeff talked about in the back half of the year, but also on the technology and digital investments that we've made into the business throughout the course of 2020 and reaping the benefits in 2021. But I think the overall point, particularly for our D&E business, as you think about the international markets, is a real focus on profitable growth."

Look, I think that was -- it's an elegant and differentiated solution, but clearly, a premium solution. We've been working on the electric technology for a number of years and have always described some of the challenges around electric also being the cost and the upfront capital associated with it. The grid solution actually eliminates the requirement for turbines, which have come with a range of either operating problems or emissions. And so -- and it's important to give a shout out to the Cimarex management team here because a lot of innovation and collaboration together in order to bring together a very efficient solution and also one with the absolute lowest emissions. I mean, because now it's tapped into the grid and consuming sort of a variety of different energy sources. So the customer commitment was very important. 
I think customer interest will be high, but it's also -- over time, but it's also going to require pricing and different types of contract terms. And I view this, though, as part of our normal reinvestment cycle. Clearly, there's interest. But we have a planned reinvestment cycle that's inside of our capital budget and our outlook on capital efficiency and certainly see electric having a place in that, but that's where it will sit."

In North America, again, I think Q1 last year creates a lot of noise in that comparison. But the important thing is I do believe customers will be capital disciplined. But we've got a lot of growth to go just to get back to where we were even pre pandemic when the first quarter of '20. And so I think that -- and we saw production come off pretty hard in 2020. So just to keep things flat in 2021, from a production perspective, requires a reasonable amount of activity and actually more activity than we even see today based on kind of our calculation and outlook. Which gives me good confidence that while we've got good momentum in the first quarter and we've got pretty good visibility for the year.

Let me start by looking back at the year that just ended. 2020 was a year like no other. We faced a global pandemic, record oil demand destruction and an unprecedented downturn in the energy industry. Despite these turbulent times, Halliburton demonstrated resilience and performed consistently with our execution culture.
Before we get to our results, I want to address our outstanding employees. I thank you for your hard work and execution throughout the entire year. You answered the call for safety, collaboration and service quality and delivered for Halliburton's customers and our shareholders.
Now I want to highlight a few of our 2020 accomplishments. We delivered historic bests in all of our key safety and service quality metrics, recordable injury rate, lost time injury rate, vehicle incident rate, environmental recordable rate and nonproductive time. Each of these key metrics improved by over 20%, and most did so for the second year in a row. This was a result of our employees' continued commitment to safety and process execution despite the year's distractions.
Total company revenue of $14.4 billion outperformed the global rig count decline of 38%, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our business. Our swift and decisive cost actions and service delivery improvements reset our earnings power, allowing us to deliver resilient margin performance.
Our Completion and Production division finished the year with close to 16% operating margins, exiting the year higher than where they started. These results highlight the success of our structural cost reductions and process improvements.
Our Drilling and Evaluation division had a strong full year margin performance despite the rig count declines experienced in all regions. We delivered over $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the year, demonstrating our ability to generate strong free cash flow throughout different business environments.
We increased the breadth and depth of our digital offerings and delivered best-in-class performance across a spectrum of digital technologies. And we successfully launched Halliburton Labs, a collaborative environment where entrepreneurs, academics, investors and industrial labs come together to advance cleaner, affordable energy.
Now let me share a few points about our fourth quarter performance. We finished the quarter with total company revenue of $3.2 billion, a 9% sequential increase; and adjusted operating income of $350 million, an increase of 27% sequentially. This marks the first quarterly revenue increase since the activity declines began last March.
Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 15% sequentially while operating income improved 33%, resulting in an operating margin improvement of 2% over the prior quarter. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue and operating income grew 2% and 11%, respectively.
Higher rig activity in the Western Hemisphere was offset by rig count declines in the Eastern Hemisphere. International revenue remained flat sequentially. Activity in Latin America improved for the second quarter in a row. Activity declines continued in other regions but at a slower pace compared to the prior quarters. And lastly, our North America revenue increased 26% sequentially, driven primarily by increases in both drilling and completions activity in U.S. land. 
Our overall strong performance was a direct result of our focus on the key strategic priorities that define Halliburton's path now and into the future. We are focused on profitable growth in our strong international franchise, and we are driving strategic changes in North America and building a leaner and more profitable business.
We are accelerating the deployment and integration of digital technologies, both internally and with our customers. We are driving capital efficiency by advancing our technologies and making strategic choices that lower our CapEx profile. And we are an active participant in advancing a sustainable energy future.
As we start the new year, we believe that the worst is behind us and look to the future with optimism. Oil prices are back to prepandemic levels, driven by global vaccine distribution and unfolding demand recovery, OPEC+ discipline and a declining production base. However, some caution is appropriate due to the surge in COVID-19 infections globally and the expected gradual return of spare production capacity.
Our 5 strategic priorities will continue to drive Halliburton's success as markets around the world stabilize and start to grow. We believe that aligning our actions with these priorities will boost our returns and free cash flow generation both today and as the recovery unfolds.
We set these priorities according to our long-term view of the market. As oil demand recovers, we expect to see favorable market dynamics and the beginning of a multiyear energy up cycle. However, we believe this recovery will look different than prior cycles. International short-cycle producers will have an opportunity to gain share. North American E&Ps will increase spending from current levels that will take a more disciplined approach to growing production in the future. We believe that the overall cost and environmental impact of producing oil and gas will continue to decline due to innovation and technology adoption. As a result, oil and gas will remain a critical and significant component of the energy mix.
I expect that our gains achieved in 2020, including service delivery improvements, structural cost reductions and capital efficiency, are firmly in place and sustainable. Halliburton is uniquely positioned in all markets and is prepared to deliver on both our customer expectations and our shareholder objectives.
Our strong international business outperformed the market. Our full year international revenue declined 17%, while rig counts and customer spending were down more than 20%. All regions, except Latin America, declined in the fourth quarter, but at a slower pace.
In the first quarter, we expect international activity to be impacted by typical weather-related seasonality and the absence of year-end product sales. Activity should bottom during the first quarter and improve as the year unfolds.
For the full year, we expect activity recovery to vary widely across regions. Latin America will continue its upward momentum off a very low bottom, both onshore and offshore. Asia Pacific is also showing signs of activity improvement. We believe parts of Europe and West Africa will remain slow, especially in the deepwater areas. As for the Middle East and Russia, we believe they will manage activity based on expectations of the economic and demand recovery.
While the pace of recovery depends on the trajectory of demand improvement, we believe the second half of this year could see a low double-digit increase in international activity year-on-year. Halliburton is well positioned to benefit from this increase.
Let me be clear. Our target is profitable growth against a tough activity backdrop in 2020, we remain focused on increasing profitability, and our actions resulted in overall international margin improvement.
In 2021, we expect that several factors will continue to drive Halliburton's profitable international growth. Halliburton will benefit from our improved position in the international markets this cycle. We are stronger technically, geographically and organizationally. We have exposure to mature field completions and interventions work, a deck of resilient integrated contracts around the world, leveraged to unconventional developments in Latin America and the Middle East and a leading position in key active offshore areas. 
While the international sales cycle tends to be longer, we now have line of sight to activity increases in the coming quarters. Tender activity has picked up recently, led by the NOCs in the Middle East and Latin America, and new opportunities are emerging with operators in other regions. Our customers have also pulled forward mobilization plans for various contracts awarded to Halliburton that were put on hold due to the pandemic.
Our new drilling technologies are penetrating the market and gaining customer confidence. For example, we exited the year with a threefold increase in our EarthStar deep resistivity sensor revenue. As activity recovers, our technology provides us with a tremendous opportunity to profitably grow revenue.
We see significant growth potential in the continued international expansion of our production businesses, especially in mature fields around the world. For example, the international artificial lift market tends to be more resilient in this longer cycle. Once an operator puts its field on a specific form of lift, it typically stays on it for many years. We are currently mobilizing for our first multiyear electric submersible pump contract in the Middle East and are excited about the opportunities artificial lift opens for us in the region. 
The construction of our specialty chemicals plant in Saudi Arabia continues to progress towards final completion. When it is complete, Halliburton will have a differentiated value chain in the region that maximizes local content, delivers customized solutions more quickly and shortens customer lead times. I'm excited about these 2 new additions to our international portfolio that provide us with unique growth opportunities.
Finally, adoption of Halliburton's digital solutions helps our customers to reduce cost per barrel, improve project economics and increase efficiencies. Our Halliburton 4.0 digital offerings in subsurface, well construction and reservoir and production create differentiation and margin growth opportunities for Halliburton. We are pleased that in 2021, several international oil companies are deploying DecisionSpace 365 cloud applications to streamline and automate their well construction activities. I believe that digital and other technology advances, geographic expansion of our products and services, along with continued discipline in cost management and capital efficiency should allow Halliburton to continue delivering profitable returns-driven growth in the international markets.
Turning to North America. The strategic actions we took last year reset Halliburton's earnings power in this critical but structurally smaller market. We are the leader in North America and the only integrated oilfield services company still active in the hydraulic fracturing market.
In the fourth quarter, our North America business took advantage of the recovery in completions and drilling activity and delivered continued margin improvement even without improved pricing. Completion stage counts increased in the oil basins, but declined modestly in the gas plays. While the U.S. land rig count recovered from its August 2020 low of 230 rigs, it is still 60% below the prepandemic levels. Private and small operators added the most rigs, while large E&Ps and majors moved more slowly. 
We expect completions activity in North America to continue improving in the first half of 2021 as commodity prices remain supportive and customers complete their backlog of DUCs. Customer consolidation will likely continue, and we expect most operators will remain committed to a disciplined capital program. For the full year, provided that the impact of the pandemic moderates, economic activity continues to increase and oil price remains solid, I am optimistic that our customers will sustain activity in order to hold their production flat to 2020 exit levels, with completion spend outpacing drilling.
I'm excited about Halliburton's future in North America. And here's why. We completed the most aggressive set of structural cost reductions in our history, giving us meaningful operating leverage in a recovering market. We also made significant changes to our processes that drive higher contribution margin, for example, how we perform equipment maintenance and provide engineering support. We believe the benefits of these changes will have a meaningful impact on our margins as activity picks up.
The hydraulic fracturing market structure continues to improve. Utilization of our active equipment is higher than it was at the beginning of last year. The market has continued to rationalize and consolidate. We are seeing competitors either cannibalize idle equipment for parts or use it to beef up working fleets, thus increasing average horsepower per fleet. This will make equipment reactivation to meet growing demand a lot harder for capital-constrained companies and should only accelerate supply and demand balancing.
As activity starts to increase, Halliburton has a unique competitive advantage and sufficient capacity to respond without adding incremental capital. Our in-house engineering capabilities to refurbish, maintain and continuously improve our fracturing and perforating equipment minimize the cost and time to deliver the necessary equipment to our customers and take advantage of the market recovery.
We are also well positioned to profitably grow in our competitive nonhydraulic fracturing businesses in North America. For example, in 2020, our artificial lift business developed and implemented new digital capabilities, increased remote operations jobs and solidified its strong market position in North America. We also expect our well construction technology investments to best position Halliburton to outperform as drilling rigs return.
Using the Halliburton 4.0 digital framework, we continue to collaborate and engineer solutions that maximize our customers' asset value. Last quarter, we launched our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system and successfully completed a customer engagement in West Texas. SmartFleet is an industry first, where intelligent automation manages and executes live treatment decisions to optimize subsurface fracture outcomes. By using SmartFleet, the operator was able to consistently visualize and measure fracture propagation and control fracture placement through automation. Importantly, the system provided a level of subsurface control that was previously not possible and enabled the customer to actively drive their completion outcomes in real time.
We are building on this success with multiple customer commitments across different basins. I believe this is the biggest step forward in fracturing technology in a long time.
Let me give you a few more examples of how we are accelerating Halliburton 4.0 digital adoption. In the North Sea, we successfully delivered the first fully automated cement job where the offshore cementing unit executed the work without human intervention. This is an important milestone in reaching the vision of fully autonomous offshore well construction that has significant implications for efficiency, safety and operating costs.
In 2020, we more than tripled the number of DecisionSpace 365 users on the iEnergy Cloud platform. Our customers also increased adoption of the DecisionSpace 365 asset simulator. Operators in Europe, Latin America and Asia ran over 3,000 reservoir simulation scenarios on the iEnergy Cloud with speeds of up to 7x faster than with conventional on-premise simulators. 
Finally, we are teaming up with Accenture to drive the digital transformation of our supply chain. This will result in process efficiencies across large volumes of transactional activities, lower our overall cost and free up resources to drive strategic decision-making in support of our operational requirements.
Next, I want to discuss capital efficiency, a key enabler of our other strategic priorities. Leveraging new materials and design approaches as well as digital innovation, we've been able to significantly reduce CapEx requirements and extend the life of our equipment. We are continuing our iCruise drilling system deployment and are reaping the benefits of a reduced CapEx profile and higher asset velocity. Technology advancements in multiple product service lines in both divisions are allowing us to improve design and service configuration to save time and money, both for our customers and Halliburton.
Finally, I would like to highlight several important actions we took in alignment with our strategic priority to participate in advancing a sustainable energy future. We are working to reduce the carbon footprint and environmental impact of our own operations and have committed to setting targets to the Science Based Targets initiative to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. With this commitment, Halliburton joins over 1,000 global companies taking science-based climate action. This is important in our journey to align with the latest climate science and contribute to sustainable energy advancement.
We are also collaborating with our customers to produce oil and gas more efficiently while reducing their emissions. We are currently performing the first electric grid-powered fracturing operation for Cimarex Energy in the Permian Basin. With over 300 stages on multiple wells already completed, Halliburton's electric-powered equipment has allowed the customer to achieve pump rates that were 30% to 40% higher than conventional pumps by utilizing the maximum grid power potential. 
Grid-powered electric spreads require substantially less capital, a smaller footprint and are more efficient compared to turbine power. When demand for emission reduction solutions translates to better pricing, I expect we will replace, within our planned capital budget, some of our conventional fracturing capacity with electric over the course of a normal equipment replacement cycle.
Halliburton is starting the new year with a clear sense of purpose. We believe that our strategic priorities are the right ones, and our margins in the fourth quarter demonstrated that. We are confident that the actions we have taken are sustainable, and we are well positioned both internationally and in North America for the unfolding market recovery.

Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, an increase of 9%. And adjusted operating income was $350 million, an increase of 27%. During the fourth quarter, we recognized approximately $450 million of pretax impairments and other charges, primarily related to the fair value adjustment of our real estate assets in North America. 
As part of our 2020 structural cost reduction initiative, we reduced the amount of real estate required to run our business. In the second quarter, we decreased our real estate use in North America by roughly 50% by closing, selling, consolidating and reducing the size of many facilities. Subsequently, we conducted a detailed analysis on how we own, lease and operate our remaining real estate footprint. As a result, we concluded that a structured transaction is likely to be advantageous in managing the majority of our North American real estate, which led to the fair value adjustment I just discussed. This initiative is consistent with our strategic priority to achieve capital efficiency in our business, while allowing us to retain flexibility and drive future operating benefits.
Let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in more detail. In our Completion and Production division, revenue increased $236 million or 15%, while operating income increased $70 million, an increase of 33%. These increases were driven by higher activity in multiple product service lines in North America; increased stimulation activity in Argentina and Kuwait; higher completion tool sales in Africa, Southeast Asia and Norway; and increased well intervention services internationally. These increases were partially offset by lower pressure pumping activity in Saudi Arabia and lower completion tool sales in Eurasia and Australia.
Our Drilling and Evaluation revenue increased $26 million or 2%, while operating income grew by $12 million or an 11% increase. These increases were primarily due to higher drilling-related services in North America and Brazil, increased wireline activity in North America and Latin America as well as higher fluid sales in Asia Pacific and Guyana, and increased software sales across all regions. Partially offsetting these increases were lower drilling-related services and project management activity in Europe/Africa/CIS, the Middle East and Mexico as well as reduced wireline activity in Asia Pacific and Saudi Arabia.
Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue increased $254 million, a 26% increase. These results were driven by higher activity in stimulation and artificial lift in U.S. land as well as higher well construction and wireline services activity and year-end completion tools and software sales.
Latin America revenue grew $46 million or 12%, resulting primarily from increased pressure pumping and wireline activity in Argentina and activity increases in multiple product service lines in Colombia and Ecuador as well as higher fluid sales in Guyana and drilling services in Brazil. These increases were partially offset by reduced activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico.
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. Revenue was modestly down by $7 million or a decrease of 1%, resulting primarily from reduced drilling-related services and completion tool sales in Eurasia, coupled with lower drilling-related activity in Norway. These results were partially offset by higher completion tool sales in Africa, Norway and Continental Europe as well as increased stimulation and well intervention services in Algeria and Continental Europe.
Middle East/Asia revenue declined $31 million or 3%, largely attributed to lower activity in multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, reduced drilling activity in United Arab Emirates and decreased project management activity in India. These decreases were partially offset by higher drilling-related services in China, Australia and Malaysia, increased stimulation activity in Kuwait and higher software sales across the region.
In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $49 million, and we expect it to be approximately the same in the first quarter of 2021. Net interest expense for the quarter was $125 million and should remain essentially flat in the first quarter.
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 19%. Based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix, we expect our 2021 first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 25%.
We generated approximately $638 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter and delivered over $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the full year. As a result, we ended the year with approximately $2.6 billion in cash. We will continue to prioritize reducing leverage in the near term and intend to pay down $685 million of debt coming due this year with cash on hand.
Capital expenditures during the quarter were $218 million, with our 2020 full year CapEx totaling approximately $730 million. In 2021, we intend to keep our capital expenditures relatively flat at $750 million. We believe that with this level of spend, we will be well equipped to take advantage of the unfolding recovery.
Finally, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter playing out. As is typical, our results for the first quarter of 2021 will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of year-end product sales, which primarily impact our international and Gulf of Mexico businesses. 
While we anticipate a slower-than-normal start to the year in some international regions, we also expect activity momentum in North America to continue, with completions activity outpacing drilling activity. As such, in our Completion and Production division, we expect revenue to increase 3% to 5% sequentially and operating margins to decline 150 to 200 basis points, largely due to a different business mix. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate a low single-digit revenue increase sequentially, with operating margins expected to increase by 50 to 75 basis points.

The question in my mind, and you gave some color around this, Jeff, but I wanted to dig in a little further, is the outlook for kind of full year '21. With North America, I know you mentioned you feel like the momentum is still good. But I guess, first, is there some peak that we're going to see here, some stabilization of activity as the companies remain capital disciplined as you get back to kind of this maintenance level?

And that's predicated on, customers I think will be certainly rational and capital-disciplined. But I think there's also pressure to hold production flat in 2021, which creates a bit of a floor as we look at the full year. 
From an international perspective, I feel confident around the international recovery. And I think in terms of magnitude, the second half of 2021, we believe -- or I believe, will be up low double digits. So that's fairly solid. And that's based on the tender pipeline that we're seeing and the types of barrels that are produced. Shorter cycle, I think, will lend themselves to that type of uptick. 
And maybe one last word on international outlook. I mean I think the -- we view 2021 as a bit of a transition year. I mean 2020 was the worst in our history. And we view 2022 is when we see the global rebalancing of supply and demand, which creates the sort of underpinning of a multiyear up cycle.

So we've got completion tool sales that are falling off and are being replaced. That revenue is being replaced by an improving North America market activity, but not at the same level of profitability. 
But look, we're encouraged about some of the backlog that we see building in our completion tool business. And I think that also gives us the confidence that Jeff just outlined in terms of the back half of the year, particularly in the international markets. 
As you think about C&P margin progression in 2021, I mean, I'd remind you and others on the call that we're starting from a much higher point in 2021 than we did even in 2020 before the impact of the pandemic. And that's on a much lower activity level. 
On a full year basis, I would say, Angie, that our expectations is that we still drive mid-teens margins for our C&P division. And look, if we are able to get some pricing momentum, it could go higher than that. But we're happy with what we've done, particularly creating the operating leverage in the business. Jeff has mentioned several times that it's sustainable. And I think it fundamentally drives higher incrementals, at least that's what the management team here is focused on for this next up cycle. 
On D&E margins, again, I think we are starting 2021 higher sequentially, which is typically not the case for our business as we go through some of the seasonality issues that we've mentioned and year-end software sales falling off. So I'm encouraged to see the momentum in margin progression across the end of the year and into the beginning of 2021. And that's coming off, again, a largest rig drop in history for our business and our industry. 
Our expectations is to get to double-digit margins by the end of the year, end of the year 2021. And I think that we're ready to do that through capitalizing on, obviously, a recovering market that Jeff talked about in the back half of the year, but also on the technology and digital investments that we've made into the business throughout the course of 2020 and reaping the benefits in 2021. But I think the overall point, particularly for our D&E business, as you think about the international markets, is a real focus on profitable growth."

Look, I think that was -- it's an elegant and differentiated solution, but clearly, a premium solution. We've been working on the electric technology for a number of years and have always described some of the challenges around electric also being the cost and the upfront capital associated with it. The grid solution actually eliminates the requirement for turbines, which have come with a range of either operating problems or emissions. 
And so -- and it's important to give a shout out to the Cimarex management team here because a lot of innovation and collaboration together in order to bring together a very efficient solution and also one with the absolute lowest emissions. I mean because now it's tapped into the grid and consuming sort of a variety of different energy sources. So the customer commitment was very important. 
I think customer interest will be high, but it's also -- over time, but it's also going to require pricing and different types of contract terms. And I view this, though, as part of our normal reinvestment cycle. Clearly, there's interest.

And I'm pretty optimistic about how all of that plays out. 
In North America, again, I think Q1 last year creates a lot of noise in that comparison. But the important thing is I do believe customers will be capital disciplined. But we've got a lot of growth to go just to get back to where we were even prepandemic when -- the first quarter of '20. And so I think that -- and we saw production come off pretty hard in 2020. So just to keep things flat in 2021, from a production perspective, requires a reasonable amount of activity and actually more activity than we even see today based on kind of our calculation and outlook. 
Which gives me good confidence that while we've got good momentum in the first quarter, and we've got pretty good visibility for the year. So I think that our outlook, that momentum, it builds in the first quarter. But it doesn't fall off at the pace that it has in the past, certainly.

We are off to a good start this year. The world is reopening. And even though some regions still experience lockdowns, overall economic and demand recovery continues to build. Oil demand is increasing globally.",2389,"Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. We are off to a good start this year. The world is reopening. And even though some regions still experience lockdowns, overall economic and demand recovery continues to build. Oil demand is increasing globally. Oil inventories are down near their 5-year averages, and OPEC Plus actions continue to support commodity prices. The first quarter strengthened our confidence about how this transition year will play out. Our first quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our strategy and operating leverage in this global market recovery. 
Here are some highlights. International revenue grew 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, marking an activity inflection in the international markets. Strong recovery in Latin America more than offset declines in other regions, while margins remained resilient. North America revenue grew 13% as both drilling and completions activity ramped up throughout the quarter. Higher utilization and our significant operating leverage supported sequential margin expansion despite weather disruptions. 
Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 3%, with increased North America and Latin America activity offsetting seasonal declines in other regions. Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered solid revenue and margin performance. Revenue grew 11%, while margins increased 2.6 percentage points driven by stronger drilling activity in North America and software sales across multiple regions. Finally, we delivered approximately $160 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, which is a great first step to delivering strong free cash flow for the full year. 
This was another quarter of solid execution on our 5 strategic priorities that define Halliburton's path and will drive our success. We're committed to drive profitable growth internationally, maximize value in North America, accelerate and integrate digital technologies, improve capital efficiency and actively participate in advancing cleaner, affordable energy. 
Our first quarter performance demonstrated that aligning our actions with these strategic priorities boosts our returns and free cash flow generation. We expect to continue delivering strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns as we move through the year. 
We are encouraged by the inflection in international activity we saw during the first quarter and anticipate that recovery will gain momentum across all regions in the second quarter and beyond. Today, we see early indicators of future activity growth internationally. Our completion tool orders, a leading indicator of upcoming work, grew throughout the first quarter. The volume of tendered work has significantly increased. We're on pace to nearly double the value of submitted bids compared to last year, with the most work coming from the NOCs in the Middle East, followed by Latin America. These signs give us greater conviction that the second half of this year will see a low double-digit increase in international activity year-on-year. 
We believe the international markets will experience multiple years of growth. However, this up cycle is expected to be structurally different from prior cycles, and Halliburton's international business is better prepared to benefit from it. Here's why. 
We expect the NOCs and other short-cycle barrel producers will increase investments and gain share to meet future oil demand growth. Halliburton has the established footprint and the customer relationships to capitalize on this growth. As deals become smaller and more complex, operators work harder to produce more barrels. Their pursuit of incremental production to meet future oil demand growth should require higher service intensity. 
In certain markets, maturing assets are changing hands. New owners require proven technology and experience to revitalize their assets and unlock remaining reserves. Halliburton's broad technology portfolio, local expertise and commercial flexibility are helping these customers achieve their efficiencies and production objectives. Multiple years of service company CapEx reductions limit equipment availability in the international markets. In early 2020, pre-COVID, international pricing was beginning to increase on the back of equipment tightness but paused with the oil demand collapse. As the world reopens and activity rebounds, we expect large tenders to remain competitive, but leading-edge pricing should increase. 
Our strategic priority is clear: deliver profitable growth as the expected international recovery unfolds. We believe the following factors will help us accomplish this. First, we expect our ongoing investment in technology innovations to benefit us as the market recovers. For example, as the global leader in completions technology, we introduced the Ovidius Expanding Isolation packer. Ovidius uses material science innovation to transform a metal alloy into a rock-like material when it reacts with downhole fluids. It creates a long-lasting seal for improved well integrity and is especially suited for high-pressure and high-temperature environments as well as permanent plug-and-abandonment operations. Our completion tools R&D pipeline incorporates the latest advancements in material science, sensors, telemetry and digitalization. Ovidius is one good example of this pipeline. 
The successful rollout of our iCruise intelligent drilling system continues to deliver excellent results. In the first quarter, iCruise improved drilling speeds 55% for a customer in the Middle East, saved an operator 3 days of rig time in the North Sea and increased drilling rates 25% compared to offset wells in offshore China. 
Second, our production business continues to expand internationally with unique growth opportunities. We plan to start executing on our first multiyear electric submersible pump contract in the Middle East in the second half of this year. We see significant volume and future growth potential for artificial lift solutions in the Middle East as many mature fields across the region come off natural flow and require ESPs to sustain production. With proven Summit ESP technology, a strong local presence and the focus on profitable growth, we expect to thrive in this market. 
As we progress towards completing our specialty chemicals plant in Saudi Arabia, we're actively participating in regional tendering activity. In addition to providing new business opportunities, this plant will also manufacture chemicals for our internal consumption. We expect the new plant to deliver cost savings and profitable growth for Halliburton in 2022 and beyond. 
Finally, we are accelerating the deployment and integration of digital technologies with our customers. We believe digital creates technological differentiation, contributes to higher international margins and drives internal efficiencies. In the first quarter, we introduced a new real-time data transmission system for a major customer in the North Sea. This high-fidelity, low-latency data highway is an essential building block for virtual remote operations that are performed without human intervention and use real-time data and tailored algorithms. 
We also launched a new digital workflow on a private cloud for an integrated services contract in the Middle East. This workflow helps our employees make better decisions. It uses a proprietary natural language processing service to extract specific information from a variety of documents and locate associated data in our data lake. This is digital technology in action, facilitating collaboration and knowledge management while improving operational efficiencies. These digital technologies are important milestones in our journey from digital planning to virtual execution. We're using our open architecture platform to integrate real-time information from the customer, Halliburton's many digitally-enabled technologies and third-party providers across the entire asset. I believe that Halliburton's current strengths and new capabilities will deliver profitable growth in a multiyear international recovery. 
Today, North America is staging a healthy recovery. In the current oil price environment, shale operators have a larger portfolio of economically viable projects. As a result, the average U.S. land rig count grew 27% sequentially in the first quarter, outpacing the growth in completed stages. We still expect the majority of our customers to remain committed to a disciplined capital program this year. But what we are seeing today solidifies our confidence in a steady activity cadence for the rest of the year as operators work to maintain their productive capacity. 
The market dynamics continue to improve. Supportive commodity prices should allow our customers to spend their announced budgets and meet their cash flow objectives. Customer mix should transition as the year unfolds. Privates led the recovery in the first half, and we expect some public companies to increase activity in the second half of the year. Halliburton serves both of these customer groups, aligning with operators that have longer-term and more efficient programs. As a result, demand for our equipment is increasing, and our calendar is filling up for the rest of the year. 
Last year, we used digital technology to redesign our service delivery approach and create significant differentiation in our cost structure. Adding to our cost reset in 2020, we continue to drive cost out of our North America operations. As an example, we've engaged with Vorto, a software company that designed an artificial intelligence supply chain platform to transform how we buy, move and sell sand and trucking within our U.S. land operations. Without human intervention, Vorto's platform optimizes thousands of logistics flows per day while also identifying and addressing issues before they occur. This fits with our strategic priorities to use digital technology to drive down costs in our business and to maximize value in North America. 
Together with our size and scale, our sustainable operating leverage should widen our margin differential relative to our competitors in North America. We are steadily improving margins, and our first quarter performance was another step in the right direction. 
As we look ahead, we see upside to our margin performance based on utilization, technology, innovation and pricing. Utilization is the first step to better margins. With a smaller equipment base and the right customer alignment, we intend to continue optimizing utilization as market demand grows. Given our scale, the operating leverage impact from utilization increases alone should improve our cash flow generation in North America. 
Technological differentiation and digital innovation is the next step. Halliburton has the leading low-emission solutions in the market today, both electric and dual fuel, and we expect they will command a premium as market demand expands. As the leader in hydraulic fracturing, Halliburton has the scale and R&D depth to deliver a proven power-agnostic, capital-efficient solution for e-frac. Deployed in the Permian Basin, our fully integrated all-electric frac site includes our 5,000-horsepower Zeus electric pumping unit, our new Express Blend blending system, Ewen's electric wireline unit and the Electric Tech Command Center. Built using our flagship Q10 pumps, Zeus delivers performance levels up to 40% higher than conventional pumps and substantially reduces emissions limited only by the grid power source. 
As certain components of our input costs rise, we are working with our suppliers and our customers to adjust our gross pricing in line with cost inflation we are seeing in the market. While improving U.S. economic activity and winter weather disruptions led to increases in sand, chemicals, cement additives and raw materials costs, Halliburton's purchasing power and technology have allowed us to procure and deliver these materials in a cost-efficient manner such that both Halliburton and our customers are more competitive. 
Service pricing improvement is the final step. We're not there yet, but we see positive signs of market rebalancing that should drive future pricing improvements. Total fracturing equipment capacity has limited room to grow in the current pricing environment. Continued attrition from a rising service intensity and insufficient returns for many service companies is altering the industry dynamics. Because we are an integrated provider, Halliburton participates in all key businesses in North America today and will benefit more than others when pricing moves up. We believe that Halliburton's leadership and strength in North America will allow us to take advantage of positive market dynamics and deliver on our strategic priority to maximize value in this market. 
Consistent with our strategy, we continue to turn every knob to manage greater capital efficiency and drive solid free cash flow generation. This takes many forms and includes important technology advancements in multiple product service lines, whether digital or equipment-related; process changes that improve the speed with which we move equipment and respond to market opportunities; and finally, actions to reduce the pace of working capital consumption required to grow our business. The first quarter was a good demonstration of this, and we will continue to build on these actions. 
We're also executing on our strategic priority to advance cleaner, affordable energy and to support sustainable energy advancements using innovation and technology to reduce the environmental impact of producing oil and gas. Halliburton has a 3-pronged approach to achieving this objective. First, we recently released our target to achieve 40% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2035 from the 2018 baseline. This is consistent with our goal to reduce the carbon footprint and environmental impact of our operations and follows our commitment to set science-based targets announced last year. 
Second, we are innovating. We continue to develop and deploy low-carbon solutions to help oil and gas operators lower their current emissions profiles. We also use our existing technologies in renewable energy applications. For example, today, the geothermal market in Europe is growing rapidly and represents an attractive expansion opportunity for our artificial lift business. We're currently supplying electric submersible pumps, specifically designed for the high-temperature large wellbore applications on the geothermal project in Germany. 
We're also providing drilling and cementing services for geothermal wells in Indonesia. We developed new high-temperature cementing formulations and directional drilling techniques that increase geothermal sites generating capacity and improved project economics. 
And finally, we're excited about the progress of Halliburton Labs, our clean energy accelerator. In the first quarter, we announced Halliburton Labs' inaugural group of participating companies. They are working on solutions for transforming organic and plastic waste to renewable power, recycling of lithium-ion batteries and converting carbon dioxide, water and renewable electricity into a hydrogen-rich platform chemical. We are collaborating with these companies and providing world-class industrial capabilities and expertise to help them achieve further scale and increase their evaluations. This engagement in the clean energy space will inform Halliburton's future strategic decisions as the energy transition evolves. We are taking applications for the next cohort of participants as we continue bringing early-stage clean energy companies into Halliburton Labs. 
To sum up, we entered 2021 optimistic and focused on innovation. We believe that the early positive momentum in North America will continue and the international market recovery will accelerate in the second half of the year. Halliburton will continue to execute on our key strategic priorities to deliver industry-leading returns and solid free cash flow as the anticipated multiyear recovery unfolds.

Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.5 billion, an increase of 7%. And our operating income was $370 million, an increase of 6% compared to the adjusted operating income of $350 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Now let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in a little bit more detail. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $1.9 billion or an increase of 3%, while operating income was $252 million, representing a decrease of 11%. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher stimulation and artificial lift activity in North America, higher cementing activity in the North Sea as well as improved stimulation activity in Argentina and Mexico and higher completion tool sales in Latin America. These increases were partially offset by lower cementing services in Russia, lower pressure-pumping activity in the Middle East, reduced seasonal completion tool sales and lower well intervention services in the Eastern Hemisphere. Operating income was negatively impacted primarily by decreased completion tool sales and reduced pressure-pumping activity in the Eastern Hemisphere. 
Our Drilling and Evaluation revenue was $1.6 billion or an increase of 11%, while operating income was $171 million, an increase of 46%. These increases were primarily due to higher software sales globally, improved drilling-related services and wireline activity in the Western Hemisphere in Norway and increased project management activity internationally. Partially offsetting these increases were lower drilling-related services across Asia. 
Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue was $1.4 billion, representing an increase of 13%. These results were primarily driven by higher drilling-related services, stimulation and artificial lift activity in North America land as well as higher wireline activity and software sales in North America land and the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced completion tool sales and lower cementing and fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Moving to Latin America. Revenue was $535 million, representing an increase of 26%, resulting primarily from increased activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina and Mexico as well as higher fluid services in the Caribbean. Partially offsetting these improvements was reduced activity across multiple product service lines in Colombia. 
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. Revenue was $634 million, a 1% decrease sequentially, resulting mainly from reduced completion tool sales and well intervention services across the region, coupled with lower activity in Russia and lower fluid services in Kazakhstan. These decreases were partially offset by higher well construction activity in the North Sea and increased software sales across the region. 
In Middle East/Asia, revenue was $878 million or a 6% decrease. These results were primarily driven by lower stimulation and well intervention services in the Middle East, reduced drilling-related activity in Indonesia and China and lower completion tool sales across the region. Partially offsetting these declines were improved project management activity in Iraq and Saudi Arabia and higher wireline activity across Asia. 
In the first quarter, our corporate expense totaled $53 million. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate corporate expense to be slightly higher. Net interest expense for the quarter was $125 million, and we expect this level of interest expense to drift slightly lower in the second quarter as a result of our reduced debt balance. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 23%. As we go forward into 2021, based on the anticipated market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Turning to cash flow. We generated $203 million of cash from operations during the first quarter and $157 million of free cash flow. We also repaid $188 million in maturing debt with cash on hand in the first quarter, and we'll continue to prioritize reducing leverage in the near term. 
Capital expenditures during the quarter came in at $104 million. We expect capital equipment deliveries for international projects to ramp up in the second half of the year, and as a result, our full year 2021 CapEx guidance remains unchanged. 
Finally, turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see the second quarter unfolding. In North America, we expect both completions and drilling activity momentum to continue, but sequential activity growth should moderate. In the international markets, we expect a seasonal rebound in a broad-based activity increase, the pace of which will vary across different regions. As a result, for our Completion and Production division, we anticipate low double-digit revenue growth sequentially, with margins expected to expand by 125 to 150 basis points as a result of our strong operating leverage across all markets. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate a mid-single-digit revenue increase with margins declining 100 to 125 basis points sequentially. The moderate growth and anticipated reduction in margins are primarily attributed to the seasonal decline in our software sales globally.

And assuming no net pricing in the U.S., with the international side starting to accelerate, U.S. continuing to expand on a more efficient and streamlined platform, how should we think about second half incrementals kind of from a high level, if you could put some color around that?

As I look at the back half or the international expansion on D&E, we're positioned today for that. And so I -- the kind of investment we're making, we view it as a march. We want to continue to improve the baseline margins in that business. So it's continuing to improve. 
And so I think we'll see improvement in 2021. I think that continues beyond that. And so our outlook is for continuing to grow those margins. I don't see the kind of headwinds that we might have seen a year ago, when we were ramping for one of the largest contracts the North Sea. I mean I don't see that repeat. And some of what we're getting also is the benefit of the capital efficiency that's baked into a lot of our D&E ability to move things around.

And so yes -- so we're seeing the demand. I think that the bifurcation will happen gradually simply because the ability to do 2 things. One, put equipment into the market. And so the way we look at that is that's replacement equipment generally. So we've got 10% to 12% of our equipment that goes off every year. And so what we're able to do is replace that with what we view to be higher-margin, better returning equipment over time. But that's more the pacing that we see. 
And then the other sort of key components around pricing, I mean, when we look at get into all of this. But when we think about returns for new equipment -- any kind of new equipment but particularly technology, we expect some premium around the technology and also derisking the time horizon impact of making those returns also.

In fact, the most important component of looking at those types of things is understanding and managing the risk.

They also have the least impact on the overall headline production number also. So I think that I really am encouraged by the activity that we've seen, the ability to continue that. I think they're all making their own economic decisions, and they make that really without a lot of stakeholder beyond the owner's direction. 
And so I think what we're seeing is a natural reaction to that, but I don't think it's indicative of how the whole market behaves. And so they have the ability to get real busy and then slow down and back it down as they see production start to ramp up a little bit for them, and it changes their economics. So a hard march up into the right, not necessarily. I think they'll all make their own decisions and could easily, I'm not going to say back off, but what they will do is make those decisions, has other operators start to ramp up. And that's obviously a much more disciplined group who have plans in place. 
I think the key point to make here, though, we're at the end of the first quarter. We're into Q2, and we haven't talked about any of the kind of budget blowouts that we talked about in prior years where like, oh, wow, we've overspent. So there's something coming that's going to slow things down. That's not at all what we see. In fact, what I'm describing in terms of confidence in the cadence is the confidence in the cadence that we are going to stay busy in marching through the second half of the year, likely up some. In fact, I think our outlook today is up North America -- yes, up North America, maybe close to 10% on the full year. So that's some moderation, but that's still growing."

And then finally, what it does internally to drive our own cost down. And so helping, yes.

So those kind of things that are operational, we can see them -- we see them getting traction -- more broad traction.

177698,706353571,2254657,"Halliburton Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2021",2021-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. We are off to a good start this year. The world is reopening. And even though some regions still experience lockdowns, overall economic and demand recovery continues to build. Oil demand is increasing globally.",2389,"Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. We are off to a good start this year. The world is reopening. And even though some regions still experience lockdowns, overall economic and demand recovery continues to build. Oil demand is increasing globally. Oil inventories are down near their 5-year averages, and OPEC Plus actions continue to support commodity prices. The first quarter strengthened our confidence about how this transition year will play out. Our first quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our strategy and operating leverage in this global market recovery.  
Here are some highlights. International revenue grew 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, marking an activity inflection in the international markets. Strong recovery in Latin America more than offset declines in other regions, while margins remained resilient. North America revenue grew 13% as both drilling and completions activity ramped up throughout the quarter. Higher utilization and our significant operating leverage supported sequential margin expansion despite weather disruptions.  
Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 3%, with increased North America and Latin America activity offsetting seasonal declines in other regions. Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered solid revenue and margin performance. Revenue grew 11%, while margins increased 2.6 percentage points driven by stronger drilling activity in North America and software sales across multiple regions.  
Finally, we delivered approximately $160 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, which is a great first step to delivering strong free cash flow for the full year.  
This was another quarter of solid execution on our 5 strategic priorities that define Halliburton's path and will drive our success. We're committed to drive profitable growth internationally, maximize value in North America, accelerate and integrate digital technologies, improve capital efficiency and actively participate in advancing cleaner, affordable energy.  
Our first quarter performance demonstrated that aligning our actions with these strategic priorities boosts our returns and free cash flow generation. We expect to continue delivering strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns as we move through the year.  
We are encouraged by the inflection in international activity we saw during the first quarter and anticipate that recovery will gain momentum across all regions in the second quarter and beyond. Today, we see early indicators of future activity growth internationally. Our completion tool orders, a leading indicator of upcoming work, grew throughout the first quarter. The volume of tendered work has significantly increased. We're on pace to nearly double the value of submitted bids compared to last year, with the most work coming from the NOCs in the Middle East, followed by Latin America. These signs give us greater conviction that the second half of this year will see a low double-digit increase in international activity year-on-year.  
We believe the international markets will experience multiple years of growth. However, this up cycle is expected to be structurally different from prior cycles, and Halliburton's international business is better prepared to benefit from it. Here's why.  
We expect the NOCs and other short-cycle barrel producers will increase investments and gain share to meet future oil demand growth. Halliburton has the established footprint and the customer relationships to capitalize on this growth. As deals become smaller and more complex, operators work harder to produce more barrels. Their pursuit of incremental production to meet future oil demand growth should require higher service intensity.  
In certain markets, maturing assets are changing hands. New owners require proven technology and experience to revitalize their assets and unlock remaining reserves. Halliburton's broad technology portfolio, local expertise and commercial flexibility are helping these customers achieve their efficiencies and production objectives. Multiple years of service company CapEx reductions limit equipment availability in the international markets. In early 2020, pre-COVID, international pricing was beginning to increase on the back of equipment tightness but paused with the oil demand collapse. As the world reopens and activity rebounds, we expect large tenders to remain competitive but leading-edge pricing should increase.  
Our strategic priority is clear: deliver profitable growth as the expected international recovery unfolds. We believe the following factors will help us accomplish this. First, we expect our ongoing investment in technology innovations to benefit us as the market recovers. For example, as the global leader in completions technology, we introduced the Ovidius Expanding Isolation packer. Ovidius uses material science innovation to transform a metal alloy into a rock-like material when it reacts with downhole fluids. It creates a long-lasting seal for improved well integrity and is especially suited for high-pressure and high-temperature environments as well as permanent plug-and-abandonment operations.  
Our completion tools R&D pipeline incorporates the latest advancements in material science, sensors, telemetry and digitalization. Ovidius is one good example of this pipeline.  
The successful rollout of our iCruise intelligent drilling system continues to deliver excellent results. In the first quarter, iCruise improved drilling speeds 55% for a customer in the Middle East, saved an operator 3 days of rig time in the North Sea and increased drilling rates 25% compared to offset wells in offshore China.  
Second, our production business continues to expand internationally with unique growth opportunities. We plan to start executing on our first multiyear electric submersible pump contract in the Middle East in the second half of this year. We see significant volume and future growth potential for artificial lift solutions in the Middle East as many mature fields across the region come off natural flow and require ESPs to sustain production. With proven Summit ESP technology, a strong local presence and a focus on profitable growth, we expect to thrive in this market.  
As we progress towards completing our specialty chemicals plant in Saudi Arabia, we're actively participating in regional tendering activity. In addition to providing new business opportunities, this plant will also manufacture chemicals for our internal consumption. We expect the new plant to deliver cost savings and profitable growth for Halliburton in 2022 and beyond.  
Finally, we are accelerating the deployment and integration of digital technologies with our customers. We believe digital creates technological differentiation, contributes to higher international margins and drives internal efficiencies. In the first quarter, we introduced a new real-time data transmission system for a major customer in the North Sea. This high-fidelity, low-latency data highway is an essential building block for virtual remote operations that are performed without human intervention and use real-time data and tailored algorithms.  
We also launched a new digital workflow on a private cloud for an integrated services contract in the Middle East. This workflow helps our employees make better decisions. It uses a proprietary natural language processing service to extract specific information from a variety of documents and locate associated data in our data lake. This is digital technology in action, facilitating collaboration and knowledge management while improving operational efficiencies. These digital technologies are important milestones in our journey from digital planning to virtual execution. We're using our open architecture platform to integrate real-time information from the customer, Halliburton's many digitally-enabled technologies and third-party providers across the entire asset. I believe that Halliburton's current strengths and new capabilities will deliver profitable growth in a multiyear international recovery.  
Today, North America is staging a healthy recovery. In the current oil price environment, shale operators have a larger portfolio of economically viable projects. As a result, the average U.S. land rig count grew 27% sequentially in the first quarter, outpacing the growth in completed stages. We still expect the majority of our customers to remain committed to a disciplined capital program this year. But what we are seeing today solidifies our confidence in a steady activity cadence for the rest of the year as operators work to maintain their productive capacity.  
The market dynamics continue to improve. Supportive commodity prices should allow our customers to spend their announced budgets and meet their cash flow objectives. Customer mix should transition as the year unfolds. Privates led the recovery in the first half, and we expect some public companies to increase activity in the second half of the year. Halliburton serves both of these customer groups, aligning with operators that have longer-term and more efficient programs. As a result, demand for our equipment is increasing, and our calendar is filling up for the rest of the year.  
Last year, we used digital technology to redesign our service delivery approach and create significant differentiation in our cost structure. Adding to our cost reset in 2020, we continue to drive cost out of our North America operations. As an example, we've engaged with Vorto, a software company that designed an artificial intelligence supply chain platform to transform how we buy, move and sell sand and trucking within our U.S. land operations. Without human intervention, Vorto's platform optimizes thousands of logistics flows per day while also identifying and addressing issues before they occur. This fits with our strategic priorities to use digital technology to drive down costs in our business and to maximize value in North America.  
Together with our size and scale, our sustainable operating leverage should widen our margin differential relative to our competitors in North America. We are steadily improving margins, and our first quarter performance was another step in the right direction.  
As we look ahead, we see upside to our margin performance based on utilization, technology, innovation and pricing. Utilization is the first step to better margins. With a smaller equipment base and the right customer alignment, we intend to continue optimizing utilization as market demand grows. Given our scale, the operating leverage impact from utilization increases alone should improve our cash flow generation in North America.  
Technological differentiation and digital innovation is the next step. Halliburton has the leading low-emission solutions in the market today, both electric and dual fuel, and we expect they will command a premium as market demand expands. As the leader in hydraulic fracturing, Halliburton has the scale and R&D depth to deliver a proven power-agnostic, capital-efficient solution for e-frac. Deployed in the Permian Basin, our fully integrated all-electric frac site includes our 5,000-horsepower Zeus electric pumping unit, our new Express Blend blending system, Ewen's electric wireline unit and the Electric Tech Command Center. Built using our flagship Q10 pumps, Zeus delivers performance levels up to 40% higher than conventional pumps and substantially reduces emissions limited only by the grid power source.  
As certain components of our input costs rise, we are working with our suppliers and our customers to adjust our gross pricing in line with cost inflation we are seeing in the market. While improving U.S. economic activity and winter weather disruptions led to increases in sand, chemicals, cement additives and raw materials costs, Halliburton's purchasing power and technology have allowed us to procure and deliver these materials in a cost-efficient manner such that both Halliburton and our customers are more competitive.  
Service pricing improvement is the final step. We're not there yet, but we see positive signs of market rebalancing that should drive future pricing improvements. Total fracturing equipment capacity has limited room to grow in the current pricing environment. Continued attrition from a rising service intensity and insufficient returns for many service companies is altering the industry dynamics. Because we are an integrated provider, Halliburton participates in all key businesses in North America today and will benefit more than others when pricing moves up.  
We believe that Halliburton's leadership and strength in North America will allow us to take advantage of positive market dynamics and deliver on our strategic priority to maximize value in this market.  
Consistent with our strategy, we continue to turn every knob to manage greater capital efficiency and drive solid free cash flow generation. This takes many forms and includes important technology advancements in multiple product service lines, whether digital or equipment-related; process changes that improve the speed with which we move equipment and respond to market opportunities; and finally, actions to reduce the pace of working capital consumption required to grow our business. The first quarter was a good demonstration of this, and we will continue to build on these actions.  
We're also executing on our strategic priority to advance cleaner, affordable energy and to support sustainable energy advancements using innovation and technology to reduce the environmental impact of producing oil and gas. Halliburton has a 3-pronged approach to achieving this objective. First, we recently released our target to achieve 40% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2035 from the 2018 baseline. This is consistent with our goal to reduce the carbon footprint and environmental impact of our operations and follows our commitment to set science-based targets announced last year.  
Second, we are innovating. We continue to develop and deploy low-carbon solutions to help oil and gas operators lower their current emissions profiles. We also use our existing technologies in renewable energy applications. For example, today, the geothermal market in Europe is growing rapidly and represents an attractive expansion opportunity for our artificial lift business. We're currently supplying electric submersible pumps, specifically designed for the high-temperature large wellbore applications on the geothermal project in Germany.  
We're also providing drilling and cementing services for geothermal wells in Indonesia. We developed new high-temperature cementing formulations and directional drilling techniques that increase geothermal sites generating capacity and improved project economics.  
And finally, we're excited about the progress of Halliburton Labs, our clean energy accelerator. In the first quarter, we announced Halliburton Labs' inaugural group of participating companies. They are working on solutions for transforming organic and plastic waste to renewable power, recycling of lithium-ion batteries and converting carbon dioxide, water and renewable electricity into a hydrogen-rich platform chemical. We are collaborating with these companies and providing world-class industrial capabilities and expertise to help them achieve further scale and increase their evaluations. This engagement in the clean energy space will inform Halliburton's future strategic decisions as the energy transition evolves. We are taking applications for the next cohort of participants as we continue bringing early-stage clean energy companies into Halliburton Labs.  
To sum up, we entered 2021 optimistic and focused on innovation. We believe that the early positive momentum in North America will continue and the international market recovery will accelerate in the second half of the year. Halliburton will continue to execute on our key strategic priorities to deliver industry-leading returns and solid free cash flow as the anticipated multiyear recovery unfolds.

Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.5 billion, an increase of 7%. And our operating income was $370 million, an increase of 6% compared to the adjusted operating income of $350 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Now let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in a little bit more detail. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $1.9 billion or an increase of 3%, while operating income was $252 million, representing a decrease of 11%. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher stimulation and artificial lift activity in North America, higher cementing activity in the North Sea as well as improved stimulation activity in Argentina and Mexico and higher completion tool sales in Latin America. These increases were partially offset by lower cementing services in Russia, lower pressure-pumping activity in the Middle East, reduced seasonal completion tool sales and lower well intervention services in the Eastern Hemisphere. Operating income was negatively impacted primarily by decreased completion tool sales and reduced pressure-pumping activity in the Eastern Hemisphere. 
Our Drilling and Evaluation revenue was $1.6 billion or an increase of 11%, while operating income was $171 million, an increase of 46%. These increases were primarily due to higher software sales globally, improved drilling-related services and wireline activity in the Western Hemisphere in Norway and increased project management activity internationally. Partially offsetting these increases were lower drilling-related services across Asia. 
Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue was $1.4 billion, representing an increase of 13%. These results were primarily driven by higher drilling-related services, stimulation and artificial lift activity in North America land as well as higher wireline activity and software sales in North America land and the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced completion tool sales and lower cementing and fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Moving to Latin America. Revenue was $535 million, representing an increase of 26%, resulting primarily from increased activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina and Mexico as well as higher fluid services in the Caribbean. Partially offsetting these improvements was reduced activity across multiple product service lines in Colombia. 
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. Revenue was $634 million, a 1% decrease sequentially, resulting mainly from reduced completion tool sales and well intervention services across the region, coupled with lower activity in Russia and lower fluid services in Kazakhstan. These decreases were partially offset by higher well construction activity in the North Sea and increased software sales across the region. 
In Middle East/Asia, revenue was $878 million or a 6% decrease. These results were primarily driven by lower stimulation and well intervention services in the Middle East, reduced drilling-related activity in Indonesia and China and lower completion tool sales across the region. Partially offsetting these declines were improved project management activity in Iraq and Saudi Arabia and higher wireline activity across Asia. 
In the first quarter, our corporate expense totaled $53 million. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate corporate expense to be slightly higher. Net interest expense for the quarter was $125 million, and we expect this level of interest expense to drift slightly lower in the second quarter as a result of our reduced debt balance. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 23%. As we go forward into 2021, based on the anticipated market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Turning to cash flow. We generated $203 million of cash from operations during the first quarter and $157 million of free cash flow. We also repaid $188 million in maturing debt with cash on hand in the first quarter, and we'll continue to prioritize reducing leverage in the near term. 
Capital expenditures during the quarter came in at $104 million. We expect capital equipment deliveries for international projects to ramp up in the second half of the year. And as a result, our full year 2021 CapEx guidance remains unchanged. 
Finally, turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see the second quarter unfolding. In North America, we expect both completions and drilling activity momentum to continue, but sequential activity growth should moderate. In the international markets, we expect a seasonal rebound in a broad-based activity increase, the pace of which will vary across different regions. As a result, for our Completion and Production division, we anticipate low double-digit revenue growth sequentially, with margins expected to expand by 125 to 150 basis points as a result of our strong operating leverage across all markets. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate a mid-single-digit revenue increase with margins declining 100 to 125 basis points sequentially. The moderate growth and anticipated reduction in margins are primarily attributed to the seasonal decline in our software sales globally. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?"

The demand outlook continues to improve both internationally and domestically, even as some regions still experience lockdowns. This year is headed in the right direction, and Halliburton is focused on the right things to deliver on our shareholders' objectives. We expect our strong international business to continue its profitable growth as activity increases throughout the year.
In North America, our business has recovered and is demonstrating margin improvement on the back of our strong operating leverage. Digital is growing our revenue and helping us and our customers increase operational efficiency and reduce costs. Our commitment to capital efficiency is expected to support growth and solid free cash flow generation. And finally, we believe that our strategy to advance cleaner, affordable energy positions us well for the future. 
And now let's open it up for questions."

As I look at the back half or the international expansion on D&E, we're positioned today for that. And so I -- the kind of investment we're making, we view it as a march. We want to continue to improve the baseline margins in that business. So it's continuing to improve. 
And so I think we'll see improvement in 2021. I think that continues beyond that. And so our outlook is for continuing to grow those margins. I don't see the kind of headwinds that we might have seen a year ago when we were ramping for one of the largest contracts in the North Sea. I mean I don't see that repeat.

We are seeing more demand for those types of solutions, and we have a leading position around whether it's Tier 4 dual fuel or also the electric. 
And so yes -- so we're seeing the demand. I think that the bifurcation will happen gradually simply because the ability to do 2 things: one, put equipment into the market. And so the way we look at that is that's replacement equipment generally. So we've got 10% to 12% of our equipment that goes off every year. And so what we're able to do is replace that with what we view to be higher-margin, better returning equipment over time. But that's more the pacing that we see. 
And then the other sort of key components around pricing, I mean, when we look at -- get into all of this. But when we think about returns for new equipment -- any kind of new equipment but particularly technology, we expect some premium around the technology and also derisking the time horizon impact of making those returns also.

In fact, the most important component of looking at those types of things is understanding and managing the risk.

I think they're all making their own economic decisions, and they make that really without a lot of stakeholder beyond the owner's direction. 
And so I think what we're seeing is a natural reaction to that, but I don't think it's indicative of how the whole market behaves. And so they have the ability to get real busy and then slow down and back it down as they see production start to ramp up a little bit for them, and it changes their economics. So a hard march up into the right, not necessarily. I think they'll all make their own decisions and could easily, I'm not going to say back off, but what they will do is make those decisions, has other operators start to ramp up. And that's obviously a much more disciplined group who have plans in place. 
I think the key point to make here, though, we're at the end of the first quarter. We're into Q2, and we haven't talked about any of the kind of budget blowouts that we talked about in prior years where like, oh, wow, we've overspent. So there's something coming that's going to slow things down. That's not at all what we see. In fact, what I'm describing in terms of confidence in the cadence is the confidence in the cadence that we are going to stay busy in marching through the second half of the year, likely up some. In fact, I think our outlook today is up North America -- yes, up North America, maybe close to 10% on the full year. So that's some moderation, but that's still growing."

And then I don't know if you'd be willing to kind of step out over your skis a little bit and say what it might would mean for activity as we kind of get into 2022 if you start signing a lot of these contracts. So -- and I know you talked about some continued growth and some strong growth on the international side over the medium term, but I don't know if you'd like to quantify that at this point just given the bid activity you're seeing."

Look, I think the type of activity we're seeing is probably more weighted towards Middle East, Latin America, broadly in terms of tender activity.

But what our view is that's certainly indicative of a growing market and the kind of market that will grow over time. We're going to engage in that and participate in it but I -- and be successful. 
But our view is, a, focus on profitable growth and drive international revenue growth that way. But I think we're also going to see that sort of lead to the broader-based kind of recovery, which is equally important to price. And so I bring that up just to say that these big tenders are always very competitive from a price standpoint. But where we start to see price improvement typically is as the market sort of starts to fill up and we see more opportunities. And that is how we see the international market shaping up. So I think that's an equally important concept of what we're seeing in terms of growth."

Our performance in the second quarter demonstrates that our clear strategy is working well and Halliburton's strategic priorities are driving value. Let's get right to the highlights. Total company revenue inc",2367,"Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. Our performance in the second quarter demonstrates that our clear strategy is working well and Halliburton's strategic priorities are driving value. Let's get right to the highlights. 
Total company revenue increased 7% sequentially as both North America and International top line continued to improve. Operating income grew 17% with solid margin performance in both divisions. Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 10%, driven by the strength in U.S. land completions. C&P delivered operating margin of 16% in the second quarter, reaching 3-year highs. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 5%. Operating margin of 11% was about flat sequentially, with rig count increases across multiple regions offsetting a seasonal decline in software sales. 
North America revenue grew 12% as both drilling and completions activity marched higher throughout the quarter. Increased utilization and our significant operating leverage supported sequential margin expansion. International revenue grew 4% sequentially, with activity increasing in the key producing regions of the world despite COVID-19 disruptions in various countries. Finally, we generated strong free cash flow this quarter, bringing the year-to-date free cash flow to almost $425 million. 
I'm pleased with the solid performance we delivered in the first half of this transition year. While recent market volatility only demonstrates the fact that we remain in a transition year, today, I want to spend more time discussing what I believe will unfold over the next couple of years. First, let me reaffirm the outlook for the rest of this year. 
In the second half of 2021, we expect activity momentum to continue. Internationally, we still anticipate a double-digit increase in activity compared to the second half of 2020, even as certain countries continue to face COVID disruptions. With commodity prices remaining supportive, we believe activity in North America inches higher with drilling outpacing completions as operators build up well inventory for 2022. 
Looking beyond this year, let me describe the longer-term outlook. We believe that we are in the early innings of a multiyear up cycle. For the first time in 7 years, we anticipate simultaneous growth in International and North America markets, and this view guides our business objectives and expected outcomes. So here's how we see the macro industry environment playing out over the next couple of years. 
First, we believe commodity prices will remain structurally supportive. With both demand resurgence in many economies and increased vaccine availability, we anticipate that global demand will continue to exceed supply, particularly to the extent OPEC Plus manages supply additions over the near term. As OPEC Plus' spare capacity returns to normalized levels over the next year, we believe sufficient pent-up global oil demand will support a call on both international and U.S. production. 
Second, multiple years of underinvestment in the international markets, coupled with the anticipated oil and gas demand growth, give us confidence in a healthy international recovery. I believe the growth will be led by the national oil companies and focused on shorter cycle barrels. This activity should come with higher service intensity and higher relative capital spend around the wellbore as opposed to long cycle infrastructure investments. We expect mature fields, both onshore and offshore, to attract the most investment, while large-scale greenfield exploration will be limited to a few markets in Africa and Latin America. As a result, we anticipate double-digit annual international spending growth at least over the next couple of years. 
Third, we believe that a supportive commodity price environment, normalized levels of spare OPEC plus capacity and high decline rates in U.S. shale are constructive for North American spending. We expect drilling and completion spending in North America will also grow double digits annually over the next 2 years, although activity will not return to pre-pandemic levels. We expect private operators to opportunistically lead the activity come back, while public E&Ps balance growth and returns. 
Fourth, I believe equipment availability will tighten much faster than most people think. In multiple product lines, we believe that equipment supply will fall behind anticipated demand. Today, both drilling and completions equipment are nearing tightness in North America. And we expect to see international markets tighten over the next few quarters. Given the scarcity of external capital sources, many North American service companies do not currently generate sufficient cash to organically fund investment in new equipment, innovation and maintenance, let alone generate sufficient returns. Internationally, multiple years of service company CapEx reductions should limit equipment availability. 
We expect increasing demand and tightening equipment capacity will lead to higher prices. Pricing is beginning to return in North America now and is expected to lag internationally where contract durations are longer. I know the positive macro outlook I just described is a case for the rising tide lifting all boats. However, what matters is how Halliburton is positioned to outperform in this market. The improving macro environment marks the first time in a long time that we see an increasing level of customer urgency and they pivot back to what creates value in our industry, and this reinforces the power of Halliburton's unique value proposition. 
Throughout the downturn, Halliburton doubled down on our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. We continue to invest in technology, both digital and hardware, that maximizes value per barrel of production. We are expanding in new market segments. We are uniquely positioned in North America as the only integrated service company. Our collaborative culture and engineered solutions create sustainable competitive advantage, setting Halliburton up to move from value creation to value capture. 
Here are a few examples of how Halliburton creates and captures value through our digital technologies. We are accelerating the deployment and integration of digital both with our customers and internally. It creates technical differentiation, contributes to higher margins and drive internal efficiencies. 
Over the first 6 months of this year, we grew the total user count on our iEnergy public cloud by 70%, and cloud revenue now constitutes almost 20% of our overall software revenues. We believe that this shift from on-prem to cloud software solutions drives faster growth. It also allows us to expand our revenue base with the same customers as we add new cloud-native applications and increase the number of users within the same operator. 
Digital technology enables high-value remote and autonomous operations. We see steady growth of our remote monitoring of open hole wireline operations. For example, this past quarter, we deployed virtual remote logging capabilities on a remote location in Continental Europe, utilizing a wellsite specialist in Norway to remotely operate downhole tools. Virtual remote logging allows us to place highly specialized personnel at regional hubs rather than in the field, which leads to better resource utilization, fewer personnel at the wellsite, less HSE exposure and higher margins. 
We also deployed digital and automation in our drilling operations across the globe, both on discrete and integrated contracts. Over 75% of our iCruise drilling system runs are fully automated today, and we expect all runs to have some automation by the end of this year. Across Europe and Eurasia, we increased the number of automated jobs fivefold since the beginning of this year. Drilling automation directly translates to top-tier customer performance. For example, over the last 2 years, it allowed us to improve the rates of penetration by approximately 25% on the Middle East lump sum turnkey project and on another integrated contract in the North Sea. 
Moreover, digitalization and automation improved the resource efficiency of our own operations. In the second quarter, on an NOC project in Russia, we reduced rig site personnel by 40%. Separately, for an IOC in the Caspian, we captured cost efficiencies through using a remote operation center to monitor and control drilling jobs. 
Halliburton's differentiated drilling technologies penetrate the market and deliver results for our customers. Our multiyear investment in drilling technologies is paying off, and we believe we are on the right path to outgrow the market as international drilling activity ramps up. Our drilling technologies deliver top quartile performance on discrete contracts and form the core of our integrated project management offering. This past quarter, on a challenging gas project on Russia's Yamal Peninsula, the Halliburton project management team drilled 8 horizontal wells 36 days ahead of plan with 0 HSE incidents. In close collaboration with our customer, we maximized drilling performance and accelerated the operator's production. 
And lastly, we deployed digital solutions to optimize production. In the second quarter, we won a contract that highlights the enormous opportunity for digital adoption in the Middle East. After many years of collaboration with Halliburton on its digital transformation journey, Kuwait Oil Company expanded our automated production management contract in North Kuwait to all other assets in the country. KOC will use DecisionSpace 365, Halliburton's cloud-based subscription service for E&P applications, to automate work processes and accurately plan, forecast and optimize production throughout KOC's portfolio. 
We are also expanding in new market segments. We expect to benefit from the significant growth potential of our specialty chemicals and artificial lift businesses, both in North America and internationally. As Halliburton increases participation in these new segments, we believe we will enjoy unique growth opportunities that are margin accretive and longer cycle. 
I'm pleased to announce that in the second quarter, Halliburton was awarded a 7-year production chemicals contract with a large IOC in Oman. Products for this new contract will be manufactured at Halliburton's new Saudi chemical reaction plant scheduled to open later this year. The strategic location of this plant will allow us to manufacture and sell specialty chemicals to other new customers throughout the region. 
In North America, we recently expanded our footprint in the downstream process and water treatment chemicals business through awards of 2 separate 5-year specialty chemicals contracts for large refiners on the Gulf Coast. 
In our growing international artificial lift business, earlier this month, we completed the first installation of our ESP contract in Kuwait. We believe this contract gives us scale in the region that will allow us to profitably grow our artificial lift business in other key markets. 
Finally, Halliburton has the broadest market exposure because we remain the only integrated service provider active in both North America and international markets. I believe this unique position allows us to capitalize on the double-digit growth, equipment tightness and resulting better service pricing in both markets. 
In the international markets, we expect that Halliburton's differentiated drilling equipment capacity tightens first. Over the next few quarters, as large tenders soak up capacity, I expect to return to the pre-pandemic environment when pricing improved in certain markets. 
In North America, specific equipment categories are already tight today. There is a high demand for low emissions frac equipment and the supply is limited. Halliburton leads the market in low emission solutions today, and that gives us a structural pricing advantage to further maximize value in North America. 
Halliburton showcased our market-leading low emission solutions at a recent event in Duncan, Oklahoma. Over the course of 5 days, several hundred people from more than 40 operators came to see our electric and dual fuel equipment displays and operational demonstrations, including our 5,000 horsepower Zeus electric pumping unit our new Express blend blending system, EEC electric wireline unit, the electric Tech Command Center and an effective power generation solution. They didn't just see R&D plans and prototypes. Instead, they witnessed functional, job-ready equipment that works for our customers today and delivers unprecedented fracturing performance and reduced emissions. 
The Duncan event also showcased our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system. SmartFleet marries our digital capabilities and fracturing expertise to do what was not possible until now, give customers control over fracturing performance in real time. It sets us apart from the rest of the hydraulic fracturing market and solidifies our industry leadership in intelligent fracturing. In the second quarter, we deployed it with 2 IOC customers in 2 different U.S. basins with excellent results. Operators achieved more consistent fracturing placement on every stage, with improved cluster uniformity and management of offset frac hits. 
SmartFleet, paired with our premium low emissions equipment creates a powerful combination of Halliburton's leading technologies to deliver superior production results, reduce environmental impact and drive a strong margin differential for Halliburton. We believe that our unique value proposition, combined with customer urgency and equipment tightness in the U.S. and international markets, will improve pricing for our differentiated equipment and services. As our equipment reaches sustained levels of higher utilization in North America, we are now moving from passing on inflationary cost increases to setting net pricing higher. And we expect this trend to accelerate into 2022. 
Internationally, pricing will take longer to catch up to North America and will first manifest itself on discrete contracts in underserved markets. We expect large tenders to remain competitive, but our strategic priority is clear: deliver profitable growth as the recovery unfolds. We expect improved pricing, higher utilization and our significant operating leverage will deliver strong incrementals for Halliburton in this up cycle. In the face of both current and expected demand increases, we remain focused on improved returns and capital efficiency and expect our overall capital investment to stay in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue. 
Now let's step back for a minute and think about what this means for Halliburton. My remarks often focus on the practical view of the near term, but I also have conviction about Halliburton's performance in the early innings of this up cycle. Based on the market assumptions outlined earlier, we expect revenue to grow at a mid-teens compound annual growth rate over the next 2 years. We also expect operating margins to expand by about 400 basis points by 2023 and thus return to 2014 margin levels. We are committed to driving significant free cash flow and returns for our shareholders as this multiyear up cycle unfolds. This earnings power results from the execution of Halliburton's strategic priorities. I'm confident that our focus on technology differentiation, digital adoption and capital efficiency positions us for profitable growth internationally and maximizing value in North America. Now I will turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our second quarter financial results. Lance?"

Let me begin with a summary of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.7 billion and operating income was $434 million, an increase of 7% and 17%, re",822,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.7 billion and operating income was $434 million, an increase of 7% and 17%, respectively. Higher equipment utilization and our significant operating leverage supported these strong results as rig counts moved up globally in the second quarter. 
Now let me take a moment to discuss our division results in a little more detail. Starting with our Completion and Production division, revenue was $2 billion, an increase of 10%, while operating income was $317 million or an increase of 26%. These improvements were driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in North America land, improved cementing activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America, increased completion tool sales in the Middle East, the North Sea and Latin America as well as higher well intervention services in Saudi Arabia and Algeria. These improvements were partially offset by lower stimulation activity in Latin America. 
In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 5%, while operating income was $175 million or an increase of 2%. These results were driven by improved drilling-related services and wireline activity across all regions, along with increased testing services in the Eastern Hemisphere. Partially offsetting these improvements were reduced software sales globally. 
Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 12%, primarily driven by higher pressure pumping services, drilling-related services and wireline activity in North America land as well as higher well construction activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced software sales across the region. 
Turning to Latin America. Revenue was flat sequentially, primarily driven by increased activity in multiple product service lines in Mexico, higher fluid services in Brazil as well as additional completion tool sales in Guyana. These results were offset by lower stimulation activity in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil, decreased software sales across the region and lower project management activity in Mexico and Ecuador. 
In Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue increased 7%, resulting from increased activity across multiple product service lines in Russia, Norway, Algeria and Ghana. These increases were partially offset by lower software sales across the region and lower activity in Nigeria. 
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 5%, resulting from improved activity in multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, improved well intervention services across the region, increased drilling-related services in Oman, higher completion tool sales in Kuwait, improved well construction activity in Australia and increased pipeline services in China. These improvements were offset by lower software sales across the region, reduced project management activity in India and lower overall activity in Bangladesh. 
In the second quarter, our corporate and other expenses totaled $58 million. For the third quarter, we expect our corporate expense to remain largely unchanged. Net interest expense for the quarter was $120 million and should remain flat for the third quarter. We remain focused on reducing our leverage in the near term and recently announced the redemption of our remaining 2021 senior notes at par ahead of schedule in August using cash on hand, which should reduce interest expense beyond the third quarter. 
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in better than expected at approximately 22%, benefiting from several onetime discrete items. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $190 million and will continue to ramp up for the remainder of the year. However, we will stay within our full year target of 5% to 6% of revenue. 
Turning to cash flow, we generated $409 million of cash from operations and $265 million of free cash flow during the second quarter. We believe that our year-to-date and expected earnings performance for the remainder of the year, combined with efficient working capital management, should result in a full year free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. The growth in earnings outlook that Jeff laid out positions us well to grow our free cash flow over the next couple of years. 
Now let me turn to our near-term outlook. In the international markets, we expect a steady increase in activity as the rig counts continue to recover. In North America, we anticipate modest pricing improvement and continued activity momentum in both  completions and drilling but sequential activity growth will be slower than in prior quarters. As a result, for our Completion and Production division, we anticipate high single-digit revenue growth sequentially, with margins expected to modestly increase by 25 to 50 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue growth of 3% to 5% due to continued rig count increases globally and a margin increase similar to that of our C&P division. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?"

Before I wrap up our discussion today, I want to thank our employees for their terrific execution on our value proposition, dedication to Halliburton and excellent service delivery for our customers. Now let me summarize what we believe and expect will unfold. 
We are in the early innings of a multiyear up cycle as oil demand exceeds supply, the macro environment will be constructive for both international and U.S. markets. Halliburton's unique value proposition, integrated services portfolio and differentiated technologies position us to outperform in this market. 
We have significant growth potential in new markets with our specialty chemicals and artificial lift businesses. Our technical differentiation allows us to disproportionately benefit from equipment capacity tightening across markets. Improved pricing, higher utilization and our significant operating leverage will deliver strong incrementals for Halliburton in this up cycle. We will continue to execute on our strategic priorities and remain committed to driving strong double-digit growth margin expansion, significant free cash flow and returns for our shareholders as this multiyear up cycle unfolds.

Where does it come from? Clearly, we've got line of sight to improving activity internationally. I described that primarily within OC. And yes, I think that it's not zeal. It's steady march to produce more barrels. And then I think that the call back on the U.S. is simply going to be that, that underinvestment that we've seen for a number of years internationally, it doesn't just spring back into action. And I think that's very positive for North America. So -- and from a customer perspective, obviously, the privates are much more opportunistic around the support of oil price.

And then more importantly, how do you think about the real timing and magnitude of the benefit to margins. Is there much of a benefit during the second half through the initial deployment and scaling up in places like Kuwait? Or is it more to come in '22 and '23? And then particularly for D&E, it's been a segment where you guys have been pushing to structurally lift margins over the last couple of years. How do the digital wins in the digitization of the industry and Halliburton's participation really push where the D&E margin could go on a more normalized basis as we get deep into recovery?"

Obviously, the software sales and the cloud-native apps are in D&E. But more broadly, digital capability affects the whole business. And so that's behind our ancillary products, so tools like EarthStar and our SmartFleet. All of those are a byproduct of having digital capability in the company. In fact, the capacity to develop software at scale is pretty unique, and that is what allows that to happen. The third way, we consume software, and this has an impact also on the entire business, is the ability to consume the solutions ourselves and reduce our own costs. So I would argue a large part of our ability to, for example, last year, reduced the roof line by 50% was rooted in our ability to do things digitally that removed many steps and changed the processes and took people out. And so that's why I'm careful how we describe that. I think that clearly, it's a contribution to D&E. But I would say that the contracts we've described are all good contracts, but they ramp up. I meant by ramp up, they get started. It's a consultative process, and so I would expect later this year really more so into '22 and beyond. And I think these build one on top of another and become very sustainable over time, less of a sort of pop all at once, but sort of building into larger projects over time."

In fact, probably 4 million barrels consumed in aviation alone. And so I think there's a normalized level of spare capacity that's expected. And so then when we think, okay, North America, what happens there? Well, we're up 10% year-on-year. And I think the expectations that production is largely flat for this year. I would expect that there would be a call of 500,000 barrels, some number like that. Some level of growth that would be called on in 2022 that the price clearly supports, which would then drive more activity for us, certainly. And we have to -- in that mix is stemming the decline curve that is always working on North America production. So those are the things that underpin our outlook, Ian."

Our performance in the second quarter demonstrates that our clear strategy is working well and Halliburton's strategic priorities are driving value. Let's get right to the highlights.
Total company revenue increased 7% sequentially as both North America and international top line continued to improve. Operating income grew 17%, with solid margin performance in both divisions. Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 10% driven by the strength in U.S. land completions. C&P delivered operating margin of 16% in the second quarter, reaching 3-year highs.
Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 5%. Operating margin of 11% was about flat sequentially, with rig count increases across multiple regions offsetting a seasonal decline in software sales. North America revenue grew 12% as both drilling and completions activity marched higher throughout the quarter. Increased utilization and our significant operating leverage supported sequential margin expansion.
International revenue grew 4% sequentially, with activity increasing in the key producing regions of the world despite COVID-19 disruptions in various countries. Finally, we generated strong free cash flow this quarter, bringing the year-to-date free cash flow to almost $425 million.
I'm pleased with the solid performance we delivered in the first half of this transition year. While recent market volatility only demonstrates the fact that we remain in a transition year, today, I want to spend more time discussing what I believe will unfold over the next couple of years. First, let me reaffirm the outlook for the rest of this year.
In the second half of 2021, we expect activity momentum to continue. Internationally, we still anticipate a double-digit increase in activity compared to the second half of 2020, even as certain countries continue to face COVID disruptions. With commodity prices remaining supportive, we believe activity in North America inches higher, with drilling outpacing completions as operators build up well inventory for 2022.
Looking beyond this year, let me describe the longer-term outlook. We believe that we are in the early innings of a multiyear upcycle. For the first time in 7 years, we anticipate simultaneous growth in international and North America markets, and this view guides our business objectives and expected outcomes. So here's how we see the macro industry environment playing out over the next couple of years.
First, we believe commodity prices will remain structurally supportive. With both demand resurgence in many economies and increased vaccine availability, we anticipate that global demand will continue to exceed supply, particularly to the extent OPEC+ manages supply additions over the near term. As OPEC+'s spare capacity returns to normalized levels over the next year, we believe sufficient pent-up global oil demand will support a call on both international and U.S. production.
Second, multiple years of underinvestment in the international markets, coupled with the anticipated oil and gas demand growth, give us confidence in a healthy international recovery. I believe the growth will be led by the national oil companies and focused on shorter cycle barrels. This activity should come with higher service intensity and higher relative capital spend around the wellbore as opposed to long cycle infrastructure investments. We expect mature fields, both onshore and offshore, to attract the most investment, while large-scale greenfield exploration will be limited to a few markets in Africa and Latin America. As a result, we anticipate double-digit annual international spending growth at least over the next couple of years.
Third, we believe that a supportive commodity price environment, normalized levels of spare OPEC+ capacity and high decline rates in U.S. shale are constructive for North American spending. We expect drilling and completion spending in North America will also grow double digits annually over the next 2 years, although activity will not return to prepandemic levels. We expect private operators to opportunistically lead the activity comeback, while public E&Ps balance growth and returns.
Fourth, I believe equipment availability will tighten much faster than most people think. In multiple product lines, we believe that equipment supply will fall behind anticipated demand. Today, both drilling and completions equipment are nearing tightness in North America. And we expect to see international markets tighten over the next few quarters. Given the scarcity of external capital sources, many North American service companies do not currently generate sufficient cash to organically fund investment in new equipment, innovation and maintenance, let alone generate sufficient returns.
Internationally, multiple years of service company CapEx reductions should limit equipment availability. We expect increasing demand and tightening equipment capacity will lead to higher prices. Pricing is beginning to return in North America now and is expected to lag internationally where contract durations are longer.
I know the positive macro outlook I just described is a case for the rising tide lifting all boats. However, what matters is how Halliburton is positioned to outperform in this market. The improving macro environment marks the first time in a long time that we see an increasing level of customer urgency and they pivot back to what creates value in our industry, and this reinforces the power of Halliburton's unique value proposition.
Throughout the downturn, Halliburton doubled down on our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. We continue to invest in technology, both digital and hardware, that maximizes value per barrel of production. We are expanding in new market segments. We are uniquely positioned in North America as the only integrated service company. Our collaborative culture and engineered solutions create sustainable competitive advantage, setting Halliburton up to move from value creation to value capture.
Here are a few examples of how Halliburton creates and captures value through our digital technologies. We are accelerating the deployment and integration of digital both with our customers and internally. It creates technical differentiation, contributes to higher margins and drives internal efficiencies. Over the first 6 months of this year, we grew the total user count on our iEnergy public cloud by 70%, and cloud revenue now constitutes almost 20% of our overall software revenues. We believe that this shift from on-prem to cloud software solutions drives faster growth. It also allows us to expand our revenue base with the same customers as we add new cloud-native applications and increase the number of users within the same operator.
Digital technology enables high-value remote and autonomous operations. We see steady growth of our remote monitoring of open-hole wireline operations. For example, this past quarter, we deployed virtual remote logging capabilities on a remote location in Continental Europe, utilizing a well site specialist in Norway to remotely operate downhole tools. Virtual remote logging allows us to place highly specialized personnel at regional hubs rather than in the field, which leads to better resource utilization, fewer personnel at the well site, less HSE exposure and higher margins.
We also deployed digital and automation in our drilling operations across the globe, both on discrete and integrated contracts. Over 75% of our iCruise drilling system runs are fully automated today, and we expect all runs to have some automation by the end of this year. Across Europe and Eurasia, we increased the number of automated jobs fivefold since the beginning of this year. Drilling automation directly translates to top-tier customer performance. For example, over the last 2 years, it allowed us to improve the rates of penetration by approximately 25% on the Middle East lump sum turnkey project and on another integrated contract in the North Sea.
Moreover, digitalization and automation improved the resource efficiency of our own operations. In the second quarter, on an NOC project in Russia, we reduced rig site personnel by 40%. Separately, for an IOC in the Caspian, we captured cost efficiencies through using a remote operation center to monitor and control drilling jobs.
Halliburton's differentiated drilling technologies penetrate the market and deliver results for our customers. Our multiyear investment in drilling technologies is paying off, and we believe we are on the right path to outgrow the market as international drilling activity ramps up. Our drilling technologies deliver top quartile performance on discrete contracts and form the core of our integrated project management offering. This past quarter, on a challenging gas project on Russia's Yamal Peninsula, the Halliburton project management team drilled 8 horizontal wells 36 days ahead of plan with 0 HSE incidents. In close collaboration with our customer, we maximized drilling performance and accelerated the operator's production.
And lastly, we deployed digital solutions to optimize production. In the second quarter, we won a contract that highlights the enormous opportunity for digital adoption in the Middle East. After many years of collaboration with Halliburton on its digital transformation journey, Kuwait Oil Company expanded our automated production management contract in North Kuwait to all other assets in the country. KOC will use DecisionSpace 365, Halliburton's cloud-based subscription service for E&P applications, to automate work processes and accurately plan, forecast and optimize production throughout KOC's portfolio.
We are also expanding in new market segments. We expect to benefit from the significant growth potential of our specialty chemicals and artificial lift businesses, both in North America and internationally. As Halliburton increases participation in these new segments, we believe we will enjoy unique growth opportunities that are margin accretive and longer cycle.
I'm pleased to announce that in the second quarter, Halliburton was awarded a 7-year production chemicals contract with a large IOC in Oman. Products for this new contract will be manufactured at Halliburton's new Saudi chemical reaction plant scheduled to open later this year. The strategic location of this plant will allow us to manufacture and sell specialty chemicals to other new customers throughout the region.
In North America, we recently expanded our footprint in the downstream process and water treatment chemicals business through awards of 2 separate 5-year specialty chemicals contracts for large refiners on the Gulf Coast.
In our growing international artificial lift business, earlier this month, we completed the first installation of our ESP contract in Kuwait. We believe this contract gives us scale in the region that will allow us to profitably grow our artificial lift business in other key markets.
Finally, Halliburton has the broadest market exposure because we remain the only integrated service provider active in both North America and international markets. I believe this unique position allows us to capitalize on the double-digit growth, equipment tightness and resulting better service pricing in both markets.
In the international markets, we expect that Halliburton's differentiated drilling equipment capacity tightens first. Over the next few quarters, as large tenders soak up capacity, I expect to return to the prepandemic environment when pricing improved in certain markets.
In North America, specific equipment categories are already tight today. There is a high demand for low emissions frac equipment and the supply is limited. Halliburton leads the market in low emission solutions today, and that gives us a structural pricing advantage to further maximize value in North America.
Halliburton showcased our market-leading low emission solutions at a recent event in Duncan, Oklahoma. Over the course of 5 days, several hundred people from more than 40 operators came to see our electric and dual fuel equipment displays and operational demonstrations, including our 5,000 horsepower Zeus electric pumping unit, our new ExpressBlend blending system, E-Winch electric wireline unit, the electric tech command center and an effective power generation solution. They didn't just see R&D plans and prototypes. Instead, they witnessed functional, job-ready equipment that works for our customers today and delivers unprecedented fracturing performance and reduced emissions.
The Duncan event also showcased our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system. SmartFleet marries our digital capabilities and fracturing expertise to do what was not possible until now: give customers control over fracturing performance in real time. It sets us apart from the rest of the hydraulic fracturing market and solidifies our industry leadership in intelligent fracturing. In the second quarter, we deployed it with 2 IOC customers in 2 different U.S. basins with excellent results. Operators achieved more consistent fracturing placement on every stage, with improved cluster uniformity and management of offset frac hits.
SmartFleet, paired with our premium low emissions equipment, creates a powerful combination of Halliburton's leading technologies to deliver superior production results, reduce environmental impact and drive a strong margin differential for Halliburton. We believe that our unique value proposition, combined with customer urgency and equipment tightness in the U.S. and international markets, will improve pricing for our differentiated equipment and services. As our equipment reaches sustained levels of higher utilization in North America, we are now moving from passing on inflationary cost increases to setting net pricing higher. And we expect this trend to accelerate into 2022.
Internationally, pricing will take longer to catch up to North America and will first manifest itself on discrete contracts in underserved markets. We expect large tenders to remain competitive, but our strategic priority is clear: deliver profitable growth as the recovery unfolds. We expect improved pricing, higher utilization and our significant operating leverage will deliver strong incrementals for Halliburton in this upcycle. In the face of both current and expected demand increases, we remain focused on improved returns and capital efficiency and expect our overall capital investment to stay in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue.
Now let's step back for a minute and think about what this means for Halliburton. My remarks often focus on the practical view of the near term, but I also have conviction about Halliburton's performance in the early innings of this upcycle. Based on the market assumptions outlined earlier, we expect revenue to grow at a mid-teens compound annual growth rate over the next 2 years. We also expect operating margins to expand by about 400 basis points by 2023 and thus return to 2014 margin levels.
We are committed to driving significant free cash flow and returns for our shareholders as this multiyear upcycle unfolds. This earnings power results from the execution of Halliburton's strategic priorities. I'm confident that our focus on technology differentiation, digital adoption and capital efficiency positions us for profitable growth internationally and maximizing value in North America. Now I will turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our second quarter financial results. Lance?"

Let me begin with a summary of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.7 billion, and operating income was $434 million, an increase of 7% and 17%, r",822,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.7 billion, and operating income was $434 million, an increase of 7% and 17%, respectively. Higher equipment utilization and our significant operating leverage supported these strong results as rig counts moved up globally in the second quarter.
Now let me take a moment to discuss our division results in a little more detail. Starting with our Completion and Production division, revenue was $2 billion, an increase of 10%, while operating income was $317 million or an increase of 26%. These improvements were driven by: higher activity across multiple product service lines in North America land; improved cementing activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America; increased completion tool sales in the Middle East, the North Sea and Latin America; as well as higher well intervention services in Saudi Arabia and Algeria. These improvements were partially offset by lower stimulation activity in Latin America.
In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 5%, while operating income was $175 million or an increase of 2%. These results were driven by improved drilling-related services and wireline activity across all regions, along with increased testing services in the Eastern Hemisphere. Partially offsetting these improvements were reduced software sales globally.
Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 12%, primarily driven by higher pressure pumping services, drilling-related services and wireline activity in North America land as well as higher well construction activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced software sales across the region.
Turning to Latin America. Revenue was flat sequentially, primarily driven by increased activity in multiple product service lines in Mexico, higher fluid services in Brazil as well as additional completion tool sales in Guyana. These results were offset by lower stimulation activity in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil; decreased software sales across the region; and lower project management activity in Mexico and Ecuador.
In Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue increased 7%, resulting from increased activity across multiple product service lines in Russia, Norway, Algeria and Ghana. These increases were partially offset by lower software sales across the region and lower activity in Nigeria.
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 5%, resulting from improved activity in multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, improved well intervention services across the region, increased drilling-related services in Oman, higher completion tool sales in Kuwait, improved well construction activity in Australia and increased pipeline services in China. These improvements were offset by lower software sales across the region, reduced project management activity in India and lower overall activity in Bangladesh.
In the second quarter, our corporate and other expenses totaled $58 million. For the third quarter, we expect our corporate expense to remain largely unchanged. Net interest expense for the quarter was $120 million and should remain flat for the third quarter. We remain focused on reducing our leverage in the near term and recently announced the redemption of our remaining 2021 senior notes at par ahead of schedule in August using cash on hand, which should reduce interest expense beyond the third quarter.
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in better than expected at approximately 22%, benefiting from several onetime discrete items. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 25%.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $190 million and will continue to ramp up for the remainder of the year. However, we will stay within our full year target of 5% to 6% of revenue.
Turning to cash flow, we generated $409 million of cash from operations and $265 million of free cash flow during the second quarter. We believe that our year-to-date and expected earnings performance for the remainder of the year, combined with efficient working capital management, should result in a full year free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. The growth in earnings outlook that Jeff laid out positions us well to grow our free cash flow over the next couple of years.
Now let me turn to our near-term outlook. In the international markets, we expect a steady increase in activity as the rig counts continue to recover. In North America, we anticipate modest pricing improvement and continued activity momentum in both completions and drilling, but sequential activity growth will be slower than in prior quarters.
As a result, for our Completion and Production division, we anticipate high single-digit revenue growth sequentially, with margins expected to modestly increase by 25 to 50 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue growth of 3% to 5% due to continued rig count increases globally and a margin increase similar to that of our C&P division. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?"

Where does it come from? Clearly, we've got line of sight to improving activity internationally. I described that primarily with NOC. And yes, I think that it's not zeal. It's steady march to produce more barrels. And then I think that the callback on the U.S. is simply going to be that -- that underinvestment that we've seen for a number of years internationally, it doesn't just spring back into action. And I think that's very positive for North America. So -- and from a customer perspective, obviously, the privates are much more opportunistic around the support of oil price.

First, just so we can dimension it, do the digital revenues and margin all flow through D&E? Or when you have completion of production apps, do some of that hit C&P? And then more importantly, how do you think about the real timing and magnitude of the benefit to margins? Is there much of a benefit during the second half through the initial deployment and scaling up in places like Kuwait? Or is it more to come in '22 and '23?
And then particularly for D&E, it's been a segment where you guys have been pushing to structurally lift margins over the last couple of years. How do the digital wins and the digitization of the industry and Halliburton's participation really push where the D&E margin could go on a more normalized basis as we get deep into recovery?"

Obviously, the software sales and the cloud-native apps are in D&E. But more broadly, digital capability affects the whole business. And so that's behind our answer products, so tools like EarthStar and our SmartFleet. All of those are a byproduct of having digital capability in the company. In fact, the capacity to develop software at scale is pretty unique, and that is what allows that to happen.
The third way we consume software, and this has an impact also on the entire business, is the ability to consume the solutions ourselves and reduce our own costs. So I would argue a large part of our ability to, for example, last year, reduce the roofline by 50% was rooted in our ability to do things digitally that removed many steps and changed the processes and took people out. And so that's why I'm careful how we describe that. I think that clearly, it's a contribution to D&E. But I would say that the contracts we've described are all good contracts, but they ramp up. I meant by ramp up, they get started. It's a consultative process. And so I would expect later this year really more so into '22 and beyond. And I think these build one on top of another and become very sustainable over time, less of a sort of pop all at once, but sort of building into larger projects over time."

And so I think there's a normalized level of spare capacity that's expected.
And so then when we think, okay, North America, what happens there? Well, we're up 10% year-on-year. And I think the expectation's that production is largely flat for this year. I would expect that there would be a call of 500,000 barrels, some number like that, some level of growth that would be called on in 2022 that the price clearly supports, which would then drive more activity for us certainly.

Last quarter, we discussed a longer view of a recovering market and our confidence in a multiyear up cycle. I am pleased that the steady march of activity and Halliburton's performance in the third quarter internationally and in North America, all reinforce our enthusiasm today and for what we expect in 2022 and beyond. 
Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of both our strategy and our execution as the market recovery accelerates. Here are some highlights. Total company revenue increased 4% sequentially, with top line improvements across all regions, while adjusted operating income grew 6% with solid margin performance in both divisions. 
Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 4%, driven by increased global activity. Operating margin was essentially flat in the third quarter as we made operational choices to prepare for higher demand for our services in 2022. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 4% and with increased activity across multiple regions. Operating margin of 11% was about flat sequentially. 
North America revenue increased 3% as growth in U.S. land was partially offset by a decline in our Gulf of Mexico business due to Hurricane Ito. International revenue grew 5% sequentially, in line with the international rig count growth. Our year-to-date free cash flow generation of almost $900 million puts us solidly on track to deliver our full year free cash flow objective. Finally, we retired $500 million of our long-term debt and ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash on hand. 
As this up cycle unfolds in both the international and North America markets, Halliburton is executing on our strategy to deliver profitable growth and generate industry-leading returns. In the international markets, third quarter activity momentum continued and I believe it will accelerate into year-end and support mid-teens second half revenue growth compared to the second half of last year. 
This expected outcome is better than we anticipated a quarter ago. In the third quarter, we started long-term projects across all regions in spite of COVID-19 interruptions. While mobility restrictions and daily precautions remain in place, business activity around the world has adjusted and continues to improve. 
In the Middle East, countries relaxed border restrictions and OPEC members prepared for activity increases. We started to work on several rigs, offshore UAE, mobilized a workover project in Bahrain and completed multiple ESP installations on our artificial lift contract in Kuwait. We expect the Middle East to exit the year with solid activity momentum. 
In Asia Pacific, we launched operations on an integrated project offshore Malaysia, with full implementation of Halliburton's digital well construction capabilities. We also ramped up for an increase in our Indonesia drilling operations where the local NOC plans to boost production from its assets. 
In Europe/Africa/CIS region, the start of operations on a 23-well offshore integrated development campaign for Woodside and Senegal marked a new country entry for Halliburton. In Russia, we are mobilizing for a multiyear IOC operated project on Salon Island. In the U.K. sector of the North Sea, work continues on several new development drilling and workover projects for local independent operators. 
Finally, Latin America delivered its best quarterly performance since 2015. We spudded the first well on a 3-year integrated project in Brazil, deployed our new drilling technologies on multiple wells in Argentina and prepared to mobilize for new work in Ecuador and Colombia. In addition to contract start-ups, our pipeline of new tenders continues to grow. While large Middle East tenders and Latin America projects receive most of the headlines, Customers in Africa, Russia and Southeast Asia, among others, are also issuing tenders for new work. 
All of this points to increasing international customer urgency and demand for our services. Let me describe what I am seeing that gives me this conviction. Global supply and demand balance continues to tighten, resulting in a strong commodity price environment. In response, asset owners are eager to reverse baseline production declines caused by multiple years of underinvestment. 
We expect that NOCs and other operators with short-cycle production opportunities will commit additional capital and gain share to meet future oil demand. Additionally, new fields are smaller and more complex where customers work harder to produce more barrels. Finally, as mature assets change hands, new owners move quickly to revitalize the assets they acquire and unlock remaining reserves. They require service partners who can deliver proven technology and decades of experience. 
All of these things have one thing in common. They require higher service intensity, more dollars spent on the wellbore rather than on infrastructure. As the international recovery accelerates, we remain committed to a clear strategic priority, deliver profitable growth and we have unique competitive advantages to deliver on this priority. 
We have the established footprint, geographic presence and customer and supplier relationships to capitalize on growth. We have a strong presence in all major international markets. The substantial majority of our workforce is local and within the regions where we operate, our supply chain spend is primarily with local suppliers. We have proven capabilities to ramp up our services as customers enter new markets. We demonstrated this in Guyana, Suriname and most recently, in Senegal. 
The Halliburton team mobilized personnel and built a multifunctional operational base to support Woodside as we embark together on a development campaign offshore Senegal. We also engineer innovative solutions both digital and hardware to meet the complex reservoir challenges faced by our international customers. 
For example, in well construction, this quarter, we introduced the iStar comprehensive measurement platform. This next-generation intelligent platform provides multiple logging and drilling measurements that enabled reservoir evaluation, faster drilling and consistent well delivery. For multiple customers in the Middle East and North Sea, the iStar platform provides insight into the impact of drilling parameters on wellbore conditions and optimizes the drilling process in real time. 
In completions, we are the global leader in downhole completion solutions. As our customers increase their activity, our e-completions ecosystem integrates manufacturing, digital twins and technology development processes to increase our speed to market for these long lead complex systems. 
In many regions, as customers drive for better performance in the face of increasing operational challenges, I expect adoption of integrated and bundled contracts will continue to grow. Halliburton has strong project management capabilities and a proven track record that deliver efficiencies and reduce total customer cost of ownership. Our digital innovations reframe customer project economics through greater efficiencies and improved decision-making. 
For example, in the third quarter, we deployed our Well Construction 4.0 digital solution to deliver further operational efficiencies for our customer in the Middle East. Finally, our customers calling us for collaboration from an IOC looking to reduce emissions on its operations in Mexico to a European independent working to remotely monitor and control all of its global drilling operations. Halliburton's value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers is working for both our customers and Halliburton. 
Now turning to North America. The bifurcation between public and private company activity continued in the third quarter. Public E&Ps remain committed to their spending plans for 2021 while private operators continue to take advantage of a strong commodity price environment. As expected, completions growth moderated in the third quarter as operators shifted their focus from completions to drilling activity. Just like in the international markets, customer urgency and demand for our services keep growing in North America. 
Drilled but uncompleted well counts reached the lowest level since 2013 as operators depleted the surplus of DUCs accumulated in 2020. We expect customers to drill and complete more new wells to offset steep base decline rates and deliver production into an anticipated attractive market next year. Completions equipment availability is tightening. Customers have responded by starting the 2022 tender process earlier in an attempt to lock in access to quality services for next year's programs. 
Private companies now operate about 60% of the U.S. land rig count and current commodity prices provide a strong incentive for their activity to expand. Our market-leading position in North America is rooted in the groundbreaking technologies we put to work in this market. We are the only fully integrated service provider in North America, and this gives us a unique competitive advantage. We combine the full breadth of our technology disciplines, geosciences, physics, chemistry, material science and mechanical, electrical and software engineering to deliver innovative solutions at scale around the world and uniquely in North America to maximize production and minimize costs. 
Our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing service has transitioned from Highland to campaign mode. Several large operators today have SmartFleet working on multi-pad completion programs. SmartFleet for the first time, allows operators to measure treatment placement in real time, which, among other things, has demonstrated up to 30% improvement in cluster uniformity. 
In the third quarter, we introduced the ISO bond cement system and pumped it for multiple customers in the DJ Basin and in the Marcellus Shale. By removing liquid additives, this dry blended cement provides significant operational efficiencies and lower capital requirements for land operations, taking advantage of the increasing demand for our services require strategic execution on many fronts, particularly in the current environment of stretched supply chains, tight labor and inflationary pressures. Against that reality, I believe that Halliburton is best prepared to provide reliable execution for our customers. 
Our sophisticated supply chain organization translates Halliburton's size and scale into real savings for us and our customers. We are seeing that in action as our supply chain delivers what our customers require for their projects. The labor market is tight today. We have seen this situation before and our human resources team knows how to navigate it. 
Over the last few years, we compressed our onboarding time, strengthened our national recruiting network and use digital solutions to significantly reduce our field personnel requirements. Despite real challenges, we have the scale, speed and systems to recruit talent nationally and quickly deploy it for our customers. 
In logistics, we have ready access to a fleet of drivers to make deliveries to the job site. We expanded our collaboration with Vorto, an artificial intelligence supply chain platform. Our early adoption of Vorto's platform that connects drivers, asset owners and maintenance charge allows us to effectively manage trucking inflation and availability constraints. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on our activity and pricing outlook for 2022. First, in the international markets and then in North America. Next year, we expect international activity momentum to accelerate an international leading-edge pricing to move upward in pockets as a result of higher activity. This is what we are seeing today. 
Large tenders remain competitive but we are already seeing modest price increases on discrete work in underserved markets. We see increasing customer demand for Halliburton's high-end technology and a recognition of its value. Finally, as a result of lower spending by service companies for more than half a decade, international markets face tightening equipment supply. To meet these demands, we are strategically reallocating assets to drive improved utilization and returns. 
Let me be clear, Halliburton prioritizes profitable growth internationally and this will drive our capital allocation decisions to the best returning product lines, geographies and contracts. In North America, we expect customer spending to increase in and around 20% next year, including solid net pricing gains. Many factors drive that spending and pricing, including customer urgency, equipment tightness and the desire to align with a reliable and differentiated service provider like Halliburton. 
Last quarter, we highlighted the pricing traction that exists for low emission equipment. Today, as we tender for 2022 work, we're seeing price increases for the rest of our fracturing fleet as well. Net pricing has also increased across different nonfrac product service lines: drilling, cementing, drill bits and artificial lift. 
To generate the highest returns as this market grows, we are taking steps to maximize the value of our North America business. Specifically, we are repositioning our fracturing fleets to customers in areas where we can maximize returns in 2022, securing longer-term premium pricing contracts for our existing and planned electric fleets and accelerating fleet maintenance and deployment of the next-generation fluid end technology, which extends the life of our equipment. 
Halliburton is committed to North America and I expect we will benefit more than others as activity and pricing momentum accelerates across the board. Next, let me turn to how we are executing on our strategic priority to advance a sustainable energy future. As we are witnessing now and saw in the third quarter, the world requires a greater supply of oil and gas. As an oilfield services company, we have the core competency to help our customers deliver the supply in the most efficient and technologically advanced ways possible. 
With our customers, we are bringing our technical expertise and over a century of industry experience to actively participate in the transition to a cleaner economy. One of the most meaningful contributions we can make today to this transition is to help our customers reduce emissions from their existing production base. Emissions reduction is a critical part of our technology development process, and our innovative low-carbon solutions are helping oil and gas operators reduce their carbon footprint. 
Halliburton's electric fracturing solution delivers results now for our customers. In the third quarter, Halliburton completed an all-electric pad operation on a multiyear contract with Chesapeake Energy in the Marcellus Shale. We deployed our electric fracturing spread with electric blending, wireline and ancillary equipment and an advanced power generation system from Bolte grid. This high-performing solution reduced Chesapeake's emission using over 25 megawatts of lower carbon power generation from Chesapeake's local field gas. 
We are collaborating with an IOC in Mexico on their total carbon footprint reduction because we provide both well construction services and logistics services on this contract. We changed supply boat fueling mechanisms and optimized usage to achieve emissions reductions in the first year of operations. We are now using a similar contract structure to collaborate with this IOC on its other projects in Latin America. 
We are also advancing renewable energy solutions through Halliburton Labs, our clean energy accelerator. In the third quarter, we doubled our size by increasing the number of Halliburton Labs companies from 4 to 8, welcoming Alumina Energy from California, Inata from Ontario and Parasante and search Power materials from Texas. We help these companies scale their exciting technologies from innovative energy storage solutions to modular carbon capture systems. 
In September, Halliburton Labs hosted its third finalist pitch day featuring 9 early-stage companies and an audience of several hundred entrepreneurs, investors, academics and other professionals looking to engage with companies that advance cleaner, affordable energy. The Halliburton Labs participants are achieving results. 
[indiscernible] Bioenergy completed a $10 million Series A round of financing. [indiscernible]  patented modular system uses locally sourced organic or plastic waste to generate clean on-site energy even in the most remote and inaccessible location. Other accelerator participants achieved important scaling milestones in the third quarter. 
With both current and expected demand increases, Halliburton remains committed to the priorities we set in 2020. We prioritized profitable growth and returns, remain focused on capital efficiency and are keeping our overall capital investment in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue. I'm excited about the multiyear up cycle we see in front of us. I believe our value proposition, technology differentiation, digital adoption and capital efficiency will allow us to deliver profitable growth internationally and maximize value in North America. Halliburton will continue to execute our key strategic priorities to deliver industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow for our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our third quarter financial results. Lance?"

Let me begin with a summary of our third quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.9 billion and adjusted operating income was $458 million, an increas",918,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our third quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.9 billion and adjusted operating income was $458 million, an increase of 4% and 6%, respectively. During the third quarter, Halliburton closed the structured transaction for our North America real estate assets that I described earlier this year, which resulted in a $74 million gain. We also discontinued the proposed sale of our Pipeline and Process Services business leading to a depreciation catch-up related to these assets previously classified as assets held for sale. As a result, among these and other items, we recognized a $12 million pretax charge. 
Now let me take a moment to discuss our division results in more detail. Starting with our Completion and Production division, revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of 4% while operating income was $322 million or an increase of 2%. These results were driven by increased activity across multiple product service lines in the Western Hemisphere, higher cementing activity in the Middle East/Asia region as well as increased well intervention services in the Europe/Africa/CIS region. 
These improvements were partially offset by reduced completion tool sales in the Eastern Hemisphere, lower stimulation activity in the Middle East/Asia region and accelerated maintenance expenses for our stimulation business in North America, which related to upgrading our fluid end technology in preparation for the anticipated market acceleration that Jeff described earlier. 
In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.7 billion or an increase of 4%, while operating income was $186 million or an increase of 6%. These results were due to improved drilling-related services internationally and in North America land. Additional testing services and wireline activity across Latin America, along with increased project management activity in Mexico and Ecuador. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced drilling-related services in Norway and the Gulf of Mexico. 
Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 3%. This increase was driven primarily by higher well construction, artificial lift and wireline activity in North America land, increased completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico and additional stimulation and drilling activity in Canada. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced drilling-related, wireline and stimulation activity in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the impact from Hurricane IDA. 
Turning to Latin America. Revenue increased 17% sequentially. This improvement was driven by increased activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil as well as higher well construction services in Colombia and improved project management activity in Ecuador. These increases were partially offset by reduced fluid services in the Caribbean. 
In Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue was essentially flat sequentially. These results were driven by higher well intervention services across the region, increased well construction services and completion tool sales in Nigeria, additional pipeline and fluid services in Russia and increased activity across multiple product service lines in Senegal. These improvements were offset by decreased activity across multiple product service lines in the North Sea and Algeria and lower completion tool sales in Angola. 
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 2%, resulting from improved well construction activity in the Middle East and Australia. These improvements were partially offset by lower completion tool sales across the region, along with reduced wireline and stimulation activity in Saudi Arabia, lower project management activity in India and lower stimulation activity in Malaysia. In the third quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $50 million. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to moderately increase. Net interest expense for the quarter was $116 million. In the third quarter, we retired $500 million of 2021 senior notes using cash on hand. As a result, our net interest expense in the fourth quarter should decline modestly. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter came in at approximately 24%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $190 million. In response to higher demand for our services in both international and North America markets, we are pulling forward spending on long lead time items for our premium equipment and now expect our full year capital expenditures to be closer to $800 million for the full year. 
Turning to cash flow. We generated approximately $620 million of  cash from operations and almost $470 million of free cash flow during the third quarter. I am very pleased with our working capital performance this quarter as we delivered net cash proceeds from working capital despite our revenue growth. Now let me describe our near-term outlook. 
In North America, we expect moderate pricing and activity improvements in drilling and completions to drive sequential growth. In the international markets, we expect continued improvement in rig counts, the pace of which will vary across regions. As a result, for our Completion and Production division, we anticipate mid-single-digit revenue growth sequentially, with operating margins expected to expand by approximately 50 basis points. 
The higher year-end completion tool sales will be partially offset by seasonal North America land activity impacted by the holidays and lower efficiency levels typically experienced in the winter months. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue growth of 5% to 7% and a margin increase of 150 to 200 basis points due to seasonal software sales and higher overall global activity.

I mean everything that I see indicates that that's well in our viewfinder in terms of getting to the sort of '23 outlook that I had. The pace at which oil demand comes back, which I would say is surprising a little bit to the upside in spite of what's out there with respect to COVID, certainly encouraging. Certainly highlights what we've been seeing for some time, which is how important oil is and more importantly, sort of the impact that not spending at sort of normal rates for quite a long time, has on the supply of oil. And of course, operators are going to work really hard to accelerate that, which is fantastic for Halliburton. So I'm very encouraged about the outlook and in the pacing."

I'll talk about pricing maybe first. Yes, we are seeing it now. It looks a little different than maybe in prior cycles in the sense that it's more of a process than it is a point in time. But yes, making a lot of progress around that. We've talked about premium equipment. Clearly, that's a lot of demand for that and it's in short supply and likely stays that way. And so that's certainly positive. The -- in our outlook is that we are going to certainly get net pricing, getting some net pricing now and we expect to continue that particularly as equipment tightens. It starts with the premium equipment, but my view is that we will see that across the entire fleet as we go into 2022. And so with respect to inflation, yes, seeing that, I think that's been passed along fairly straightforward manner. But that's not the pricing that actually we're looking forward to and seeing some of now. From a labor perspective, if you describe 20 more fleets into 2022, [indiscernible] 85% utilization today, that takes us, what, like close to 100. That drives a lot of pricing activity around equipment. And the labor, I think acerbated that. We were very fortunate at Halliburton that we're able to manage the labor other elements of transportation, I think, more effectively than the market. I described some of that in my comments. But I think that will continue to get tight. I like the way we're differentially positioned around those things also."

A separate question. You touched on this a little bit, but I'm really wondering what the inventory of kind of both directional drilling and completion tools globally. Now you're spending only about 5% of revenue on CapEx. It's less than half the rate of just a few years ago. Your competitors have also been very capital disciplined. So obviously, not just the E&P through capital discipline, but you guys have been as well. But now we're on this cusp of this global recovery in activity, as you said, multiyear up cycle unfolding. And we're also seeing these supply chain issues across the industry. I guess my question is, if there's going to be the shortage of type of specialized equipment next year? And where do you see it most acute? You talked about reallocating equipment, but I feel like we've done this already a couple of times. I know you've been moving it around, but -- it feels like we're kind of coming to this inflection on a lot of this equipment out there and I'm just kind of curious to your views on that."

And I say it that way because there'll be many opportunities. Our focus is on the profitable slice of that. And the things that we're seeing set up as it gets more active internationally, short-cycle barrels, clearly will use equipment. But as we see some element of offshore activity creep into that, that soaks up more capacity. And so I expect we'll see quite a bit of tightness, which is very, very positive for Halliburton and our outlook.

Because if you just kind of look at operating cash flow of E&Ps, I mean, those could be up 30% to 40% year-over-year. So that would imply that they would spend less of operating cash flow, where today, they're spending about 50% of operating cash flow.

When we look at 2022, clearly, there's a call on U.S. production at the kind of commodity prices that we see today and particularly given the supply shortage. So I've always expected that we would see North America moved first and strongest as we got into sort of the real heavy lift around short supply. That said, though, I do believe that it has moderated to a degree because there are formulas in place around how reinvestment -- around reinvestment rates, around dividend requirements, around compensation schemes. So all of that's in place, which serves to certainly moderate activity for the public. And I suspect we'll -- those budgets aren't out, but I certainly expect that we'll see those. I think the privates clearly are very active and evidence to me that we see sort of that strengthening is we're finding more work. I mean the reality is, as we readjust pricing and look at the market that requires moving around to different operators at different times and we're doing some of that now. The old adage you don't quit a job until you have a job, and we're finding jobs. And so -- I mean all of that is positive but I think that there will be tightness around equipment in that environment. I don't -- we're in and around 20. It's just sort of a current outlook on '22.

The framework is if the market price is up 15%, but peers are seeing like 10% inflation.

The labor about the ability to recruit nationally in the U.S. and the ability to have a strong local workforce internationally. Both are key elements of managing inflation for Halliburton. From a raw materials perspective, again, supply chain buys from the entire world. We manage logistics, and we actually see that improving in terms of tightness as we go into 2022. Particularly, we're seeing sort of space on airplanes. As the world opens up and we see more carriers sort of get back to work, we actually believe the international logistics around raw material gets better. And then in North America, our relationship with Vorto is having quite an impact. I mean we are able to add drivers. We were able to retain drivers. It's been quite disruptive, but very effective.

So we'll be looking to round out the year around CapEx. And look, I think we'll have to see how working capital continues to play out. We have clearly been very focused on working capital and the required investment it would take to put back that investment as we continue to grow sort of a great outcome this quarter where we actually still generated cash from working capital despite the fact that our revenue was growing globally. So all good good facts historically, whether we can keep -- whether it's realistic that we can keep that momentum from a working capital perspective going forward might be a little bit harder. So those are all the things that we think about. I mean, look, overall, I'm excited about the way that free cash flow has behaved so far this year and I continue to be encouraged about what that means for next year as well."

But they were sort of the things that improved margins with activity. We didn't have much activity, so we didn't see the benefit of that. But a lot of the digital work that we've done in North America and the reduction of roof line and changing of maintenance and all of those things become more valuable as we get into an environment where we see more activity.

Last quarter, we discussed a longer view of a recovering market and our confidence in a multiyear upcycle. I am pleased that the steady march of activity and Halliburton's performance in the third quarter i",2612,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone.  
Last quarter, we discussed a longer view of a recovering market and our confidence in a multiyear upcycle. I am pleased that the steady march of activity and Halliburton's performance in the third quarter internationally and in North America, all reinforce our enthusiasm today and for what we expect in 2022 and beyond.  
Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of both our strategy and our execution as the market recovery accelerates. Here are some highlights. Total company revenue increased 4% sequentially, with top line improvements across all regions, while adjusted operating income grew 6% with solid margin performance in both divisions.  
Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 4%, driven by increased global activity. Operating margin was essentially flat in the third quarter as we made operational choices to prepare for higher demand for our services in 2022. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 4%, with increased activity across multiple regions. Operating margin of 11% was about flat sequentially.  
North America revenue increased 3% as growth in U.S. land was partially offset by a decline in our Gulf of Mexico business due to Hurricane Ito. International revenue grew 5% sequentially, in line with the international rig count growth. Our year-to-date free cash flow generation of almost $900 million puts us solidly on track to deliver our full year free cash flow objective. Finally, we retired $500 million of our long-term debt and ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash on hand.  
As this upcycle unfolds in both the international and North America markets, Halliburton is executing on our strategy to deliver profitable growth and generate industry-leading returns. In the international markets, third quarter activity momentum continued, and I believe it will accelerate into year-end and support mid-teens second half revenue growth compared to the second half of last year.  
This expected outcome is better than we anticipated a quarter ago. In the third quarter, we started long-term projects across all regions in spite of COVID-19 interruptions. While mobility restrictions and daily precautions remain in place, business activity around the world has adjusted and continues to improve.  
In the Middle East, countries relaxed border restrictions and OPEC members prepared for activity increases. We started to work on several rigs, offshore UAE, mobilized a workover project in Bahrain and completed multiple ESP installations on our artificial lift contract in Kuwait. We expect the Middle East to exit the year with solid activity momentum.  
In Asia Pacific, we launched operations on an integrated project offshore Malaysia, with full implementation of Halliburton's digital well construction capabilities. We also ramped up for an increase in our Indonesia drilling operations, where the local NOC plans to boost production from its assets.  
In Europe/Africa/CIS region, the start of operations on a 23-well offshore integrated development campaign for Woodside and Senegal marked a new country entry for Halliburton. In Russia, we are mobilizing for a multiyear IOC operated project on Sakhalin Island. In the U.K. sector of the North Sea, work continues on several new development drilling and workover projects for local independent operators.  
Finally, Latin America delivered its best quarterly performance since 2015. We spudded the first well on a 3-year integrated project in Brazil, deployed our new drilling technologies on multiple wells in Argentina and prepared to mobilize for new work in Ecuador and Colombia. In addition to contract start-ups, our pipeline of new tenders continues to grow. While large Middle East tenders and Latin America projects receive most of the headlines, Customers in Africa, Russia and Southeast Asia, among others, are also issuing tenders for new work.  
All of this points to increasing international customer urgency and demand for our services. Let me describe what I am seeing that gives me this conviction. Global supply and demand balance continues to tighten, resulting in a strong commodity price environment. In response, asset owners are eager to reverse baseline production declines caused by multiple years of underinvestment.  
We expect that NOCs and other operators with short-cycle production opportunities will commit additional capital and gain share to meet future oil demand. Additionally, new fields are smaller and more complex where customers work harder to produce more barrels. Finally, as mature assets change hands, new owners move quickly to revitalize the assets they acquire and unlock remaining reserves. They require service partners who can deliver proven technology and decades of experience.  
All of these things have one thing in common: they require higher service intensity, more dollars spent on the wellbore rather than on infrastructure. As the international recovery accelerates, we remain committed to a clear strategic priority, deliver profitable growth. And we had unique competitive advantages to deliver on this priority.  
We have the established footprint, geographic presence and customer and supplier relationships to capitalize on growth. We have a strong presence in all major international markets. The substantial majority of our workforce is local. And within the regions where we operate, our supply chain spend is primarily with local suppliers. We have proven capabilities to ramp up our services as customers enter new markets. We demonstrated this in Guyana, Suriname and, most recently, in Senegal.  
The Halliburton team mobilized personnel and built a multifunctional operational base to support Woodside as we embark together on a development campaign offshore Senegal. We also engineer innovative solutions both digital and hardware to meet the complex reservoir challenges faced by our international customers.  
For example, in well construction, this quarter, we introduced the iStar comprehensive measurement platform. This next-generation intelligent platform provides multiple logging and drilling measurements that enabled reservoir evaluation, faster drilling and consistent well delivery. For multiple customers in the Middle East and North Sea, the iStar platform provides insight into the impact of drilling parameters on wellbore conditions and optimizes the drilling process in real time.  
In completions, we are the global leader in downhole completion solutions. As our customers increase their activity, our e-completions ecosystem integrates manufacturing, digital twins and technology development processes to increase our speed to market for these long lead complex systems. In many regions, as customers drive for better performance in the face of increasing operational challenges, I expect adoption of integrated and bundled contracts will continue to grow. Halliburton has strong project management capabilities and a proven track record that deliver efficiencies and reduce total customer cost of ownership. Our digital innovations reframe customer project economics through greater efficiencies and improved decision-making.  
For example, in the third quarter, we deployed our Well Construction 4.0 digital solution to deliver further operational efficiencies for our customer in the Middle East. Finally, our customers calling us for collaboration from an IOC looking to reduce emissions on its operations in Mexico to a European independent working to remotely monitor and control all of its global drilling operations.  
Halliburton's value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers is working for both our customers and Halliburton.  
Now turning to North America. The bifurcation between public and private company activity continued in the third quarter. Public E&Ps remain committed to their spending plans for 2021 while private operators continue to take advantage of a strong commodity price environment. As expected, completions growth moderated in the third quarter as operators shifted their focus from completions to drilling activity. Just like in the international markets, customer urgency and demand for our services keep growing in North America.  
Drilled but uncompleted well counts reached the lowest level since 2013 as operators depleted the surplus of DUCs accumulated in 2020. We expect customers to drill and complete more new wells to offset steep base decline rates and deliver production into an anticipated attractive market next year. Completions equipment availability is tightening. Customers have responded by starting the 2022 tender process earlier in an attempt to lock in access to quality services for next year's programs.  
Private companies now operate about 60% of the U.S. land rig count, and current commodity prices provide a strong incentive for their activity to expand. Our market-leading position in North America is rooted in the groundbreaking technologies we put to work in this market. We are the only fully integrated service provider in North America, and this gives us a unique competitive advantage. We combine the full breadth of our technology disciplines, geosciences, physics, chemistry, material science and mechanical, electrical and software engineering to deliver innovative solutions at scale around the world and uniquely in North America to maximize production and minimize costs.  
Our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing service has transitioned from pilot to campaign mode. Several large operators today have SmartFleet working on multi-pad completion programs. SmartFleet, for the first time, allows operators to measure treatment placement in real time, which, among other things, has demonstrated up to 30% improvement in cluster uniformity.  
In the third quarter, we introduced the IsoBond Cement System and pumped it for multiple customers in the DJ Basin and in the Marcellus Shale. By removing liquid additives, this dry blended cement provides significant operational efficiencies and lowers capital requirements for land operations. Taking advantage of the increasing demand for our services require strategic execution on many fronts, particularly in the current environment of stretched supply chains, tight labor and inflationary pressures. Against that reality, I believe that Halliburton is best prepared to provide reliable execution for our customers.  
Our sophisticated supply chain organization translates Halliburton's size and scale into real savings for us and our customers. We are seeing that in action as our supply chain delivers what our customers require for their projects. The labor market is tight today. We have seen this situation before, and our human resources team knows how to navigate it.  
Over the last few years, we compressed our onboarding time, strengthened our national recruiting network and use digital solutions to significantly reduce our field personnel requirements. Despite real challenges, we have the scale, speed and systems to recruit talent nationally and quickly deploy it for our customers.  
In logistics, we have ready access to a fleet of drivers to make deliveries to the job site. We expanded our collaboration with Vorto, an artificial intelligence supply chain platform. Our early adoption of Vorto's platform that connects drivers, asset owners and maintenance yards, allows us to effectively manage trucking inflation and availability constraints.  
Now let me spend a few minutes on our activity and pricing outlook for 2022. First, in the international markets and then in North America. Next year, we expect international activity momentum to accelerate an international leading-edge pricing to move upward in pockets as a result of higher activity. This is what we are seeing today.  
Large tenders remain competitive, but we are already seeing modest price increases on discrete work in underserved markets. We see increasing customer demand for Halliburton's high-end technology and a recognition of its value. Finally, as a result of lower spending by service companies for more than half a decade, international markets face tightening equipment supply. To meet these demands, we are strategically reallocating assets to drive improved utilization and returns.  
Let me be clear. Halliburton prioritizes profitable growth internationally, and this will drive our capital allocation decisions to the best returning product lines, geographies and contracts. In North America, we expect customer spending to increase in and around 20% next year, including solid net pricing gains. Many factors drive that spending and pricing, including customer urgency, equipment tightness and the desire to align with a reliable and differentiated service provider like Halliburton.  
Last quarter, we highlighted the pricing traction that exists for low emission equipment. Today, as we tender for 2022 work, we're seeing price increases for the rest of our fracturing fleet as well. Net pricing has also increased across different nonfrac product service lines: drilling, cementing, drill bits and artificial lift.  
To generate the highest returns as this market grows, we are taking steps to maximize the value of our North America business. Specifically, we are repositioning our fracturing fleets to customers in areas where we can maximize returns in 2022, securing longer-term premium pricing contracts for our existing and planned electric fleets and accelerating fleet maintenance and deployment of the next-generation fluid end technology, which extends the life of our equipment. Halliburton is committed to North America, and I expect we will benefit more than others as activity and pricing momentum accelerates across the board. 
Next, let me turn to how we are executing on our strategic priority to advance a sustainable energy future. As we are witnessing now and saw in the third quarter, the world requires a greater supply of oil and gas. As an oilfield services company, we have the core competency to help our customers to deliver the supply in the most efficient and technologically advanced ways possible.  
With our customers, we are bringing our technical expertise and over a century of industry experience to actively participate in the transition to a cleaner economy. One of the most meaningful contributions we can make today to this transition is to help our customers reduce emissions from their existing production base. Emissions reduction is a critical part of our technology development process, and our innovative low-carbon solutions are helping oil and gas operators reduce their carbon footprint.  
Halliburton's electric fracturing solution delivers results now for our customers. In the third quarter, Halliburton completed an all-electric pad operation on a multiyear contract with Chesapeake Energy in the Marcellus Shale. We deployed our electric fracturing spread with electric blending, wireline and ancillary equipment and an advanced power generation system from VoltaGrid. This high-performing solution reduced Chesapeake's emission using over 25 megawatts of lower carbon power generation from Chesapeake's local field gas.  
We are collaborating with an IOC in Mexico on their total carbon footprint reduction because we provide both well construction services and logistics services on this contract. We changed supply boat fueling mechanisms and optimized usage to achieve emissions reductions in the first year of operations. We are now using a similar contract structure to collaborate with this IOC on its other projects in Latin America.  
We are also advancing renewable energy solutions through Halliburton Labs, our clean energy accelerator. In the third quarter, we doubled our size by increasing the number of Halliburton Labs companies from 4 to 8, welcoming Alumina Energy from California, Ionada from Ontario and Parasanti and SurgePower Materials from Texas. We help these companies scale their exciting technologies from innovative energy storage solutions to modular carbon capture systems.  
In September, Halliburton Labs hosted its third finalist pitch day featuring 9 early-stage companies and an audience of several hundred entrepreneurs, investors, academics and other professionals looking to engage with companies that advance cleaner, affordable energy. The Halliburton Labs participants are achieving results.  
Enexor Bioenergy completed a $10 million Series A round of financing. Enexor's patented modular system uses locally sourced organic or plastic waste to generate clean on-site energy even in the most remote and inaccessible location. Other accelerator participants achieved important scaling milestones in the third quarter.  
With both current and expected demand increases, Halliburton remains committed to the priorities we set in 2020. We prioritized profitable growth and returns, remain focused on capital efficiency and are keeping our overall capital investment in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue. I'm excited about the multiyear upcycle we see in front of us. I believe our value proposition, technology differentiation, digital adoption and capital efficiency will allow us to deliver profitable growth internationally and maximize value in North America. Halliburton will continue to execute our key strategic priorities to deliver industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow for our shareholders.  
Now I'll turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our third quarter financial results. Lance?"

Let me begin with a summary of our third quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.9 billion and adjusted operating income was $458 million, an increas",918,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our third quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.9 billion and adjusted operating income was $458 million, an increase of 4% and 6%, respectively. During the third quarter, Halliburton closed the structured transaction for our North America real estate assets that I described earlier this year, which resulted in a $74 million gain. We also discontinued the proposed sale of our Pipeline and Process Services business leading to a depreciation catch-up related to these assets previously classified as assets held for sale. As a result, among these and other items, we recognized a $12 million pretax charge.  
Now let me take a moment to discuss our division results in more detail. Starting with our Completion and Production division, revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of 4%, while operating income was $322 million or an increase of 2%. These results were driven by increased activity across multiple product service lines in the Western Hemisphere, higher cementing activity in the Middle East/Asia region as well as increased well intervention services in the Europe/Africa/CIS region.  
These improvements were partially offset by reduced completion tool sales in the Eastern Hemisphere, lower stimulation activity in the Middle East/Asia region and accelerated maintenance expenses for our stimulation business in North America, which related to upgrading our fluid end technology in preparation for the anticipated market acceleration that Jeff described earlier.  
In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.7 billion or an increase of 4%, while operating income was $186 million or an increase of 6%. These results were due to improved drilling-related services internationally and in North America land, additional testing services and wireline activity across Latin America, along with increased project management activity in Mexico and Ecuador. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced drilling-related services in Norway and the Gulf of Mexico.  
Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 3%. This increase was driven primarily by higher well construction, artificial lift and wireline activity in North America land, increased completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico and additional stimulation and drilling activity in Canada. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced drilling-related, wireline and stimulation activity in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the impact from Hurricane IDA.  
Turning to Latin America. Revenue increased 17% sequentially. This improvement was driven by increased activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil as well as higher well construction services in Colombia and improved project management activity in Ecuador. These increases were partially offset by reduced fluid services in the Caribbean.  
In Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue was essentially flat sequentially. These results were driven by higher well intervention services across the region, increased well construction services and completion tool sales in Nigeria, additional pipeline and fluid services in Russia and increased activity across multiple product service lines in Senegal. These improvements were offset by decreased activity across multiple product service lines in the North Sea and Algeria and lower completion tool sales in Angola.  
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 2%, resulting from improved well construction activity in the Middle East and Australia. These improvements were partially offset by lower completion tool sales across the region, along with reduced wireline and stimulation activity in Saudi Arabia, lower project management activity in India and lower stimulation activity in Malaysia. In the third quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $50 million.  
For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to moderately increase. Net interest expense for the quarter was $116 million. In the third quarter, we retired $500 million of 2021 senior notes using cash on hand. As a result, our net interest expense in the fourth quarter should decline modestly. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter came in at approximately 24%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 22%.  
Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $190 million. In response to higher demand for our services in both international and North America markets, we are pulling forward spending on long lead time items for our premium equipment and now expect our full year capital expenditures to be closer to $800 million for the full year.  
Turning to cash flow. We generated approximately $620 million of  cash from operations and almost $470 million of free cash flow during the third quarter. I am very pleased with our working capital performance this quarter as we delivered net cash proceeds from working capital despite our revenue growth. 
Now let me describe our near-term outlook. In North America, we expect moderate pricing and activity improvements in drilling and completions to drive sequential growth. In the international markets, we expect continued improvement in rig counts, the pace of which will vary across regions. As a result, for our Completion and Production division, we anticipate mid-single-digit revenue growth sequentially, with operating margins expected to expand by approximately 50 basis points.  
The higher year-end completion tool sales will be partially offset by seasonal North America land activity impacted by the holidays and lower efficiency levels typically experienced in the winter months. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue growth of 5% to 7% and a margin increase of 150 to 200 basis points due to seasonal software sales and higher overall global activity.

And then along with that, we've got short supply service assets, and that is also driving great environment for us. And Halliburton is in the right places. 
And so when I think about profitable growth internationally and also maximizing value in North America, that's right in the fairway of where we want to be. And so this beginning of an upcycle, I think what we'll see are our operators work very hard to improve production, but it's short-cycle style barrels are just going to take a lot more work around the wellbore, and all very good.

I'll talk about pricing maybe first. Yes, we are seeing it now. It looks a little different than maybe in prior cycles in the sense that it's more of a process than it is a point in time. But yes, making a lot of progress around that. We've talked about premium equipment. Clearly, that's a lot of demand for that and it's in short supply and likely stays that way. And so that's certainly positive. 
The -- and our outlook is that we are going to certainly get net pricing, getting some net pricing now, and we expect to continue that particularly as equipment tightens. It starts with the premium equipment, but my view is that we will see that across the entire fleet as we go into 2022. And so with respect to inflation, yes, seeing that, I think that's been passed along fairly straightforward manner. But that's not the pricing that actually we're looking forward to and seeing some of now. 
From a labor perspective, if you describe 20 more fleets into 2022, for a 85% utilization today, that takes us, what, like close to 100. That drives a lot of pricing activity around equipment. And the labor, I think will acerbated that. And we were very fortunate at Halliburton that we're able to manage the labor and other elements of transportation, I think, more effectively than the market. I described some of that in my comments. But I think that will continue to get tight. I like the way we're differentially positioned around those things also."

A separate question. You touched on this a little bit, but I'm really wondering what the inventory of kind of both directional drilling and completion tools globally. Now you're spending only about 5% of revenue on CapEx. It's less than half the rate of just a few years ago. Your competitors have also been very capital disciplined. So obviously, not just the E&P through capital discipline, but you guys have been as well. 
But now we're on this cusp of this global recovery in activity, as you said, multiyear upcycle unfolding. And we're also seeing these supply chain issues across the industry. I guess my question is, if there's going to be the shortage of type of specialized equipment next year? And where do you see it most acute? You talked about reallocating equipment, but I feel like we've done this already a couple of times. And I know you've been moving it around.

And I say it that way because there'll be many opportunities. Our focus is on the profitable slice of that. 
And as things that we're seeing set up as it gets more active internationally, short-cycle barrels, clearly will use equipment. But as we see some element of offshore activity creep into that, that soaks up more capacity. And so I expect we'll see quite a bit of tightness, which is very, very positive for Halliburton and our outlook.

Because if you just kind of look at operating cash flow of E&Ps, I mean, those could be up 30% to 40% year-over-year. So that would imply that they would spend less of operating cash flow, where today, they're spending about 50% of operating cash flow. And if you just look at consensus for public E&Ps, we're talking high teens already for growth. So that implies kind of a more modest pace of growth for the private E&Ps.

When we look at 2022, clearly, there's a call on U.S. production at the kind of commodity prices that we see today and particularly given the supply shortage. So I've always expected that we would see North America moved first and strongest as we got into sort of the real heavy lift around short supply. 
That said, though, I do believe that it has moderated to a degree because there are formulas in place around how reinvestment -- around reinvestment rates, around dividend requirements, around compensation schemes. So all of that's in place, which serves to certainly moderate activity for the public. And I suspect we'll -- those budgets aren't out, but I certainly expect that we'll see those. I think the privates clearly are very active and evidence to me that we see sort of that strengthening is we're finding more work. 
I mean the reality is, as we readjust pricing and look at the market that requires moving around to different operators at different times, and we're doing some of that now. But the old adage you don't quit a job until you have a job, and we're finding jobs. And so -- I mean all of that is positive, but I think that there will be tightness around equipment in that environment. I don't -- we're in and around '20.

The labor about the ability to recruit nationally in the U.S. and the ability to have a strong local workforce internationally, both are key elements of managing inflation for Halliburton. 
From a raw materials perspective, again, supply chain buys from the entire world. We manage logistics, and we actually see that improving in terms of tightness as we go into 2022. Particularly, we're seeing sort of space on airplanes. As the world opens up and we see more carriers sort of get back to work, we actually believe the international logistics around raw material gets better. 
And then in North America, our relationship with Vorto is having quite an impact. I mean we are able to add drivers. We were able to retain drivers. It's been quite disruptive, but very effective.

Drag or headwind near term, not much. Any of that would be in our guidance. But look, this is maximizing the value in North America, which is clearly what strategically we want to do and plan to do and are doing involves making decisions around what we do with the assets that we have. And I think you're seeing that, and we'll continue to see that from Halliburton. And so I'm super encouraged. And a lot of the discussions we're having today with customers are around 2022. 
In fact, most of that dialogue is 2022 and beyond actually, even into some sort of '23 type discussion. So I'm super encouraged. What we want to make sure is that our assets are deployed where they are the most valuable for us and our clients. And yes, that does include moving them around. When we're moving them around, we tend to do more maintenance on them and whatnot. That's the opportunity that we take typically to do high grades of fluid ends and that kind of thing. And so should be interpreted in a very positive way what we're doing and particularly a demonstration of really 2 strategic planks: one is maximizing value in North America, and the second is capital velocity -- capital efficiency."

And a lot of countries are declining today. Declining is hard to overcome. They'll work hard to do that, but that doesn't necessarily move the needle in terms of production. It might get it back to flat and steady even with extra work. It takes extra work to just stem the decline. All of that's positive for us. I mean, clearly, we see more activity as we go into 2022 in the Middle East and Latin America. But again, I think that those that can spend and are in a position to do so will. 
But there's -- the sort of the capital austerity by a number of clients is still well in place. And so I think that -- and I say that in the sense that I think that production is going to all be near wellbore, which is very good for us. And I think that a lot of work will get done, but I still see supply is tight for really quite some time. I mean it doesn't turn back on. Maybe a point worth remembering in 2014, the number of big multibillion-dollar projects with 30-year payouts that were being completed or in the process of finishing, we don't see those today. And the reality is that means there's less spend on infrastructure and a lot more spend on what we do. And I think that's all very, very positive."

That's pretty obvious based on our guidance for the quarter. Some of that will be offset by some of that acceleration in CapEx spend that we talked about in my prepared remarks. So we'll be looking to round out the year around CapEx. And look, I think we'll have to see how working capital continues to play out. We have clearly been very focused on working capital and the required investment it would take to put back that investment as we continue to grow sort of a great outcome this quarter where we actually still generated cash from working capital despite the fact that our revenue was growing globally. 
So all good facts historically, whether we can keep -- whether it's realistic that we can keep that momentum from a working capital perspective going forward might be a little bit harder. So those are all the things that we think about. I mean, look, overall, I'm excited about the way that free cash flow has behaved so far this year.

Look, I feel good about our business in 2022, most certainly for the reasons I've described. Not going to try to give an outlook today on 2022. But what I can say from an operating -- from an earnings power standpoint, been very effective at maintaining the earnings power reset that really happened a year ago, but that's well in place. And all of the things -- there were a lot of things that we did when we were reducing cost a year ago that really they were going to be savings as we saw activity pick up. But they were sort of the things that improved margins with activity. We didn't have much activity, so we didn't see the benefit of that. But a lot of the digital work that we've done in North America and the reduction of roof line and changing of maintenance and all of those things become more valuable as we get into an environment where we see more activity. And so I'm really encouraged about the outlook. And I think not only activity, but our technology offering, particularly around frac in North America, is very unique.

I think we've been pretty clear what the guardrails are on our business even into next year, 5% to 6% of revenue.
