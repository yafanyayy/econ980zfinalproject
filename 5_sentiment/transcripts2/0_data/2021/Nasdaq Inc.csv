Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I begin my remarks, I would like to note that we're starting the new year at the depth of the COVID crisis.

Before I begin my remarks, I would like to note that we're starting the new year at the depth of the COVID crisis. And we continue to focus on maintaining our employees' health and safety while executing on our critical role in facilitating capital raising, liquidity and price discovery in the economies in which we and our clients operate. 
While we manage through this very challenging environment, the rollout of the vaccines provide a new hope for 2021. Throughout this health crisis, I have remained extremely proud of the resilience of Nasdaq's business our team and our client community. Over the past year, we have deepened our partnerships with our clients and worked together with them to ensure the resiliency of the capital markets to handle unprecedented volumes and to facilitate near record levels of capital raising across our listed companies. 
Capital markets and the role Nasdaq plays within them have never been more important as a critical source of funding and liquidity for innovation and job creation, including vaccine research and production as well as for funding and liquidity needed to help companies weather through this very challenging period. 
We remain steadfast and unwavering in our commitments to our employees, our clients and our mission as we enter 2021. 
My remarks today will focus on the following areas: Nasdaq's full year 2020 and fourth quarter of 2020 financial and business performance; the progress we've made to drive Nasdaq forward along our strategic direction, and our ambitions for 2021 and beyond. 
Turning to our results. I'm very pleased to report Nasdaq's strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020. First, for the fourth quarter, we achieved $788 million in net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020, a 22% increase compared to the prior year period, while non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.60 rose 24% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Turning to the full year of 2020. We generated total net revenues of $2.9 billion, including 10% organic revenue growth from our Solutions segment along with 21% organic growth -- revenue increase from our Market Services segment due primarily to elevated trading volumes in U.S. equities and options. 
Total organic revenue growth for the year was 14%. In terms of the annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, and Software as a Service or SaaS revenue disclosures, we introduced at our November 2020 Investor Day. ARR ended the year at $1.58 billion in the fourth -- end of the year, $1.58 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, up 9% year-over-year, and annualized SaaS revenue was $456 million, up 11% year-over-year. 
The strong development across these types of revenues creates a healthy core to build off of going forward, independent of fluctuating trade volumes or market levels. 
2020 was another year of robust execution for Nasdaq against the unique operating environment that none of us could have predicted a year ago. The strong results from the fourth quarter highlight the strength of Nasdaq's diversified product offering and business model, which allowed us to address the needs of our clients in a unique capital markets environment, including periods of elevated trading volumes, rising benchmark index valuations and a very strong period of new listings and capital formation. 
Throughout the year, we also continue to invest organically and inorganically to advance our offerings, guided by our strategy to maximize opportunities as a technology and analytics provider while also investing to sustain the strong competitive position of our core marketplace foundation. 
Because of the strong performance for the year and in particular, the very strong finish in the fourth quarter, we entered 2021 with incredible momentum. We now have begun our fourth year since the 2017 announcement of our new vision for NASDAQ. Our full year results illustrate how we can deliver on our strategy, and more importantly, how our disciplined client-centric focus is creating value, not just for our clients, but for all of our stakeholders. 
Now I'm going to turn to specific highlights from our businesses, focusing mainly on fourth quarter results. Our Investment Intelligence segment delivered $247 million in net revenue during the fourth quarter, a 27% increase from the prior year period, primarily driven by especially strong momentum in index licensing as well as positive contributions from both analytics and end market data. 
We set new quarterly highs in both our index revenues of $97 million and end-of-period ETP assets under management tracking Nasdaq indexes of $359 billion. As we noted in our Investor Day presentation, our Investment Intelligence segment has been repositioned for improved growth as we look to deepen our engagement with asset managers, asset owners and consultants, and the clients from our market data and index franchises. 
We are diligently focused on building out this business to be the essential partner to the investment community. As we move into 2021, we're making investments to ensure these growth engines have the fuel to continue performing in the long term. For example, we're progressing our alternative investment workflow and data platform for asset owners with new capabilities, coupled with our integration with Solovis. And we will continue to advance our expansion of our increasingly popular indexes and trusted data products to new clients in new geographies. 
Turning next to our Market Technology segment. We delivered $106 million in total net revenues for the fourth quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year period. This was driven by higher SaaS revenues and changes in foreign exchange rates, while revenues from market infrastructure operator projects stayed remained flat. 
Over the course of 2020, I'm pleased to report Market Technology welcome 29 new customers, of which 25 chose our SaaS products. As we stated in the previous investor calls, service implementations, change request projects, new order intake levels from our traditional market operator clients and funding for new markets initiatives have been adversely impacted by pandemic-related factors. 
In the second half of 2020, we have taken actions, in particular, dedicating more resources to mitigate project delays and to better deliver for our customers. In a communication to our investors issued on January 12, we noticed -- we noted in one particular project, specifically in on-premise enterprise software delivery of a complex post-trade clearing and settlement solution foreign exchange group, changes to our implementation timing and expected costs resulted in a significant discrete $25 million expense for the period. The expense resulted from taking a onetime reserve to reflect the expected losses on the approximately 13-year fixed price contract. The need for reserve resulted from an updated detailed review of the implementation project with the client and with our internal technology and finance teams. 
We expect an increased implementation spend from higher resourcing for the project and a longer project duration due partly to the aforementioned COVID-related impacts, but also due to a prior underappreciation of this one project's unique demand. 
While some of the issues are very specific to this one project, we will apply what we've learned to ensure future contracts fit with the profitability objectives of the market technology business. As we examine the broader market technology business with our market infrastructure operator clients, we are starting to see improved sales opportunities as we exit 2020. However, we have not seen a full recovery to a pre-COVID sales environment. Both new and existing market infrastructure operator clients recognize that we're operating in a unique period with unusually elongated sales cycles, but we are -- they are engaging with us with incrementally more energy in the last few months. to move forward with new projects and system upgrades. 
Additionally, our buy-side and sell-side technology business, led by our SaaS-based trade execution and trade surveillance offerings, maintained strong momentum throughout 2020 with 13% revenue growth for the full year, and we enter 2021 with a position of strength in this segment of our business. 
During the fourth quarter, we also announced an agreement to acquire Verafin, which provides more than 2,000 financial institutions in North America with a cloud-based platform to detect, investigate and report money laundering and financial fraud. A statistic from the United Nations notes that up to $2 trillion in laundered money flows through the financial system every year. As criminals continue to find sophisticated methods for moving funds undetected, robust advanced anti-money laundering technology have become essential for financial institutions. 
Once closed, Verafin will complement NASDAQ's established regtech leadership to create a global SaaS leader focused on the $13 billion market for antifinancial Crime technology solutions. Our long-term mission together with Verafin is to become the market-leading provider of anti financial crime technology. 
Despite the challenges we faced in market technology in 2020, we remain highly confident in our strategy and on our ability to execute against new opportunities going forward. 
Moving to our foundational marketplace businesses. Our Market Services segment delivered net revenues of $291 million during the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 29% from the prior year period. This area of our business maintained its strong competitive position across both the United States and Europe, while our U.S. options business set a new quarterly trading volume record. 
The record fourth quarter helped make 2020 the most active year for options trading ever, averaging 27.7 million contracts traded a day, a 58% increase over 2019. The Nasdaq led the industry in multiply listed options for the 11th year in a row. In fact, for the first time, Nasdaq was the largest options marketplace platform in the country for the year, including trading both index options and multiple listed options. 
Meanwhile, our European Equities Exchange complex set a new 10-year high on on-exchange market share in 2020. Finally, our Corporate Platform segment delivered revenue of $144 million in the fourth quarter, a 12% increase, boosted by particularly strong IPO and private market activity in our listings business, as well as increased demand for our IR intelligence, ESG services and Board portable offerings. 
Our team successfully adapted all elements of the IPO process to a virtual environment. And as a result, for the eighth consecutive year, Nasdaq led the United States exchanges for IPOs in 2020 with 316, capitalizing on an incredibly busy year for new issues and with a 67% overall IPN win rate, including an 83% win rate for operating companies and a 53% win rate for SPACS. 
Also for the second year in a row, Nasdaq ranked #1 in the U.S. in terms of IPO capital raised with $80.9 billion, representing 52% of the industry total. The fourth quarter was particularly strong in terms of activity. We welcomed 142 IPOs, and this momentum is carried into 2021 with a particularly busy January. 
Meanwhile, our Nordic, Baltic and First North exchanges continue to attract new companies from across Europe, adding 67 new listings, including 45 IPOs in 2020. We also had 20 new companies switch their corporate listings to Nasdaq, including American Electric Power, Astrazeneca and Keurig Dr Pepper. These 20 transfers represent an aggregate $282 billion in global equity market capitalization. 
Across the entire Nasdaq listing business in both the U.S. and the Nordics, our corporate issuer count rose 8% in 2020, setting us up in a strong position as we begin 2021. 
On the private company side, our Nasdaq private market business set a new record for annual volume in 2020, facilitating 90 private company liquidity programs and with the fourth quarter -- and the fourth quarter was particularly busy with 49 transactions completed on the platform, a new quarterly record. 
Demand for our IR intelligence and governance solutions, particularly our ESG-related technology and consultative tools, drove growth in our IR ESG services subsegment, which saw an 8% increase in the fourth quarter. 
And lastly, during the period, we filed a new U.S. listing proposal with the SEC that seeks to standardize forward level diversity disclosures, coupled with a recommended minimum diversity standard through a hub or explained framework. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks today, 2020 represented an important year regarding the progress we've made on our strategic journey. As we continue on that path, I would like to reiterate the core ambitions we outlined at our Investor Day in November. 
In Market Technology, our core ambition is to be the trusted market technology and antifinancial crime technology partner, and our key 2021 initiatives for this segment are to deploy and drive adoption of SaaS market technology solutions and to enhance our antifinancial crime business through the combination with Verafin. 
In Investment Intelligence, our core ambition is to be the essential partner to the investment community, and our key 2021 initiatives are to offer a full-service alternative workflow platform for asset owners and to accelerate the expansion of indexes and cloud-delivered data services to new clients and new geographies. 
In Corporate Platforms, our core ambition is to be the leading provider of capital market solutions to corporates. And our key 2021 initiatives are to expand Nasdaq's share of U.S. corporate listing and to establish the leading end-to-end corporate ESG reporting workflow tool to complement our IR and Governance solutions. 
Lastly, in Market Services, our core ambition is to be the preeminent market operator for equities and equity derivatives in the U.S. and Europe. And our key 2021 initiatives are to continue to implement our multiyear migration of our derivatives markets to our next-generation platform, increasingly leveraging the cloud; and to expand our suite of distinctive equity and equity derivatives trading products and solutions. We look forward to updating you on our progress on these ambitions in the quarters to come. 
As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that our fourth quarter produced solid results for Nasdaq, completing a successful 2020 for our company. Moving forward into 2021, we remain relentlessly focused on advancing our strategic pivot to maximize opportunities as a technology and data analytics provider while maintaining segment leadership in our foundational marketplace businesses in the U.S. and Europe. We will officially celebrate Nasdaq's 50th anniversary next month. 
As we near this important milestone in our corporate history, I remain confident that we are moving the company in the right direction as we build upon the strong momentum generated last year. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Michael in a moment to review the financial details for his final earnings call before handing the mantle to Ann at the end of February. While we spent some time on our last earnings call and our Investor Day reflecting on Michael's incredible career here at Nasdaq and at TMX, on this occasion of Michael's 73rd consecutive and final earnings call, I would like to thank Michael for his tremendous service to Nasdaq. We will miss him greatly, but we are well prepared for his transition, as Ann Dennison steps into the role of CFO and Jeremy School expands his responsibilities to become our new Chief Strategy Officer. 
Now over to you, Michael."
740535,698620380,2182022,"Nasdaq, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Nasdaq, Inc.","Executives","Thank you for those kind remarks, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results",1993,"Thank you for those kind remarks, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. 
Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the financial section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing fourth quarter revenue performance, as shown on Page 3 of the presentation and organic revenue growth on Pages 4 and 14. 
The $142 million increase in reported net revenue of $788 million is a net result of organic growth of $126 million, including a 27% organic increase in market services and a 16% organic increase in the Solutions segment, a $3 million positive impact from acquisitions, and a $13 million positive impact from favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. 
I will now review quarterly highlights within each of the reporting segments. I'll start with Investment Intelligence revenue, which increased $53 million or 27%. Organic revenue growth during the period was 25%, primarily reflecting very strong growth in our index business and positive contributions from each of the market data and analytics businesses. 
Annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $560 million and increased 9% compared to the prior year period. As a reminder, revenues related to index AUM and futures trading are not included in the ARR definition. 
Fourth quarter 2020 operating margin of 65% increased 4 percentage points compared to the prior year period, while the full year 2020 margin of 64% rose 1 percentage point versus 2019. 
Now I note, looking forward to the first quarter of 2021 for index. Trading activity of instruments licensed to our indexes achieved certain thresholds earlier in the year that triggered an increase in-licensing economics in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. While the confidentiality of our index agreements limits the detail we can provide on this, what we can say is that as we begin 2021, the economics of some of the agreements reset for the new year. And this will lead to approximately $7 million of lower revenue in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. 
This assumes similar trading activity and product mix in the 2 periods. Turning to Market Technology. Revenue increased $8 million or 8%. Organic revenue growth totaled $4 million or 4%, and there was a positive $4 million impact from changes in foreign exchange. The organic increase was driven primarily by higher SaaS revenues. 
ARR was $283 million and increased 9% compared to the prior year period. The operating margin was a negative 1% in the period and was impacted by the previously mentioned $25 million reserve related to the expected loss on the market technology implementation project. 
Excluding the reserve, the operating margin was 23% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 24% in the prior year period and 16% for the full year 2020, unchanged from 2019. 
Corporate platforms revenues increased $15 million or 12%. Organic revenue growth totaled $13 million or 10%, and there was a $2 million positive impact from changes in foreign exchange. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in U.S. listings revenues, increases in ESG services revenues and growth in Nasdaq private market. 
ARR was $470 million and increased 9% compared to the prior year period. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the operating margin of 31% for the segment was down from 35% in the prior year period. The decrease in the operating margin was primarily due to higher variable compensation and marketing expenses during the period in support of the very strong IPO activity. 
For the full year 2020, the corporate platform's operating margin was 36%, unchanged from 2019. Market services net revenues increased $66 million or 29%. The organic revenue increase was $60 million or 27%, and there was a $6 million impact from changes in foreign exchange. The organic increase during the period primarily reflects increases in cash equities and U.S. equities derivatives net revenues due to higher industry trading volumes. 
For the fourth quarter of 2020, market services operating margin of 61% increased 6 percentage points from 55% in the prior year period, and full year 2020 margin of 62% was 5 percentage points higher than 2019, each comparison reflecting strong operating leverage on the higher trading revenues. 
Now earlier today, NASDAQ clearing received the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authorities or FSA's decision following their supervisory review initiated after the member default following the extreme market movement on our Nordic commodities market in September of 2018. 
The SFSA decided to issue a warning and an administrative fine of approximately $36 million. NASDAQ clearing has been cooperating throughout the investigation with the regulator and maintains a constructive working relationship with the SFSA. 
Immediately following the event and independent of the SFSA review, NASDAQ clearing launched a comprehensive enhancement program to strengthen the resilience and robustness of the clearinghouse. We are comfortable that the program effectively addresses the observations made by the SFSA in their review. 
While the SFSA recognized the changes made by the clearinghouse, our initial review indicates that the findings appear to be disproportionate to the severity and impact of the incident and to the size of the commodities business that the clearinghouse serves. We are continuing to review the decision and evaluating our legal options, and we'll communicate any next steps to our members and the broader public in due course. 
Now turning to Pages 9 and 14 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $71 million to $406 million. The increase reflects a $53 million or 16% organic increase, inclusive of the $25 million reserve related to market technology. Excluding the reserve, the organic increase was $28 million or 8% as compared to the total organic revenue growth of 20%. 
The increase was also due to a $6 million increase from the impact of acquisitions and a $12 million increase from the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. As noted in our January 12 press release, the full year 2020 non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.41 billion were above the high end of our prior guidance range due to 3 primary factors: first, higher performance compensation and variable expenses related to higher-than-expected fourth quarter 2020 revenues associated with elevated trading volumes, a quarterly record in assets under management and licensed ETPs, and a multi-decade high in the number of Nasdaq IPOs. 
Second, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates; and third, the $25 million reserve related to the expected loss of the market technology implementation project. 
On that last item, I will spend a moment explaining the accounting aspect of the reserve. The accounting for highly customized software system delivery contracts, such as certain of our market technology contracts, requires us to record a loss in the quarter when it becomes probable that costs will exceed future revenues from the contract. 
During the fourth quarter, as part of our regular review of significant implementation projects, we refined and revised our plans relating to a large-scale post-trade clearing implementation project for a specific client. In that process, it became probable that we would incur a loss over the remainder of that particular project, in part due to the logistical implications of COVID-19. As a result, we recorded the $25 million reserve that reflects the expected loss. 
Turning to Slide 10. We are initiating our 2021 non-GAAP operating expense guidance range of $1.55 to $1.62 billion. The expense guidance range at the midpoint reflects an approximate 3% organic increase compared to 2020, excluding the $25 million reserve on the market tech contract. An additional approximate 3% increased due to changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as expenses due to the net impact of M&A. 
The guidance does reflect the anticipated closing of Verafin acquisition in the first quarter of 2021. Now moving to operating profits and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased $71 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the non-GAAP operating margin of 48% was unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the $25 million reserve, the non-GAAP operating margin would have been 52% in the fourth quarter, up 400 basis points versus the prior year. 
Net interest expense was $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of $2 million versus the prior year period. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25% for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 26% for the full year 2020. 
For the full year of 2021, we expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be between 25% and 27%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $268 million or $1.60 per diluted share compared to $215 million or $1.29 per diluted share in the prior year period. 
Turning to Slide 11. Debt increased by $1.97 billion versus September 30, 2020, primarily due to bond issuances of $1.88 billion in December and an $89 million increase in our outstanding Eurobond book values caused by stronger Europe. 
The proceeds of the December offering are expected to be used to partially finance the Verafin acquisition, along with additional borrowings of approximately $500 million prior to the closing of the transaction. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.5x, an increase from 2.4x from the third quarter of 2020. 
During the fourth quarter of 2020, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $81 million and repurchased common stock in the amount of $36 million. And during 2020, the company also repurchased common stock in the amount of $222 million. 
Now I'd like to provide a brief update on the acquisition of Verafin. We continue to progress through the regulatory approval process and expect Verafin to close in the first quarter of 2021. As a reminder, we are projecting in excess of $140 million in Verafin revenue for the full year of 2021. This will need to be adjusted for both the actual closing date as well as the impact of an accounting write-down of deferred revenue. We currently estimate this purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue to total $35 million, which will impact recognized revenues over the 12-month period following the close. 
The acquisition of Verafin is expected to deliver non-GAAP EPS accretion beginning in 2022 and increase thereafter. And I'll remind investors and analysts that Nasdaq's organic growth calculation reflects contributions from acquired businesses beginning 12 months after close. And as such, Verafin will be included in organic growth beginning in the first quarter of 2022. 
Finally, as Adena mentioned, this will be my 73rd consecutive and last quarterly call before retirement. I want to take a moment to thank my incredible team and outstanding colleagues for all their extensive efforts, contributions and kindness during my time here at Nasdaq. 
I also want to thank Adena for her exceptional and principled leadership. It has been an honor and an education working for Adena and our esteemed Board of Directors. I also want to express my appreciation and gratitude to you, the investors and analysts with whom I've had the pleasure and privilege of working with over the years. And I especially want to thank my family for allowing me the time to pursue my career, and I'm very much looking forward to be able to repay them some of that time whether they want it or not, over the coming years. 
As I said on the last call, I could not be more excited that Ann will be taking hold of the CFO reins. I have so enjoyed working with her. She is a person of integrity, intelligence and initiative, who I'm confident will serve this organization with excellence. And I look forward to you breaking my quarterly record as CFO of an exchange group, and I will definitely hologram into the Q2 2039 investor call when that occurs. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for Q&A."

So my question is mainly for Michael. I didn't fully understand, I guess, the drop in revenues. I think it was for an investment intelligence. But the overriding question here is really for you, Adena. It's -- when you look at the organic growth rate, I know you adjusted it up for Verafin a bit. But if you take, for example, in investment intelligence, the 5% to 8% we've run at 18% and 25% the last 2 quarters.

I think we also are seeing solid growth across market data and the analytics businesses and that are more stable but also just really, really strong. So whether or not you're asking whether we would change our medium- to long-term outlook for the business, I think that we are maintaining our medium- to long-term outlook for the business on the back of the fact that index values can fluctuate. 
But I also agree that as we continue to perform and we continue to see progress in the business, we will, of course, continue to update our outlook for that business."

So on order intake, I would say that the primary driver of a lower order intake for 2020 has been the impact of the COVID situation. 
When we think about our engagement with our clients, and particularly for those that are taking on some very significant projects with us, I think there are 2 things that come into play. First is the fact that many of our market infrastructure operator clients have been really, really focused on managing the capacity and resiliency in this year where they've all experienced very high volumes. And we're very proud of the fact that our technology has served them well, but they've been more focused on the here and the now. 
And some of the projects that they have been planning to do and planning to work with us on early in the year were temporary to put on hold. So we're starting to engage more productively with them as they start to think through the future going into 2021. 
But I definitely think that was part of it. And then the second thing is that when we're engaging with new clients. And we did sign, as we mentioned, we did sign 29 new clients in 2020. But it is important, in some cases, particularly with the larger ones that would drive the order intake number that they have a lot of engagement, including in person engagement, and that's been much harder this year. So some of those projects, again, have just had elongated sales cycles. So I think that it really has been a COVID impact on order intake primarily. 
In terms of the margin going forward, I think the way to look at that particular situation was it is an isolated situation. We have had actually -- we've signed over the last 5 years, 38 new clients that would be in a similar situation where they have very -- they have large-scale contracts. We do quarterly reviews. We have a steering Board internally to track and monitor the projects, and this is the only one in which we are seeing a situation where we have a loss. But in that particular case, we are recognizing that loss now, which then for the remaining life of the contract means we will not recognize a loss, assuming it goes according to our expectations. 
I think, though, that -- but it doesn't necessarily accelerate the margin. It just -- it makes it so that this one isolated situation doesn't have a negative impact on the margin going forward. I hope that answers your question, Dan."

If you could just clarify, Michael, I got the $35 million of deferred revenue, which if you could just clarify if that will be included in your adjusted results and a contra revenue for '21 for Verafin and then just reiterate the top line that you mentioned for Verafin in '21.

I'll answer the listings question, and then I'll turn it over to Michael for the Verafin question. 
On the listing side, I think that if you think about the key drivers of recurring revenue in that business, and much of the revenue is recurring in that business, having -- we mentioned the fact that we had a net increase of 8% in terms of total listings on that business year-over-year, which then -- if that's the exit rate, that becomes the entry rate for 2021. So -- and as you know, we collect fees annually and we collect them in the beginning of the year. 
So I think that that's one thing to think about in terms of the fundamental drivers of the business. I think the second thing is that as we look at our SaaS businesses, our IR services, particularly our IR technology and the Board portal business, as well as the one report system, those are all kind of what I would call reoccurring contracts. Many of them are multiyear. Some of them -- and many of them, of course, recur year-over-year. And so if you have a higher exit rate for last year, 2020, and therefore, you have a higher entry rate for 2021 that obviously occurs for benefit. 
But you are right that there are some revenues on what we call our advisory service, including our ESG advisory services, that are project-based. And so that revenue is more that we might have a onetime project, we might have recurring projects, but that part of the revenue is a little less recurring. So hopefully, it gives you a sense of how to think about the fundamental drivers of that business as we go into 2021. Why don't we turn it over to Michael on the Verafin question."

The other thing we've said in the past is that the futures revenue can be a range of 10% to 20% of the overall. And I think that if you look at the fourth quarter, it was -- those numbers are generally accurate. 
And as obviously, every quarter, the future's revenue will fluctuate a little bit. But those types of ranges are the right way to look at it, including the fourth quarter. In terms of the market data side, I think that what we call revenue from previously unreported usage, it was up $2 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter, but was actually -- was lower for the year versus 2019.

So I think that if we look at the overall Market Tech business, we've got the market infrastructure operators, and then we have our banks and brokers clients. And so I think it's important, as I mentioned in my comments, that it's really in the market infrastructure operator segment that we saw a slowing of sales as well as the elongation of some of the significant projects. 
And I think that as we think about our engagement with those clients, as I mentioned also, a lot of those clients really focus much of the year on their immediate needs to make sure that they were managing capacity and resiliency and managing to current trading levels. And so if they were planning to do some enhancements or changes or upgrades they kind of put those plans on hold. I think also, they know that as they go forward with those plans, they want to be able to have the right focus from their customers and their customers are also dealing with these elevated trading volumes. 
So to put on them and upgrade in the middle of that, I think, was also something we were hesitant to do. So as we exited 2020 and we're starting to -- we are starting to see more engagement from those clients saying, we can't put these things off forever and they're starting to engage with us. But I would have to say, still is not at the levels that we were experiencing before covet at the beginning of last year. I think also some of the new markets clients that were very active and engaged with us are continuing to engage, but some of them have hit funding issues or just as they're looking at launching their products, they're waiting until a more normalized environment. 
So those are the things that are -- that's the color behind that. On the banks and broker side, though, and this actually plays into the Verafin question, we actually continue to see a nice healthy engagement, healthy growth. And also, it's a SaaS-based delivery. So it's a much easier thing for the clients to take and to integrate, whether it's our surveillance or our trade execution solutions. And so they -- that business had a more, I would say, more of a normal environment as well as some increased demand, particularly for surveillance as the clients went online, went to a remote setting, and they had to add users to make sure that they had proper coverage. I think that, that then plays into the Verafin question, which is they're more aligned with the banks and brokers, where it's a SaaS-based cloud-based delivery. So it's the light implementation for the client and they continue to have a lot of engagement with banks and brokers managing through their antifinancial crime program. So they didn't see the same level of impact as we did see at the market infrastructure operator clients, and I think that they had a solid end to the year. So we feel good about their progress and their momentum going into 2021."

So we probably really only have some level of understanding of the demand for SPACs in the first quarter and then our line of sight really diminishes. 
I think with operating companies, we tend to have a little bit of a longer view. So my answer to the question is that we have a very active pipeline in both SPAC and operating companies and I would say, SPAC for the next several weeks probably. And in terms of we just don't see beyond that. And with operating companies, we certainly see a healthy pipeline through the first half of the year, and then we'll have to see how the markets continue to develop. 
But as you know, the market and the performance of the market does have an impact on when companies tend to go out. So assuming a benign market environment, we should have a pretty healthy first half."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
Before I begin my remarks, I would like to note that we're starting the new year at the depth of the COVID crisis, and we continue to focus on maintaining our employees' health and safety while executing on our critical role in facilitating capital raising, liquidity and price discovery in the economies in which we and our clients operate.  
While we manage through this very challenging environment, the rollout of the vaccines provide a new hope for 2021. Throughout this health crisis, I have remained extremely proud of the resilience of Nasdaq's business, our team and our client community. 
Over the past year, we have deepened our partnerships with our clients and worked together with them to ensure the resiliency of the capital markets to handle unprecedented volumes and to facilitate near-record levels of capital raising across our listed companies. Capital markets and the role Nasdaq plays within them have never been more important as a critical source of funding and liquidity for innovation and job creation, including vaccine research and production, as well as for funding and liquidity needed to help companies weather through this very challenging period. We remain steadfast and unwavering in our commitments to our employees, our clients and our mission as we enter 2021.  
My remarks today will focus on the following areas: Nasdaq's full year 2020 and fourth quarter of 2020 financial and business performance, the progress we've made to drive Nasdaq forward along our strategic direction and our ambitions for 2021 and beyond. Turning to our results. I'm very pleased to report Nasdaq's strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020. 
First, for the fourth quarter, we achieved $788 million in net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020, a 22% increase compared to the prior year period while non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.60 rose 24% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.  
Turning to the full year of 2020. We generated total net revenues of $2.9 billion, including 10% organic revenue growth from our solutions segment along with 21% organic growth revenue increase from our Market Services segment due primarily to elevated trading volumes in U.S. equities and options. Total organic revenue growth for the year was 14%. 
In terms of the annualized recurring revenue or ARR and Software as a Service or SaaS revenue disclosures we introduced at our November 2020 Investor Day, ARR ended the year at $1.58 billion in  the fourth quarter of 2020, up 9% year-over-year, and annualized SaaS revenue was $456 million, up 11% year-over-year. The strong development across these types of revenues creates a healthy core to build off of going forward, independent of fluctuating trade volumes or market levels.  
2020 was another year of robust execution for Nasdaq against a unique operating environment that none of us could have predicted a year ago. The strong results in the fourth quarter highlight the strength of Nasdaq's diversified product offering and business model, which allowed us to address the needs of our clients in a unique capital markets environment, including periods of elevated trading volumes, rising benchmark index valuations and a very strong period of new listings and capital formation. Throughout the year, we also continued to invest organically and inorganically to advance our offerings, guided by our strategy to maximize opportunities as a technology and analytics provider while also investing to sustain the strong competitive position of our core marketplace foundation.  
Because of the strong performance for the year and in particular, the very strong finish in the fourth quarter, we enter 2021 with incredible momentum. We now have begun our fourth year since the 2017 announcement of our new vision for Nasdaq. Our full year results illustrate how we can deliver on our strategy and more importantly, how our disciplined client-centric focus is creating value not just for our clients but for all of our stakeholders.  
Now I'm going to turn to specific highlights from our businesses, focusing mainly on fourth quarter results. Our Investment Intelligence segment delivered $247 million in net revenue during the fourth quarter, a 27% increase from the prior year period, primarily driven by especially strong momentum in index licensing as well as positive contributions from both analytics and end market data. We set new quarterly highs in both our index revenues of $97 million and end-of-period ETP assets under management tracking Nasdaq indexes of $359 billion. 
As we noted in our Investor Day presentation, our Investment Intelligence segment has been repositioned for improved growth as we look to deepen our engagement with asset managers, asset owners and consultants and the clients from our market data and index franchises. We are diligently focused on building out this business to be the essential partner to the investment community. As we move into 2021, we're making investments to ensure these growth engines have the fuel to continue performing in the long term. For example, we're progressing our alternative investment workflow and data platform for asset owners with new capabilities coupled with our integration with Solovis, and we will continue to advance our expansion of our increasingly popular indexes and trusted data products to new clients in new geographies.  
Turning next to our Market Technology segment. We delivered $106 million in total net revenues for the fourth quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year period. This was driven by higher SaaS revenues and changes in foreign exchange rates while revenues from market infrastructure operator projects stayed -- remained flat. 
Over the course of 2020, I'm pleased to report Market Technology welcomed 29 new customers, of which 25 chose our SaaS products. As we stated in the previous investor calls, service implementations, change request projects, new order intake levels from our traditional market operator clients and funding for new markets initiatives have been adversely impacted by pandemic-related factors.  
In the second half of 2020, we have taken actions, in particular dedicating more resources, to mitigate project delays and to better deliver for our customers. 
In a communication to our investors issued on January 12, we noted in one particular project, specifically an on-premise enterprise software delivery of a complex post-trade clearing and settlement solution for an exchange group, changes to our implementation timing and expected costs resulting in a significant discrete $25 million expense for the period. The expense resulted from taking a onetime reserve to reflect the expected losses on the approximately 13-year fixed price contract. The need for a reserve resulted from an updated detailed review of the implementation project with the client and with our internal technology and finance teams. We expect an increased implementation spend from higher resourcing for the project and a longer project duration due partly to the aforementioned COVID-related impacts but also due to a prior underappreciation of this one project's unique demand. While some of the issues are very specific to this one project, we will apply what we've learned to ensure future contracts fit with the profitability objectives of the Market Technology business. 
As we examine the broader Market Technology business with our market infrastructure operator clients, we are starting to see improved sales opportunities as we exit 2020. However, we have not seen a full recovery to a pre-COVID sales environment. Both new and existing market infrastructure operator clients recognize that we're operating in a unique period with unusually elongated sales cycles, but we are -- they are engaging with us with incrementally more energy in the last few months to move forward with new projects and system upgrades. Additionally, our buy-side and sell-side technology business, led by our SaaS-based trade execution and trade surveillance offerings, maintained strong momentum throughout 2020 with 13% revenue growth for the full year, and we enter 2021 with a position of strength in this segment of our business.  
During the fourth quarter, we also announced an agreement to acquire Verafin, which provides more than 2,000 financial institutions in North America with a cloud-based platform to detect, investigate and report money laundering and financial fraud. A statistic from the United Nations notes that up to $2 trillion in laundered money flows through the financial system every year. As criminals continue to find sophisticated methods for moving funds undetected, robust advanced anti-money laundering technology have become essential for financial institutions. 
Once closed, Verafin will complement Nasdaq's established regtech leadership to create a global SaaS leader focused on the $13 billion market for anti-financial crime technology solutions. Our long-term mission together with Verafin is to become the market-leading provider of anti-financial crime technology. Despite the challenges we faced in Market Technology in 2020, we remain highly confident in our strategy and on our ability to execute against new opportunities going forward.  
Moving to our foundational marketplace businesses. Our Market Services segment delivered net revenues of $291 million during the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 29% from the prior year period. This area of our business maintained its strong competitive position across both the United States and Europe while our U.S. options business set a new quarterly trading volume record.  
The record fourth quarter helped make 2020 the most active year for options trading ever, averaging 27.7 million contracts traded a day, a 58% increase over 2019. Nasdaq led the industry in multiply listed options for the 11th year in a row. In fact, for the first time, Nasdaq was the largest options marketplace platform in the country for the year, including trading both index options and multiply listed options. Meanwhile, our European equities exchange complex set a new 10-year high on on-exchange market share in 2020. 
Finally, our Corporate Platform segment delivered revenue of $144 million in the fourth quarter, a 12% increase, boosted by particularly strong IPO and private market activity in our listings business as well as increased demand for our IR intelligence, ESG services and board portal offerings. Our team successfully adapted all elements of the IPO process to a virtual environment, and as a result, for the eighth consecutive year, Nasdaq led the United States exchanges for IPOs in 2020 with 316, capitalizing on an incredibly busy year for new issues and with a 67% overall IPO win rate, including an 83% win rate for operating companies and a 53% win rate for SPACS.  
Also for the second year in a row, Nasdaq ranked #1 in the U.S. in terms of IPO capital raised with $80.9 billion, representing 52% of the industry total. The fourth quarter was particularly strong in terms of activity. We welcomed 142 IPOs, and this momentum has carried into 2021 with a particularly busy January.  
Meanwhile, our Nordic, Baltic and First North exchanges continue to attract new companies from across Europe, adding 67 new listings, including 45 IPOs in 2020. We also had 20 new companies switch their corporate listings to Nasdaq, including American Electric Power, AstraZeneca and Keurig Dr Pepper. These 20 transfers represent an aggregate $282 billion in global equity market capitalization.  
Across the entire Nasdaq listing business in both the U.S. and the Nordics, our corporate issuer count rose 8% in 2020, setting us up in a strong position as we begin 2021. On the private company side, our Nasdaq Private Market business set a new record for annual volume in 2020, facilitating 90 private company liquidity programs, and with the fourth quarter -- and the fourth quarter was particularly busy with 49 transactions completed on the platform, a new quarterly record. Demand for our IR intelligence and governance solutions, particularly our ESG-related technology and consultative tools, drove growth in our IR ESG services subsegment, which saw an 8% increase in the fourth quarter. And lastly, during the period, we filed a new U.S. listing proposal with the SEC that seeks to standardize Board-level diversity disclosures, coupled with a recommended minimum diversity standard through a have-or-explain framework. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks today, 2020 represented an important year regarding the progress we've made on our strategic journey. As we continue on that path, I would like to reiterate the core ambitions we outlined at our Investor Day in November. In Market Technology, our core ambition is to be the trusted market technology and anti-financial crime technology partner, and our key 2021 initiatives for this segment are to deploy and drive adoption of SaaS market technology solutions and to enhance our anti-financial crime business through the combination with Verafin. In Investment Intelligence, our core ambition is to be the essential partner to the investment community, and our key 2021 initiatives are to offer a full-service alternative workflow platform for asset owners and to accelerate the expansion of indexes and cloud-delivered data services to new clients and new geographies. 
In Corporate Platforms, our core ambition is to be the leading provider of capital market solutions to corporates, and our key 2021 initiatives are to expand Nasdaq's share of U.S. corporate listing and to establish the leading end-to-end corporate ESG reporting workflow tool to complement our IR and governance solutions. Lastly, in Market Services, our core ambition is to be the preeminent market operator for equities and equity derivatives in the U.S. and Europe. And our key 2021 initiatives are to continue to implement our multiyear migration of our derivatives markets to our next-generation platform, increasingly leveraging the cloud; and to expand our suite of distinctive equity and equity derivatives trading products and solutions. We look forward to updating you on our progress on these ambitions in the quarters to come.  
As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that our fourth quarter produced solid results for Nasdaq, completing a successful 2020 for our company. Moving forward into 2021, we remain relentlessly focused on advancing our strategic pivot to maximize opportunities as a technology and data analytics provider while maintaining segment leadership in our foundational marketplace businesses in the U.S. and Europe. 
We will officially celebrate Nasdaq's 50th anniversary next month. As we near this important milestone in our corporate history, I remain confident that we are moving the company in the right direction as we build upon the strong momentum generated last year.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Michael in a moment to review the financial details for his final earnings call before handing the mantle to Ann at the end of February. While we spent some time on our last earnings call and our Investor Day reflecting on Michael's incredible career here at Nasdaq and at TMX, on this occasion of Michael's 73rd consecutive and final earnings call, I would like to thank Michael for his tremendous service to Nasdaq. We will miss him greatly, but we are well prepared for his transition as Ann Dennison steps into the role of CFO and Jeremy Skule  expands his responsibilities to become our new Chief Strategy Officer.  
Now over to you, Michael."

I will start by reviewing fourth quarter revenue performance as shown on Page 3 of the presentation and organic revenue growth on Pages 4 and 14. The $142 million increase in reported net revenue of $788 million is a net result of organic growth of $126 million, including a 27% organic increase in Market Services and a 16% organic increase in the Solutions segment; a $3 million positive impact from acquisitions; and a $13 million positive impact from favorable changes in foreign exchange rates.  
I will now review quarterly highlights within each of the reporting segments. I'll start with Investment Intelligence revenue, which increased $53 million or 27%. Organic revenue growth during the period was 25%, primarily reflecting very strong growth in our Index business and positive contributions from each of the Market Data and Analytics businesses.  
Annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $560 million and increased 9% compared to the prior year period. As a reminder, revenues related to index AUM and futures trading are not included in the ARR definition. Fourth quarter 2020 operating margin of 65% increased 4 percentage points compared to the prior year period while the full year 2020 margin of 64% rose 1 percentage point versus 2019.  
Now looking forward to the first quarter of 2021 for Index. Trading activity of instruments licensed to our indexes achieved certain thresholds earlier in the year that triggered an increase in licensing economics in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. While the confidentiality of our index agreements limits the detail we can provide on this, what we can say is that as we begin 2021, the economics of some of the agreements reset for the new year, and this will lead to approximately $7 million of lower revenue in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. This assumes similar trading activity and product mix in the 2 periods. 
Turning to Market Technology. Revenue increased $8 million or 8%. Organic revenue growth totaled $4 million or 4%, and there was a positive $4 million impact from changes in foreign exchange. The organic increase was driven primarily by higher SaaS revenues.  
ARR was $283 million and increased 9% compared to the prior year period. The operating margin was a negative 1% in the period and was impacted by the previously mentioned $25 million reserve related to the expected loss on the market technology implementation project. Excluding the reserve, the operating margin was 23% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 24% in the prior year period and 16% for the full year 2020, unchanged from 2019.  
Corporate Platforms revenues increased $15 million or 12%. Organic revenue growth totaled $13 million or 10%, and there was a $2 million positive impact from changes in foreign exchange. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in U.S. listings revenues, increases in ESG services revenues and growth in Nasdaq Private Market.  
ARR was $470 million and increased 9% compared to the prior year period. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the operating margin of 31% for the segment was down from 35% in the prior year period. The decrease in the operating margin was primarily due to higher variable compensation and marketing expenses during the period in support of the very strong IPO activity. For the full year 2020, the Corporate Platforms' operating margin was 36%, unchanged from 2019. 
Market Services net revenues increased $66 million or 29%. The organic revenue increase was $60 million or 27%, and there was a $6 million impact from changes in foreign exchange. The organic increase during the period primarily reflects increases in cash equities and U.S. equities derivatives net revenues due to higher industry trading volumes. For the fourth quarter of 2020, Market Services operating margin of 61% increased 6 percentage points from 55% in the prior year period and full year 2020 margin of 62% was 5 percentage points higher than 2019, each comparison reflecting strong operating leverage on the higher trading revenues.  
Now earlier today, Nasdaq Clearing received the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority's or SFSA's decision following their supervisory review initiated after the member default following the extreme market movement on our Nordic commodities market in September of 2018. The SFSA decided to issue a warning and an administrative fine of approximately $36 million. Nasdaq Clearing has been cooperating throughout the investigation with the regulator and maintains a constructive working relationship with the SFSA.  
Immediately following the event and independent of the SFSA review, Nasdaq Clearing launched a comprehensive enhancement program to strengthen the resilience and robustness of the clearinghouse. We are comfortable that the program effectively addresses the observations made by the SFSA in their review. While the SFSA recognized the changes made by the clearinghouse, our initial review indicates that the findings appear to be disproportionate to the severity and impact of the incident and to the size of the commodities business that the clearinghouse serves. We are continuing to review the decision and evaluating our legal options, and we'll communicate any next steps to our members and the broader public in due course.  
Now turning to Pages 9 and 14 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $71 million to $406 million. The increase reflects a $53 million or 16% organic increase, inclusive of the $25 million reserve related to Market Technology. Excluding the reserve, the organic increase was $28 million or 8% as compared to the total organic revenue growth of 20%. The increase was also due to a $6 million increase from the impact of acquisitions and a $12 million increase from the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. 
As noted in our January 12 press release, the full year 2020 non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.41 billion were above the high end of our prior guidance range due to 3 primary factors: first, higher performance compensation and variable expenses related to higher-than-expected fourth quarter 2020 revenues associated with elevated trading volumes, a quarterly record in assets under management and licensed ETPs and a multi-decade high in the number of Nasdaq IPOs; second, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates; and third, the $25 million reserve related to the expected loss on a Market Technology implementation project.  
On that last item, I will spend a moment explaining the accounting aspect of the reserve. The accounting for highly customized software system delivery contracts, such as certain of our Market Technology contracts, requires us to record a loss in the quarter when it becomes probable that costs will exceed future revenues from the contract. During the fourth quarter, as part of our regular review of significant implementation projects, we refined and revised our plans relating to a large-scale post-trade clearing implementation project for a specific client. In that process, it became probable that we would incur a loss over the remainder of that particular project in part due to the logistical implications of COVID-19. As a result, we recorded the $25 million reserve that reflects the expected loss.  
Turning to Slide 10. We are initiating our 2021 non-GAAP operating expense guidance range of $1.55 to $1.62 billion. The expense guidance range at the midpoint reflects an approximate 3% organic increase compared to 2020, excluding the $25 million reserve on the market tech contract; an additional approximate 3% increase due to changes in foreign exchange rates; as well as expenses due to the net impact of M&A. The guidance does reflect the anticipated closing of Verafin acquisition in the first quarter of 2021. 
Now moving to operating profits and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased $71 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the non-GAAP operating margin of 48% was unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the $25 million reserve, the non-GAAP operating margin would have been 52% in the fourth quarter, up 400 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of $2 million versus the prior year period. 
The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25% for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 26% for the full year 2020. For the full year of 2021, we expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be between 25% and 27%. 
non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $268 million or $1.60 per diluted share compared to $215 million or $1.29 per diluted share in the prior year period.  
Turning to Slide 11. Debt increased by $1.97 billion versus September 30, 2020, primarily due to bond issuances of $1.88 billion in December and an $89 million increase in our outstanding Eurobond book values caused by stronger euro. The proceeds of the December offering are expected to be used to partially finance the Verafin acquisition, along with additional borrowings of approximately $500 million prior to the closing of transaction. 
Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.5x, an increase from 2.4x from the third quarter of 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $81 million and repurchased common stock in the amount of $36 million. And during 2020, the company also repurchased common stock in the amount of $222 million.  
Now I'd like to provide a brief update on the acquisition of Verafin. We continue to progress through the regulatory approval process and expect Verafin to close in the first quarter of 2021. As a reminder, we are projecting in excess of $140 million in Verafin revenue for the full year of 2021. This will need to be adjusted for both the actual closing date as well as the impact of an accounting write-down of deferred revenue. We currently estimate this purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue to total $35 million, which will impact recognized revenues over the 12-month period following the close.  
The acquisition of Verafin is expected to deliver non-GAAP EPS accretion beginning in 2022 and increase thereafter. And I'll remind investors and analysts that Nasdaq's organic growth calculation reflects contributions from acquired businesses beginning 12 months after close. And as such, Verafin will be included in organic growth beginning in the first quarter of 2022.  
Finally, as Adena mentioned, this will be my 73rd consecutive and last quarterly call before retirement. I want to take a moment to thank my incredible team and outstanding colleagues for all their extensive efforts, contributions and kindness during my time here at Nasdaq. 
I also want to thank Adena for her exceptional and principled leadership. It has been an honor and an education working for Adena and our esteemed Board of Directors. I also want to express my appreciation and gratitude to you, the investors and analysts with whom I've had the pleasure and privilege of working with over the years. And I especially want to thank my family for allowing me the time to pursue my career, and I'm very much looking forward to be able to repay them some of that time, whether they want it or not, over the coming years.  
As I said on the last call, I could not be more excited that Ann will be taking hold of the CFO reins. I have so enjoyed working with her. She is a person of integrity, intelligence and initiative who I'm confident will serve this organization with excellence. And I look forward to you breaking my quarterly record as CFO of an exchange group, and I will definitely hologram into the Q2 2039 investor call when that occurs.  
And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for Q&A."

But both have deep roots in the exchange space, so I congratulate both guys.  
So my question is mainly for Michael. I didn't fully understand, I guess, the drop in revenues. I think it was for Investment Intelligence. 
But the overriding question here is really for you, Adena. It's -- when you look at the organic growth rate, I know you adjusted it up for Verafin a bit. But if you take, for example, in Investment Intelligence the 5% to 8%, we've run at 18% and 25% the last 2 quarters. Is it still -- are these ranges still reasonable for the run rates you're experiencing, especially in Investment Intelligence?"

So -- and on a comparable basis then, Q1 of 2021, if it has the same mix and the same trading activity as compared to Q4, there will be a $7 million decrease in the run rate for that, in the amount for that period in Q1. Does that answer that question?"

I think we also are seeing solid growth across Market Data and the Analytics businesses and that are more stable but also just really, really strong. So whether or not -- you're asking whether we would change our medium- to long-term outlook for the business. I think that we are maintaining our medium- to long-term outlook for the business on the back of the fact that index values can fluctuate. But I also agree that as we continue to perform and we continue to see progress in the business, we will, of course, continue to update our outlook for that business."

So on order intake, I would say that the primary driver of a lower order intake for 2020 has been the impact of the COVID situation.  
When we think about our engagement with our clients and particularly for those that are taking on some very significant projects with us, I think there are 2 things that come into play. First is the fact that many of our market infrastructure operator clients have been really, really focused on managing the capacity and resiliency in this year where they've all experienced very high volumes, and we're very proud of the fact that our technology has served them well. But they've been more focused on the here and the now, and some of the projects that they have been planning to do and planning to work with us on early in the year were temporarily put on hold. So we're starting to engage more productively with them as they start to think through the future going into 2021, but I definitely think that was part of it. 
And then the second thing is that when we're engaging with new clients -- and we did sign -- as we mentioned, we did sign 29 new clients in 2020. But it is important, in some cases, particularly with the larger ones that would drive the order intake number, that they have a lot of engagement, including in-person engagement, and that's been much harder this year. So some of those projects, again, have just had elongated sales cycles. So I think that it really has been a COVID impact on order intake primarily.  
In terms of the margin going forward, I think the way to look at that particular situation was it is an isolated situation. We have had -- actually, we've signed over the last 5 years 38 new clients that would be in a similar situation where they have very -- they have large-scale contracts. We do quarterly reviews. We have a steering board internally to track and monitor the projects, and this is the only one in which we are seeing a situation where we have a loss. 
But in that particular case, we are recognizing that loss now, which then for the remaining life of the contract means we will not recognize a loss, assuming it goes according to our expectations. I think though that -- but it doesn't necessarily accelerate the margin. It just -- it makes it so that this one isolated situation doesn't have a negative impact on the margin going forward. I hope that answers your question, Dan."

Which -- if you could just clarify if that will be included in your adjusted results and a contra revenue for '21 for Verafin and then just reiterate the top line that you mentioned for Verafin in '21.

I'll answer the listings question, and I'll turn it over to Michael for the Verafin question. 
On the listing side, I think that if you think about the key drivers of recurring revenue in that business, and much of the revenue is recurring in that business, having -- we mentioned the fact that we had a net increase of 8% in terms of total listings on that business year-over-year, which then -- if that's the exit rate, that becomes the entry rate for 2021. So -- and as you know, we collect fees annually and we collect them in the beginning of the year. So I think that that's one thing to think about in terms of the fundamental drivers of the business.  
I think the second thing is that as we look at our SaaS businesses, our IR services, particularly our IR technology and the board portal business as well as the OneReport system, those are all kind of what I will call reoccurring contracts. Many of them are multiyear. Some of them -- and many of them, of course, recur year-over-year. And so if you have a higher exit rate for last year, 2020, and therefore, you have a higher entry rate for 2021, that obviously accrues to a benefit. But you are right that there are some revenues on what we call our advisory service, including our ESG advisory services, that are project-based. And so that revenue is more that -- we might have a onetime project, we might have recurring projects, but that part of the revenue is a little less recurring. 
So hopefully, it gives you a sense of how to think about the fundamental drivers of that business as we go into 2021. Why don't we turn it over to Michael on the Verafin question."

The other thing we've said in the past is that the futures revenue can be a range of 10% to 20% of the overall. And I think that if you look at the fourth quarter, it was -- those numbers are generally accurate. And as -- obviously, every quarter, the future's revenue will fluctuate a little bit, but those types of ranges are the right way to look at it, including the fourth quarter. 
In terms of the Market Data side, I think that what we call revenue from previously unreported usage, it was up $2 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter but was actually -- was lower for the year versus 2019. And so the fact that we continued to show a nice performance in Market Data even with the lower revenues from that particular activity, I think, is a testament to the strength of the business."

So I think that if we look at the overall Market Tech business, we've got the market infrastructure operators, and then we have our banks and brokers clients. And so I think it's important, as I mentioned in my comments, that it's really in the market infrastructure operator segment that we saw a slowing of sales as well as the elongation of some of the significant projects. 
And I think that as we think about our engagement with those clients, as I mentioned also, a lot of those clients really focused much of the year on their immediate needs to make sure that they were managing capacity and resiliency and managing to current trading levels. And so if they were planning to do some enhancements or changes or upgrades, they kind of put those plans on hold. I think also, they know that as they go forward with those plans, they want to be able to have the right focus from their customers, and their customers are also dealing with these elevated trading volumes. So to put on them  an upgrade in the middle of that, I think, was also something that they were hesitant to do. 
So as we exited 2020, and we're starting to -- we are starting to see more engagement from those clients saying, ""Well, We can't put these things off forever."" And they're starting to engage with us. But I would have to say it still is not at the levels that we were experiencing before COVID at the beginning of last year. I think also some of the new markets clients that were very active and engaged with us are continuing to engage, but some of them have hit funding issues or just as they're looking at launching their products, they're waiting until a more normalized environment. So those are the things that are -- that's the color behind that. 
On the banks and brokers side though, and this actually plays into the Verafin question, we actually continue to see a nice healthy engagement, healthy growth. And also, it's a SaaS-based delivery so it's a much easier thing for the clients to take and to integrate, whether it's our surveillance or our trade execution solutions. And so they -- that business had a more -- I would say more of a normal environment as well as some increased demand particularly for surveillance as the clients went online, went to a remote setting and they had to add users to make sure that they had proper coverage. 
I think that, that then plays into the Verafin question, which is they're more aligned with the banks and brokers, where it's a SaaS-based cloud-based delivery so it's a light implementation for the client. And they continue to have a lot of engagement with banks and brokers managing through their anti-financial crime programs. So they didn't see the same level of impact as we did see at the market infrastructure operator clients, and I think that they had a solid end to the year. So we feel good about their progress and their momentum going into 2021."

And then there's always ability to make some level of adjustments.

But obviously, if there -- as you saw in the fourth quarter, where we had some increases in marketing spend and some other comp-related items, that in periods where things were to slow down, then there are certain factors that we'll adjust accordingly.

So I think that it's worth noting that of the 316 IPOs that we had last year, I believe 184 were operating companies.

And we had -- we were actually very proud of the fact we had an 82% or 83% win rate for those listings as well. And then the remainder were SPACs. And as we go into 2021, we are continuing to see a very healthy activity level in terms of listings of both operating companies and SPACs, particularly SPACs. 
But I think that when we look at our pipeline, we have a longer view of operating company potentials versus SPACs. SPACs tend to come to market quickly, tend to engage with us quickly and we don't have as much line of sight. So we probably really only have some level of understanding of the demand for SPACs in the first quarter, and then our line of sight really diminishes. I think with operating companies, we tend to have a little bit of a longer view. 
So my answer to the question is that we have a very active pipeline in both SPACs and operating companies, and I would say SPAC for the next several weeks probably and -- in terms of we just don't see beyond that. And with operating companies, we certainly see a healthy pipeline through the first half of the year, and then we'll have to see how the markets continue to develop. But as you know, the market and the performance of the market does have an impact on when companies tend to go out. So assuming a benign market environment, we should have a pretty healthy first half."

740535,708184316,2254353,"Nasdaq, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2021",2021-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Nasdaq, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's first quarter 2021 financial and business performance as well as the progress we have made executing on our strategy. I would like to begin by a",2109,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's first quarter 2021 financial and business performance as well as the progress we have made executing on our strategy. 
I would like to begin by acknowledging how deeply proud I am of the Nasdaq team's continued commitment to our clients during this period. A full year has now passed since our global workforce began working remotely, and I could not be more pleased with the first quarter results that our team has delivered to our stakeholders today. 
Our relentless client focus and Nasdaq's nimbleness allowed us to generate strong financial results for the first quarter of 2021. We also made important progress against our corporate strategy during the quarter with the completion of our acquisition of Verafin in February and the announced agreement to sell our U.S. fixed income business to Tradeweb Markets. 
Our performance during this period continues to underscore the resilience of Nasdaq's diversified product office offering and business model as well as our ability to address the needs of our clients in a rapidly changing environment. 
Now I will turn to our strong financial results for the first quarter of 2021. Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $851 million, an increase of $150 million or 21% from the prior year period, driven by 17% organic growth in our Solutions segment businesses and 17% organic growth in our Market Services business. The acquisition of Verafin and the changes in FX rates drove the remainder of the growth of the business in the quarter. 
Across our exchange businesses, the incredibly dynamic capital markets environment during the period, combined with our strong competitive positioning, resulted in record U.S. equity and options volumes in a record quarter for new listings. I'm also extremely proud of the progress we've made to continue to grow our annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, which is up 21% compared to the prior year period. This was driven by our continued focus on key secular growth opportunities that are powering our Solutions segments. We are seeing rising demand across our clientele for our solutions, including from institutional investors for analytics and workflow tools, from corporate clients for our ESG and IR solutions and from financial institutions and marketplaces for technology that helps reduce financial crime. 
Our ARR growth was also boosted by the acquisition of Verafin. The strong operating leverage of our model was evident in the results. Our non-GAAP operating margins increased to 54%, up 2 percentage points compared to the prior year. As a result, we experienced 25% increase in our non-GAAP operating income and a 31% increase in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the period. 
Turning now to the specific highlights from the quarter. I will begin with our foundational marketplace and corporate businesses. Our Market Services segment saw net revenues of $338 million, a 20% increase from the prior year period and a new quarterly revenue record for this business. This is primarily led by higher U.S. options and Cash Equities trading volumes. We're also seeing an increase in demand for trade management services connectivity solutions as clients adjust their capacity for a wider range of volume scenarios. 
Nasdaq's U.S. options market set a quarterly record of 892 million contracts traded during the period, an increase of 57%, while our U.S. equities market set a quarterly record of 153 million shares traded, an increase of 20% year-over-year. Additionally, during the period, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our U.S. fixed income business, NFI, to an affiliate of Tradeweb Markets. The decision to sell NFI aligns with our strategy to maximize our potential as a major technology and analytics provider to the global capital markets. We expect the transaction to close later in 2021, subject to customary closing conditions. 
Next, our Corporate Platform segment delivered revenues of $155 million, a 21% increase, with robust contributions across each of the product areas in that business. The business is boosted by record levels of new listing activity, material contribution from Nasdaq Private Market following a record first quarter for private company transactions and increased demand for our Investor Relations Intelligence and ESG solutions. 
In our IR and ESG services business, we are seeing consistent and growing demand for our expanded suite of products, which has been carefully designed to help our clients measure, analyze, collaborate and take positive action regarding their respective investor relations, governance and sustainability programs. For example, in our IR Intelligence unit, we saw 6 new client wins from our new expanded ESG advisory offering, a more in-depth solution that has lengthened and deepened our engagement with executive leadership teams as they seek to meet the demand from institutional investors and other stakeholders for greater clarity on their ESG strategies. And we are seeing the deeper client engagement results and continued sales momentum for our consultative IR advisory service and our Nasdaq IR Insight workflow solution, which saw a combined 36% increase in sales during the quarter. 
In our Listing segment, Nasdaq led U.S. exchanges for IPOs during the period, welcoming 275 IPOs that raised $74.4 billion, including 79 operating company IPOs and 196 SPAC IPOs. The Nasdaq stock market led U.S. exchanges with a 69% total win rate on IPOs, including a 77% win rate among operating companies and a 66% win rate among SPACs. Listing highlights from the first quarter include the IPOs of Bumble, Qualtrics, Affirm, Platica and Petco. During the quarter, Nasdaq listed 7 of the top 10 largest IPOs by capital raised. 
Companies have responded positively to our virtual IPO experience during the pandemic period, and we are excited and encouraged to see our iconic bell ceremony and IPO day experience come to life again in Times Square and in cities across the country through our unique remote bell ceremony. Highlights include going on the road during the quarter to Bumble in Texas and to Qualtrics in Utah. We look forward to welcoming our clients and capital markets partners safely to the Nasdaq MarketSite for these milestone celebrations as we start to prepare for a post-pandemic period. 
Of course, I also want to acknowledge the strong start to the second quarter in Listings with -- in particular, noting Nasdaq's successful direct listing of Coinbase, a global leader in infrastructure and technology for the crypto economy. The Coinbase listing represents the largest direct listing in history and was the largest ever initial public listing opening cross on Nasdaq. 
Now let me turn to our Market Technology and Investment Intelligence businesses. Our Market Technology segment delivered $100 million in revenues, including a partial period contribution from the Verafin acquisition, which we completed in February. Our annualized recurring revenue for the quarter was $416 million, a 62% increase year-over-year, including a 10% increase from our existing business and an additional $134 million representing the annualized total of Verafin's first quarter subscription revenues irrespective of the closing date or the temporary impact of the write-down of deferred revenues. 
To give you more transparency in how different parts of Market Technology are operating and progressing going forward, we have started to report our revenues from this segment of our business in 2 groups. The first is called Marketplace Infrastructure Technology, which will comprise our solutions for the full trade life cycle to market infrastructure operators, banks and brokers and nonfinancial market operators. And the second is called Anti-Financial Crime Technology, our offerings providing surveillance, risk management and Verafin's anti-money laundering and fraud detection solutions. 
As we stated in previous investor calls, there are certain areas of our Market Technology business that have been adversely impacted by the pandemic-related factors, largely in the Marketplace Infrastructure Technology business. And while the environment continues to be characterized by the logistical challenges to implementations and lengthen sales cycles, the actions we took last year to respond to those dynamics are resulting in stabilized but moderated revenue growth in the near term, albeit with short-term impact to segment profitability. More importantly, our longer-term vision for Market Technology remains on track as demonstrated by the progress we've been delivering in new sales and revenues from SaaS products and services, in particular, our anti-financial crime technology solutions. Excluding the impact of Verafin, SaaS revenues within all of Market Technology increased 15% year-over-year. 
Turning to our Investment Intelligence segment. We delivered net revenues of $258 million, up $47 million or 22% from the prior year period. Overall, assets under management and ETP's benchmark to Nasdaq's indexes totaled $385 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 87% from the prior year period and a new quarterly record. Additionally, trading of futures and options on futures contracts tracking Nasdaq indexes increased 31% year-over-year. 
I'm also pleased to see increasing adoption of some of our recent product innovations. In particular, AUM and the Invesco QQQ Innovation suite built on their strong review in the fourth quarter of 2020 and now stands at approximately $2 billion in AUM in just 5 months after launch, making this one of the most successful new launches for NASDAQ's Index business. 
Our Analytics business delivered revenues of $48 million, an increase of $7 million or 17% from the prior year period. Led by eVestment and Solovis, this business experienced strong -- increased growth in the first quarter due to improvement in both new users and retention compared to the prior year period. On a sequential basis, new sales were up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting both a rebound in institutional investment industry demand following some temporary contraction in 2020 as well as increased realizations of the synergies between eVestment and Solovis as the combination helped drive 28 new accounts to Solovis in the first quarter. These results underscore our strategy to create comprehensive WorkSpace solutions for investment managers and institutional asset owners from precommitment diligence to postcommitment portfolio tracking and secondary trades. 
Lastly, within Investment Intelligence, our Market Data revenues rose 11%, driven primarily by expanding international demand for our proprietary data products. As I wrap up, I would like to reiterate that Nasdaq remains diligently focused on serving the unique needs of our clients while we advance our strategic mission to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead of us. 
At our Investor Day in November, we articulated that our diversified business model was designed to provide us with the resiliency to drive disciplined growth across a variety of backdrops. Our recent success, especially in the first quarter, underscores the power of the Nasdaq platform and highlights that the strategy underpinning our repositioned franchise is resonating with our clients as we continue to reallocate capital to higher growth opportunities while maintaining leadership in our marketplace core. This focus has also resulted in many new instances of dynamic collaboration across our businesses, be it new product innovations or bringing advanced technology solutions to help our clients solve major industry challenges. 
For example, in our Anti-Financial Crime Technology segment, we're very excited about the work that we can do together with Verafin. This includes the potential for new client opportunities given our strong relationships with Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks as the Verafin team continues to build out their solutions to increase confidence in the global financial system. Additionally, we are pleased to support their international expansion, especially into Europe where Verafin has just landed its first client. 
Another great example is the intersection of our Listings and Index businesses. Listing the next generation of innovators, including many of the largest IPOs that have come to Nasdaq in the recent years, creates strong synergies to drive new product development in collaboration with our Index business. For example, The strength and success of our flagship Nasdaq 100 Index and our partnership with Invesco laid the groundwork for a recent launch of the Invesco Innovation Suite, including the Invesco Nasdaq Next Generation 100 ETF. Comprised of the 101st to the 200th largest nonfinancial companies listed on Nasdaq, the Nasdaq Next Gen 100 Index has been one of the fastest-growing ETFs that we've ever launched with a partner and includes companies such as Etsy and Roku as well as many of the fastest-growing enterprise technology and health care companies listed on our market. 
As I look back at this quarter, I could not be prouder of the performance across the business. We officially celebrated Nasdaq's 50th anniversary in February. And given our rich history as a technology pioneer, I remain confident that we are moving Nasdaq in the right direction for many years to come. And with that, I will turn it over to Ann to review our financial results in greater detail."
740535,708184316,2254353,"Nasdaq, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2021",2021-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Nasdaq, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our pre",1734,"Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the financial section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. 
I will start by reviewing first quarter revenue performance as shown on Page 3 of the presentation and organic revenue growth on Pages 4 and 14. The $150 million increase in reported net revenue of $851 million is the net result of: organic growth of $118 million, including 17% organic increase in both Market Services and Solutions segment; a $14 million positive impact from acquisitions; and an $18 million impact from changes in FX rates. 
I will now review quarterly highlights within each of our reporting segments. I'll start with Investment Intelligence revenue, which increased $47 million or 22%. Organic revenue growth during the period was 20%, reflecting very strong growth in our Index business as well as strong contributions from both the Market Data and Analytics businesses. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $542 million and increased 13% compared to the prior year period. AUM and ETPs licensed to Nasdaq Indices rose 87% year-over-year to $385 billion, including a 25% increase from net inflows and a 62% increase from changes in market impact. 
On Page 19 of the presentation, you'll find our new disclosure on net flow contribution to the year-over-year change in AUM. The segment operating margin of 65% increased 1 percentage point compared to the prior year period. Market Technology revenue increased $19 million or 23%. The increase reflects organic revenue growth of $3 million or 4%, $12 million from the acquisition of Verafin, which closed mid-quarter, and a $4 impact million from the changes in FX rates. Excluding a temporary $7 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue associated with the closing of the Verafin transaction, Verafin revenues would have totaled $19 million for the partial quarter period following the February 11, 2021, close. 
On Slide 10, we show the runoff of the remaining $23 million purchase price adjustment on Verafin's deferred revenue. The $3 million organic increase in Market Tech was driven primarily by higher SaaS-based Anti-Financial Crime Technology revenues, in particular, from our market and trade surveillance products. ARR for Market Technology was $416 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 62% compared to the prior year period, largely due to the Verafin acquisition. Excluding Verafin, Market Technology ARR increased 10% in the period. 
In addition to the new Market Technology reporting Adena mentioned earlier, we are supplementing this with another revenue breakdown, disclosing the recurring subscription SaaS and support licensing revenues as well as the nonrecurring professional services contributions to help investors and analysts track our progress as we continue to expand the SaaS contribution across both our Market Infrastructure Technology and Anti-Financial Crime Technology businesses. The segment operating margin was a negative 2%, but would have been a positive 5% when excluding the noncash purchase price adjustment related to Verafin deferred revenue. The 5% margin is not a level that we believe reflects the potential of the business. And we continue to feel optimistic about our ambition for a margin that supports Market Technology being a Rule 40 business in 2023 and beyond. 
While the impact of the Verafin purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue is temporary and will be eliminated over the next 4 quarters, on a core basis, 2 main factors will drive our margin expansion over the coming years. First, our mix of SaaS subscription revenues within Market Technology is increasing significantly. Looking ahead, we expect it to continue to grow as we execute our strategy. This is critical because our SaaS businesses have approximately 2 to 3x the average contribution margin of the on-premise solutions. Second, we accelerated hiring in certain areas of our Market Technology business in recent quarters and on a temporary basis, allocated more of our existing resources to relatively low-margin installation work, in particular, in the most complex and on-premise clearing solutions. We expect the margin impact to gradually diminish over the coming years. 
Corporate Platform revenues increased $27 million or 21%. Organic revenue growth totaled $24 million or 19%, and there was a $3 million impact from changes in FX rates. The organic revenue increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. Listings revenues due to an increase in IPOs and higher Nasdaq Private Market revenues, together with an increase in both IR and ESG advisory services revenue. 
Nasdaq Private Market revenues were about $6 million to $7 million higher than the average quarterly run rate of 2020. And while this business has averaged an over 40% CAGR in the last 3 years, we would expect to see at least $5 million in sequential decline in 2Q '21 from NPM's particularly strong first quarter. 
Corporate Platform's ARR was $487 million and increased 12% compared to the prior year period. The segment operating margin of 42% increased 7 percentage points compared to the prior year period and was driven by both of the unusually strong activity on the Nasdaq Private Market as well as from the substantial increase in the listed issuer base. 
Market Services net revenues increased $57 million or 20%. The organic revenue increase was $48 million or 17%, and there was a $9 million impact from changes in FX rates. The organic increase during the period primarily reflects increases in cash equities and equity derivative net revenues due to higher industry trading volumes and an increase in trade management services revenues. The segment operating margin of 67% increased 4 percentage points from the prior year period, reflecting strong operating leverage on record trading revenues. 
Turning to Pages 9 and 14 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $57 million to $393 million. The increase reflects a $24 million or 7% organic increase, an $18 million increase from the impact of acquisitions and a $15 million increase from the impact of changes in FX rates. The organic growth in expenses reflects the sum of: one, relatively consistent low single-digit percentage increase related to hiring and wage inflation; two, higher compensation expense as variable performance-linked compensation increased, reflecting the company's outstanding growth; and three, costs related to what has been an incredibly active capital markets backdrop. For example, costs related to increasing our trading capacity as well as marketing commitments supporting the extraordinary number of IPO wins in recent periods. 
Turning to Slide 10. We are narrowing our 2021 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.57 billion to $1.62 billion to reflect strong and broad-based organic revenue growth in the first quarter and the impact that growth has on variable expenses like performance-based compensation and marketing commitments. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, overall, if performance continues to be strong, we would expect to come in at the high end of the expense guidance range. In addition, we expect the year-over-year organic growth in expenses to be elevated, particularly in 2Q '21 compared to 2Q '20 as the prior year period had a significant reduction in travel and other in-office activity due to the onset of the pandemic as well as lower new listing activity and less performance-based compensation due to the uncertain financial environment in 2Q '20. 
Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased $93 million in the first quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 54% increased 2 percentage points year-over-year. Net interest expense was $28 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $4 million compared to the prior year period due to incremental interest expense related to the financing of the Verafin acquisition. Consistent with our reporting practice, interest expense related to acquisition financing that was incurred prior to the mid-quarter close of the transaction was excluded from non-GAAP results for this quarter. And therefore, an incremental $3 million to $4 million of Verafin -- $3 million to $4 million of Verafin-related interest expense will be reflected in the second quarter results. 
The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24% for the first quarter of 2021, which includes a benefit related to the vesting of certain equity awards. For the full year 2021, we still expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 27%. And barring any changes in the corporate tax landscape, we expect to come in near the bottom end of the range for the year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the first quarter of 2021 was $327 million or $1.96 per diluted share compared to $251 million or $1.50 per diluted share in the prior year period. 
Turning to Slide 11. Debt increased by $349 million versus 4Q '20 primarily due to net issuances of $435 million of commercial paper used to fund a portion of the Verafin acquisition, partially offset by an $87 million decrease in the book values of our eurobonds caused by changes in FX rates. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.4x, a decrease from 3.5x in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
During the first quarter of 2021, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $81 million and repurchased common stock in the amount of $162 million. Today, we're announcing a 10% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.54 per share. Additionally, during the first quarter, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the share repurchase program of an additional $1 billion, subject to the closing of the sale of our U.S. fixed income business and acceleration of the issuance of Nasdaq common stock related to the sale. As previously communicated, we intend to use the proceeds from the sale as well as available tax benefits, working and clearing capital of the business and other sources to repurchase shares in order to offset EPS dilution. We continue to expect the sale to be temporarily 2% dilutive to non-GAAP EPS in the 12-month period following the close, and we see immaterial dilution in periods thereafter. Overall, the actions taken during the first quarter support Nasdaq's accelerated evolution and allow the company to further concentrate its resources on technology, analytics and ESG opportunities.

On your -- related to your question on Market Tech margins, as we look forward to 2023 and our ambitions of achieving the Rule of 40 for the overall Market Tech, we think the primary way we're going to get there is through revenue growth. Part of that will be bringing Verafin on board. And then then the other 2 things I'd point to is we should look to -- we're going to continue to expand our SaaS offerings. We talked about the growth in our SaaS business and the fact that our SaaS businesses come at higher contribution margins. So as we continue to expand there, we'll see an impact on the margins. 
And then the last thing that I'd mention is just that we do have some incremental costs now to deliver on some of our larger, more complex projects. We've added costs, and we expect them to gradually decline over time. So when you put those 3 things together, we expect to achieve that Rule of 40 in 2023. And I think I'll just bring it back. It's just important to note that we are confident in the prospects of this business and our ability to be successful here."

Well, I think that really when you look at the revenue performance in the Listings business, it is on the back of 3 very strong years of new listings, which, of course, gets us to a new annualized recurring rate of Listing revenue. We had over, I guess, in 2019, we had 189 IPOs. In 2020, we had over, I think, 314 IPOs. And then this year already, we've had [ 275] IPOs. 
You are right, though, with the SPAC listings, it's a little different. They -- first of all, they tend to come in at the capital market because they want to pay the lowest possible fees. So contributions from SPAC, if we look at overall SPAC annual listing revenue is only about 5% of our total Listing revenues. So it is -- it's not a huge contributor And of course, when they do combine with companies, then we have the opportunity to bring that company into Nasdaq as an operating company, and that tends to accrue to a higher fee rate. So there's a lot of opportunity from the SPACs as they make those combinations to increase our revenue contribution. But it also has a pretty limited risk in terms of if the facts are not able to find operating companies they want to combine with. 
But generally speaking, Alex, it's just -- I think it's kind of the compounding effect of multiple years where we've been winning the majority of IPOs and frankly, the vast majority of operating company IPOs. And it's just been a favorable environment for us to be able to bring a lot of new companies to market. So I think it's a combination of all those things. And I should mention also, we had 32 new listings in the Nordics in the first quarter as well. And so that's really bucking the trend in Europe. And we continue to see a lot of strength in our Nordic business as well."

If there's anything that we should be thinking about or even as we think about the rest of the year? 
And related to that, you've noted that you continue to see a little bit of pressure within the Market Tech basket as a result of the pandemic that hasn't entirely gone away. So just any color as to -- if I think about the legacy business ex Verafin, thinking about the 8% to 11% organic growth rate, if you think about 2021, is that still a feasible and reasonable kind of growth rate? Again, I know it's more of a medium-term rate. But if we think about 2021, when we think about the legacy business, is that 8%, 11-ish percent still a receivable rate given some of the headwinds and pressures that you're seeing in the business?"

On the anti-financial crime side, it is largely a SaaS-oriented business. There are -- so we think about what we put into the anti-financial crime subsegment are the surveillance solutions to markets. Some of those are still on-prem, but they are long-term license revenues, not a lot of project-related costs because that's a pretty -- a more standardized service. Then you have the SaaS business related to the surveillance for our trading firms, and it's all SaaS. And then you have the risk management solutions to both markets and broker-dealers. And there, that has both a combination of on-prem and SaaS solutions. And then lastly, you have Verafin, which is entirely a SaaS business with very low professional fees. So generally speaking, it's -- what you're seeing in the quarter is a relatively recurring element of kind of what the potential of the business is. 
As I mentioned before, we did have 10% growth in our anti-financial crime business, absent Verafin. So We continue to see really strong demand for all of those solutions. I think that in terms of the overall growth rate for Market Tech absent Verafin, as we mentioned, the Market Infrastructure Technology part of the business has been more materially impacted by the pandemic. And we are still in a pandemic. So we're still not able to go visit clients. These are generally and oftentimes, particularly for new clients, these are large-scale decisions that they're making to have us partner with them to build and support them in their core business technologies. So they tend to be sales cycles that result from relationships, and it's harder to establish and manage those relationships if we can't visit our clients. So that is still the case because of the pandemic. 
However, having said that, our existing clients, they really spent last year focusing on managing the very high-volume environment and a pretty dynamic capital markets environment as well. As they come into 2021, we are having more constructive conversations with them around thinking longer term again, thinking about how they want to continue to advance their technology. So we're certainly seeing encouraging signs of working with our clients. But as I said in my comments, we would expect that the short-term growth rates on that part of the business would be -- will be moderated. And -- but over time, we're not changing our medium- to long-term outlook on the overall business because we have confidence it will recover."

The investment management community and the asset owners were also dealing with a lot of change in a very dynamic environment. They weren't sure whether this is going to be a sustainable market trend. And so they were -- they really pulled back on buying decisions around any sort of analytical tools. So -- but what we're seeing, as we've mentioned in the first quarter, is that we maintain those conversations and relationships. We definitely -- I think through our all-in pricing model that we shifted to in 2019 really had helped us actually retain a lot of clients in 2020. And therefore, now going into 2021, we're seeing that investment managers and asset owners are back in the market to really find ways to, frankly, manage these very dynamic portfolios. So -- and we've also done more to create a more all-in solution, particularly for asset owners across the investment. So we're seeing a lot of nice upswing now coming into 2021 off the back of a pretty impact on 2020. 
I think Market Tech, as we mentioned, particularly the Market Infrastructure Technology is the other area that's been impacted. And then across the rest of it, I would say that it's -- and actually, I would say somewhat in the governance area on the governance platform solutions. We -- it's harder -- we do a lot of work there. But again, I think a lot of corporates we're dealing with downturns. We're dealing with a lot of challenges. And so it was a harder sales environment for that team as well last year. And we're starting to see some recovery there as well. But that would be another area where we hope that we would have some more pickup in 2021 and beyond."

And then there'll be point solutions and other innovations that come in on top of that, that we should be in a position either to acquire or integrate or partner with to make it so that we can continue to manage the dynamic needs of our clients.

And I would say, many are on-prem solutions that are not nearly as nimble or flexible, which is what I think Verafin has been very successful at displacing in recent years as well as a lot of internal build, particularly for the larger banks, the internal build. And then at the very smallest end, there are a lot of small point solutions providers that Verafin also competes very successfully against.

I think that it's great to have a leader within the SEC that really understands markets and market structure. So he is certainly a market structure expert. In terms of the priorities, I think on the back of some of the retail trading trends and the hearings that happened in Washington, I do believe this will be a focus area for the SEC, and they're already working on a kind of a white paper thought piece around it to go out and get comments and input from the industry. 
When it comes to -- part of that is a discussion of the dark trading. Because when you look at the composition of the markets in the U.S., almost -- it's like 40% to 50%. It's like, I would say, 45% or so of the trading today is done in the dark, and the vast majority of that is retail. So that means that the retail orders are not getting exposed to the exchanges and they're not, therefore, contributing to price discovery. 
And therefore, then you have to sit there and say, well, do we have the best reflection of price discovery if only half the market is being exposed and displayed? So I think, Ken, it is an area of focus for us. It's one of several things that we -- I think that the SEC and us and others will be focused on as we look at how to continue to make market structure improvements. One of the great things about this business, honestly, Ken, as you know, it's like kind of an internal learning curve. It's one of the things that keeps me so interested, and it's just fascinating to see how the markets evolve. But as we continue to evolve those markets, I think that some focus areas that we think will be important are to look at settlement cycles to see if we can go from T+2 to T+1 as well as to look at the margin calculation process and giving people a little bit more clarity as to the margin obligations.
The second is onshore sale disclosure. We do believe that long positions are disclosed, short positions are not, and it just seems like an unfortunate asymmetry. And then the third is on market structure and trying to level the playing field between exchanges and off-exchange players, but not in a way that's unnatural, but in a way that just allows us all to compete successfully. And one of those examples would be minimum tick sizes and minimum trade sizes and things like that, but that's one of several things that we would want to have the SEC consider."

I think that we should recognize that more and more companies are seeing -- more and more private companies are seeing NPM as a good way for them to manage long-term liquidity needs of their employees and our investors without having to bring themselves to the public markets or ahead of bringing themselves to the public markets, where, as you mentioned, with Coinbase, having some of that liquidity done in the private markets ahead of time, kind of position them really well for their direct listing and gave them an investor base that they could walk into their direct listing with in a way that was very sustainable and strong. And so I think that would be a good example of how companies, I think, increasingly are using the private markets as a kind of a lead-in into a direct listing. And we see that as a really encouraging sign for our business and for the relationships we have with our companies. I think the crypto space is a good question, Owen, as to whether more crypto-oriented companies will be coming into the public markets on the back of Coinbase and whether or not they also would choose that path. And if that's the case, then I think the Nasdaq Private Market is a natural way for them to manage that private liquidity ahead of an IPO."

The way I look at the crypto markets and the overall cryptocurrency economy is that it's in a very -- it's still in a very early stage. And that's great because I think we've seen this really elegant construct come into the ecosystem in terms of what the blockchain and what you can do with it. You're seeing now some really interesting intangible applications of it that have been more geared up until recently towards retail. But now you're starting to see institutional players recognizing that this is -- and a contract that really could become part of mainstream commerce. So it's that classic product life cycle that's really starting to develop. And you're seeing where all the early experimentations turn to early businesses turn into a proliferation of businesses now are turning into I would say, more concentrated, but still very, very early life cycle type of companies emerging. And so it does give us time to -- for us to figure out the right path for us. As you mentioned, our initial involvement in crypto has been with our technology, and that's been really great. We are partners with several crypto markets on their surveillance and their technology. And that's one of the big concerns with crypto has been around making sure that the markets are fair for all participants. And so our technology is highly relevant there. Managing trading and, frankly, the scalability of trading that they've had to deal with, our systems are designed for scale. So I think that, that also really gives us some real advantage. And then we actually have launched with a partner, a crypto index, and we've turned that into investable products outside the U.S. And we're hoping with a second partner to kind of hopefully bring that into the U.S. in coming months. So we do have some really interesting ways for us to participate in the crypto space, but we're still evaluating what should our long-term role be? And how will the markets evolve? And obviously, there are some great winners, including Coinbase, of course, in terms of developing the marketplaces of the future."

And so $50 million a year, 5 years later. So make sure it's clear. But I think that we obviously are quite encouraged by the fact that we've had some really great adoption of our ESG solutions by companies. We also have actually incorporated our ESG solutions into our IPO package now. So we'll get more and more companies adopting them, and that gives us longer-term revenue opportunity with them as well. 
And we do obviously think that this is a trend that is here to stay. It's something that we believe will drive a lot of corporate decision-making in the future, and we want to be that partner to the corporates to help them navigate this landscape. The business that we have launched and the services we offer are as popular in the U.S. as they are in Europe. So we already have -- I would say we've had really good adoption of the products in the U.S. But in Europe, we've had -- it's more mature. And so there's more -- we had more sustainable bond listings and other capital listings that also we support in Europe in addition to helping our clients through standard setting and reporting, et cetera. So I think that it's an interesting and dynamic space, and it's one we're quite encouraged by."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's first quarter 2021 financial and business performance as well as the progress we have made executing on our strategy. I would like to begin by a",2113,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's first quarter 2021 financial and business performance as well as the progress we have made executing on our strategy. 
I would like to begin by acknowledging how deeply proud I am of the Nasdaq team's continued commitment to our clients during this period. A full year has now passed since our global workforce began working remotely, and I could not be more pleased with the first quarter results that our team has delivered to our stakeholders today. 
Our relentless client focus and Nasdaq's nimbleness allowed us to generate strong financial results for the first quarter of 2021. We also made important progress against our corporate strategy during the quarter with the completion of our acquisition of Verafin in February and the announced agreement to sell our U.S. Fixed Income business to Tradeweb Markets.
Our performance during this period continues to underscore the resilience of Nasdaq's diversified product office offering and business model as well as our ability to address the needs of our clients in a rapidly changing environment.
Now I will turn to our strong financial results for the first quarter of 2021. Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $851 million, an increase of $150 million or 21% from the prior year period, driven by 17% organic growth in our Solutions segment businesses and 17% organic growth in our Market Services business. The acquisition of Verafin and the changes in FX rates drove the remainder of the growth of the business in the quarter.
Across our exchange businesses, the incredibly dynamic capital markets environment during the period, combined with our strong competitive positioning, resulted in record U.S. equity and options volumes in a record quarter for new listings. I'm also extremely proud of the progress we've made to continue to grow our annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, which is up 21% compared to the prior year period. This was driven by our continued focus on key secular growth opportunities that are powering our Solutions segments. We are seeing rising demand across our clientele for our solutions, including from institutional investors for analytics and workflow tools, from corporate clients for our ESG and IR solutions and from financial institutions and marketplaces for technology that helps reduce financial crime. Our ARR growth was also boosted by the acquisition of Verafin. 
The strong operating leverage of our model was evident in the results. Our non-GAAP operating margins increased to 54%, up 2 percentage points compared to the prior year. As a result, we experienced 25% increase in our non-GAAP operating income and a 31% increase in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the period. 
Turning now to the specific highlights from the quarter. I will begin with our foundational marketplace and corporate businesses. Our Market Services segment saw net revenues of $338 million, a 20% increase from the prior year period and a new quarterly revenue record for this business. This is primarily led by higher U.S. options and cash equities trading volumes. We're also seeing an increase in demand for trade management services connectivity solutions as clients adjust their capacity for a wider range of volume scenarios.
Nasdaq's U.S. options market set a quarterly record of 892 million contracts traded during the period, an increase of 57%, while our U.S. equities market set a quarterly record of 153 million (sic) [ 153 billion ] shares traded, an increase of 20% year-over-year. 
Additionally, during the period, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our U.S. Fixed Income business, NFI, to an affiliate of Tradeweb Markets. The decision to sell NFI aligns with our strategy to maximize our potential as a major technology and analytics provider to the global capital markets. We expect the transaction to close later in 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.
Next, our Corporate Platform segment delivered revenues of $155 million, a 21% increase, with robust contributions across each of the product areas in that business. The business is boosted by record levels of new listing activity, material contribution from Nasdaq Private Market following a record first quarter for private company transactions and increased demand for our Investor Relations Intelligence and ESG solutions.
In our IR and ESG services business, we are seeing consistent and growing demand for our expanded suite of products, which has been carefully designed to help our clients measure, analyze, collaborate and take positive action regarding their respective investor relations, governance and sustainability programs. For example, in our IR Intelligence unit, we saw 6 new client wins from our new, expanded ESG advisory offering, a more in-depth solution that has lengthened and deepened our engagement with executive leadership teams as they seek to meet the demand from institutional investors and other stakeholders for greater clarity on their ESG strategies. And we are seeing the deeper client engagement results and continued sales momentum for our consultative IR advisory service and our Nasdaq IR Insight workflow solution, which saw a combined 36% increase in sales during the quarter. 
In our listing segment, Nasdaq led U.S. exchanges for IPOs during the period, welcoming 275 IPOs that raised $74.4 billion, including 79 operating company IPOs and 196 SPAC IPOs. The Nasdaq stock market led U.S. exchanges with a 69% total win rate on IPOs, including a 77% win rate among operating companies and a 66% win rate among SPACs. Listing highlights from the first quarter include the IPOs of Bumble, Qualtrics, Affirm, Playtika and Petco. During the quarter, Nasdaq listed 7 of the top 10 largest IPOs by capital raised.
Companies have responded positively to our virtual IPO experience during the pandemic period, and we are excited and encouraged to see our iconic bell ceremony and IPO day experience come to life again in Times Square and in cities across the country through our unique remote bell ceremony. Highlights include going on the road during the quarter to Bumble in Texas and to Qualtrics in Utah. We look forward to welcoming our clients and capital markets partners safely to the Nasdaq MarketSite for these milestone celebrations as we start to prepare for a post-pandemic period.
Of course, I also want to acknowledge the strong start to the second quarter in listings with -- in particular, noting Nasdaq's successful direct listing of Coinbase, a global leader in infrastructure and technology for the crypto economy. The Coinbase listing represents the largest direct listing in history and was the largest ever initial public listing opening cross on Nasdaq.
Now let me turn to our Market Technology and Investment Intelligence businesses. Our Market Technology segment delivered $100 million in revenues, including a partial period contribution from the Verafin acquisition, which we completed in February. Our annualized recurring revenue for the quarter was $416 million, a 62% increase year-over-year, including a 10% increase from our existing business and an additional $134 million representing the annualized total of Verafin's first quarter subscription revenues irrespective of the closing date or the temporary impact of the write-down of deferred revenues. 
To give you more transparency in how different parts of Market Technology are operating and progressing going forward, we have started to report our revenues from this segment of our business in 2 groups. The first is called marketplace infrastructure technology, which will comprise our solutions for the full trade life cycle to market infrastructure operators, banks and brokers and nonfinancial market operators. And the second is called anti-financial crime technology, our offerings providing surveillance, risk management and Verafin's anti-money laundering and fraud detection solutions.
As we stated in previous investor calls, there are certain areas of our Market Technology business that have been adversely impacted by the pandemic-related factors, largely in the marketplace infrastructure technology business. And while the environment continues to be characterized by the logistical challenges to implementations and lengthened sales cycles, the actions we took last year to respond to those dynamics are resulting in stabilized but moderated revenue growth in the near term, albeit with short-term impact to segment profitability. 
More importantly, our longer-term vision for Market Technology remains on track as demonstrated by the progress we've been delivering in new sales and revenues from SaaS products and services, in particular, our anti-financial crime technology solutions. Excluding the impact of Verafin, SaaS revenues within all of Market Technology increased 15% year-over-year. 
Turning to our Investment Intelligence segment. We delivered net revenues of $258 million, up $47 million or 22% from the prior year period. Overall, assets under management in ETP's benchmark to Nasdaq's indexes totaled $385 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 87% from the prior year period and a new quarterly record. Additionally, trading of futures and options on futures contracts tracking Nasdaq indexes increased 31% year-over-year.
I'm also pleased to see increasing adoption of some of our recent product innovations. In particular, AUM and the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite built on their strong debut in the fourth quarter of 2020 and now stands at approximately $2 billion in AUM in just 5 months after launch, making this one of the most successful new launches for Nasdaq's index business.
Our analytics business delivered revenues of $48 million, an increase of $7 million or 17% from the prior year period. Led by eVestment and Solovis, this business experienced strong -- increased growth in the first quarter due to improvement in both new users and retention compared to the prior year period. 
On a sequential basis, new sales were up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting both a rebound in institutional investment industry demand following some temporary contraction in 2020 as well as increased realizations of the synergies between eVestment and Solovis as the combination helped drive 28 new accounts to Solovis in the first quarter. These results underscore our strategy to create comprehensive workflow solutions for investment managers and institutional asset owners from precommitment diligence to postcommitment portfolio tracking and secondary trades. Lastly, within Investment Intelligence, our market data revenues rose 11%, driven primarily by expanding international demand for our proprietary data products. 
As I wrap up, I would like to reiterate that Nasdaq remains diligently focused on serving the unique needs of our clients while we advance our strategic mission to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead of us. At our Investor Day in November, we articulated that our diversified business model was designed to provide us with the resiliency to drive disciplined growth across a variety of backdrops. Our recent success, especially in the first quarter, underscores the power of the Nasdaq platform and highlights that the strategy underpinning our repositioned franchise is resonating with our clients as we continue to reallocate capital to higher-growth opportunities while maintaining leadership in our marketplace core. This focus has also resulted in many new instances of dynamic collaboration across our businesses, be it new product innovations or bringing advanced technology solutions to help our clients solve major industry challenges. 
For example, in our anti-financial crime technology segment, we're very excited about the work that we can do together with Verafin. This includes the potential for new client opportunities given our strong relationships with Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks as the Verafin team continues to build out their solutions to increase confidence in the global financial system. Additionally, we are pleased to support their international expansion, especially into Europe where Verafin has just landed its first client.
Another great example is the intersection of our listings and index businesses. Listing the next generation of innovators, including many of the largest IPOs that have come to Nasdaq in the recent years, creates strong synergies to drive new product development in collaboration with our index business. For example, The strength and success of our flagship Nasdaq 100 Index and our partnership with Invesco laid the groundwork for a recent launch of the Invesco Innovation Suite, including the Invesco NASDAQ Next Generation 100 ETF. Comprised of the 101st to the 200th largest nonfinancial companies listed on Nasdaq, the NASDAQ Next Gen 100 index has been one of the fastest-growing ETFs that we've ever launched with a partner and includes companies such as Etsy and Roku as well as many of the fastest-growing enterprise technology and health care companies listed on our market.
As I look back at this quarter, I could not be prouder of the performance across the business. We officially celebrated Nasdaq's 50th anniversary in February. And given our rich history as a technology pioneer, I remain confident that we are moving Nasdaq in the right direction for many years to come. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Ann to review our financial results in greater detail."

My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results, and all comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the financial section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. 
I will start by reviewing first quarter revenue performance as shown on Page 3 of the presentation and organic revenue growth on Pages 4 and 14. The $150 million increase in reported net revenue of $851 million is the net result of: organic growth of $118 million, including 17% organic increase in both Market Services and Solutions segment; a $14 million positive impact from acquisitions; and an $18 million impact from changes in FX rates.
I will now review quarterly highlights within each of our reporting segments. I'll start with Investment Intelligence revenue, which increased $47 million or 22%. Organic revenue growth during the period was 20%, reflecting very strong growth in our index business as well as strong contributions from both the market data and analytics businesses. Annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $542 million and increased 13% compared to the prior year period. AUM and ETPs licensed to Nasdaq indices rose 87% year-over-year to $385 billion, including a 25% increase from net inflows and a 62% increase from changes in market impact. On Page 19 of the presentation, you'll find our new disclosure on net flow contribution to the year-over-year change in AUM. The segment operating margin of 65% increased 1 percentage point compared to the prior year period. 
Market Technology revenue increased $19 million or 23%. The increase reflects organic revenue growth of $3 million or 4%, $12 million from the acquisition of Verafin, which closed mid-quarter, and a $4 impact million from the changes in FX rates. Excluding a temporary $7 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue associated with the closing of the Verafin transaction, Verafin revenues would have totaled $19 million for the partial quarter period following the February 11, 2021, close. On Slide 10, we show the runoff of the remaining $23 million purchase price adjustment on Verafin's deferred revenue. 
The $3 million organic increase in Market Tech was driven primarily by higher SaaS-based anti-financial crime technology revenues, in particular, from our market and trade surveillance products. ARR for Market Technology was $416 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 62% compared to the prior year period, largely due to the Verafin acquisition. Excluding Verafin, Market Technology ARR increased 10% in the period. 
In addition to the new Market Technology reporting Adena mentioned earlier, we are supplementing this with another revenue breakdown disclosing the recurring subscription SaaS and support licensing revenues as well as the nonrecurring professional services contributions to help investors and analysts track our progress as we continue to expand the SaaS contribution across both our market infrastructure technology and anti-financial crime technology businesses. The segment operating margin was a negative 2%, but would have been a positive 5% when excluding the noncash purchase price adjustment related to Verafin deferred revenue. The 5% margin is not a level that we believe reflects the potential of the business, and we continue to feel optimistic about our ambition for a margin that supports Market Technology being a rule of 40 business in 2023 and beyond. 
While the impact of the Verafin purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue is temporary and will be eliminated over the next 4 quarters, on a core basis, 2 main factors will drive our margin expansion over the coming years. First, our mix of SaaS subscription revenues within Market Technology is increasing significantly. Looking ahead, we expect it to continue to grow as we execute our strategy. This is critical because our SaaS businesses have approximately 2 to 3x the average contribution margin of the on-premise solutions. 
Second, we accelerated hiring in certain areas of our Market Technology business in recent quarters and on a temporary basis, allocated more of our existing resources to relatively low-margin installation work, in particular, in the most complex on-premise clearing solutions. We expect the margin impact to gradually diminish over the coming years. 
Corporate Platform revenues increased $27 million or 21%. Organic revenue growth totaled $24 million or 19%, and there was a $3 million impact from changes in FX rates. The organic revenue increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listings revenues due to an increase in IPOs and higher Nasdaq Private Market revenues, together with an increase in both IR and ESG advisory services revenue. 
Nasdaq Private Market revenues were about $6 million to $7 million higher than the average quarterly run rate of 2020. And while this business has averaged an over 40% CAGR in the last 3 years, we would expect to see at least $5 million in sequential decline in 2Q '21 from NPM's particularly strong first quarter. 
Corporate Platform's ARR was $487 million and increased 12% compared to the prior year period. The segment operating margin of 42% increased 7 percentage points compared to the prior year period and was driven by both the unusually strong activity on the Nasdaq Private Market as well as from the substantial increase in the listed issuer base.
Market Services net revenues increased $57 million or 20%. The organic revenue increase was $48 million or 17%, and there was a $9 million impact from changes in FX rates. The organic increase during the period primarily reflects increases in cash equities and equity derivative net revenues due to higher industry trading volumes and an increase in trade management services revenues. The segment operating margin of 67% increased 4 percentage points from the prior year period, reflecting strong operating leverage on record trading revenues. 
Turning to Pages 9 and 14 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $57 million to $393 million. The increase reflects a $24 million or 7% organic increase, an $18 million increase from the impact of acquisitions and a $15 million increase from the impact of changes in FX rates. 
The organic growth in expenses reflects the sum of: one, relatively consistent low single-digit percentage increase related to hiring and wage inflation; two, higher compensation expense as variable performance-linked compensation increased, reflecting the company's outstanding growth; and three, costs related to what has been an incredibly active capital markets backdrop. For example, costs related to increasing our trading capacity as well as marketing commitments supporting the extraordinary number of IPO wins in recent periods.
Turning to Slide 10. We are narrowing our 2021 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.57 billion to $1.62 billion to reflect strong and broad-based organic revenue growth in the first quarter and the impact that growth has on variable expenses like performance-based compensation and marketing commitments. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, overall, if performance continues to be strong, we would expect to come in at the high end of the expense guidance range. In addition, we expect the year-over-year organic growth in expenses to be elevated, particularly in 2Q '21 compared to 2Q '20 as the prior year period had a significant reduction in travel and other in-office activity due to the onset of the pandemic as well as lower new listing activity and less performance-based compensation due to the uncertain financial environment in 2Q '20.
Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased $93 million in the first quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 54% increased 2 percentage points year-over-year. Net interest expense was $28 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $4 million compared to the prior year period due to incremental interest expense related to the financing of the Verafin acquisition. Consistent with our reporting practice, interest expense related to acquisition financing that was incurred prior to the mid-quarter close of the transaction was excluded from non-GAAP results for this quarter. And therefore, an incremental $3 million to $4 million Verafin-related interest expense will be reflected in the second quarter results.
The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24% for the first quarter of 2021, which includes a benefit related to the vesting of certain equity awards. For the full year 2021, we still expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 27%. And barring any changes in the corporate tax landscape, we expect to come in near the bottom end of the range for the year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the first quarter of 2021 was $327 million or $1.96 per diluted share compared to $251 million or $1.50 per diluted share in the prior year period. 
Turning to Slide 11. Debt increased by $349 million versus 4Q '20 primarily due to net issuances of $435 million of commercial paper used to fund a portion of the Verafin acquisition, partially offset by an $87 million decrease in the book values of our Eurobonds caused by changes in FX rates. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.4x, a decrease from 3.5x in the fourth quarter of 2020.
During the first quarter of 2021, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $81 million and repurchased common stock in the amount of $162 million. Today, we're announcing a 10% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.54 per share. Additionally, during the first quarter, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the share repurchase program of an additional $1 billion, subject to the closing of the sale of our U.S. Fixed Income business and acceleration of the issuance of Nasdaq common stock related to the sale. 
As previously communicated, we intend to use the proceeds from the sale as well as available tax benefits, working and clearing capital of the business and other sources to repurchase shares in order to offset EPS dilution. We continue to expect the sale to be temporarily 2% dilutive to non-GAAP EPS in the 12-month period following the close, and we see immaterial dilution in periods thereafter. Overall, the actions taken during the first quarter support Nasdaq's accelerated evolution and allow the company to further concentrate its resources on technology, analytics and ESG opportunities. 
Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

On your -- related to your question on Market Tech margins, as we look forward to 2023 and our ambitions of achieving the rule of 40 for the overall Market Tech, we think the primary way we're going to get there is through revenue growth. Part of that will be bringing Verafin on board. 
And then the other 2 things I'd point to is we should look to -- we're going to continue to expand our SaaS offerings. We talked about the growth in our SaaS business and the fact that our SaaS businesses come at higher contribution margins. So as we continue to expand there, we'll see an impact on the margins. 
And then the last thing that I'd mention is just that we do have some incremental costs now to deliver on some of our larger, more complex projects. We've added costs, and we expect them to gradually decline over time. 
So when you put those 3 things together, we expect to achieve that rule of 40 in 2023. And I think I'll just bring it back, it's just important to note that we are confident in the prospects of this business and our ability to be successful here."

I know you dimensionalized the private market impact, I think, $7 million. But even without that, it was still a very, very strong quarter on a sequential basis. And I know you highlighted SPACs in particular. And I know it was a very strong SPAC quarter. But usually, the initial listing fees get amortized over many years. 
So just wondering, is the accounting difference on SPAC listings or anything that you could point out to kind of bridge the gap? And how sustainable that should be going forward given that some of the SPAC enthusiasm seems to be waning a little bit?"

We",331,"Sure. Thanks, Alex. Well, I think that really when you look at the revenue performance in the listings business, it is on the back of 3 very strong years of new listings, which, of course, gets us to a new annualized recurring rate of listing revenue. We had over, I guess, in 2019, we had 189 IPOs. In 2020, we had over, I think, 314 IPOs. And then this year already, we've had 275 IPOs. 
You are right though. With the SPAC listings, it's a little different. They -- first of all, they tend to come in at the capital market because they want to pay the lowest possible fees. So contributions from SPAC, if we look at kind of overall SPAC annual listing revenue, is only about 5% of our total listing revenues. So it is -- it's not a huge contributor. And of course, when they do combine with companies, then we have the opportunity to bring that company into Nasdaq as an operating company, and that tends to accrue to a higher fee rate. 
So there's a lot of opportunity from the SPACs as they make those combinations to increase our revenue contribution. But it also is a pretty limited risk in terms of if the SPACs are not able to find operating companies they want to combine with.
But generally speaking, Alex, it's just -- I think it's kind of the compounding effect of multiple years where we've been winning the majority of IPOs and frankly, the vast majority of operating company IPOs. And it's just been a favorable environment for us to be able to bring a lot of new companies to market. So I think it's a combination of all those things. 
And I should mention also, we had 32 new listings in the Nordics in the first quarter as well. And so that's really bucking the trend in Europe. And we continue to see a lot of strength in our Nordic business as well."

So just looking at the anti-fin crime bucket, including the core Verafin contribution that you called out, that looks stronger than what we expected, just looking at that $46 million bucket for the quarter. Can you talk about either lumpiness or seasonal factors driving that during the quarter? If there's anything that we should be thinking about or even as we think about the rest of the year? 
And related to that, you've noted that you continue to see a little bit of pressure within the Market Tech basket as a result of the pandemic. That hasn't entirely gone away. So just any color as to -- if I think about the legacy business ex Verafin, thinking about the 8% to 11% organic growth rate, if you think about 2021, is that still a feasible and reasonable kind of growth rate? Again, I know it's more of a medium-term rate. But if we think about 2021, when we think about the legacy business, is that 8%, 11-ish percent still an achievable rate given some of the headwinds and pressures that you're seeing in the business?"

On the anti-financial crime side, it is largely a SaaS-oriented business. There are -- so we think about -- what we put into the anti-financial crime subsegment are the surveillance solutions to markets. Some of those are still on-prem, but they are long-term license revenues, not a lot of project-related costs because that's a pretty -- a more standardized service. 
Then you have the SaaS business related to the surveillance for our trading firms, and it's all SaaS. And then you have the risk management solutions to both markets and broker-dealers. And there, that has both a combination of on-prem and SaaS solutions. And then lastly, you have Verafin, which is entirely a SaaS business with very low professional fees. 
So generally speaking, it's -- what you're seeing in the quarter is a relatively recurring element of kind of what the potential of the business is. As I mentioned before, we did have 10% growth in our anti-financial crime business, absent Verafin. So we continue to see really strong demand for all of those solutions. 
I think that in terms of the overall growth rate for Market Tech absent Verafin, as we mentioned, the market infrastructure technology part of the business has been more materially impacted by the pandemic. And we are still in a pandemic. So we're still not able to go visit clients. These are generally and oftentimes, particularly for new clients, these are large-scale decisions that they're making to have us partner with them to build and support them in their core business technologies. So they tend to be sales cycles that result from relationships, and it's harder to establish and manage those relationships if we can't visit our clients. So that is still the case because of the pandemic.
However, having said that, our existing clients, they really spent last year focusing on managing the very high-volume environment and a pretty dynamic capital markets environment as well. As they come into 2021, we are having more constructive conversations with them around thinking longer term again, thinking about how they want to continue to advance their technology. 
So we're certainly seeing encouraging signs of working with our clients. But as I said in my comments, we would expect that the short-term growth rates on that part of the business would be -- will be moderated. And -- but over time, we're not changing our medium- to long-term outlook on the overall business because we have confidence it will recover."

And I would say eVestment and Solovis, I should say together. The investment management community and the asset owners were also dealing with a lot of change, a very dynamic environment. They weren't sure whether this is going to be a sustainable market trend. And so they were -- they really pulled back on buying decisions around any sort of analytical tools. 
So -- but what we're seeing, as we've mentioned in the first quarter, is that we maintain those conversations and relationships. We definitely -- I think through our all-in pricing model that we've shifted to in 2019 really helped us actually retain a lot of clients in 2020. 
And therefore, now going into 2021, we're seeing that investment managers and asset owners are back in the market to really find ways to, frankly, manage these very dynamic portfolios. So -- and we've also done more to create a more all-in solution, particularly for asset owners across Solovis and eVestment. So we're seeing a lot of nice upswing now coming into 2021 off the back of a pretty impacted 2020.
I think Market Tech, as we've mentioned, particularly the market infrastructure technology is the other area that's been impacted. And then across the rest of it, I would say that it's -- and actually, I would say somewhat in the governance area on the governance platform solutions. We -- it's harder. We do a lot of work there. But again, I think a lot of corporates were dealing with downturns, were dealing with a lot of challenges. And so it was a harder sales environment for that team as well last year, and we're starting to see some recovery there as well. But that would be another area where we hope that we would have some more pickup in 2021 and beyond."

That they continue to penetrate that sector quite successfully. And they have an all-in full solution that really supports kind of a full platform for those banks. 
As they've been going in and starting to engage with $100-billion-and-plus type of banks and really the large -- the very large banks, they are finding opportunities to come in with a specific solution like a part of their offering. And that -- they do have -- part of their offerings are quite relevant to the needs of those banks in terms of what I would call more of like a point solutions approach. 
But what we want to be able to do is become that all-in platform partner to these banks over time. So there may be some shorter-term opportunities like we have with the European company to have a nice, specific sale of a specific capability now that we're very, very good at. But then over time, I think that the real revenue opportunity will come if we can really build that out to become more of a holistic platform partner. 
So I just want you to know, it's obviously very early days. There's a lot of enthusiasm, a great sense of partnership and the ability for us to open doors. But it will be -- it will take time for us to get the solution and investment that we want to make in the business so that we can get that solution to become the preeminent platform across the entire industry."

So it's a huge market opportunity. It's a huge and growing problem. 
So I kind of equate it in some respects -- well, first of all, I think that there will be certain platforms that kind of emerge as the ones that the banks rely upon for all of their core work. And then there'll be point solutions and other innovations that come in on top of that, that we should be in a position either to acquire or integrate or partner with to make it so that we can continue to manage the dynamic needs of our clients. 
So I think that is the case. But there are some incumbents. And I would say, many are on-prem solutions that are not nearly as nimble or flexible, which is what I think Verafin has been very successful at displacing over -- in recent years as well as a lot of internal build, particularly for the larger banks, the internal build. And then at the very smallest end, there are a lot of small point solutions providers that Verafin also competes very successfully against. 
And they've done a nice job of working with a lot of the more core banking platform providers to integrate Verafin into those platforms. So that as a client is taking one of these core platforms, the banking platforms, they know that they have the benefit of Verafin as part of that."

I think that it's great to have a leader within the SEC that really understands markets and market structure. So he is certainly a market structure expert. 
In terms of the priorities, I think on the back of some of the retail trading trends and the hearings that happened in Washington, I do believe this will be a focus area for the SEC. And they're already working on a kind of a white paper, a thought piece around it to go out and get comments and input from the industry. 
When it comes to -- part of that is a discussion of the dark trading. Because when you look at the composition of the markets in the U.S., almost -- it's like 40% to 50%. It's like -- I would say 45% or so of the trading today is done in the dark, and the vast majority of that is retail. So that means that the retail orders are not getting exposed to the lit exchanges and they're not, therefore, contributing to price discovery. And therefore, then you have to sit there and say, well, do we have the best reflection of price discovery if only half the market is being exposed and displayed? 
So I think, Ken, it is an area of focus for us. It's one of several things that we -- I think that the SEC and us and others will be focused on as we look at how to continue to make market structure improvements. So it's -- one of the great things about this business, honestly, Ken, as you know, it's like kind of an eternal learning curve. It's one of the things that keeps me so interested, and it's just fascinating to see how the markets evolve. But as we continue to evolve those markets, I think that some focus areas that we think will be important are to look at settlement cycles to see if we can go from T+2 to T+1 as well as to look at the margin calculation process and giving people a little bit more clarity as to the margin obligations.
The second is onshore sale disclosure. We do believe that long positions are disclosed, short positions are not, and it just seems like an unfortunate asymmetry. And then the third is on market structure and trying to level the playing field between exchanges and off-exchange players, but not in a way that's unnatural, but in a way that just allows us all to compete successfully. And one of those examples would be minimum tick sizes and minimum trade sizes and things like that, but that's one of several things that we would want to have the SEC consider."

And then suddenly, in the second half, we had a whole range of programs coming out, and it really picked -- the activity picked up and gave us a great fourth quarter and now a great first quarter. 
I think that we should recognize that more and more companies are seeing -- more and more private companies are seeing NPM as a good way for them to manage long-term liquidity needs of their employees and our investors without having to bring themselves to the public markets or ahead of bringing themselves to the public markets. Where, as you mentioned, with Coinbase, having some of that liquidity done in the private markets ahead of time, kind of position them really well for their direct listing and gave them an investor base that they could walk into their direct listing with in a way that was very sustainable and strong. And so I think that would be a good example of how companies, I think, increasingly are using the private markets as a kind of a lead-in into a direct listing. And we see that as a really encouraging sign for our business and for the relationships we have with our companies. 
I think the crypto space is a good question, Owen, as to whether more crypto-oriented companies will be coming into the public markets on the back of Coinbase and whether or not they also would choose that path. And if that's the case, then I think the Nasdaq Private Market is a natural way for them to manage that private liquidity ahead of an IPO."

You're seeing now some really interesting intangible applications of it that have been more geared up until recently towards retail. But now you're starting to see institutional players recognizing that this is -- and a construct that really could become part of mainstream commerce. 
So it's that classic product life cycle that's really starting to develop. And you're seeing where all the early experimentations turned to early businesses, turned into a proliferation of businesses now are turning into I would say, more concentrated, but still very, very early life cycle type of companies emerging. 
And so it does give us time to -- for us to figure out the right path for us. Our, as you mentioned, our initial involvement in crypto has been with our technology, and that's been really great. We are partners with several crypto markets on their surveillance and their technology. And that's one of the big concerns with crypto, has been around making sure that the markets are fair for all participants. And so our technology is highly relevant there. Managing trading and, frankly, the scalability of trading that they've had to deal with, our systems are designed for scale. So I think that, that also really gives us some real advantage. 
And then we actually have launched with a partner Crypto Index, and we've turned that into investable products outside the U.S. And we're hoping, with a second partner, to kind of hopefully bring that into the U.S. in coming months. 
So we do have some really interesting ways for us to participate in the crypto space, but we're still evaluating what should our long-term role be? And how will the markets evolve? And obviously, there are some great, great winners, including Coinbase, of course, in terms of developing the marketplaces of the future."

But I think that we obviously are quite encouraged by the fact that we've had some really great adoption of our ESG solutions by companies. 
We also have actually incorporated our ESG solutions into our IPO package now. So we'll get more and more companies adopting them, and that gives us longer-term revenue opportunity with them as well.

My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's second quarter 2021 financial and business performance as well as the progress we've made to drive forward along our strategic direction. I would like to begin by acknowledging the Nasdaq team's deep commitment in delivering results for our clients while creating sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. 
Nasdaq's mission reflects our focus on becoming the premier platform and ecosystem for the global capital markets and beyond with unmatched technology, insights and markets expertise, and we made important progress during the second quarter. Our financial results demonstrate our business' ability to capture opportunity in a unique economic environment even as we continue to strengthen this position for long-term growth. 
We see strong demand for many of our products and services as corporate issuers, institutional investors, banks, brokers and marketplace operators, all navigate today's rapidly changing world. Our core foundational marketplaces benefited from an active capital market backdrop that saw record-setting industry, U.S. equity and options trading volumes in the first half of 2021. Our client-first model has also driven our ability to win the majority of new listings in one of the strongest periods of industry activity in years. Meanwhile, expanding demand from institutional owners for index strategies as well as asset allocation and portfolio management tools from banks for modern anti-financial crime solutions and from corporates for ESG and Investor Relations solutions underpinned our performance in the Solutions segment businesses. 
Our performance in these businesses is also a testament to our client-centric approach and strategically-aligned offerings as we invest in and grow new and innovative technology to meet that demand. We also achieved other important milestones against our corporate journey this quarter. 
First, Nasdaq completed the sale of our U.S. fixed income business to Tradeweb markets at the end of the second quarter. Second, we announced our strategic investment in Puro.earth, a leading carbon removal marketplace. Along with the launch of our new ESG data hub, these solutions further expand the ways that we can partner with our clients to support their unique sustainability efforts. And third, we announced yesterday that we are starting an exciting next chapter for the NASDAQ Private Market as part of our partnership with a group of leading banks in the private market space. It highlights both the success of the private market platform we developed at Nasdaq and the growing interest in developing a robust ecosystem for private company liquidity. 
All of these actions underscore our commitment to our strategy and allow us to reprioritize elements of our unique business model to advance our focus on the most impactful secular opportunities. 
I will now turn to our financial results from the second quarter of 2021. Overall, Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $846 million, an increase of $147 million or 21% from the prior year period, driven by 18% organic revenue growth in our Solutions segments, and 10% organic growth in our Market Services businesses. 
We continue to execute against key secular growth opportunities as illustrated by strong momentum in our institutional investor analytics and anti-financial crime solutions businesses well as the broad-based growth in total company ARR of $1.8 billion. This equated to an increase of 22% compared to the prior year period, reflecting both the acquisition of Verafin and a 12% increase in our existing ARR. 
Turning now to specific segment highlights from the second quarter. I will begin with our foundational marketplace and corporate businesses. Our Market Services segment saw net revenues of $312 million, a 13% increase from the prior year period. Market Services transactional revenues, the sum of our cash equity, equity derivatives and fixed income commodities trading businesses increased by 27% in total in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the prior year period, with the largest contributor of this being our equity derivatives revenues where we experienced strong increases in U.S. options industry volume. 
Nasdaq's Options markets specifically traded $782 million of multiply-listed options contracts, an increase of 28% year-over-year. Driven by an active dynamic equities market, we have also seen increased levels of activity from companies seeking to tap the public market to raise capital, which has resulted in a 13% increase in the overall number of operating companies listed on the U.S. on NASDAQ in the last 12 months. 
Specifically, we have 352 more operating companies listed on NASDAQ in the U.S. than we did in June of 2020. The increase in our number of listed companies naturally contributes to higher industry volumes and contributes to higher trading on NASDAQ in particular, since we have approximately 2x higher market share in our own listed stocks than we have in stocks listed in other markets. 
I would also like to highlight for a moment another record-breaking NASDAQ Closing Cross during the annual Russell U.S. Indexes reconstitution, which occurred in late June. The Closing Cross successfully executed 2.3 billion shares of NASDAQ-listed securities, representing approximately $81 billion in market value and occurred in under 2 seconds. This Closing Cross was 760 million shares larger than our second largest Closing Cross ever, which occurred in March of this year with the triple which expiration. 
I'm incredibly proud of our team as this milestone underscores our leadership in operating in the industry's most robust and resilient market infrastructure. 
Next, our Corporate Platform segment delivered revenues of $154 million, a 22% increase year-over-year. The business continues to thrive with elevated levels of new listings since the market recovery in the second half of 2020. In our listings business, NASDAQ again led U.S. exchanges for IPOs during the period, welcoming 135 IPOs that raised $31.7 billion, including 88 operating company IPOs and 47 SPAC IPOs. 
The NASDAQ stock market led U.S. exchanges with a 78% total win rate on IPOs as well as executing the largest direct listing ever coin base. In addition to new listings, we also welcomed 10 switches from the -- in the second quarter of 2021, representing a combined $183 billion in market value, including Honeywell, a Dow 30 company. 
The total market value of all companies transferring to NASDAQ since 2016 now exceeds $1 trillion. Meanwhile, our Nordic listing platform hosted 62 IPOs in the second quarter, bringing the total to 86 in the first half of 2021, contributing to an 11% year-over-year increase in the Nordic-listed issuer base compared to the prior year quarter. 
Nasdaq is proud to be the exchange partner supporting companies throughout their corporate life cycle with our commitment to providing issuers with an industry-leading market model and a full suite of Investor Relations, Board engagement and ESG solutions. Revenues in our IR and ESG services increased $4 million or 8% to $56 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year period as we continue to see strong demand for our Investor Relations and advisory and ESG product offerings. 
The economic impacts of the pandemic, combined with the sudden and likely lasting landscape of virtual or hybrid investor engagement, has increased corporate focus on investor relationships and has accelerated their professionalization of their ESG programs, both of which has intensified the demand for new data and tools to power their programs. 
Now let me take a minute to talk about the actions we've taken to advance the NASDAQ Private Market going forward. This week, we announced an agreement to contribute NASDAQ Private Market into a joint venture with Silicon Valley Bank, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. This creates a new entity to build upon NPM success, becoming the leading marketplace platform for issuer-led private company tender transactions. The partnership will enable increased investment in a broader set of capabilities to design to enhance NPM's position as the go-to marketplace for private company liquidity. 
Now as the private market will continue to expand from its foundation of facilitating private company tender programs to enhance and refine its buy-side book building, auctions, investor block trades and pre-direct listing continuous trading programs. Additionally, the platform will provide end-to-end settlement, and through the new ownership structure, will create a unique and powerful distribution network serving private companies and institutional investors. 
Nasdaq's Market Technology business will be contracted to supply NPM with a technology platform on a go-forward basis. NASDAQ Private Market's talented team has made strong progress in the 7 years since we established the business as measured by the close relationships we've built with more than 250 leading private companies worldwide and the more than $30 billion in transaction volume that they've executed for many of the world's largest private companies. This new entity will expand upon that success going forward. 
In the last 12 months ended June 30, revenues for NASDAQ Private Market increased $13 million or approximately 200% over the prior year period. Going forward with our partners, we expect to unlock significantly more value for our clients and shareholders by advancing the market for private company shares with a high integrity advanced platform that facilitates liquidity in new ways and build on the momentum that we've developed over the past several years. 
Now let me turn to our Market Technology and Investment Intelligence segments. Our Market Technology segment delivered $117 million in revenues, a 39% increase year-over-year, including a 5% organic increase from our existing business and an additional $27 million contribution from Verafin. 
Revenues in the second quarter of 2021 also included a temporary $10 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue associated with the closing of the Verafin transaction. In our anti-financial crime technology business, revenues increased $29 million or 88%, driven by the inclusion of revenues from Verafin as well as the continued growth in Surveillance Solutions. 
With Verafin as part of NASDAQ for its first full quarter, we continue to find great opportunities, working collaboratively with the Verafin team to open doors to new clients and expand their footprint. Verafin signed 36 new clients during the second quarter, and we remain extremely pleased with the business and its growth potential as it achieves its mission of fighting financial crime. 
In our Marketplace Infrastructure Technology business, revenues increased $4 million or 8% in the second quarter of 2020 -- sorry, 2021, compared to the second quarter of 2020. New order intake for market technology hit a 6-quarter high at $81 million, excluding Verafin. Technology -- Market Technology ARR increased 9% year-over-year, also excluding the impact of Verafin. If you include Verafin, NASDAQ Market Technologies ARR increased 61%. 
Turning to our Investment Intelligence segment. We delivered net revenues of $263 million, up $50 million or 23% from the prior year period. Overall assets under management and ETP's benchmark to NASDAQ's indexes totaled $415 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 53% from the prior year period. 
We are pleased to expand our long-standing partnership with Invesco during the second quarter with the launch of 2 new thematic technology ETFs tracking the NASDAQ Biotech Index and the semiconductor sector index. These 2 indexes are the longest-standing benchmarks for their respective sectors and in the past year, have increased in relevance for investors given the recent pandemic-related events. 
We also continue to see strong global interest in our index franchise with 12 of 15 new and license ETP launches in the second quarter occurring outside of the U.S. We are committed to bringing investment opportunities through our index partnerships and empower investors globally with access to diversified investment opportunities. For example, XP Inc., a technology-driven investment management platform in Brazil, launched one of the first locally listed NASDAQ 100 ETF offerings in Latin America during the second quarter. While Hasdaq also from Brazil, partnered with Nasdaq to launch the world's first ETF available in Brazil to investors utilizing the NASA Crypto index. 
During the quarter, 2 ETP sponsors, BlackRock and Vanguard, announced that they would be switching and consolidating their relationships with some index providers. And as a consequence, certain of their products would no longer be licensing NASDAQ indexes. While we're always disappointed to lose sponsors, the loss had a minimal financial impact, which Ann will touch on in her comments and the continued expansion of our relationships with the broader sponsor universe as well as the continued innovation and growth of the index product suite gives us great cause for optimism going forward. 
Turning next to our Analytics business. We delivered revenues of $50 million, a 14% increase from the prior year period due to growth in eVestment and Solovis revenues from higher new sales and increased retention, driven in part by the success of the enterprise license contracting initiative, which spread usage of eVestment's unique analytics to more users in more business areas of our client base. 
Lastly, revenues in our Market Data business rose 5% as compared to the prior year period to $106 million, driven primarily by expanding international demand for proprietary data products. As our business, our clients and the broader markets begin to prepare to operate in a post-pandemic environment, we are excited to carry forward the strong momentum from the first half of 2021 and into the future. One increased area of focus for us is ESG, which we have seen growing interest from a range of clients in both the U.S. and Europe. Nasdaq's position at the intersection of financial, corporate and regulatory communities gives us a unique perspective on corporate sustainability. 
From this vantage point, we're actively engaging with clients to help them successfully navigate the complex and fast maturing ESG landscape. We were thrilled to have the opportunity in the second quarter to add Puro.earth's marketplace for carbon removal solutions to help our corporate clients meet their emission reduction commitments. At the same time, as a public company ourselves, we engage with our employees and our communities to improve our own practices, performance and transparency on our own ESG journey. 
In that regard, I encourage our stakeholders to review our recently published and expanded sustainability report, which is available on our website. As I wrap up, I want to highlight how each of our businesses has expanded the diversity and depth of their client base in recent years, which underpins the strength and resiliency of the NASDAQ platform as we move through each quarter. 
Our strong engine of talent and technology is allowing us to expand our position in the capital markets in ways that can capitalize on the powerful secular tailwinds in a post-pandemic period. We're leading NASDAQ into the second half of 2021 with incredible momentum, and I look forward to updating all of you on our progress in the months to come. And with that, I will turn it over to Ann to review our financial results in detail."

My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results, and all comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted.

My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results, and all comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. 
Before we review the financial comparisons and developments, I want to cover some reporting changes going forward related specifically to some of the strategic developments within the business portfolio that Adena mentioned previously. First, with regards to the NASDAQ Private Market or NPM, as recently announced, we have contributed this business to a newly formed joint venture for which we will own a minority interest. As a result, we will no longer consolidate the results and instead we'll be recognizing our share of net income as a nonoperating item, consistent with how we treat other unconsolidated investees. 
Second, with regards to both NPM and NASDAQ Fixed Income or NFI, beginning in the third quarter of 2021, we will reclassify the revenue and operating expenses of these 2 businesses out of the corporate platforms market Services and Investment Intelligence segment results for all prior periods and move them into corporate items so that the business results of each of these segments can be compared to prior periods on a like-for-like basis. On Slide 12, we provide a table previewing the reclassified operating segment results. 
Now I will start by reviewing second quarter revenue performance. The 21% increase in reported net revenue of $846 million is a result of organic growth of 15%, including 18% organic increase in the Solutions segment, and a 10% organic increase in Market Services; a 4% positive impact from acquisitions and a 2% positive impact from changes in FX rates. 
I will now review the quarterly highlights within each of our reporting segments, as shown on Pages 5 through 8 of the slide presentation. I will start with Investment Intelligence revenue, which increased $50 million or 23%. Organic revenue growth totaled $47 million or 22% and there was a $3 million positive impact from changes in FX rates. 
Organic revenue growth during the period reflects very strong growth in our index business as well as strong contributions from both the analytics and market data businesses. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $547 million, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year period. AUM and ETPs licensed to NASDAQ indices rose 53% compared to the prior year period to $415 billion, including $47 billion from net inflows and $113 billion net increase from market appreciation, partially offset by $17 billion in negative net impact related to an ETP sponsor switching its index provider. 
The Investment Intelligence segment operating margin of 65% increased 3 percentage points compared to the prior year period. As Adena mentioned earlier, we will see an additional impact to AUM in the third quarter of 2021 related to previously announced ETP sponsor index switches. The total revenue impact of all of the 2021 switches announced to date is estimated to be approximately $3 million per quarter. 
Market Technology revenue increased $33 million or 39%. The increase reflects organic revenue growth of $4 million or 5%; $27 million from the acquisition of Verafin and a $2 million positive impact from changes in FX rates. Excluding a temporary $10 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenues associated with the Verafin transaction, Verafin revenues would have been $37 million. 
The organic revenue increase, which excludes revenue generated from Verafin during the first 12 months after the acquisition close, was driven primarily by higher support and licensing revenues and higher SaaS-based surveillance solutions revenues. ARR for Market Technology was $432 million in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 9% compared to the prior period, excluding the impact of Verafin. Including Verafin, Market Technology ARR increased 61% in the period. 
The Market Technology segment operating margin was 15% in the period. Market Technology expenses include a partial reversal of the reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 of approximately $6 million as we finalize client negotiations and updated our estimate of cost to service our client agreement. 
Corporate Platforms revenues increased $28 million or 22%. Organic revenue growth totaled $25 million or 20%, and there was a $3 million impact from changes in FX rates. The organic revenue increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listings revenues due to the expansion in our listed issuer base, together with an increase in IR advisory services and ESG product offering. Corporate Platforms ARR was $509 million and increased 16% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platform segment operating margin of 42% increased 3 percentage points compared to the prior year period and was driven by both the continued increase in the listed issuer base and strong activity on the NASDAQ Private Market. 
Market Services net revenues increased $36 million or 13%. The organic revenue increase was $28 million or 10%, and there was an $8 million impact from changes in FX rates. The organic increase during the period primarily reflects increases in equity derivatives and trade management services revenues. The segment operating margin of 65% increased 1 percentage point from the prior year period, reflecting strong operating leverage on trading revenues. 
Turning to Pages 9 and 10 to review both expenses and 2021 guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $65 million to $392 million. The increase reflects a $24 million or a 7% organic increase, a $26 million increase from the impact of acquisitions as well as a $15 million increase from the impact of changes in FX rates due to a weaker U.S. dollar. 
The organic expense increase has 2 main drivers: first, higher variable performance linked compensation expense, reflecting our outstanding revenue growth; and second, increased costs related to what has been a very active capital markets backdrop, including expenses related to increased trading capacity and marketing commitments supporting our listing clients. 
We are narrowing our 2021 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.59 billion to $1.62 billion to reflect that our strong and broad-based organic revenue growth in the first half of 2021 has impacted variable expenses like performance-based compensation and marketing commitments. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, if performance continues to be strong in relation to our medium-term growth objectives, we would, as we said last quarter, expect to come in near the high end of this updated expense guidance range. 
Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased $82 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 54% increased 1 percentage point compared to the prior year period. Net interest expense was $33 million in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of $8 million compared to the prior year period due to incremental interest expense related to the financing of the Verafin acquisition. 
The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25% for the second quarter of 2021. For full year 2021, we still expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 27%. And barring any changes in the corporate tax landscape, we expect to come in near the bottom end of the range for the year. 
Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the second quarter of 2021 was $316 million or $1.90 per diluted share compared to $256 million or $1.54 per diluted share in the prior year period. 
Turning to Slide 11. Debt decreased by $189 million versus the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to a net reduction of $214 million of commercial paper, partially offset by $24 million increase in Eurobond book values caused by a stronger euro. Our total debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.2x, a decrease from 3.4x in the first quarter of 2021. 
During the second quarter of 2021, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $88 million and repurchased common stock in the amount of $248 million. As of June 30, 2021, there was 1.46 billion remaining under the share repurchase authorization. As previously communicated, upon the consummation of the sale of our U.S. fixed income business, we issued approximately 6.2 million shares to a third party. We intend to use the proceeds from the sale as well as available tax benefits, working and clearing capital of this business and other sources to repurchase shares in order to offset the EPS dilution from the sale. 
This week, we plan to execute an accelerated share repurchase program for approximately $470 million. Let me talk for a moment about share count expectations. Our average diluted shares outstanding for the second quarter were 166 million. Due to timing, this average reflected only a minimal impact of the $6.2 million NFI-related share issuance. At the end of the second quarter, however, diluted shares outstanding were approximately 172 million. With our plan to execute the accelerated share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2021, at the current share price, we would retire approximately 2 million shares in the third quarter and roughly 0.5 million additional shares in the fourth quarter. 
We plan to execute additional repurchases to offset the remaining NFI dilution in 2022 and 2023. We continue to expect EPS dilution from the sale of NFI to be about 2% in the first 12 months following the June 25 close, but to diminish to immaterial levels after that. 
I'll wrap up by saying that these capital reallocation actions, both in terms of the sale of NFI and the related capital return program, support Nasdaq's acceleration of our strategy and allow the company to further concentrate our resources on strategic opportunities. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

And we basically -- we contributed the NASDAQ Private Market asset, the other firms contributed investment dollars so that we can continue to build out the platform and grow and expand the footprint of NASDAQ Private Market going forward. 
We have a large minority stake, so we are the largest shareholder, and we will retain that. In terms of the revenue for the last 12 months, you did the math right, so it's $20 million for -- on an LTM basis. So -- but I would say that we are -- we do think that this is an opportunity for us to really accelerate our progress in the private company share liquidity programs. And we're seeing a lot of interesting and additional programs or interest from institutional investors, from other shareholders to really use the NASDAQ Private Market for price discovery, maybe continuous trading programs and other things like that. And we think that with the partners that we have between the West Coast with Silicon Valley Bank and their relationships with the venture community and early-stage private companies, the institutional connections that Citi and Morgan Stanley and Goldman have, and then us as a marketplace operator in our expertise and our relationships with later-stage private companies, it's kind of like this great coming together of talent and network and distribution capabilities that we think that we can really, really accelerate the progress and create a lot of value for our shareholders even with a large minority interest as opposed to 100% interest. 
So that is the thesis, and we're really excited to get going with them. And it should actually close pretty quickly. We've gotten a lot of approvals, so we should be able to get this going very quickly."

So first of all, yes, we are definitely seeing progress in terms of growth and demand from clients. in Market Tech. So if we talk specifically about the market infrastructure technology side of Market Tech, we're definitely finding new clients to serve, which is exciting. We are continuing to grow the number of crypto markets that we're providing technology to, digital asset markets we're providing technology to. But also, our core clients are -- after a year of a lot of volatility and a lot of focus just on the here and now, they're definitely now focused again on what does it mean for their infrastructure for the future, and our next-gen system is kind of front and center in a lot of clients' minds. 
So the order intake is reflecting, Alex, both some re-upping from existing clients as well as some new clients that have come in. And so it's a really healthy mix. And the conversations that we're seeing around the world are just much more longer-term driven and more focused on the future. So we're excited to see that progressing. 
And now the fact of the matter is, though, we're still not traveling, right? So we're still having to -- we've adjusted, I think, pretty well to a remote environment in terms of delivering for clients, and that was a big adjustment. And obviously, we had challenges associated with that. But we're still delivering in a remote environment, and we're still selling in a remote environment. And so we still think that it will be kind of improvements over time but not something where you're going to see kind of just this huge surge in 1 period of time. I think that we expect it to be steady improvement in demand and our ability to deliver over time. 
But on the anti-fin crime side, I should mention on the anti-financial crime side, we're doing really well in selling our market surveillance SaaS solution to new clients still. That was something we launched beginning of 2020 and has had a really nice demand curve there. In terms of our trade surveillance solution, we continue to find ways to expand our client relationships. And then, of course, on Verafin, we mentioned the fact that they had 36 new customers come in, and that business is going really well."

Well, I think the first thing is I believe that we seem to be relatively aligned, at least with the overarching agenda of the SEC right now in terms of thinking about how do you maximize competition, how do you maximize price transparency and how do you maximize market access, right? So -- and make it sure it's fair across both institutional investors and individual investors. 
And so if you kind of take that as kind of the principles that they're operating under and certainly the principles we operate under, I think that as they look at all the various components of market structure, our view is that we -- while our solutions may be slightly different or ideas may be slightly different, there's general alignment. 
In terms of that, that means things like pick size regimes, also different incentive programs that might exist are going to be examined. I also would say, as we kind of we all know, the markets are working and operating relatively well. So to the extent that we think that there can be constant improvement, that's absolutely the case. But our view is it's better to try incremental iterative improvements than to try something big bang, because the law of unintended consequences are so high. If you make changes to incentive programs, then you have to understand what all the consequences might be from that in terms of retail investors getting access to free trading and making sure at the same time that the quotes reflect the supply -- the actual supply and demand in the market. 
So a lot of pushes and pulls. So Alex, I think that it is still early days. We are certainly in active dialogue with the SEC staff as they come out with their papers. We'll be there to comment and be a part of that debate. But my -- our view is that right now, at least, there's a general alignment of principles, which we think is -- we obviously have some optimism around."

I mean, I think that when it comes to the growth within Verafin, there's a really nice balance between new logos or new clients and then re-upping and expanding relationships with existing clients. So Verafin is an interesting model. They do we",451,"Sure. Yes. I mean, I think that when it comes to the growth within Verafin, there's a really nice balance between new logos or new clients and then re-upping and expanding relationships with existing clients. So Verafin is an interesting model. They do weekly release cycles and they enter into these multiyear agreements with clients, but they're literally enhancing the system every single week and bringing a lot of new capabilities in under the existing contract. But when they renew the contract, they kind of point to all these improvements and all the value they've created over the prior several years. And so when they do renew, they tend to renew at a higher rate and often also a broader user base. 
So when we look at the growth of revenue, they look at new bookings and then they look at existing client renewals, because those also drive revenue growth, and it's actually been quite balanced. It always has been and it continues to be quite balanced in both areas. 
In terms of the sales strategy, they have an incredible kind of sales approach and sales discipline. They are incredibly metrics-driven and KPI driven. It's amazing to see kind of how they're very disciplined in the way that they do it. They do most of their sales remotely. They always have. They always would like to be able to have conferences and other ways to meet new clients, but they have the ability to do sales successfully in a remote environment. 
And they've -- I think, luckily that muscle is quite mature. So they haven't had to make a ton of change through the pandemic. And in terms of our impact on that, where we've been focused is opening doors to larger clients or to -- maybe they're trying to nurture a new relationship, but they're already listed customer on NASDAQ. So therefore, we can leverage our relationship manager to open more doors and maybe accelerate the sale process or they're very large banking relationships, and so we can kind of get them in front of higher-level executives to teach their services. 
But their platform itself is is a superior platform, so we feel very confident in bringing them to customers and saying, we know that they can do better than whatever the client has existing in their systems. And we've been -- that's the one area we've been collaborating on the most. We have a regular meeting where we go through the pipeline. We examine where we have relationships where we can stretch them to go to larger clients. And then strategically, how are we going to move them up the value chain and then move them over into Europe."

Yes, we actually have seen a really nice recovery of demand, Owen. So the reason why eVestment and Solovis were impacted by COVID was, first of all, we bought Solovis right at the beginning of the pandemic. So the integration took longer than we wanted it to, just because we couldn't get together and getting to know people on Zoom is different than getting to know people in the room. 
So -- but then also kind of thinking about the integrated platform and kind of what -- how do we demonstrate an integrated solution to our clients. That took a little bit longer, too, because, again, the integration took a little longer. But now in the fourth quarter of 2020 and into 2021, you're starting to see that demand pick up in terms of asset owners really understanding the intersection between making an asset allocation decision and then managing their portfolio once they make that decision, and we have solutions that provide and kind of bridge that. So I think that we've definitely seen a nice acceleration of demand. 
And you're seeing that in the growth numbers in the first quarter and second quarter. And we definitely are -- I think that we feel like also investment managers and asset owners are definitely more willing to put money to work to advance their own platforms. And I think that also took a little while for them to realize that they had -- it's a very active capital markets backdrop. So bringing in these solutions can make their lives a lot more efficient. And I think that, that demand has also come back."

In terms of international, there are regulations associated with that, but it is an area that we would say that, over time, we should be able to globalize the platform. We do bring some foreign issuers into the platform, but it's then they have to kind of go through -- it's a FINRA broker/dealer, so they have to go through and make sure that all the institutional investors are accredited in a way and are registered appropriately. So it definitely isn't completely open as a global platform at this point, but it's certainly something we have on the agenda."

And yes, I think that the answer is that as we've seen a lot of change, both in terms of the growth of fintech and the emergence of DFI, we do see that those 2 parts of the sector as being really interesting growth opportunities for Verafin. Verafin has been focused on banks. And -- but the fact is some fintechs have been leveraging banks in order to manage their fraud and AML detection programs. 
And so what Verafin will do is they'll put the platform into the bank and then the bank will then kind of become a subcontractor to the fintech. Well, over time, I think that Verafin understands that really they could become, obviously, a direct provider to the fintech, and then that would be the case, of course, with the D5 providers as well. And some -- I think that they have really truly a superior, particularly on fraud detection and AML detection as well. 
There's a network effect that they have because they have 2,000 banks in their network that allow for them to, frankly, just be better at eliminating false positives and focusing in on real potential fraud issues. So we do think that we have a chance to expand there, and they're very excited about that as a near-term opportunity.

So we certainly think it gives us an opportunity to be able to draw in more flow. I think though that when you look at the internalization, there are multiple factors that drive our retail broker to a specific internalizer. And obviously, painful part of that, the ability for internalizers to make good on broken trades is another area that they focus on. 
There are a range of services that internalizers provide. But if we could make it so that -- I mean the fact is they really just can't put a lot of orders into our platform, because we don't have the ability to offer sub-penny pricing, and that is where they're getting executed. So that is -- that will break down a barrier. But we have to look holistically at the range of things that we do and what we can do to attract more retail flow in. 
One point is in Europe, actually, most retail orders actually come to the NASDAQ Nordic platform. It's -- we have great relationships, direct relationships with the retail brokers, and they execute their trades. They place their orders in our book, they're visible and so that they get more order interaction and they have a great execution experience. So we do think that if you level the playing field, we can compete for that order flow."

So challenges in the past have been -- there's a lot of them. So one is just the inefficiency that exists in the system and as well as kind of the hesitancy in the past for private companies to offer liquidity options. I think that's been, frankly, the biggest impediment in the past. Private companies, obviously, when they bring in early-stage investors, they want them to be in there for a long time. When they issue equity to their employees, they want their employees to be locked up for a long time. 
However, today, it's a very, very vibrant environment, and private companies are staying private longer. And over time, they realized that unlocking liquidity is actually can be value accretive, because number one, their employees, over time, they want to buy houses and send their kids to school and be able to use their equity in ways that help manage their lives. 
And so offering a fair way and in a high-integrity way to offer that liquidity is really important -- the fact and to attract talent to these days to have some sort of liquidity program as part of talent acquisition for our private companies becoming more interesting and something that you're seeing. 
The second is that, obviously, getting early-stage investors some returns and then bringing in later-stage investors who can carry the firms over time into the public markets is highly, highly interesting. And so there's just been this really steady increase in corporate interest in liquidity, and we've seen an acceleration of that in the last couple of years. Private companies are really balancing. Do we go public? Do we stay private? If we stay private, how do we make sure that we have a nice liquidity capability within the company? 
And then, of course, with direct listings, there's what we call continuous trading programs that are being developed in advance of those companies tapping the public market. So I think all of those things have accelerated the interest and now it's a matter of us really bringing together the institutional community, the venture community and the private company community to -- and our -- obviously, our technology capabilities and our market know-how to say, okay, how do we catalyze this into a really robust and efficient liquidity marketplace. 
So we see this as being just a huge opportunity. In terms of the total market opportunity, it's hard to measure something that doesn't exist. But when we look at it and say, where do we think the liquidity could be and what kind of revenue opportunity could there be, we actually sized it anywhere between kind of $500 million to $1.5 billion. So it's a big opportunity that we're going after over the next 5 to 10 years."

And so your math seems pretty accurate. I think that in terms of the way that we are approaching this business is we see a very long-term high-growth opportunity, right? So the overall anti-financial crime space is growing at like 17% a year. It's a huge, huge opportunity, $6 billion to $8 billion TAM or SAM frankly, not -- the TAM is much bigger, but the SAM is in that range. 
And so if we invest in the platform, we are actively investing and we will continue actively to invest in the platform to make sure we can continue the kind of growth that they're exhibiting today. And so we've talked about this when we've actually been pretty clear as to the fact that we're not really maximizing margin. Right now, we're going to be maximizing growth. 
And the EBITDA when we talked about it upon acquisitions in the range of 25%, and we expect that we will try to kind of maintain that kind of margin while we're growing as fast as we can. But over time, obviously, as the space matures, we have -- but there certainly are ways that we can scale it. But right now, we're going to maintain that growth mode still be able to deliver a really nice bottom line in a high-growth business to our shareholders."

One is in the anti-financial crime space, the second is in the investment Solovis kind of space in terms of asset owner or asset management, workflow solutions, particularly focused on the private markets there. And then the third is in ESG. 
But we also do look at things that are in corporate services like Puro.earth is a marketplace that really serves corporates for carbon removals. We continue to find ways that we want to serve our corporate clients in our marketplace solutions. And so we will always -- we look holistically at acquisition opportunities, but we have these 3 focus areas that I mentioned.

Okay. Well, I think that we're going to close it out. So thank you very much for your time today, and we're really pleased to see that our business is delivering strong revenue growth for the quarter and for the year. Guided by our strategic direction, we have a clear focus for the remainder of 2021 as we reimagine markets to realize the potential of tomorrow.

I would",2443,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's second quarter 2021 financial and business performance as well as the progress we've made to drive forward along our strategic direction. I would like to begin by acknowledging the Nasdaq team's deep commitment in delivering results for our clients while creating sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. 
Nasdaq's mission reflects our focus on becoming the premier platform and ecosystem for the global capital markets and beyond with unmatched technology, insights and markets expertise, and we made important progress during the second quarter. Our financial results demonstrate our business' ability to capture opportunity in a unique economic environment even as we continue to strengthen its position for long-term growth.
We see strong demand for many of our products and services as corporate issuers, institutional investors, banks, brokers and marketplace operators, all navigate today's rapidly changing world. Our core foundational marketplaces benefited from an active capital market backdrop that saw record-setting industry, U.S. equity and options trading volumes in the first half of 2021. Our client-first model has also driven our ability to win the majority of new listings in one of the strongest periods of industry activity in years. 
Meanwhile, expanding demand from institutional owners for index strategies as well as asset allocation and portfolio management tools from banks for modern anti-financial crime solutions and from corporates for ESG and investor relations solutions underpinned our performance in the Solutions segment businesses. Our performance in these businesses is also a testament to our client-centric approach and strategically-aligned offerings as we invest in and grow new and innovative technology to meet that demand. 
We also achieved other important milestones against our corporate journey this quarter. First, Nasdaq completed the sale of our U.S. fixed income business to Tradeweb Markets at the end of the second quarter. Second, we announced our strategic investment in Puro.earth, a leading carbon removal marketplace. Along with the launch of our new ESG Data Hub, these solutions further expand the ways that we can partner with our clients to support their unique sustainability efforts. 
And third, we announced yesterday that we are starting an exciting next chapter for the Nasdaq Private Market as part of a partnership with a group of leading banks in the private market space. It highlights both the success of the private market platform we developed at Nasdaq and the growing interest in developing a robust ecosystem for private company liquidity. All of these actions underscore our commitment to our strategy and allow us to reprioritize elements of our unique business model to advance our focus on the most impactful secular opportunities.
I will now turn to our financial results from the second quarter of 2021. Overall, Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $846 million, an increase of $147 million or 21% from the prior year period, driven by 18% organic revenue growth in our Solutions segments, and 10% organic growth in our Market Services businesses.
We continue to execute against key secular growth opportunities as illustrated by strong momentum in our institutional investor analytics and anti-financial crime solutions businesses well as the broad-based growth in total company ARR of $1.8 billion. This equated to an increase of 22% compared to the prior year period, reflecting both the acquisition of Verafin and a 12% increase in our existing ARR.
Turning now to specific segment highlights from the second quarter. I will begin with our foundational marketplace and corporate businesses. Our Market Services segment saw net revenues of $312 million, a 13% increase from the prior year period. Market Services transactional revenues, the sum of our cash equity, equity derivatives and fixed income commodities trading businesses increased by 27% in total in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the prior year period, with the largest contributor of this being our equity derivatives revenues where we experienced strong increases in U.S. options industry volume. 
Nasdaq's Options Markets specifically traded $782 million of multiply-listed options contracts, an increase of 28% year-over-year. Driven by an active dynamic equities market, we have also seen increased levels of activity from companies seeking to tap the public market to raise capital, which has resulted in a 13% increase in the overall number of operating companies listed on the U.S. on NASDAQ in the last 12 months.
Specifically, we have 352 more operating companies listed on Nasdaq in the U.S. than we did in June of 2020. The increase in our number of listed companies naturally contributes to higher industry volumes and contributes to higher trading on Nasdaq in particular, since we have approximately 2x higher market share in our own listed stocks than we have in stocks listed in other markets.
I would also like to highlight for a moment another record-breaking Nasdaq Closing Cross during the annual Russell U.S. Indexes reconstitution, which occurred in late June. The Closing Cross successfully executed 2.3 billion shares of Nasdaq-listed securities, representing approximately $81 billion in market value and occurred in under 2 seconds. This Closing Cross was 760 million shares larger than our second largest Closing Cross ever, which occurred in March of this year with the triple witch expiration. I'm incredibly proud of our team as this milestone underscores our leadership in operating the industry's most robust and resilient market infrastructure.
Next, our Corporate Platform segment delivered revenues of $154 million, a 22% increase year-over-year. The business continues to thrive with elevated levels of new listings since the market recovery in the second half of 2020. In our listings business, Nasdaq again led U.S. exchanges for IPOs during the period, welcoming 135 IPOs that raised $31.7 billion, including 88 operating company IPOs and 47 SPAC IPOs. 
The Nasdaq Stock Market led U.S. exchanges with a 78% total win rate on IPOs as well as executing the largest direct listing ever, Coinbase. In addition to new listings, we also welcomed 10 switches from the -- in the second quarter of 2021, representing a combined $183 billion in market value, including Honeywell, a Dow 30 company. The total market value of all companies transferring to Nasdaq since 2016 now exceeds $1 trillion. Meanwhile, our Nordic listing platform hosted 62 IPOs in the second quarter, bringing the total to 86 in the first half of 2021, contributing to an 11% year-over-year increase in the Nordic-listed issuer base compared to the prior year quarter. 
Nasdaq is proud to be the exchange partner supporting companies throughout their corporate life cycle with our commitment to providing issuers with an industry-leading market model and a full suite of investor relations, Board engagement and ESG solutions. Revenues in our IR and ESG services increased $4 million or 8% to $56 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year period as we continue to see strong demand for our investor relations and advisory and ESG product offerings. The economic impacts of the pandemic, combined with the sudden and likely lasting landscape of virtual or hybrid investor engagement, has increased corporates' focus on investor relationships and has accelerated their professionalization of their ESG programs, both of which has intensified the demand for new data and tools to power their programs.
Now let me take a minute to talk about the actions we've taken to advance the Nasdaq Private Market going forward. This week, we announced an agreement to contribute Nasdaq Private Market into a joint venture with Silicon Valley Bank, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. This creates a new entity to build upon NPM's success, becoming the leading marketplace platform for issuer-led private company tender transactions. The partnership will enable increased investment in a broader set of capabilities to designed to enhance NPM's position as the go-to marketplace for private company liquidity.
Nasdaq Private Market will continue to expand from its foundation of facilitating private company tender programs to enhance and refine its buy-side book building, auctions, investor block trades and pre-direct listing continuous trading programs. Additionally, the platform will provide end-to-end settlement, and through the new ownership structure, will create a unique and powerful distribution network serving private companies and institutional investors. Nasdaq's Market Technology business will be contracted to supply NPM with this -- as technology platform on a go-forward basis. 
Nasdaq Private Market's talented team has made strong progress in the 7 years since we established the business as measured by the close relationships we've built with more than 250 leading private companies worldwide and the more than $30 billion in transaction volume that they've executed for many of the world's largest private companies. This new entity will expand upon that success going forward.
In the last 12 months ended June 30, revenues for Nasdaq Private Market increased $13 million or approximately 200% over the prior year period. Going forward with our partners, we expect to unlock significantly more value for our clients and shareholders by advancing the market for private company shares with a high-integrity, advanced platform that facilitates liquidity in new ways and builds on momentum that we've developed over the past several years. 
Now let me turn to our Market Technology and Investment Intelligence segments. Our Market Technology segment delivered $117 million in revenues, a 39% increase year-over-year, including a 5% organic increase from our existing business and an additional $27 million contribution from Verafin. Revenues in the second quarter of 2021 also included a temporary $10 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue associated with the closing of the Verafin transaction. In our anti-financial crime technology business, revenues increased $29 million or 88%, driven by the inclusion of revenues from Verafin as well as the continued growth in surveillance solutions.
With Verafin as part of Nasdaq for its first full quarter, we continue to find great opportunities, working collaboratively with the Verafin team to open doors to new clients and expand their footprint. Verafin signed 36 new clients during the second quarter, and we remain extremely pleased with the business and its growth potential as it achieves its mission of fighting financial crime.
In our Marketplace Infrastructure Technology business, revenues increased $4 million or 8% in the second quarter of 2020 -- sorry, 2021, compared to the second quarter of 2020. New order intake for Market Technology hit a 6-quarter high at $81 million, excluding Verafin.
Technology -- Market Technology ARR increased 9% year-over-year, also excluding the impact of Verafin. If you include Verafin, Nasdaq Market Technologies ARR increased 61%.
Turning to our Investment Intelligence segment. We delivered net revenues of $263 million, up $50 million or 23% from the prior year period. Overall assets under management and ETPs benchmarked to Nasdaq's indexes totaled $415 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 53% from the prior year period.
We are pleased to expand our long-standing partnership with Invesco during the second quarter with the launch of 2 new thematic technology ETFs tracking the Nasdaq Biotech Index and the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index. These 2 indexes are the longest-standing benchmarks for their respective sectors and in the past year, have increased in relevance for investors given the recent pandemic-related events.
We also continue to see strong global interest in our index franchise with 12 of 15 new and licensed ETP launches in the second quarter occurring outside of the U.S. We are committed to bringing investment opportunities through our index partnerships and empower investors globally with access to diversified investment opportunities. 
For example, XP Inc., a technology-driven investment management platform in Brazil, launched one of the first locally listed Nasdaq 100 ETF offerings in Latin America during the second quarter. While Hashdex, also from Brazil, partnered with Nasdaq to launch the world's first ETF available in Brazil to investors utilizing the Nasdaq Crypto Index.
During the quarter, 2 ETP sponsors, BlackRock and Vanguard, announced that they would be switching and consolidating their relationships with some index providers. And as a consequence, certain of their products would no longer be licensing Nasdaq indexes. While we're always disappointed to lose sponsors, the loss had a minimal financial impact, which Ann will touch on in her comments. And the continued expansion of our relationships with the broader sponsor universe as well as the continued innovation and growth of the index product suite gives us great cause for optimism going forward. 
Turning next to our Analytics business. We delivered revenues of $50 million, a 14% increase from the prior year period due to growth in eVestment and Solovis revenues from higher new sales and increased retention, driven in part by the success of the enterprise license contracting initiative, which spread usage of eVestment's unique analytics to more users in more business areas of our client base. Lastly, revenues in our Market Data business rose 5% as compared to the prior year period to $106 million, driven primarily by expanding international demand for proprietary data products. 
As our business, our clients and the broader markets begin to prepare to operate in a post-pandemic environment, we are excited to carry forward the strong momentum from the first half of 2021 and into the future. One increased area of focus for us is ESG, which we have seen growing interest from a range of clients in both the U.S. and Europe. Nasdaq's position at the intersection of financial, corporate and regulatory communities gives us a unique perspective on corporate sustainability.  
From this vantage point, we're actively engaging with clients to help them successfully navigate the complex and fast-maturing ESG landscape. We were thrilled to have the opportunity in the second quarter to add Puro.earth's marketplace for carbon removal solutions to help our corporate clients meet their emission reduction commitments. 
At the same time, as a public company ourselves, we engage with our employees and our communities to improve our own practices, performance and transparency on our own ESG journey. In that regard, I encourage our stakeholders to review our recently published and expanded sustainability report, which is available on our website. 
As I wrap up, I want to highlight how each of our businesses has expanded the diversity and depth of their client base in recent years, which underpins the strength and resiliency of the Nasdaq platform as we move through each quarter. Our strong engine of talent and technology is allowing us to expand our position in the capital markets in ways that can capitalize on the powerful secular tailwinds in a post-pandemic period. We're leading Nasdaq into the second half of 2021 with incredible momentum, and I look forward to updating all of you on our progress in the months to come. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Ann to review our financial results in detail."

My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results, and all comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. 
Before we review the financial comparisons and developments, I want to cover some reporting changes going forward related specifically to some of the strategic developments within the business portfolio that Adena mentioned previously. First, with regards to the Nasdaq Private Market or NPM, as recently announced, we have contributed this business to a newly formed joint venture for which we will own a minority interest. As a result, we will no longer consolidate the results and instead we'll be recognizing our share of net income as a nonoperating item, consistent with how we treat other unconsolidated investees.
Second, with regards to both NPM and Nasdaq Fixed Income or NFI, beginning in the third quarter of 2021, we will reclassify the revenue and operating expenses of these 2 businesses out of the Corporate Platforms, Market Services and Investment Intelligence segment results for all prior periods and move them into corporate items so that the business results of each of these segments can be compared to prior periods on a like-for-like basis. On Slide 12, we provide a table previewing the reclassified operating segment results.
Now I will start by reviewing second quarter revenue performance. The 21% increase in reported net revenue of $846 million is a result of organic growth of 15%, including 18% organic increase in the Solutions segment, and a 10% organic increase in Market Services, a 4% positive impact from acquisitions and a 2% positive impact from changes in FX rates.
I will now review the quarterly highlights within each of our reporting segments, as shown on Pages 5 through 8 of the slide presentation. I will start with Investment Intelligence revenue, which increased $50 million or 23%. Organic revenue growth totaled $47 million or 22% and there was a $3 million positive impact from changes in FX rates. 
Organic revenue growth during the period reflects very strong growth in our index business as well as strong contributions from both the Analytics and Market Data businesses. Annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $547 million, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year period. AUM and ETPs licensed to Nasdaq indices rose 53% compared to the prior year period to $415 billion, including $47 billion from net inflows and $113 billion net increase from market appreciation, partially offset by $17 billion in negative net impact related to an ETP sponsor switching its index provider. 
The Investment Intelligence segment operating margin of 65% increased 3 percentage points compared to the prior year period. As Adena mentioned earlier, we will see an additional impact to AUM in the third quarter of 2021 related to previously announced ETP sponsor index switches. The total revenue impact of all of the 2021 switches announced to date is estimated to be approximately $3 million per quarter. 
Market Technology revenue increased $33 million or 39%. The increase reflects organic revenue growth of $4 million or 5%; $27 million from the acquisition of Verafin and a $2 million positive impact from changes in FX rates. Excluding a temporary $10 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenues associated with the Verafin transaction, Verafin revenues would have been $37 million. The organic revenue increase, which excludes revenue generated from Verafin during the first 12 months after the acquisition close, was driven primarily by higher support and licensing revenues and higher SaaS-based surveillance solutions revenues. 
ARR for Market Technology was $432 million in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 9% compared to the prior period, excluding the impact of Verafin. Including Verafin, Market Technology ARR increased 61% in the period.
The Market Technology segment operating margin was 15% in the period. Market Technology expenses include a partial reversal of the reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 of approximately $6 million as we finalize client negotiations and updated our estimate of cost to service our client agreement.
Corporate Platforms revenues increased $28 million or 22%. Organic revenue growth totaled $25 million or 20%, and there was a $3 million impact from changes in FX rates. The organic revenue increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listings revenues due to the expansion in our listed issuer base, together with an increase in IR advisory services and ESG product offering. Corporate Platforms ARR was $509 million and increased 16% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platform segment operating margin of 42% increased 3 percentage points compared to the prior year period and was driven by both the continued increase in the listed issuer base and strong activity on the Nasdaq Private Market. 
Market Services net revenues increased $36 million or 13%. The organic revenue increase was $28 million or 10%, and there was an $8 million impact from changes in FX rates. The organic increase during the period primarily reflects increases in equity derivatives and trade management services revenues. The segment operating margin of 65% increased 1 percentage point from the prior year period, reflecting strong operating leverage on trading revenues. 
Turning to Pages 9 and 10 to review both expenses and 2021 guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $65 million to $392 million. The increase reflects a $24 million or 7% organic increase, a $26 million increase from the impact of acquisitions as well as a $15 million increase from the impact of changes in FX rates due to a weaker U.S. dollar. 
The organic expense increase has 2 main drivers: first, higher variable performance-linked compensation expense, reflecting our outstanding revenue growth; and second, increased costs related to what has been a very active capital markets backdrop, including expenses related to increased trading capacity and marketing commitments supporting our listing clients.
We are narrowing our 2021 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.59 billion to $1.62 billion to reflect that our strong and broad-based organic revenue growth in the first half of 2021 has impacted variable expenses like performance-based compensation and marketing commitments. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, if performance continues to be strong in relation to our medium-term growth objectives, we would, as we said last quarter, expect to come in near the high end of this updated expense guidance range. 
Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased $82 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 54% increased 1 percentage point compared to the prior year period. Net interest expense was $33 million in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of $8 million compared to the prior year period due to incremental interest expense related to the financing of the Verafin acquisition. 
The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25% for the second quarter of 2021. For full year 2021, we still expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 27%. And barring any changes in the corporate tax landscape, we expect to come in near the bottom end of the range for the year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the second quarter of 2021 was $316 million or $1.90 per diluted share compared to $256 million or $1.54 per diluted share in the prior year period. 
Turning to Slide 11. Debt decreased by $189 million versus the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to a net reduction of $214 million of commercial paper, partially offset by $24 million increase in eurobond book values caused by a stronger euro. Our total debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.2x, a decrease from 3.4x in the first quarter of 2021. 
During the second quarter of 2021, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $88 million and repurchased common stock in the amount of $248 million. As of June 30, 2021, there was $1.46 billion remaining under the share repurchase authorization. As previously communicated, upon the consummation of the sale of our U.S. fixed income business, we issued approximately 6.2 million shares to a third party. We intend to use the proceeds from the sale as well as available tax benefits, working and clearing capital of this business and other sources to repurchase shares in order to offset the EPS dilution from the sale.
This week, we plan to execute an accelerated share repurchase program for approximately $470 million. Let me talk for a moment about share count expectations. Our average diluted shares outstanding for the second quarter were 166 million. Due to timing, this average reflected only a minimal impact of the $6.2 million NFI-related share issuance. At the end of the second quarter, however, diluted shares outstanding were approximately 172 million. With our plan to execute the accelerated share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2021, at the current share price, we would retire approximately 2 million shares in the third quarter and roughly 0.5 million additional shares in the fourth quarter.
We plan to execute additional repurchases to offset the remaining NFI dilution in 2022 and 2023. We continue to expect EPS dilution from the sale of NFI to be about 2% in the first 12 months following the June 25 close, but to diminish to immaterial levels after that. 
I'll wrap up by saying that these capital reallocation actions, both in terms of the sale of NFI and the related capital return program, support Nasdaq's acceleration of our strategy and allow the company to further concentrate our resources on strategic opportunities. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

So first of all, we are really, really excited about the partnership we've created. And we basically -- we contributed the Nasdaq Private Market asset, the other firms contributed investment dollars so that we can continue to build out the platform and grow and expand the footprint of Nasdaq Private Market going forward. We have a large minority stake, so we are the largest shareholder, and we will retain that. 
In terms of the revenue for the last 12 months, you did the math right, so it's $20 million for -- on an LTM basis. So -- but I would say that we are -- we do think that this is an opportunity for us to really accelerate our progress in the private company share liquidity programs. And we're seeing a lot of interesting and additional programs or interest from institutional investors, from other shareholders to really use the Nasdaq Private Market for price discovery, maybe continuous trading programs and other things like that. 
And we think that with the partners that we have between the West Coast with Silicon Valley Bank and their relationships with the venture community and early-stage private companies, the institutional connections that Citi and Morgan Stanley and Goldman have, and then us as a marketplace operator and our expertise and our relationships with later-stage private companies, it's kind of like this great coming together of talent and network and distribution capabilities. That we think that we can really, really accelerate the progress and create a lot of value for our shareholders even with a large minority interest as opposed to 100% interest. So that is the thesis, and we're really excited to get going with them. And it should actually close pretty quickly. We've gotten a lot of approvals, so we should be able to get this going very quickly."

So first of all, yes, we are definitely seeing progress in terms of growth and demand from clients in Market Tech. So if we talk specifically about the market infrastructure technology side of Market Tech, we're definitely finding new clients to serve, which is exciting. We are continuing to grow the number of crypto markets that we're providing technology to, digital asset markets we're providing technology to. But also, our core clients are -- after a year of a lot of volatility and a lot of focus just on the here and now, they're definitely now focused again on what does it mean for their infrastructure for the future, and our next-gen system is kind of front and center in a lot of clients' minds. 
So the order intake is reflecting, Alex, both some re-upping from existing clients as well as some new clients that have come in. And so it's a really healthy mix. And the conversations that we're seeing around the world are just much more longer-term driven and more focused on the future. So we're excited to see that progressing. 
And now the fact of the matter is, though, we're still not traveling, right? So we're still having to -- we've adjusted, I think, pretty well to a remote environment in terms of delivering for clients, and that was a big adjustment. And obviously, we had challenges associated with that. But we're still delivering in a remote environment, and we're still selling in a remote environment. And so we still think that it will be kind of improvements over time but not something where you're going to see kind of just this huge surge in one period of time. I think that we expect it to be steady improvement in demand and our ability to deliver over time. 
But as I -- on the anti-fin crime side, I should mention on the anti-financial crime side, we're doing really well in selling our market surveillance SaaS solution to new clients still. That was something we launched beginning of 2020 and has had a really nice demand curve there. In terms of our trade surveillance solution, we continue to find ways to expand our client relationships. And then, of course, on Verafin, we mentioned the fact that they had 36 new customers come in, and that business is going really well."

Well, I think the first thing is I believe that we seem to be relatively aligned, at least with the overarching agenda of the SEC right now in terms of thinking about how do you maximize competition, how do you maximize price transparency and how do you maximize market access, right? So -- and make it sure it's fair across both institutional investors and individual investors.
And so if you kind of take that as kind of the principles that they're operating under and certainly the principles we operate under, I think that as they look at all the various components of market structure, our view is that we -- while our solutions may be slightly different or our ideas may be slightly different, there's general alignment. In terms of that, that means things like tick size regimes. Also different incentive programs that might exist are going to be examined. 
I also would say, as we kind of we all know, the markets are working and operating relatively well. So to the extent that we think that there can be constant improvement, that's absolutely the case. But our view is it's better to try incremental iterative improvements than to try something big bang, because the law of unintended consequences are so high. If you make changes to incentive programs, then you have to understand what all the consequences might be from that in terms of retail investors getting access to free trading and making sure at the same time that the quotes reflect the supply -- the actual supply and demand in the market. So a lot of pushes and pulls. 
So Alex, I think that it is still early days. We are certainly in active dialogue with the SEC staff. As they come out with their papers, we'll be there to comment and be a part of that debate. But I -- our view is that right now, at least, there's a general alignment of principles, which we think is -- we obviously have some optimism around."

I mean, I think that when it comes to the growth within Verafin, there's a really nice balance between new logos or new clients and then re-upping and expanding relationships with existing clients. So Verafin is an interesting model. They do weekly release cycles and they enter into these multiyear agreements with clients, but they're literally enhancing the system every single week and bringing a lot of new capabilities in under the existing contract. But when they renew the contract, they kind of point to all these improvements and all the value they've created over the prior several years. And so when they do renew, they tend to renew at a higher rate and often also a broader user base.
So when we look at the growth of revenue, they look at new bookings and then they look at existing client renewals, because those also drive revenue growth. And it's actually been quite balanced. It always has been and it continues to be quite balanced in both areas. 
In terms of the sales strategy, they have an incredible kind of sales approach and sales discipline. They are incredibly metrics-driven and KPI driven. It's amazing to see kind of how they're very disciplined in the way that they do it. They do most of their sales remotely. They always have. They always would like to be able to have conferences and other ways to meet new clients, but they have the ability to do sales successfully in a remote environment. And they've -- I think, luckily that muscle is quite mature. So they haven't had to make a ton of change through the pandemic. 
And in terms of our impact on that, where we've been focused is opening doors to larger clients or to -- maybe they're trying to nurture a new relationship, but they're already a listed customer on Nasdaq. So therefore, we can leverage our relationship manager to open more doors and maybe accelerate the sale process. Or they're very large banking relationships, and so we can kind of get them in front of higher-level executives to pitch their services. 
But their platform itself is a superior platform, so we feel very confident in bringing them to customers and saying, we know that they can do better than whatever the client has existing in their systems. And we've been -- that's the one area we've been collaborating on the most. We have a regular meeting where we go through the pipeline. We examine where we have relationships, where we can stretch them to go to larger clients. And then strategically, how are we going to move them up the value chain and then move them over into Europe."

So the reason why eVestment and Solovis were impacted by COVID was, first of all, we bought Solovis right at the beginning of the pandemic.

So -- but then also kind of thinking about the integrated platform and kind of what -- how do we demonstrate an integrated solution to our clients, that took a little bit longer, too, because of, again, the integration took a little longer. 
But now in the fourth quarter of 2020 and into 2021, you're starting to see that demand pick up in terms of asset owners really understanding the intersection between making an asset allocation decision and then managing their portfolio once they make that decision. And we have solutions that provide and kind of bridge that. So I think that we've definitely seen a nice acceleration of demand. 
And you're seeing that in the growth numbers in the first quarter and second quarter. And we definitely are -- I think that we feel like also investment managers and asset owners are definitely more willing to put money to work to advance their own platforms.

We do bring some foreign issuers into the platform, but it's then they have to kind of go through -- it's a FINRA broker/dealer, so they have to go through and make sure that all the institutional investors are accredited in a way and are registered appropriately.

Verafin has been focused on banks. And -- but the fact is some fintechs have been leveraging banks in order to manage their fraud and AML detection programs. 
And so what Verafin will do is they'll put the platform into the bank and then the bank will then kind of become a subcontractor to the fintech. Well, over time, I think that Verafin understands that really they could become, obviously, a direct provider to those fintechs, and then that would be the case, of course, with the D5 providers as well. And some -- I think that they have really, truly a superior -- particularly on fraud detection and AML detection as well. There's a network effect that they have because they have 2,000 banks in their network that allow for them to, frankly, just be better at eliminating false positives and focusing in on real potential fraud issues. 
So we do think that we have a chance to expand there, and they're very excited about that as a near-term opportunity.

I mean it certainly is an issue of not having a level playing field between us and dark pools and internalizers. So we certainly think it gives us an opportunity to be able to draw in more flow.

So we certainly think it gives us an opportunity to be able to draw in more flow. I think though that when you look at the internalization, there are multiple factors that drive a retail broker to a specific internalizer. And obviously, paying for flow is part of that. The ability for internalizers to make good on broken trades is another area that they focus on. There are a range of services that internalizers provide. 
But if we could make it so that -- I mean, the fact is they really just can't put a lot of orders into our platform because we don't have the ability to offer sub-penny pricing, and that is where they're getting executed. So that is -- that will break down a barrier. But we have to look holistically at the range of things that we do and what we can do to attract more retail flow in.
One point is in Europe. Actually, most retail orders actually come to the Nasdaq Nordic platform. It's -- we have great relationships, direct relationships with the retail brokers, and they execute their trades. They place their orders in our book, they're visible and so that they get more order interaction and they have a great execution experience. So we do think that if you level the playing field, we can compete for that order flow."

And frankly, BlackRock and Vanguard remain clients, just smaller ones. And so we feel very good about all of the partnerships we have with our clients. 
I think that obviously, any time a sponsor switches, you do a self-reflection, and you want to make sure that we're doing -- we're giving them absolutely the best service possible. And so we will continue to make improvements across our business just to make sure that we're the ones they switch to, and we have certainly been the ones -- the index provider that other sponsors have switched to in the past. So we feel very good about our platform, but we can always improve. And -- but I would say this is not something that's frequent.
The other thing is some of the sponsors have also made other switches. So it's not -- we're not the only ones that they've made a decision around. They've made decisions around other providers as well. 
In terms of pricing, we don't see this as a reason to examine pricing. It really has -- it has to do with -- we feel very good about the way that we price our products. We do that based on the complexity of an index, the uniqueness of the index, the types of investors we're trying to attract into the index and what's the size and scope of the opportunity.

So one is just the inefficiency that exists in the system and as well as kind of the hesitancy in the past for private companies to offer liquidity options. I think that's been, frankly,",466,"Great. So challenges in the past have been -- there's a lot of them. So one is just the inefficiency that exists in the system and as well as kind of the hesitancy in the past for private companies to offer liquidity options. I think that's been, frankly, the biggest impediment in the past. Private companies, obviously, when they bring in early-stage investors, they want them to be in there for a long time. When they issue equity to their employees, they want their employees to be locked up for a long time.
However, today, it's a very, very vibrant environment, and private companies are staying private longer. And over time, they realize that unlocking liquidity is actually can be value accretive, because number one, their employees, over time, they want to buy houses and send their kids to school and be able to use their equity in ways that help manage their lives. 
And so offering a fair way and in a high-integrity way to offer that liquidity is really important. The second -- and to attract talent, these days, to have some sort of liquidity program as part of talent acquisition for private company is becoming more interesting and something that you're seeing. The second is that, obviously, getting early-stage investors some returns and then bringing in later-stage investors who can carry firms over time into the public market is highly, highly interesting. 
And so there's just been this really steady increase in corporate interest in liquidity, and we've seen an acceleration of that in the last couple of years. Private companies are really balancing, do we go public? Do we stay private? If we stay private, how do we make sure that we have a nice liquidity capability within the company? And then, of course, with direct listings, there's what we call continuous trading programs that are being developed in advance of those companies tapping the public market. 
So I think all of those things have accelerated the interest, and now it's a matter of us really bringing together the institutional community, the venture community and the private company community to -- and our -- obviously, our technology capabilities and our market know-how to say, okay, how do we catalyze this into a really robust and efficient liquidity marketplace. So we see this as being just a huge opportunity. 
In terms of the total market opportunity, it's hard to measure something that doesn't exist. But when we look at it and say, what do we think -- where do we think the liquidity could be and what kind of revenue opportunity could there be, we actually sized it anywhere between kind of $500 million to $1.5 billion. So it's a big opportunity that we're going after over the next 5 to 10 years."

One is in the anti-financial crime space. The second is in the investment, Solovis kind of space in terms of asset owner or asset management, workflow solutions, particularly focused on the private markets there. And then the third is in ESG. 
But we also do look at things that are in corporate services. Like Puro.earth is a marketplace that really serves corporates for carbon removals. We continue to find ways that we want to serve our corporate clients in our marketplace solutions.

Thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's third quarter 2021 performance, the progress we're making on our strategic repositioning and updates on areas where we are making significant investments to address large opportunities. I'll also share brief remarks about the current operating environment before I turn the call over to Ann, who will provide further details about our results as well as an update on our guidance, our capital deployment and our corporate sustainability efforts before we move to Q&A. 
Let me begin by acknowledging the Nasdaq team's dedication to our broader mission as we made notable progress in the third quarter. Their hard work has been critical to our success in delivering strong results for our clients. Together, we will continue our journey to become the leading provider of technology, data analytics, insights and marketplace excellence to the global capital markets and beyond. 
Now turning to our financial results for the third quarter of 2021. Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $838 million, an increase of $123 million or 17% from the prior year period. Our growth was largely driven by 13% organic revenue growth in our Solutions segment, 14% organic growth in our Market Services business and contributions from our acquisition of Verafin. 
We continue to make notable progress across key secular growth opportunities as illustrated by total company annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, of $1.834 billion, an increase of 19% compared to the prior year period. Within our recurring revenue businesses, we are seeing some of our best performances from our SaaS-based solutions. Specifically, Anti Financial Crime Technology is showing particularly strong results with revenues increasing 16%, excluding the impact of Verafin. Verafin will begin to be included in our organic growth calculations next year, and we saw an increase of over 30% versus prior year in that business. 
Additionally, in our Investment Intelligence business, our SaaS products, including the Nasdaq Asset Owner Solutions, which is the new name for the combined eVestment and Solovis products, drove the 13% increase in Analytics revenue. Our third quarter results underscore the continued progress we've made to advance our strategy and additionally, demonstrate the value capture from the flywheel effect, which is our ability to leverage the momentum in one business area to drive success in other parts of the business. 
For example, our success in attracting the majority of the quarter's new listings and capital raised to Nasdaq drives higher growth in equities and options trading and multiplies cross-sell opportunities for our Investor Relations and ESG-related services. It also contributes to the vitality of the R Index business, like the Nasdaq-100 and the Nasdaq Next-Gen100 indexes and enhances the brand's strength in other strategic growth areas of the company. 
As we continue to evolve Nasdaq into a high-performance technology company, each quarter that passes gives us an opportunity to reflect on the progress we've made. A critical pillar of our success has been our ability to allocate capital towards our technology and analytics capabilities. Our acquisition of Verafin has established us as a leader in Anti Financial Crime Technology as we build upon our already strong foundation in that area of the market. In the third quarter, our legacy Trade Surveillance segment saw the largest quarterly order intake in the last several years, adding new business across all regions. While our market surveillance group signed 2 new clients for our SaaS-based solutions, including a new crypto exchange clients. 
Another pillar has been our ability to advance our leading corporate and marketplace positions. Corporate Platforms' revenues increased 18% versus the prior year period, driven primarily by outstanding growth in the Nasdaq-listed issuer base across our U.S. and Nordic markets. It has been a record year so far for new listings in the Nordics and with over 132 new listings coming to Nasdaq year-to-date. Additionally, the U.S. has experienced the best new issuance here in the past 2 decades. And Nasdaq continues to demonstrate strength with a 75% win rate for IPOs in the quarter and a 72% win rate year-to-date. 
As our listed issuer base grows, we're seeing correlated demand for our suite of IR and ESG services. Within ESG specifically, we see continued interest in our Nasdaq OneReport and our ESG Advisory Solutions coming from very -- from companies at every stage of their ESG journey, including companies preparing to list on Nasdaq. I would like to acknowledge briefly here that we are pleased with the SEC's approval during the quarter of our proposal to enhance board diversity disclosures. While there have been meaningful developments to advance board diversity across the governance ecosystem, we believe the standardized manner by which Nasdaq-listed companies will disclose this information will be critical to driving further progress. We look forward to working with our listed companies to implement the new listing rules. 
Market Services is another area of our business where we are seeing that flywheel-related success. Our expanded issuer base benefits equity trading since our share of trading and average capture rate is significantly higher in Nasdaq-listed stocks than it is in stocks listed on other venues. An expanded ecosystem of equity trading in turn brings positive impacts to the options industry where Nasdaq led all exchanges in the third quarter and the U.S. Equity Options contracts traded. We're also excited by the early progress we're seeing in the growing suite of ESG-related capital market solutions within Market Services. These include the Nasdaq Sustainable Bond Network, our European green bond listing service, our carbon removal marketplace, Puro.Earth, as well as the expansion of our Nordic ESG derivatives offering. 
Overall, our Market Services segment saw revenues increase 15% in the third quarter versus the prior year. And this was largely driven by increases in equity derivatives and cash equity net revenues, although all subsegments of Market Services delivered year-over-year increases. 
Our Investment Intelligence business saw revenues increase 30% during the third quarter compared to the prior year period. I'm sorry. Our Investment Intelligence businesses saw revenues increased 15% in the third quarter compared to the prior year period. This was driven by a combination of geographic expansion in our Market Data business, higher assets under management and exchange-traded products linked to the Nasdaq indexes as well as strong new sales, higher client retention and take-up of new capabilities across the Analytics offerings. 
Our Index business continued its strong 2021 performance in the third quarter with revenues up 38% compared versus the prior year on a combination of both strong market performance of our most important dramatic indexes as well as very material net inflows. We're especially pleased to see positive responses from the market to some of our newer products in our Index franchise with notable AUM growth in the Invesco innovation suite, the new Moray ETF tracking, the Philex semiconductor index and the [indiscernible] products linked to the Nasdaq Crypto Index. More broadly, AUM and Nasdaq-licensed ETPs launched since 2019 reached $13 billion at the end of the third quarter. 
We are also unlocking new areas of innovation in our Analytics business to bring more data and transparency to the institutional marketplace. This includes a significant partnership announced in July with Mercer, a leading consultant for institutional asset owners that gives our asset owner clients broader access to high-quality research on investment managers and their various investment strategies through a simplified workflow, enabling deeper due diligence. We expect this partnership to expand our clients' usage of our asset owner solutions going forward. 
While we continue our strategic journey, I would like to highlight next how we are measuring our progress in evolving the company at the highest level using 2 key metrics. First, our year-to-date organic revenue growth across the Solutions segment continues to meet or exceed the medium-term outlook of 6% to 9% annualized growth that we initiated after adding Verafin. Our 2021 year-to-date organic growth across the Solutions segment is 15%. 
Secondly, because we are growing our SaaS revenues even more quickly than the 19% increase in ARR year-over-year, the total percentage of ARR that we are generating from our SaaS businesses rose to 34% at the end of the third quarter. This is up from 28% in the prior year period and continues to move us closer to our medium-term objective of 40% to 50% by 2025. 
We are very pleased with the progress that our teams continue to make regarding SaaS contributions to our revenues, both organically and inorganically. Here are 2 brief examples that demonstrate our progress and innovation to support this growth. It has been 8 months since we completed the acquisition of Verafin, and our collaboration to date affirms our belief that this combination can accelerate new opportunities. This is particularly the case with larger Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks and those international banks from outside of Verafin's traditional customer franchise in North America. The Verafin team is executing on its strategy to further penetrate Tier 2 banks, which we define as banks holding total assets of $50 billion. And we secured another significant win during the quarter through our joint efforts. While we still have significant developments in progress to unlock broader adoption among new customer groups, our early milestones certainly validate the potential that we have identified together. 
Additionally, we continue to evolve our cloud-based data offerings with the launch of the Nasdaq Data Link in September. This new platform includes a comprehensive suite of core data covering financial markets, investment fund information and alternative data to every segment of the investment landscape. It's the perfect illustration of our SaaS evolution in a key growth area at Nasdaq, and it underscores our ability to give clients an efficient means to consume and manage market-related data sets in the cloud, which is becoming a standard practice for many users. Initial interest in Nasdaq Data Link is encouraging. The platform has seen daily average of 3,000 new visitors and 200 new account activations in the weeks following the launch. 
Next, I will briefly address areas of our business where factors impacting the current operating landscape are particularly relevant today and in the near term. By and large, we continue to operate within the confines of the pandemic. While there has been slow progress to enable in-person activities and on-site client visits, it remains far from the environment in which we operated prior to March of 2020. We are, however, fortunate that our diversified business model allows us to be executing at a very high level across our operations despite the prolonged backdrop of the pandemic. 
The logistical challenges of COVID-19 to travel, intense collaboration and on-site installation and integration have had their highest impact on the Market Infrastructure Technology business within our Market Technology segment. We have had several complex clearing and post-trade implementation projects that have experienced longer time lines and have required more resources to progress. These challenges have slowed revenue recognition and have increased near-term implementation expenses, impacting near-term margins and creating short-term capacity constraints despite growing demand from clients. 
The second half of 2021 continues to be heavily impacted by this dynamic. And with this business having relatively high revenue visibility and clear capacity constraints, we know now that in the near term, Market Infrastructure Technology revenue growth within the broader Market Technology segment will continue to be impacted in 2022 even if the underlying logistical challenges of the pandemic improve. 
On the other hand, in our Corporate Platforms business, the pandemic period has created some efficiencies on to the go public process. Notably, IPO road shows have turned virtual, making them more efficient for companies and investors. The new efficiencies have contributed to investors' ability to evaluate the multitude of new issuers and have increased bankers' capacity to support companies going through the IPO process. As of today, the pipeline for new listings remains robust based on the number of active S-1 registrations on file with the SEC. Assuming current market conditions persist, we have a strong visibility into the upcoming 6 months, and we anticipate this momentum to continue as we enter the final months of the year and into at least the first quarter of 2022. 
Turning to how we envision our ability to sustain sizable growth in the long term, I see 2 key elements to our potential future -- sorry, our future potential. First, we have evolved Nasdaq's businesses to focus on critical capabilities that are strategically important to our clients, and we have become more client-centric than ever. This evolution has allowed us to focus on providing the right data, insights and technology that our clients need to be successful across the capital markets today and tomorrow. 
Second, we have strong competitive positions in very sizable markets with -- in the key areas of growth for Nasdaq. It is a combined serviceable, addressable market of $20 billion across our Anti Financial Crime and Trade Surveillance technologies, our indexes and investment analytics solutions as well as our Investor Relations governance and ESG services. Based on our traction in these growth businesses today, we are incredibly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us. 
As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are entering the final months of 2021 with remarkable momentum as we make steady and consistent progress across our key growth areas and our foundational marketplace businesses. Combined with the favorable capital markets and macroeconomic backdrop, we remain well positioned to advance our strategy into '22 -- in 2022 and beyond. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Ann to review the financial results in greater detail."
740535,1681484562,2407974,"Nasdaq, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Nasdaq, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results, and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our pre",1618,"Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results, and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. 
I will start by reviewing third quarter performance beginning on Slide 11 of the presentation. The 17% increase in reported net revenue of $838 million is the net result of organic growth of 13%, including 13% organic increase in the Solutions segment and a 14% organic increase in Market Services; and the contribution from Verafin as well as the impact from divestitures. 
Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 20% while the non-GAAP operating margin of 53% increased 1 percentage point compared to the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the third quarter of 2021 was $303 million or $1.78 per diluted share compared to $256 million or $1.53 per diluted share in the prior year period. 
Turning to Slide 12. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $1.834 billion, an increase of 19% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $620 million, an increase of 42%. Excluding the impact of Verafin, ARR increased 10% year-over-year. 
I will now review quarterly segment results on Slides 13 through 16. Starting with Market Technology. Revenue increased $28 million or 33%. The increase reflects the positive $29 million impact from the acquisition of Verafin and a $5 million increase in our existing Anti Financial Crime Technology business. partially offset by an organic revenue decline of $6 million in our Market Infrastructure Technology business. 
Excluding a $3 million FX impact as well as the $7 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue associated with the closing of the Verafin transaction, Verafin revenues would have been $39 million in the third quarter period and Anti Financial Crime Technology would have been $73 million, with both our existing surveillance and Verafin's [indiscernible] Solution continuing to exhibit strong momentum. 
The revenue decline within the Market Infrastructure Technology business was driven primarily by the planned roll-off of a sizable maintenance and support licensing contract with a customer who will continue to use our technology under our license agreement as well as a decrease more broadly in change requests and installation revenues, a consequence of both a strong comparison period in the third quarter of 2020 and capacity constraints we're working through due to logistical implications of the pandemic. 
ARR for Market Technology was $428 million in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 54% compared to the prior year period. The Market Technology segment operating margin was 9% in the period. Excluding the impact of the previously mentioned $7 million purchase price adjustment related to Verafin, the operating margin would have been 14%. 
Investment Intelligence revenue increased $36 million or 15%, all of which was organic. Organic revenue growth during the period reflects very strong growth in our Index business as well as a meaningful contribution from Analytics. 
Annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $555 million, an increase of 9% compared to the prior year period. AUM and ETPs licensed to Nasdaq indices rose 15% compared to the prior year period to $361 billion, including $53 billion from net inflows and an $87 billion net increase from market appreciation, partially offset by a $92 billion negative impact related to the previously discussed ETP sponsor switches. These switches collectively were associated with about a $3 million in run rate quarterly revenues, which will be fully reflected in our revenues for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
The Investment Intelligence segment operating margin of 65% is unchanged compared to the prior year period as we continue to make strategic investments in Index and Analytics to support sustained growth. 
Corporate Platforms revenues increased $24 million or 18%, reflecting organic growth. The increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. Listings revenues due to the expansion in our listed issuer base as well as higher adoption across the breadth of our Investor Relations and newer ESG advisory and reporting offerings. 
Corporate Platforms ARR was $529 million and increased 17% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platforms segment operating margin of 42% increased 3 percentage points compared to the prior year period. 
Market Services net revenues increased $39 million or 15%. The organic revenue increase was $37 million or 14%, and there was a $2 million positive impact from changes in FX rates. The organic increase reflects higher Equity Derivatives, Cash Equities and Trade Management Services revenues. The segment operating margin of 63% increased 3 percentage points from the prior year period, reflecting strong operating leverage on higher trading revenues. One modeling item to note is that for the fourth quarter of 2021 and January '22, we have waived the collection of certain regulatory fees for 4 of our U.S. Equity Options markets. This is in order to ensure that collection of the fees, in combination with other regulatory fees and fines, does not exceed our regulatory costs. Holding all else equal, the removal of the fee is expected to reduce our reported capture rate by approximately $0.015 per contract in the fourth quarter of 2021 and approximately $0.005 per contract in the first quarter of 2022. 
Turning to Page 17 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $51 million to $397 million. The increase reflects a $26 million or 8% organic increase, a $21 million increase from the net impact of acquisition and divestitures as well as a $4 million increase from the impact of changes in FX rates due to a weaker U.S. dollar. The organic expense increase has 2 main drivers: first, higher compensation expense reflecting our continued investment to drive growth and an increase in variable performance-linked compensation due to our outstanding results; and second, increased costs related to what has been a very active capital markets backdrop, including expenses related to increased trading capacity and marketing commitments supporting our listing clients. Consistent with what we said last quarter about expenses coming in near the high end of the range if performance continues to be strong in relation to our medium-term growth objectives, we are narrowing our 2021 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.605 billion to $1.62 billion from $1.59 billion to $1.62 billion previously. The updated range reflects the impact of strong and broad-based organic revenue growth in the first 9 months of 2021 on variable expenses. 
Turning to Slide 18. Debt increased by $226 million versus 2Q '21, primarily due to net issuances of $259 million of commercial paper, primarily used to fund the accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR, and a net increase of $19 million of Eurobonds from refinancing our 2023 Eurobond with a 2033 Eurobond during the quarter. This is partially offset by a $52 million decrease in Eurobond book values caused by a weaker euro. 
Our total debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.2x, unchanged from the second quarter of 2021. During the third quarter of 2021, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $90 million and repurchased common stock in the amount of $475 million, including the initial delivery of approximately 2 million shares of common stock related to the ASR agreement we entered into in July. We expect to receive the remaining shares related to the ASR in the fourth quarter of 2021 and for additional planned repurchases related to the sale of our U.S. Fixed Income business to resume in 2022. 
As of September 30, 2021, there was $984 million remaining under the share repurchase authorization. We continue to expect EPS dilution from the sale of Nasdaq Fixed Income to be about 2% in the first 12 months following the June 25 close but to diminish to immaterial levels after that. 
Turning to Slide 19. I want to begin regularly addressing our focus on ESG elements of our business, both internally and externally, because we believe Nasdaq has an important set of opportunities in terms of our sustainability and external impact, and we have a strong momentum in executing against them. We're committed to the highest level of sustainability in terms of how we run our businesses and serve all of our stakeholders, but also have positioned ourselves to develop high impact outside of the organization through our anti-fincrime solutions, our carbon removal marketplace, Puro, and our unique ESG products and services offer to our corporate clients as well as our efforts to further our corporate purpose through focused philanthropy and volunteerism. Our purpose is to champion inclusive growth and prosperity, and we have chosen to emphasize financial literacy and extensive entrepreneurship education and support within underserved communities throughout the U.S. 
During 2021, we've expanded our ESG disclosures with new climate reporting and task force on climate-related financial commitments. Additionally, we have substantially expanded our Anti Financial Crime and ESG products and services capabilities. And we've received FCC approval for our listing rule, promoting increased transparency on board diversity. We have much to do to continue executing on our ESG opportunities, but we were very encouraged to see Sustainalytics, a leading provider of ESG research and ratings, recently recognized our progress in these areas. Our latest Sustainalytics ESG risk rating improved to a level that puts Nasdaq in the top 3 percentile of all rated companies. We look forward to updating you on a regular basis as we progress our ESG initiatives going forward. 
Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

I guess you're having tremendous success with the annual growth of annual recurring revenues and the mix of SaaS revenues in there.

And so we do look at -- we examine every element of our business. Our core marketplace business really serves as our foundation for our ability to serve our clients in a lot of other ways. So we're extremely focused on it. I think that we've seen some shifts in market share as well as just in a couple of different dynamics. One has been the increase in retail, which has increased internalization and just -- and decreased overall exchange's share of trading. And I think that within that, that's an area that obviously we're seeing some more work done by the regulators just to understand that dynamic. 
I think that the second is, of course, the launch of some new exchanges that have come forward. And they have actually primarily focused on gathering some of that retail order flow and trying to compete for it. So we have really taken a very balanced approach in terms of being strategic in how we serve our clients. We want to make sure that we provide kind of a sustainable marketplace, that we do things in a competitive way, but also creates a sustainable advantage for our markets and for our clients that operate in our markets. And so we've taken, I would say, a very measured and balanced approach to managing share, managing capture and evaluating kind of the composition of trading in the markets to make sure that we're kind of balanced there. And that I would say that applies to both our equities and options markets and how we're looking at our share and capture and the dynamics there."

Well, first of all, I do think the environment is starting to generally improve in terms of being able to travel a bit now. But we're still doing most of our client interactions on Zoom, and that makes it harder. It's also harder to develop the kind of what I would call the top end of the pipeline, the top end of the funnel in terms of identifying new clients. But I do think we've done a good job of adapting there to try to make sure that we know which new marketplaces are starting to consider launching and how we can serve them. So you're seeing that we are still signing up new clients, for sure. They are taking our SaaS-based marketplace solutions, which we're also pretty excited about. I think more than 90% of our new clients, any new clients that's signing up for us across all of Market Tech, and that includes Market Infrastructure Technology clients as well as anti-fincrime. Actually, it's well more than 90% are taking our SaaS-based solutions, and that includes new markets launching in the cloud and taking our next-gen trading system. 
So we see a good pipeline, I would say, Rich. And we also see that we could do more, and we definitely want to be able to identify client opportunities a little earlier and travel will help with that. But I also would say that on the post-trade side, which is where we've really experienced most of our delivery challenges, those are harder to implement. They take -- they're multiyear programs. They always have been. But they are definitely lengthening out in time with our inability to be on site. We are starting to get on site now with some of our clients, and that's helping, definitely helping to accelerate things. And I also think that it's keeping us from being able to meet all the demands that our clients have. So we do see good strong client demand there, but we have to make sure that we have the resources to be able to meet the demand. So we've been working with our clients to kind of stage that over time. And that's what I think is going to is what we really were referring to in our comments around 2021 and 2022 is just that we see the need for us to manage through those capacity constraints before we can really meet all the demands that our clients have."

I think that there are 2 metrics that we've provided to our investor base to kind of measure our progress in the business. One is just our overall medium- to long-term growth outlook on revenues and then the other is this notion of the rule of 40, which is really a combination of the growth in the revenues and the EBITDA margin of the business. And so what our outlook is, is that we expect to be able to deliver 13% to 16% annualized growth over the coming 3- to 5-year period across Market Technology. And that includes the Market Infrastructure Technology business and the Anti Financial Crime business together. And we do continue to believe that, that is an appropriate expectation of growth for the business going forward. 
I think that the -- on the rule of 40, what we've communicated is that we wanted to get to a rule of 40, which is, as I said, the combination of growth in EBITDA by 2023, and we continue to see ourselves on track for that. So you have to think about this as a shorter-term or at least a near-term challenge that we're having to work our way through that part of the business that is most impacted to be able to get ourselves to a better growth state and more scalability as we sign more of our clients to SaaS clients instead of on-prem clients."

And it's going to be really an interesting market model. 
Our surveillance technology absolutely applies to that type of market model. But actually the module that we've created around sports surveillance applies to multiple -- the traditional model as well in terms of having kind of your own book and then betting against the house kind of thing. So I think that we can apply the technology to a traditional sports book or to these new marketplaces, and we have created a module that's specific to that segment. So we're pretty excited about that. 
And we don't have a TAM or a SAM yet. And that's actually a good question, Owen. So we'll come back and think through how do we look at that SAM developing, particularly for our surveillance and trading technology for that segment going forward. But it's obviously very early days here in the U.S. for that. 
In terms of other new markets and nonfinancial markets, we are continuing to support the crypto exchanges. I think we have 8 exchanges leveraging our trading technology, 9 leveraging our surveillance technology today. And then we also are seeing kind of fractionalized markets like fractionalized real estate markets and others coming up. There are actually several really interesting new marketplaces launching. And they're all coming on to what we're calling our Nasdaq Marketplace Services platform, which is really a SaaS-based cloud, and it can be delivered in the cloud or we can host it. But it's a managed service platform where we provide the technology, but also the infrastructure so that markets can spin up a lot faster. So I would say though, Owen, as you know, this is an early part of our strategy and, but we are definitely seeing nice progress. And we can provide you some more stats going forward on kind of new markets that we're launching there."

We have the Surveillance and the Market Tech solutions. And so we will come back to, Brian, just to kind of think about how we want to start to provide you more clarity there. But it is early days. 
And on the Surveillance side and actually the broader Anti Financial Crime side, that's an area that we are really spending a lot of time on to try to figure out how we can provide broader services across our bank clients as well as our brokerage clients because right now, the surveillance capabilities is really driven by marketplaces. But over time, as crypto becomes more integrated into the financial system, we want to make sure that we can provide solutions that meet the needs across all of our customers. So that's actually an area of active evaluation right now and we're looking at that. It's a great -- to have 2,000 banks as our clients across the U.S. and Canada really does give us a much broader opportunity to think about how to serve their evolving needs there."

So I think that with regard to the market structure of discussions, and I think the SEC's paper was, to me, an early first step in a long process of evaluating how to continuously improve the market. So I think what we were happy about with that rep",423,"Sure. So I think that with regard to the market structure of discussions, and I think the SEC's paper was, to me, an early first step in a long process of evaluating how to continuously improve the market. So I think what we were happy about with that report, well, a few things. One, they did a really nice job of dissecting the activity and understanding that there wasn't anything there that that had, I would say, that there was nothing there that really signified that there's any significant manipulation in the markets. I think the second thing is that they really did note that the markets were really resilient and very efficient. And that obviously is a good thing for us. 
But they also did point out a few key areas of focus. One is the quality of the national best offer. And the fact that so much more of the activity is happening in the dark, is there an impact on the quality of the national investment offer. And that's an area that we've been doing some work on. I think our Chief Economist published a report on that last week. And that then ties to what are the incentive structures that underpin the markets. And so are we finding that order flow is being moved off exchange and brought into these darker venues because of incentive structures. And I think I don't think that the SEC necessarily drew a definitive conclusion there, but it's an area that I think that they will be focused on. All we can say is we really believe in taking kind of iterative, smaller steps, iterative change rather than big bang changes to market structure because it's such an intricately woven system that it's really -- the law of unintended consequences are high. But if they look at disclosures around PFA or they look at making some measured changes to the PFA structure as well as making it so we can compete more for order flow like sub-$0.01 pricing or other other rules that encourage orders to come on to exchange and be lit. I think that those are all things that would be positive for us. But recognizing that we like innovation, we like variety and competition. We think that those are all good for investors. And so we have to we have to make sure we're taking measured steps there. And I got the sense that they weren't looking at draconian steps and that they were going to take a pretty measured approach."

But at the same time, it is a competitive environment. We do think that there's going to be increases in wage in -- I would say, wage increases as we go into 2022. But as you said, we haven't yet finalized our budget and our planning. So we'll be able to talk more about that on our fourth quarter call as we provide you with our 2022 guidance.

My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's third quarter 2021 performance, the progress we're making on our strategic repositioning and updates on areas where we are making significant inve",2268,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's third quarter 2021 performance, the progress we're making on our strategic repositioning and updates on areas where we are making significant investments to address large opportunities. I'll also share brief remarks about the current operating environment before I turn the call over to Ann, who will provide further details about our results as well as an update on our guidance, our capital deployment and our corporate sustainability efforts before we move to Q&A.  
Let me begin by acknowledging the Nasdaq team's dedication to our broader mission as we made notable progress in the third quarter. Their hard work has been critical to our success in delivering strong results for our clients. Together, we will continue our journey to become the leading provider of technology, data analytics, insights and marketplace excellence to the global capital markets and beyond.  
Now turning to our financial results for the third quarter of 2021. Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $838 million, an increase of $123 million or 17% from the prior year period. Our growth was largely driven by 13% organic revenue growth in our Solutions segment, 14% organic growth in our Market Services business and contributions from our acquisition of Verafin.  
We continue to make notable progress across key secular growth opportunities as illustrated by total company annualized recurring revenue or ARR of $1.834 billion, an increase of 19% compared to the prior year period. Within our recurring revenue businesses, we are seeing some of our best performances from our SaaS-based solutions. Specifically, Anti Financial Crime Technology is showing particularly strong results with revenues increasing 16% excluding the impact of Verafin. Verafin will begin to be included in our organic growth calculations next year, and we saw an increase of over 30% versus prior year in that business.  
Additionally, in our Investment Intelligence business, our SaaS products, including the Nasdaq Asset Owner Solutions, which is the new name for the combined eVestment and Solovis products, drove the 13% increase in Analytics revenue. Our third quarter results underscore the continued progress we've made to advance our strategy and additionally, demonstrate the value capture from the flywheel effect, which is our ability to leverage the momentum in one business area to drive success in other parts of the business.  
For example, our success in attracting the majority of the quarter's new listings and capital raise to Nasdaq drives higher growth in equities and options trading and multiplies cross-sell opportunities for our Investor Relations and ESG-related services. It also contributes to the vitality of our index business like the Nasdaq-100 and the NASDAQ Next Gen 100 indexes and enhances the brand's strength in other strategic growth areas of the company. As we continue to evolve Nasdaq into a high-performance technology company, each quarter that passes gives us an opportunity to reflect on the progress we've made. 
A critical pillar of our success has been our ability to allocate capital towards our technology and analytics capabilities. Our acquisition of Verafin has established us as a leader in Anti Financial Crime Technology as we build upon our already strong foundation in that area of the market. In the third quarter, our legacy Trade Surveillance segment saw the largest quarterly order intake in the last several years, adding new business across all regions, while our market surveillance group signed 2 new clients for our SaaS-based solutions, including a new crypto exchange client.  
Another pillar has been our ability to advance our leading corporate and marketplace positions. Corporate Platforms revenues increased 18% versus the prior year period, driven primarily by outstanding growth in the Nasdaq-listed issuer base across our U.S. and Nordic markets. It has been a record year so far for new listings in the Nordics with over 132 new listings coming to Nasdaq year-to-date. Additionally, the U.S. has experienced the best new issuance here in the past 2 decades, and Nasdaq continues to demonstrate strength with a 75% win rate for IPOs in the quarter and a 72% win rate year-to-date.  
As our listed issuer base grows, we're seeing correlated demand for our suite of IR and ESG services. Within ESG specifically, we see continued interest in our Nasdaq OneReport and our ESG advisory solutions coming from every -- from companies at every stage of their ESG journey, including companies preparing to list on Nasdaq. 
I would like to acknowledge briefly here that we are pleased with the SEC's approval during the quarter of our proposal to enhance Board diversity disclosures. While there have been meaningful developments to advance Board diversity across the governance ecosystem, we believe the standardized manner by which Nasdaq-listed companies will disclose this information will be critical to driving further progress. We look forward to working with our listed companies to implement the new listing rules.  
Market Services is another area of our business where we are seeing that flywheel-related success. Our expanded issuer base benefits equity trading since our share of trading and average capture rate is significantly higher in Nasdaq-listed stocks than it is in stocks listed on other venues. An expanded ecosystem of equity trading in turn brings positive impacts to the options industry where Nasdaq led all exchanges in the third quarter in the U.S. Equity Options contracts traded. 
We're also excited by the early progress we're seeing in the growing suite of ESG-related capital market solutions within Market Services. These include the Nasdaq Sustainable Bond Network; our European green bond listing service; our carbon removal marketplace, Puro.Earth; as well as the expansion of our Nordic ESG derivatives offering. Overall, our Market Services segment saw revenues increase 15% in the third quarter versus the prior year. And this was largely driven by increases in equity derivatives and cash equity net revenues, although all subsegments of Market Services delivered year-over-year increases.  
Our Investment Intelligence business saw revenues increase 30% during the third quarter compared to the prior year period -- I'm sorry, our Investment Intelligence businesses saw revenues increase 15% in the third quarter compared to the prior year period. This was driven by a combination of geographic expansion in our Market Data business, higher assets under management and exchange-traded products linked to the Nasdaq indexes as well as strong new sales, higher client retention and take-up of new capabilities across the Analytics offerings.  
Our index business continued its strong 2021 performance in the third quarter with revenues up 38% compared -- versus the prior year on a combination of both strong market performance of our most important thematic indexes as well as very material net inflows. We're especially pleased to see positive responses from the market to some of our newer products in our index franchise with notable AUM growth in the Invesco innovation suite, the new Mirae ETF tracking, the Philex semiconductor index and the Hashdex products linked to the Nasdaq Crypto Index. More broadly, AUM in Nasdaq-licensed ETPs launched since 2019 reached $13 billion at the end of the third quarter.  
We are also unlocking new areas of innovation in our Analytics business to bring more data and transparency to the institutional marketplace. This includes a significant partnership announced in July with Mercer, a leading consultant for institutional asset owners that gives our asset owner clients broader access to high-quality research on investment managers and their various investment strategies through a simplified workflow, enabling deeper due diligence. We expect this partnership to expand our clients' usage of our asset owner solutions going forward.  
While we continue our strategic journey, I would like to highlight next how we are measuring our progress in evolving the company at the highest level using 2 key metrics. First, our year-to-date organic revenue growth across the Solutions segment continues to meet or exceed the medium-term outlook of 6% to 9% annualized growth that we initiated after adding Verafin. Our 2021 year-to-date organic growth across the Solutions segment is 15%. 
Secondly, because we are growing our SaaS revenues even more quickly than the 19% increase in ARR year-over-year, the total percentage of ARR that we are generating from our SaaS businesses rose to 34% at the end of the third quarter. This is up from 28% in the prior year period and continues to move us closer to our medium-term objective of 40% to 50% by 2025.  
We are very pleased with the progress that our teams continue to make regarding SaaS contributions to our revenues, both organically and inorganically. Here are 2 brief examples that demonstrate our progress and innovation to support this growth. It has been 8 months since we completed the acquisition of Verafin, and our collaboration to date affirms our belief that this combination can accelerate new opportunities. This is particularly the case with larger Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks and those international banks from outside of Verafin's traditional customer franchise in North America. 
The Verafin team is executing on its strategy to further penetrate Tier 2 banks, which we define as banks holding total assets of $50 billion, and we secured another significant win during the quarter through our joint efforts. While we still have significant developments in progress to unlock broader adoption among new customer groups, our early milestones certainly validate the potential that we have identified together.  
Additionally, we continue to evolve our cloud-based data offerings with the launch of the Nasdaq Data Link in September. This new platform includes a comprehensive suite of core data covering financial markets, investment fund information and alternative data to every segment of the investment landscape. It's the perfect illustration of our SaaS evolution in a key growth area at Nasdaq, and it underscores our ability to give clients an efficient means to consume and manage market-related data sets in the cloud, which is becoming a standard practice for many users. Initial interest in Nasdaq Data Link is encouraging. The platform has seen daily average of 3,000 new visitors and 200 new account activations in the weeks following the launch.  
Next, I will briefly address areas of our business where factors impacting the current operating landscape are particularly relevant today and in the near term. By and large, we continue to operate within the confines of the pandemic. While there has been slow progress to enable in-person activities and on-site client visits, it remains far from the environment in which we operated prior to March of 2020. We are however fortunate that our diversified business model allows us to be executing at a very high level across our operations despite the prolonged backdrop of the pandemic.  
The logistical challenges of COVID-19 to travel, intense collaboration and on-site installation and integration have had their highest impact on the market infrastructure technology business within our Market Technology segment. We have had several complex clearing and post-trade implementation projects that have experienced longer time lines and have required more resources to progress. These challenges have slowed revenue recognition and have increased near-term implementation expenses, impacting near-term margins and creating short-term capacity constraints despite growing demand from clients. The second half of 2021 continues to be heavily impacted by this dynamic. And with this business having relatively high revenue visibility and clear capacity constraints, we know now that in the near term, market infrastructure technology revenue growth within the broader Market Technology segment will continue to be impacted in 2022 even if the underlying logistical challenges of the pandemic improve.  
On the other hand, in our Corporate Platforms business, the pandemic period has created some efficiencies to the go-public process. Notably, IPO road shows have turned virtual, making them more efficient for companies and investors. The new efficiencies have contributed to investors' ability to evaluate a multitude of new issuers and have increased bankers' capacity to support companies going through the IPO process. As of today, the pipeline for new listings remains robust based on the number of active S-1 registrations on file with the SEC. Assuming current market conditions persist, we have a strong visibility into the upcoming 6 months, and we anticipate this momentum to continue as we enter the final months of the year and into at least the first quarter of 2022.  
Turning to how we envision our ability to sustain sizable growth in the long term. I see 2 key elements to our potential future -- sorry, our future potential. First, we have evolved Nasdaq's businesses to focus on critical capabilities that are strategically important to our clients, and we have become more client-centric than ever. This evolution has allowed us to focus on providing the right data, insights and technology that our clients need to be successful across the capital markets today and tomorrow.  
Second, we have strong competitive positions in very sizable markets with -- in the key areas of growth for Nasdaq. It is a combined serviceable addressable market of $20 billion across our Anti Financial Crime and Trade Surveillance technologies, our indexes and investment analytics solutions as well as our Investor Relations, governance and ESG services. Based on our traction in these growth businesses today, we are incredibly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us.  
As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are entering the final months of 2021 with remarkable momentum as we make steady and consistent progress across our key growth areas and our foundational marketplace businesses. Combined with the favorable capital markets and macroeconomic backdrop, we remain well positioned to advance our strategy into '22 -- 2022 and beyond.  
And with that, I will turn it over to Ann to review the financial results in greater detail."
740535,1681484562,2408040,"Nasdaq, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Nasdaq, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results, and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our pre",1618,"Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results, and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com.  
I will start by reviewing third quarter performance beginning on Slide 11 of the presentation. The 17% increase in reported net revenue of $838 million is the net result of organic growth of 13%, including 13% organic increase in the Solutions segment and a 14% organic increase in Market Services; and the contribution from Verafin as well as the impact from divestitures.  
Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 20% while the non-GAAP operating margin of 53% increased 1 percentage point compared to the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the third quarter of 2021 was $303 million or $1.78 per diluted share compared to $256 million or $1.53 per diluted share in the prior year period.  
Turning to Slide 12. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $1.834 billion, an increase of 19% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $620 million, an increase of 42%. Excluding the impact of Verafin, ARR increased 10% year-over-year.  
I will now review quarterly segment results on Slides 13 through 16. Starting with Market Technology. Revenue increased $28 million or 33%. The increase reflects the positive $29 million impact from the acquisition of Verafin and a $5 million increase in our existing Anti Financial Crime Technology business, partially offset by an organic revenue decline of $6 million in our market infrastructure technology business. 
Excluding a $3 million FX impact as well as the $7 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue associated with the closing of the Verafin transaction, Verafin revenues would have been $39 million in the third quarter period and Anti Financial Crime Technology would have been $73 million, with both our existing surveillance and Verafin's FRAML solution continuing to exhibit strong momentum. The revenue decline within the market infrastructure technology business was driven primarily by the planned roll-off of a sizable maintenance and support licensing contract with a customer who will continue to use our technology under our license agreement; as well as a decrease, more broadly, in change requests and installation revenues, a consequence of both a strong comparison period in the third quarter of 2020 and capacity constraints we're working through due to logistical implications of the pandemic.  
ARR for Market Technology was $428 million in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 54% compared to the prior year period. The Market Technology segment operating margin was 9% in the period. Excluding the impact of the previously mentioned $7 million purchase price adjustment related to Verafin, the operating margin would have been 14%.  
Investment Intelligence revenue increased $36 million or 15%, all of which was organic. Organic revenue growth during the period reflects very strong growth in our index business as well as a meaningful contribution from Analytics. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $555 million, an increase of 9% compared to the prior year period. 
AUM and ETPs licensed to Nasdaq indices rose 15% compared to the prior year period to $361 billion, including $53 billion from net inflows and an $87 billion net increase from market appreciation, partially offset by a $92 billion negative impact related to the previously discussed ETP sponsor switches. These switches collectively were associated with about a $3 million in run rate quarterly revenues, which will be fully reflected in our revenues for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Investment Intelligence segment operating margin of 65% is unchanged compared to the prior year period as we continue to make strategic investments in index and Analytics to support sustained growth.  
Corporate Platforms revenues increased $24 million or 18%, reflecting organic growth. The increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listings revenues due to the expansion in our listed issuer base as well as higher adoption across the breadth of our Investor Relations and newer ESG advisory and reporting offerings. Corporate Platforms ARR was $529 million and increased 17% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platforms segment operating margin of 42% increased 3 percentage points compared to the prior year period.  
Market Services net revenues increased $39 million or 15%. The organic revenue increase was $37 million or 14%, and there was a $2 million positive impact from changes in FX rates. The organic increase reflects higher Equity Derivatives, Cash Equities and trade management services revenues. The segment operating margin of 63% increased 3 percentage points from the prior year period, reflecting strong operating leverage on higher trading revenues. 
One modeling item to note is that for the fourth quarter of 2021 and January '22, we have waived the collection of certain regulatory fees for 4 of our U.S. equity options markets. This is in order to ensure that collection of the fees, in combination with other regulatory fees and fines, does not exceed our regulatory costs. Holding all else equal, the removal of the fee is expected to reduce our reported capture rate by approximately $0.015 per contract in the fourth quarter of 2021 and approximately $0.005 per contract in the first quarter of 2022.  
Turning to Page 17 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $51 million to $397 million. The increase reflects a $26 million or 8% organic increase, a $21 million increase from the net impact of acquisition and divestitures as well as a $4 million increase from the impact of changes in FX rates due to a weaker U.S. dollar. 
The organic expense increase has 2 main drivers: first, higher compensation expense reflecting our continued investment to drive growth and an increase in variable performance-linked compensation due to our outstanding results; and second, increased costs related to what has been a very active capital markets backdrop, including expenses related to increased trading capacity and marketing commitments supporting our listing clients. Consistent with what we said last quarter about expenses coming in near the high end of the range if performance continues to be strong in relation to our medium-term growth objectives, we are narrowing our 2021 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.605 billion to $1.62 billion from $1.59 billion to $1.62 billion previously. The updated range reflects the impact of strong and broad-based organic revenue growth in the first 9 months of 2021 on variable expenses.  
Turning to Slide 18. Debt increased by $226 million versus 2Q '21, primarily due to net issuances of $259 million of commercial paper, primarily used to fund the accelerated share repurchase program or ASR; and a net increase of $19 million of Eurobonds from refinancing our 2023 Eurobond with a 2033 Eurobond during the quarter. This is partially offset by a $52 million decrease in Eurobond book values caused by a weaker euro. Our total debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.2x, unchanged from the second quarter of 2021. 
During the third quarter of 2021, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $90 million and repurchased common stock in the amount of $475 million, including the initial delivery of approximately 2 million shares of common stock related to the ASR agreement we entered into in July. We expect to receive the remaining shares related to the ASR in the fourth quarter of 2021 and for additional planned repurchases related to the sale of our U.S. Fixed Income business to resume in 2022. As of September 30, 2021, there was $984 million remaining under the share repurchase authorization. We continue to expect EPS dilution from the sale of Nasdaq Fixed Income to be about 2% in the first 12 months following the June 25 close but to diminish to immaterial levels after that.  
Turning to Slide 19. I want to begin regularly addressing our focus on ESG elements of our business, both internally and externally, because we believe Nasdaq has an important set of opportunities in terms of our sustainability and external impact, and we have a strong momentum in executing against them. We're committed to the highest level of sustainability in terms of how we run our businesses and serve all of our stakeholders but also have positioned ourselves to develop high impact outside of the organization through our anti-fin crime solutions; our carbon removal marketplace, Puro; and our unique ESG products and services offer to our corporate clients as well as our efforts to further our corporate purpose through focused philanthropy and volunteerism. Our purpose is to champion inclusive growth and prosperity, and we have chosen to emphasize financial literacy and extensive entrepreneurship education and support within underserved communities throughout the U.S.  
During 2021, we've expanded our ESG disclosures with new climate reporting and task force on climate-related financial commitments. Additionally, we have substantially expanded our anti-financial crime and ESG products and services capabilities, and we've received FCC approval for our listing rule promoting increased transparency on Board diversity. We have much to do to continue executing on our ESG opportunities, but we were very encouraged to see Sustainalytics, a leading provider of ESG research and ratings, recently recognize our progress in these areas. Our latest Sustainalytics ESG risk rating improved to a level that puts Nasdaq in the top 3 percentile of all rated companies. We look forward to updating you on a regular basis as we progress our ESG initiatives going forward.  
Thank you for your time. And I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

I guess you're having tremendous success with the annual -- growth of annual recurring revenues and the mix of SaaS revenues in there. And you did talk about -- you said you focused on the critical capabilities of your clients and more clients. So the question is, looking back, how important is equity trading and equity market share? Even though -- again, your revenues there are growing because volumes have grown, but looking -- an old metric was equity market share and revenue capture. How important is that to Nasdaq as you make this transformation?"

And so we do look at -- we examine every element of our business. Our core marketplace business really serves as our foundation for our ability to serve our clients in a lot of other ways. So we're extremely focused on it. 
I think that we've seen some shifts in market share as well as just in a couple of different dynamics. One has been the increase in retail, which has increased internalization and just -- and decreased overall exchange's share of trading. And I think that within that, that's an area that obviously we're seeing some more work done by the regulators just to understand that dynamic. I think that the second is, of course, the launch of some new exchanges that have come forward, and they have actually primarily focused on gathering some of that retail order flow and trying to compete for it. 
So we have really taken a very balanced approach in terms of being strategic in how we serve our clients. We want to make sure that we provide kind of a sustainable marketplace, that we do things in a competitive way but also create a sustainable advantage for our markets and for our clients that operate in our markets. And so we've taken, I would say, a very measured and balanced approach to managing share, managing capture and evaluating kind of the composition of trading in the markets to make sure that we're kind of balanced there. And that -- I would say that applies to both our equities and options markets and how we're looking at our share and capture and the dynamics there."

Well, first of all, I do think the environment is starting to generally improve in terms of being able to travel a bit now.

Well, first of all, I do think the environment is starting to generally improve in terms of being able to travel a bit now. But we're still doing most of our client interactions on Zoom, and that makes it harder. It's also harder to develop kind of what I would call the top end of the pipeline, the top end of the funnel in terms of identifying new clients. But I do think we've done a good job of adapting there to try to make sure that we know which new marketplaces are starting to consider launching and how we can serve them. 
So you're seeing that we are still signing up new clients, for sure. They are taking our SaaS-based marketplace solutions, which we're also pretty excited about. I think more than 90% of our new clients -- any new clients that's signing up for us across all of market tech, and that includes market infrastructure technology clients as well as anti-fin crime, actually, well more than 90% are taking our SaaS-based solutions. And that includes new markets launching in the cloud and taking our next-gen trading system. So we see a good pipeline, I would say, Rich. 
And we also see that we could do more. And we definitely want to be able to identify client opportunities a little earlier, and travel will help with that. But I also would say that on the post-trade side, which is where we've really experienced most of our delivery challenges, those are harder to implement. They take -- they're multiyear programs. They always have been. But they are definitely lengthening out in time with our inability to be on site. We are starting to get on site now with some of our clients, and that's helping -- definitely helping to accelerate things. 
And I also think that it's keeping us from being able to meet all the demands that our clients have. So we do see good strong client demand there, but we have to make sure that we have the resources to be able to meet the demand. So we've been working with our clients to kind of stage that over time. And that's what I think is going to -- is what we really were referring to in our comments around 2021 and 2022, is just that we see the need for us to manage through those capacity constraints before we can really meet all the demands that our clients have."

I think that there are 2 metrics that we've provided to our investor base to kind of measure our progress in the business. One is just our overall medium- to long-term growth outlook on revenues, and then the other is this notion of the rule of 40, which is really a combination of the growth in the revenues and the EBITDA margin of the business. And so what our outlook is, is that we expect to be able to deliver 13% to 16% annualized growth over the coming 3- to 5-year period across Market Technology. And that includes the market infrastructure technology business and the Anti Financial Crime business together. And we do continue to believe that, that is an appropriate expectation of growth for the business going forward. 
I think that the -- on the rule of 40, what we've communicated is that we wanted to get to a rule of 40, which is, as I said, a combination of growth in EBITDA by 2023, and we continue to see ourselves on track for that. So you have to think about this as a shorter-term or at least a nearer-term challenge that we're having to work our way through that part of the business that is most impacted to be able to get ourselves to a better growth state and more scalability as we sign more of our clients as SaaS clients instead of on-prem clients."

So on Sporttrade, there's a combination of what we're doing there. One is we have taken an investment in the business itself through our venture portfolio, and then we also are providing them the surveillance technology. And what's interesting about Sporttrade and the market model that they're creating is they're definitely creating more what I would call like a marketplace model where they're going to have market makers, they're going to have bid-ask spreads for different in-game betting opportunities. And it's going to be really an interesting market model. 
Our surveillance technology absolutely applies to that type of market model. But actually, the module that we've created around sports surveillance applies to multiple -- the traditional model as well in terms of having kind of your own book and then betting against the house kind of thing. So I think that we can apply the technology to a traditional sports book or to these new marketplaces, and we have created a module that's specific to that segment. So we're pretty excited about that.  
And we don't have a TAM or a SAM yet. And that's actually a good question, Owen. So we'll come back and think through how do we look at that SAM developing, particularly for our surveillance and trading technology for that segment going forward. But it's obviously very early days here in the U.S. for that. 
In terms of other new markets and nonfinancial markets, we are continuing to support the crypto exchanges. I think we have 8 exchanges leveraging our trading technology and 9 leveraging our surveillance technology today. And then we also are seeing kind of fractionalized markets like fractionalized real estate markets and others coming up. 
And there are actually several really interesting new marketplaces launching, and they're all coming on to what we're calling our Nasdaq Marketplace Services Platform, which is really a SaaS-based cloud -- it can be delivered in the cloud or we can host it. But it's a managed service platform where we provide the technology but also the infrastructure so that markets can spin up a lot faster. So I would say though, Owen, as you know, this is an early part of our strategy, and -- but we are definitely seeing nice progress. And we can provide you some more stats going forward on kind of new markets that we're launching there."

And actually, you can -- a client could choose to put their own third-party managed data into the system. And we can basically become their technology provider, making sure all of their data is managed and available to them in a really, really nice modern API structure. And so it's really an umbrella way for us to deliver market information, fund information, alternative information in a modern API and cloud-based infrastructure. So it's really easy to use, by the way. And it's really easy to take the data sets and integrate them into Excel or anything else that you want to use internally."

We have the surveillance and the market tech solutions. And so we will come back, too, Brian, just to kind of think about how we want to start to provide you more clarity there, but it is early days. 
And on the surveillance side and actually, the broader anti-financial crime side, that's an area that we are really spending a lot of time on to try to figure out how we can provide broader services across our bank clients as well as our brokerage clients because, right now, the surveillance capabilities is really driven by marketplaces. But over time, as crypto becomes more integrated into the financial system, we want to make sure that we can provide solutions that meet the needs across all of our customers. So that's actually an area of active evaluation right now, and we're looking at that. It's a great -- to have 2,000 banks as our clients across the U.S. and Canada really does give us a much broader opportunity to think about how to serve their evolving needs there."

So I think that with regard to the market structure discussions -- and I think the SEC's paper was, to me, an early first step in a long process of evaluating how to continuously improve the market. So I think what we were happy about with that repo",426,"Sure. So I think that with regard to the market structure discussions -- and I think the SEC's paper was, to me, an early first step in a long process of evaluating how to continuously improve the market. So I think what we were happy about with that report, well, a few things. One, they did a really nice job of dissecting the activity and understanding that there wasn't anything there that had -- I would say, that there was nothing there that really signified that there's any significant manipulation in the markets. I think the second thing is that they really did note that the markets were really resilient and very efficient, and that obviously is a good thing for us. 
But they also did point out a few key areas of focus. One is the quality of the national investment offer. And the fact that so much more of the activity is happening in the dark, is there an impact on the quality of the national investment offer? And that's an area that we've been doing some work on. I think our chief economist published a report on that last week. 
And that then tees to what are the incentive structures that underpin the markets. And so are we finding that order flow is being moved off exchange and brought into these darker venues because of incentive structures? And I think -- I don't think that the SEC necessarily drew a definitive conclusion there, but it's an area that I think that they will be focused on. 
All we can say is we really believe in taking kind of iterative -- smaller steps, iterative change rather than big bang changes to market structure because it's such an intricately woven system that it's really -- the law of unintended consequences are high. But if they look at disclosures around [ PFAP ] or if they look at making some measured changes to the [ PFAP ]  structure as well as making it so we can compete more for order flow, like sub-$0.01 pricing or other rules that encourage orders to come on to exchange and be lit, I think that those are all things that would be positive for us. But recognizing that we like innovation, we like variety and competition. We think that those are all good for investors. And so we have to make sure we're taking measured steps there. And I got the sense that they weren't looking at draconian steps and that they were going to take a pretty measured approach."

I definitely think that there's been -- I think that we all know that the competition for talent is pretty -- at a pretty heightened level right now. And so we are -- we've honestly benefited from the ability for us to attract talent from all over the world. The benefit is that we have tech talent in the U.S., in Canada, in Europe, in Asia and Australia. We have tech talent kind of spread throughout different economies and different markets, which gives us more flexibility to seek out talent in markets where we think that we can do that efficiently. 
But at the same time, it is a competitive environment. We do think that there's going to be increases in wage in -- I would say, wage increases as we go into 2022. But as you said, we haven't yet finalized our budget and our planning. So we'll be able to talk more about that on our fourth quarter call as we provide you with our 2022 guidance.

But the one thing that we don't have and what we don't intend to do is become a rating agency ourselves. That's just not our role.
