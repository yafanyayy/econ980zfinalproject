I'm pleased to speak to you this morning about our fourth quarter results. I'll first discuss our financial results, then we'll cover our performance with respect to our strategic priorities and operations and will end with our expectations for 2021. 
We finished 2020 with organic growth continuing to improve sequentially. For the fourth quarter, organic growth was a negative 9.6% as compared to a negative 11.7% in the third quarter. The fourth quarter organic growth decline of $398 million included a decrease in third-party service costs of approximately $150 million. The U.S. decline was 9.4%, an improvement of about 200 basis points from the third quarter. In the U.S., PR, helped by election year spend, and Healthcare performed better than average, while CRM Consumer Experience underperformed as continuing headwinds in events and shopper marketing offset relatively better performance in precision marketing. 
Third-party service costs represented more than half of the total decline in organic growth in the United States. Europe continued to face significant challenges due to COVID in the fourth quarter. The U.K. was down 12.4%, and the euro and non-euro markets were down 9.2%, similar to the level of performance that we experienced in the third quarter. Asia had organic growth of negative 3.9%, down from negative 12.8% in Q3. Australia and New Zealand saw mid single-digit growth in the quarter as those countries have managed the pandemic relatively well. 
Japan also saw a strong improvement sequentially, although it was negative overall. We're also pleased to see positive growth in our events operations in China during the quarter. Latin America experienced negative 9.2% growth in Q4, a significant improvement due primarily to better performance in Brazil, our largest market in the region. As we have experienced since early in the year, the hardest hit client sectors in the quarter were travel and entertainment and oil and gas. While food and beverage, pharma and health care and technology performed relatively better. 
On a positive note, EBIT margin in the fourth quarter was 16.4% as compared to 15.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The performance can be attributed to a number of factors, including savings resulting from our repositioning actions taken in the second quarter and our agency's ongoing management of costs in line with revenue, significant reductions in addressable spend and reimbursements and tax credits under government programs in several countries. These improvements were offset by asset impairment charges for certain underperforming businesses, which we plan to dispose of in 2021. Phil will cover this in more detail during his remarks. 
Net income for the quarter was approximately $398 million, a decline of 4.1% from 2019, and EPS for the quarter was $1.84 per share, a year-over-year decline of 2.6%. Finally, for the full year, organic growth was negative 11.1% or $1.7 billion. Included in this is a decline of approximately $750 million in third-party service costs. 
Turning to our liquidity. The refinancing steps we took early in 2020, combined with our enhanced working capital processes and the curtailment of our share repurchase program, have positioned us extremely well. For the year, we generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow and ended the year with $5.6 billion in cash. 
Our primary use of cash in 2020 was the payment of dividends of $563 million. Given the continuing improvements in our operations, strong liquidity position and credit profile, yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share or 7.7%. At this point, I'm optimistic about the company's return to growth and, as our performance improved during the course of 2021, we expect to resume our traditional uses of cash: paying dividends, pursuing accretive acquisitions and resuming share repurchases. 
Turning now to our strategy and operations. In the midst of the pandemic, our key strategic objectives served us well. These strategies are centered around hiring and retaining the best talent, driving organic growth by evolving and expanding our service offerings, investing in areas of growth with a particular focus on CRM and precision marketing, performance media, commerce, data and analytics, digital transformation consulting and health. And remaining vigilant on managing our costs and improving operational efficiencies in areas such as real estate, back office accounting, purchasing and IT. 
While remaining very disciplined with respect to our cost structure, it's important to emphasize that we continue to invest in our businesses during a very difficult year in order to service our clients' needs. We are all aware that as a result of the pandemic, the velocity of digital transformation picked up this year. When the world went into lockdowns, consumers increasingly took to online services to interact with brands and businesses. As we emerge on the other side of this pandemic, it's clear this trend is here to stay. As a result, we now have a greater opportunity to help our clients accelerate their digital transformation initiatives and connect them more directly with their customers. 
As an example, we are seeing significant growth in our mar-tech and IT consulting business. Credera, a firm we acquired in 2018, since joining Omnicom, they've expanded beyond their Dallas roots to the U.K., Chicago, New York and more recently to Los Angeles. This is just one highlight of many of the investments we've made to support our clients' needs as they look to accelerate growth by adopting new tools and capabilities that get them closer to their consumers. 
Omnicom's long-term strategy has always been to develop our people and embed digital and new skill sets across our portfolio, whether it's PR, creative, shopper marketing, media, events or any of our disciplines so that we can quickly and continually adapt to changing technologies and media. The pandemic has compressed years of digital adoption into a few months, and people are racing to keep up. So it is important to continue to train our people in a remote working environment. 
For this reason, all of our agencies expanded their training programs as a priority in 2020. For example, during the year, BBDO became the first global network to achieve Blueprint certification from Facebook and partnered with Google to develop virtual training sessions on using insights and analytics throughout the creative planning process. So far, over 3,000 people across 80 offices have completed this trend. 
In a similar effort, Omnicom Health Group provided over 300 all virtual offerings. 96% of Omnicom Healthcare's employees engaged in these training programs as did many of our clients, resulting in 11,000 combined hours of courses taken in 2020. The increase in virtual training sessions and employee participation reinforces our view that remote learning will have a permanent place in our future learning and development efforts. 
By evolving our challenge strategy and developing the digital offering is needed right now, we secured a number of recent new business wins, including OMD's win of Home Depot's media business, the marketing arm won all brand and product advertising for State Farm, as well as [indiscernible] cards U.S. brand promotion and shopper advertising. 
Sanofi awarded its global media count to Omnicom Media Group. TBWA World Health won one of the largest vaccine brands, [ Prevena ] from Pfizer and our agency won mandates on several COVID-19 campaigns, including TBWA [indiscernible] win of McDermo's first ever consumer ad campaign. Gilead assigned the launch of Remdesivir to Harrison Start. And Marina Mark continued its work with J&J's road to a vaccine project. 
This year, our practice areas and GCLs have increasingly utilized Omni's flexible and open architecture to develop more relevant insights for their specific disciplines and clients. Omni integrates clients' first-party data with privacy compliant data sets to map consumer journeys. It allows our agencies to optimize audiences, guide creative content development, target messages and plan media without compromising consumer safety and data privacy. 
A recent example of this was the launch of OmniEarned ID by Omnicom's Public Relations group. OmniEarned ID allows our clients to evaluate the outcomes of earned media with the same precision as paid media. The first of its kind patent-pending solution was built on the power of the Omni platform. It connects Omni to the PR discipline through earned media lenses and a curated list of privacy compliant data partners. These solutions are a result of the investments we've made in Omni for more than a decade. I'm very pleased that the platform is now deployed across most of our top clients and is used in more than 60 markets around the world to serve local, regional and global accounts. 
Our focus on innovation and development of Omni also provides us a clear path to operate in an environment where digital media now dominates and where more stringent consumer privacy requirements, such as the phasing out of third-party cookies, will take effect. It's worth noting that we've been anticipating privacy developments from the start. That's why Omni is an open source platform created on the basis of data neutrality using an unbiased and ethically focused procurement process to create the most diverse compilation of data sets. It is also why we have a comprehensive privacy compliance and data risk management process for regulatory compliance and to anticipate data set suitability for evolving technical standards. 
While data and analytics remain a top investment and priority for us, we understand that data can only take us so far. It is the creativity and innovation skills of our people, supported by data and analytics, that truly set us apart and drive the best results for our clients. It's for this reason that we remain steadfast in investing in our leading brands and businesses and have strategically organized ourselves across practice areas and clients to maximize collaboration and expertise. In doing so, we can align our talent and tools in an optimal manner to deliver comprehensive solutions addressing the marketing and business needs of our clients. 
While our organization allows our companies and their clients to easily connect and access deep specialist expertise from across the group, our success also requires that people have diverse backgrounds and experiences. With the recent social justice issues and the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on diverse populations, this has become even more of a priority for us. We took the time to evaluate our efforts thus far by recognizing our shortcomings and commit to progress ahead. 
Open 2.0, our strategy for achieving systemic equity across Omnicom, put us on a clear path forward, one that is defined not just by goals but by actions. One of the first actions within Open 2.0 calls for us to expand and empower those who are responsible for leading the plan's implementation. This is an important step because we recognize that our plan will only be successful if we have a strong base of DE&I specialists executing it throughout our agencies. Since last summer, we more than doubled the number of DE&I leaders throughout Omnicom. In fact, all of our networks and practice areas now have a dedicated DE&I leader reporting to their CEO. 
At Omnicom Corporate, we hired Chief Equity and Impact Officer, Emily Graham, to lead and guide our group of dedicated leaders. This new team is an important first step. Additional progress will be made in 2021 and more action items will be executed, measured and considered in our compensation decisions. In the year ahead, our focus remains the same: protecting the safety and well-being of our people, continuing to effectively serve the business needs of our clients, and preserving the strength of our businesses. 
Although we see hope as the vaccine rolls out, we know there are still significant challenges that will impact 2021. In evaluating 2021, the first quarter has difficult comps. COVID lockdowns did not meaningfully impact our operations until mid-March 2020. Looking beyond the first quarter, our current expectations for the balance of the year is that we will achieve positive organic growth. While we hope the end is in sight, the virus has surprised us, so we must remain vigilant and adaptable in planning and managing our operations. And that is exactly what we're doing. Our agency leaders have done an excellent job of managing our cost base to be aligned with revenues and that the work continues into 2021. 
At the same time, we remain laser-focused on driving our strategic priorities to expand our client services and win new business. Before I turn it over to Phil for a deeper dive into our results, I want to take a moment to thank all of our people. 2020 challenged everybody, both personally and professionally, and our performance in 2020 is directly tied to our perseverance. Everyone in our company can relate when I say the pandemic was and is all consuming. We dealt with the effects at home, with our families and friends, and then at work, we yet again, had to deal with its effects on our businesses and our clients. 
So I want to sincerely thank everybody for their hard work because I know it was more than difficult. I, and all the leaders across the group, appreciate what you did and are continuing to do to help us get through this. I'll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the results. Phil?"

As John said, during the fourth quarter, we continued to see a moderation in the decline in business conditions when compared to the peak of the pandemic in Q2 of 2020. As a result, we saw less of a decline in our organic revenue performance when compared to the previous 2 quarters. Our operating margins improved compared to Q4 of 2019, benefiting primarily from the active management of our discretionary addressable spend costs, the repositioning actions taken in Q2 of this year and the alignment of our cost structure with the current realities of the economic environment. 
Turning to Slide 4 for a summary of our revenue performance for the quarter. Our organic revenue performance was negative $398 million or 9.6% for the quarter. The decrease again represented a sequential improvement from the unprecedented decrease in organic revenue of 23% in the second quarter and 11.7% in the third quarter. And while we continue to experience declines across all regions and disciplines, most showed sequential improvement when compared to what we experienced over the previous 2 quarters. 
The impact of foreign exchange rates increased our revenue by 8/10th of a percent in the quarter, slightly above the 50 basis point increase we anticipated entering the quarter as the dollar weakened against some of our larger currencies compared to the prior year. The impact on revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, decreased revenue by 0.6%, in line with our previous projection. As a result, our reported revenue in the fourth quarter decreased 9.3% to $3.76 billion when compared to Q4 of 2019. I'll return to discuss the details of the changes in revenue in a few minutes. 
Turning back to Slide 1. Our reported operating profit for the quarter was $615 million, down approximately 5% when compared to Q4 of last year. Operating margin for the quarter increased 80 basis points to 16.4% compared to 15.6% in Q4 of last year. Our operating profit and the 80 basis point improvement in our margins this quarter was again positively impacted from our actions to reduce payroll and real estate costs in the second quarter as well as the larger-than-expected cost savings from our discretionary addressable spend costs including T&E, general office expenses, professional fees, personnel fees and other items, including cost savings resulting from the remote working environment. 
Operating profit for the quarter also included a $44.7 million reduction in salary and related costs, resulting from reimbursements and tax credits under government programs in several countries including the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Germany and France, as well as other markets. These benefits were offset by an asset impairment charge of $55.8 million related to certain underperforming assets. Our reported EBITDA for the quarter was $635 million, and EBITDA margin was 16.9%, also up 80 basis points when compared to Q4 of last year. 
On Slide 3 of our investor presentation, we presented the details of our operating expenses. As we've discussed previously, we have and will continue to actively manage our costs to ensure they are aligned with our revenues. In addition to the overarching structural changes we made during the second quarter, we continue to evaluate ways to improve efficiency throughout the organization focusing on our real estate portfolio management, back office services, procurement and IT services. 
And as for the details, our salary and service costs are variable and fluctuate with revenue. Salary and related costs declined by $162 million in the quarter, reflecting the net impact of staffing actions we undertook in the second quarter as well as the impact of benefits from government reimbursements and tax credit programs, which were offset by the impairment charge. 
Third-party service costs, which are directly linked to changes in our revenue, include expenses incurred with third-party vendors when we act as a principal when performing our services for our clients. These costs decreased by $152 million in the quarter or 12.7%. In comparison, the year-over-year decrease in third-party service costs was nearly 40% and 20% in the second quarter and third quarter, respectively. Occupancy and other costs, which are less linked to changes in revenue, declined by approximately $41 million. Again, reflecting the ongoing efforts to reduce our infrastructure costs as well as reductions in general office expenses related to the majority of our staff continuing to work remotely during the pandemic. 
Net interest expense for the quarter was $48 million, up $9.4 million compared to Q4 of last year and down $500,000 versus Q3 of 2020. When compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, our gross interest expense was up $3.3 million, primarily resulting from additional interest on the incremental $600 million of debt we issued in early April at the onset of the pandemic, partially offset by the reduction in interest expense from having no commercial paper borrowings in Q4 when compared to 2019. 
Net interest expense was also negatively impacted by a decrease in interest income of $6.1 million versus Q4 of 2019 due to lower interest rates on our cash balances. When compared to the third quarter of 2020, interest expense increased by $900,000, while interest income increased by $1.4 million on higher cash on hand when compared to the previous quarter. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.1%, which was slightly lower than Q4 of 2019, primarily due to the lower effective tax rate on our foreign earnings resulting from a change in legislation. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 27.1%, an increase from 26% for the 2019 full year rate. The effective rate for 2020 reflects an increase from the nondeductibility in certain jurisdictions of a portion of the repositioning costs reported in Q2, which was offset by the lower effective rate on our foreign earnings, as described previously. 
In addition, our effective tax rate in 2019 reflected a benefit of $10.8 million, primarily related to the net favorable settlement of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions. Excluding the impact of these items from each period, the effective rate for 2020 would approximate the 2019 rate. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2021 will remain between approximately 26.5% to 27%, excluding the impact of share-based compensation items, which we cannot predict because they are subject to changes in our share price. 
Earnings from our affiliates totaled $3.3 million for the quarter, up versus Q4 of last year. And the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in certain of our agencies was $30.4 million during the quarter, down when compared to last year. As a result, our reported net income for the fourth quarter was $398.1 million, down 4.1% or $16.9 million when compared to Q4 of 2019. Our diluted share count for the quarter decreased 1.5% versus Q4 of last year to 216.1 million shares, resulting from share repurchases prior to the suspension of our program in mid-March. As a result, our diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.84 versus $1.89 per share when compared to our Q4 EPS for last year. 
On Slide 2, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. Primarily due to the negative effects on our revenue arising from the pandemic, worldwide revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 decreased 11.9% to $13.2 billion. Negative organic growth decreased revenue 11.1% for the year, while FX reduced revenue 0.4%, and acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by 0.4% as well. As a reminder, in response to the pandemic, during the second quarter, we took repositioning actions, including severance actions to reduce employee headcount, real estate lease impairments, terminations, and related fixed asset charges that will allow us additional flexibility to match our anticipated changes in the need for space based on our headcount as well as the disposition of several small agencies. These repositioning charges totaled $278 million, which reduced our year-to-date net income by $223 million. 
The full year results also include the impact of an asset impairment charge of $56 million we recorded in the fourth quarter. Lastly, our full year results include the benefit of reductions in salary-related costs of $163 million related to reimbursements and tax credits under various government programs. Additional details regarding the impact of these items on our operating expenses are presented in the supplemental slides that accompany the presentation. And our full year reported diluted EPS for 2020 was $4.37 per share. 
Returning to the details of our revenue performance on Slide 4. While the decrease this quarter was an improvement from the reductions in client spending we experienced during the last 2 quarters, we continue to see marketers across a wide spectrum of geographies and industries adjust spending levels versus prior years as they continue to assess the continuing impact of the pandemic on their businesses. Our reported revenue for the fourth quarter was $3.76 billion, down $384 million or 9.3% from Q4 2019. 
In summary, as we've discussed in our last 2 calls, regarding our performance by client sector, we see certain industries, particularly T&E, continue to be more negatively affected than others. Regarding our performance by discipline, CRM Execution & Support continued negatively impacted from reductions in client activity in certain areas, including field marketing and research. And CRM Consumer Experience was also negative, but performance within this discipline was more mixed. The Events businesses continue to face significant declines, while our Commerce and Branding disciplines continue to lag. 
These declines were somewhat offset by relatively strong performance in our precision marketing businesses. Our Healthcare discipline also performed well. However, it faced a difficult comparison back to Q4 of last year, and it delivered organic growth of 12.9%. It was down slightly for the quarter. And PR had marginally positive organic growth due in part to election year spending in the U.S. 
Turning to the FX impact. On a year-over-year basis, the impact of foreign exchange rates was mixed when translating our foreign revenue to U.S. dollars. The net impact of changes in exchange rates increased reported revenue by 8/10th of a percent or $32 million in revenue for the quarter. While the dollar weakened against some of our largest major foreign currencies, we also saw some strengthening against others. 
In the quarter, the dollar weakened against the euro, the British pound, the Chinese won and the Australian dollar. And the dollar strengthened against the Brazilian real, the Russian ruble and the Turkish lira. Projecting the FX impact for the upcoming year is challenging. But in light of the recent strengthening of our basket of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar and where rates currently are, our current estimate is that FX could increase our reported revenues by over 2.5% in the first quarter by over 4% in the second quarter and then moderate in the second half of 2021, resulting in a full year projection of approximately 2.5% positive. These estimates are subject to significant adjustment as we move forward in 2021. 
The impact of our disposition activities over the past 12 months, reduced somewhat by our relatively recent acquisition in the U.K., decreased revenue by just over $19 million in the quarter or 5/10th of a percent, which is consistent with our estimates. Inclusive of the disposition activity through the end of 2020, we estimate the projected net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity will reduce reported revenue by approximately 40 basis points in the first quarter of 2021, 25 basis points in Q2, with marginal reductions in the second half of 2021. However, we continue to evaluate our portfolio for both potential disposition opportunities and acquisition targets. 
During Q4, we recorded asset impairment charges of approximately $56 million, related to businesses that we expect to dispose of in the first half of 2021. Organic revenue increased just under $400 million or 9.6% in the third quarter when compared to the prior year. As mentioned earlier, our revenue once again was down across all major geographic markets. But overall, the percentage decreases in organic revenue continue to improve when compared to those we experienced over the previous 2 quarters. 
Turning to our mix of business by discipline on Page 5. For the second quarter, the split was 58% for advertising and 42% for marketing services. As for the organic change by discipline, advertising was down 9.7%. Within the discipline, our media businesses have continued to see sequential organic improvement over the past 2 quarters. And our global and national advertising agencies also showed improvement this quarter, although that was certainly mixed by agency. 
CRM Consumer Experience was down 15.8% for the quarter. As previously discussed, this was primarily due to a large year-over-year decline at our Events businesses, which continue to face significant obstacles due to many restrictions resulting from the pandemic. CRM Execution & Support was down 13.7% as our field marketing and research businesses lagged for the quarter. PR, buoyed by increased activity in the quarter related to the U.S. elections, was marginally positive in Q4. And our health care agencies, facing a very difficult comparison back to Q4 2019 when they generated double-digit organic growth, were down 2%. But the performance of the underlying businesses remained solid across all geographies. 
Now turning to the details of our regional mix by business on Page 6. You can see the quarterly split was 52% in the U.S., 3% for the rest of North America and 9% in the U.K., 20% for the rest of Europe, 12% for Asia Pacific, and 2% each for Latin America and Middle East and Africa. In reviewing the details of our performance by region on Slide 7, organic revenue in the fourth quarter in the U.S. was down $202 million or 9.4%. For the quarter, our domestic events business has once again experienced our largest organic decline. And while we again saw year-over-year decreases in our advertising and media activity, they continued to have sequential improvement when compared to the previous 2 quarters. 
Our precision marketing businesses continued to perform well, and our domestic PR businesses were positive in the quarter again, resulting primarily from election-related activities in the U.S. Outside the U.S., our other North American agencies were down 3.2%. Our U.K. agencies were down 12.4%, continuing solid performance from our Precision Marketing and Healthcare agencies was offset by reductions from our advertising and field marketing businesses. The rest of Europe was down 9.2% organically. 
In the Eurozone, among our major markets, Germany, Belgium, Ireland and Italy were down single digits. While Spain and France experienced double-digit reductions. Outside the Eurozone, organic growth was down around 3% during the quarter, with decreased activity in Russia and Sweden, offsetting improved performance elsewhere in Continental Europe. 
Organic revenue performance in Asia Pacific for the quarter was negative 3.9%. Positive performance from our agencies in Australia and New Zealand were more than offset by decreases in Greater China and Singapore. While our Indian agencies were effectively flat. Latin America was down 9.2% organically in the quarter, although our agencies in Brazil continue to feel the effects of reduced activity, the single-digit reduction in organic growth was an improvement. And lastly, the Middle East and Africa was negative for the quarter due to a significant reduction in project revenue. 
As you can see on the revenue by industry information that will be presented on Slides 8 to 10, certain client sectors continue to be more negatively affected than others. In particular, our travel and entertainment and energy clients are continuing to curtail their marketing expenditures to match the significant decline in business activity in those sectors. While spending by clients in the technology industry was up versus Q4 of 2019, client spend in other industries, such as autos, food and beverage and consumer products continue to be lower when compared to the prior year, but improved from the lowest levels we saw back in the second quarter. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 11. You can see that in 2020, we generated nearly $1.7 billion of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, down when compared to 2019, but less than the year-over-year decrease in our net income. The $558 million generated in the fourth quarter was up $35 million versus the $523 million generated during the fourth quarter of 2019. 
And as for our primary uses of cash on Slide 12, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $563 million, effectively unchanged when compared to last year. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders was down slightly year-over-year to $96 million. Capital expenditures for the year were $75 million, down when compared to last year. As we previously discussed, we've reduced our capital spending in the near term to only those projects that are essential or were previously committed. 
Acquisitions, including earnout payments totaled $117 million and stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $218 million, down compared to last year due to the suspension of our share repurchase program in mid-March. As a result of our continuing efforts to prudently manage the use of our cash, we were able to generate $625 million of free cash flow during 2020 with approximately $340 million generated in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to our capital structure as of year-end. Our total debt was just over $5.8 billion, up around $670 million since last year. The major components of the change were the issuance of $600 million of 10-year senior notes due in 2030, which were issued in early April at the outset of the pandemic, along with the increase in debt of approximately $100 million, resulting from the FX impact of converting our $1 billion of euro-denominated borrowings into dollars at the balance sheet date. 
Our net debt position as of December 31 was $211 million, down $624 million from last year-end. Year-on-year, the improvement in net debt is primarily due to our positive free cash flow of $625 million and positive changes in operating capital of $31 million. As for our debt ratios, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.2x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.1x. 
And finally, moving to our historical returns on Page 14. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio was 23%, while our return on equity is 31.8%, both reflecting the decline in operating results driven by the economic effects of the pandemic as well as the impact of the repositioning charges we took back in the second quarter. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included several of the supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

I saw this morning that there were some -- possibly some confusion out there in some of the writings that were there. But that's what's really going to happen. 
In terms of specific industries and specific responses, we see an improving positive attitude, but COVID is still here. Progress is getting made with the vaccine as it rolls out, but it's going to take a little bit of time. And I don't think anybody has baked in the stimulus payments into their spending habits. But if that occurs, I'm sure it will only be a positive -- have a positive effect on what happens as we get into the second quarter and beyond. I don't know if you want to add to it?"

But at some point in the second quarter, we do expect to rebound, especially given the comps in the second quarter are much easier as well as the third quarter. So I think we definitely expect to return back to growth mode in Q2 and likely for the first 6 months based on that Q2 performance.

So still like field marketing, events, so any business impacted by virus from a lockdown and reduced mobility? So we can have an idea because I would think that your percentage is higher than other agencies. And therefore, when things recover, you should grow faster than the others? That's my first question. 
The second one is you generated good cash flow in '20, but -- and you end up with not a lot of debt or net debt of $0.2 billion. So you do have $5.8 billion of debt and $5.6 billion of cash. And the debt clearly costs more than the cash yield. So anything you can do to reduce gross debt and gross cash and benefit the P&L through lower interest. That's my second question.

So specifically, with respect to events and field marketing, they've certainly been challenged in events, for certain, even more so in 2020. And I think we saw a slow pickup in China, which got hit first, which is when we saw it first in the first quarter of 2020. We saw a little bit of a pickup in the fourth quarter of 2020 as well. But our Events business is somewhere around 3.5% or 4% of the business and fuel marketing might be 2% to 3%. So those certainly are 2 of the most affected. 
I think many of our businesses, though, even the creative agencies and throughout the portfolio, branding businesses, et cetera, we rely on project work. We think that will pick up more as the economies come back, but I think the most sensitive to an open economy, no travel restrictions, those kinds of things and being able to go to live sports and things. Events is going to be on the top of that list. 
Field marketing, because much of it happens in day-to-day life, grocery stores, et cetera. We expect that will come back sooner. And as far as debt and cash and reducing interest, I think our performance certainly has been very good from a cash flow perspective or a cash management perspective during the pandemic. We took out the additional $600 million of debt in early April as kind of a liquidity insurance policy. We will be evaluating internally with our Board our approaches as we get past the first quarter and things stabilize more as to what alternatives we're going to pursue. 
From a cash perspective, right now, we're comfortable where we are, but it is on our list to address what the alternatives might be to more efficiently and effectively use that cash. And then in terms of media, as far as 2020 goes, I think the media business certainly sequentially improved throughout the year, Q4 versus Q3 and versus Q2. We do expect improvements as we head into 2021. But I think we're optimistic about the business in 2021. And certainly, we've won more than our fair share of pitches, and we're in more as we head into the early part of the year here. So our expectations are certainly positive."

I'm pleased to speak to you this morning about our fourth quarter results. I'll first discuss our financial results, then I'll cover our performance with respect to our strategic priorities and operations and will end with our expectations for 2021. 
We finished 2020 with organic growth continuing to improve sequentially. For the fourth quarter, organic growth was a negative 9.6% as compared to a negative 11.7% in the third quarter. The fourth quarter organic growth decline of $398 million included a decrease in third-party service costs of approximately $150 million. The U.S. decline was 9.4%, an improvement of about 200 basis points from the third quarter. In the U.S., PR, helped by election year spend, and Healthcare performed better than average, while CRM Consumer Experience underperformed as continuing headwinds in events and shopper marketing offset relatively better performance in precision marketing. 
Third-party service costs represented more than half of the total decline in organic growth in the United States. Europe continued to face significant challenges due to COVID in the fourth quarter. The U.K. was down 12.4%, and the euro and non-euro markets were down 9.2%, similar to the level of performance that we experienced in the third quarter. Asia had organic growth of negative 3.9%, down from negative 12.8% in Q3. Australia and New Zealand saw mid-single-digit growth in the quarter as those countries have managed the pandemic relatively well. 
Japan also saw a strong improvement sequentially, although it was negative overall. We're also pleased to see positive growth in our events operations in China during the quarter. Latin America experienced negative 9.2% growth in Q4, a significant improvement due primarily to better performance in Brazil, our largest market in the region. As we have experienced since early in the year, the hardest-hit client sectors in the quarter were travel and entertainment and oil and gas, while food and beverage, pharma and health care and technology performed relatively better. 
On a positive note, EBIT margin in the fourth quarter was 16.4% as compared to 15.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The performance can be attributed to a number of factors, including savings resulting from our repositioning actions taken in the second quarter and our agency's ongoing management of costs in line with revenue, significant reductions in addressable spend and reimbursements and tax credits under government programs in several countries. These improvements were offset by asset impairment charges for certain underperforming businesses, which we plan to dispose of in 2021. Phil will cover this in more detail during his remarks. 
Net income for the quarter was approximately $398 million, a decline of 4.1% from 2019, and EPS for the quarter was $1.84 per share, a year-over-year decline of 2.6%. Finally, for the full year, organic growth was negative 11.1% or $1.7 billion. Included in this is a decline of approximately $750 million in third-party service costs. 
Turning to our liquidity. The refinancing steps we took early in 2020, combined with our enhanced working capital processes and the curtailment of our share repurchase program, have positioned us extremely well. For the year, we generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow and ended the year with $5.6 billion in cash. 
Our primary use of cash in 2020 was the payment of dividends of $563 million. Given the continuing improvements in our operations, strong liquidity position and credit profile, yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share or 7.7%. At this point, I'm optimistic about the company's return to growth and, as our performance improved during the course of 2021, we expect to resume our traditional uses of cash: paying dividends, pursuing accretive acquisitions and resuming share repurchases. 
Turning now to our strategy and operations. In the midst of the pandemic, our key strategic objectives served us well. These strategies are centered around hiring and retaining the best talent; driving organic growth by evolving and expanding our service offerings; investing in areas of growth with a particular focus on CRM and precision marketing, performance media, commerce, data and analytics, digital transformation consulting and health; and remaining vigilant on managing our costs and improving operational efficiencies in areas such as real estate, back-office accounting, purchasing and IT. 
While remaining very disciplined with respect to our cost structure, it's important to emphasize that we continue to invest in our businesses during a very difficult year in order to service our clients' needs. We are all aware that as a result of the pandemic, the velocity of digital transformation picked up this year. When the world went into lockdowns, consumers increasingly took to online services to interact with brands and businesses. As we emerge on the other side of this pandemic, it's clear this trend is here to stay. As a result, we now have a greater opportunity to help our clients accelerate their digital transformation initiatives and connect them more directly with their customers. 
As an example, we are seeing significant growth in our mar-tech and IT consulting business. Credera, a firm we acquired in 2018, since joining Omnicom, they've expanded beyond their Dallas roots to the U.K., Chicago, New York and more recently to Los Angeles. This is just one highlight of many of the investments we've made to support our clients' needs as they look to accelerate growth by adopting new tools and capabilities that get them closer to their consumers. 
Omnicom's long-term strategy has always been to develop our people and embed digital and new skill sets across our portfolio, whether it's PR, creative, shopper marketing, media, events or any of our disciplines so that we can quickly and continually adapt to changing technologies and media. The pandemic has compressed years of digital adoption into a few months, and people are racing to keep up. So it is important to continue to train our people in a remote working environment. 
For this reason, all of our agencies expanded their training programs as a priority in 2020. For example, during the year, BBDO became the first global network to achieve Blueprint Certification from Facebook and partnered with Google to develop virtual training sessions on using insights and analytics throughout the creative planning process. So far, over 3,000 people across 80 offices have completed this training. 
In a similar effort, Omnicom Health Group provided over 300 all-virtual offerings. 96% of Omnicom Healthcare's employees engaged in these training programs, as did many of our clients, resulting in 11,000 combined hours of courses taken in 2020. The increase in virtual training sessions and employee participation reinforces our view that remote learning will have a permanent place in our future learning and development efforts. By evolving our challenge strategy and developing the digital offerings needed right now, we secured a number of recent new business wins, including OMD's win of Home Depot's media business, The Marketing Arm won all brand and product advertising for State Farm as well as for [indiscernible] cards U.S. brand promotion and shopper advertising. 
Sanofi awarded its global media count to Omnicom Media Group. TBWA\WorldHealth won one of the largest vaccine brands, Prevnar from Pfizer, and our agency won mandates on several COVID-19 campaigns, including TBWA\Chiat\Day's win of Moderna's first-ever consumer ad campaign. Gilead assigned the launch of Remdesivir to Harrison & Star. And Marina Maher continued its work with J&J's Road to a Vaccine project. 
This year, our practice areas and GCLs have increasingly utilized Omni's flexible and open architecture to develop more relevant insights for their specific disciplines and clients. Omni integrates clients' first-party data with privacy-compliant data sets to map consumer journeys. It allows our agencies to optimize audiences, guide creative content development, target messages and plan media without compromising safety and data privacy. 
A recent example of this was the launch of omniearnedID by Omnicom's Public Relations Group. omniearnedID allows our clients to evaluate the outcomes of earned media with the same precision as paid media. The first of its kind patent-pending solution was built on the power of the Omni platform. It connects Omni to the PR discipline through earned media lenses and a curated list of privacy-compliant data partners. These solutions are a result of the investments we've made in Omni for more than a decade. I'm very pleased that the platform is now deployed across most of our top clients and is used in more than 60 markets around the world to serve local, regional and global accounts. 
Our focus on innovation and development of Omni also provides us a clear path to operate in an environment where digital media now dominates and where more stringent consumer-privacy requirements such as the phasing out of third-party cookies will take effect. It's worth noting that we've been anticipating privacy developments from the start. That's why Omni is an open-source platform created on the basis of data neutrality using an unbiased and ethically focused procurement process to create the most diverse compilation of data sets. It is also why we have a comprehensive privacy compliance and data risk management process for regulatory compliance and to anticipate data set suitability for our evolving technical standards. 
While data and analytics remain a top investment and priority for us, we understand that data can only take us so far. It is the creativity and innovation skills of our people, supported by data and analytics, that truly set us apart and drive the best results for our clients. It's for this reason that we remain steadfast in investing in our leading brands and businesses and have strategically organized ourselves across practice areas and clients to maximize collaboration and expertise. In doing so, we can align our talent and tools in an optimal manner to deliver comprehensive solutions addressing the marketing and business needs of our clients. 
While our organization allows our companies and their clients to easily connect and access deep specialist expertise from across the group, our success also requires that people have diverse backgrounds and experiences. With the recent social justice issues and the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on diverse populations, this has become even more of a priority for us. We took the time to evaluate our efforts thus far, recognizing our shortcomings and commit to progress ahead. 
OPEN 2.0, our strategy for achieving systemic equity across Omnicom, put us on a clear path forward, one that is defined not just by goals but by actions. One of the first actions within OPEN 2.0 calls for us to expand and empower those who are responsible for leading the plan's implementation. This is an important step because we recognize that our plan will only be successful if we have a strong base of DE&I specialists executing it throughout our agencies. Since last summer, we more than doubled the number of DE&I leaders throughout Omnicom. In fact, all of our networks and practice areas now have a dedicated DE&I leader reporting to their CEO. 
At Omnicom Corporate, we hired Chief Equity and Impact Officer, Emily Graham, to lead and guide our group of dedicated leaders. This new team is an important first step. Additional progress will be made in 2021 and more action items will be executed, measured and considered in our compensation decisions. In the year ahead, our focus remains the same: protecting the safety and well-being of our people, continuing to effectively serve the business needs of our clients, and preserving the strength of our businesses. 
Although we see hope as the vaccine rolls out, we know there are still significant challenges that will impact 2021. In evaluating 2021, the first quarter has difficult comps. COVID lockdowns did not meaningfully impact our operations until mid-March 2020. Looking beyond the first quarter, our current expectations for the balance of the year is that we will achieve positive organic growth.
While we hope the end is in sight, the virus has surprised us, so we must remain vigilant and adaptable in planning and managing our operations. And that is exactly what we're doing. Our agency leaders have done an excellent job of managing our cost base to be aligned with revenues and that the work continues into 2021. At the same time, we remain laser-focused on driving our strategic priorities to expand our client services and win new business. 
Before I turn it over to Phil for a deeper dive into our results, I want to take a moment to thank all of our people. 2020 challenged everybody, both personally and professionally, and our performance in 2020 is directly tied to our perseverance. Everyone in our company can relate when I say the pandemic was and is all-consuming. We dealt with the effects at home, with our families and friends, and then at work, we yet again had to deal with its effects on our businesses and our clients. So I want to sincerely thank everybody for their hard work because I know it was more than difficult. I, and all the leaders across the group, appreciate what you did and are continuing to do to help us get through this. 
I'll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the results. Phil?"

As John said, during the fourth quarter, we continued to see a moderation in the decline in business conditions when compared to the peak of the pandemic in Q2 of 2020. As a result, we saw less of a decline in our organic revenue performance when compared to the previous 2 quarters. Our operating margin improved compared to Q4 of 2019, benefiting primarily from the active management of our discretionary addressable spend costs, the repositioning actions taken in Q2 of this year and the alignment of our cost structure with the current realities of the economic environment. 
Turning to Slide 4 for a summary of our revenue performance for the quarter. Our organic revenue performance was negative $398 million or 9.6% for the quarter. The decrease again represented a sequential improvement from the unprecedented decrease in organic revenue of 23% in the second quarter and 11.7% in the third quarter. And while we continue to experience declines across all regions and disciplines, most showed sequential improvement when compared to what we experienced over the previous 2 quarters. 
The impact of foreign exchange rates increased our revenue by 8/10 of 1% in the quarter, slightly above the 50 basis point increase we anticipated entering the quarter as the dollar weakened against some of our larger currencies compared to the prior year. The impact on revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, decreased revenue by 5/10 of 1%, in line with our previous projection. As a result, our reported revenue in the fourth quarter decreased 9.3% to $3.76 billion when compared to Q4 of 2019. I'll return to discuss the details of the changes in revenue in a few minutes. 
Turning back to Slide 1. Our reported operating profit for the quarter was $615 million, down approximately 5% when compared to Q4 of last year. Operating margin for the quarter increased 80 basis points to 16.4% compared to 15.6% in Q4 of last year. Our operating profit and the 80 basis point improvement in our margins this quarter was again positively impacted from our actions to reduce payroll and real estate costs in the second quarter as well as the larger-than-expected cost savings from our discretionary addressable spend costs, including T&E, general office expenses, professional fees, personnel fees and other items, including cost savings resulting from the remote working environment. 
Operating profit for the quarter also included a $44.7 million reduction in salary and related costs, resulting from reimbursements and tax credits under government programs in several countries, including the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Germany and France as well as other markets. These benefits were offset by an asset impairment charge of $55.8 million related to certain underperforming assets. Our reported EBITDA for the quarter was $635 million, and EBITDA margin was 16.9%, also up 80 basis points when compared to Q4 of last year. 
On Slide 3 of our investor presentation, we presented the details of our operating expenses. As we've discussed previously, we have and will continue to actively manage our costs to ensure they are aligned with our revenues. In addition to the overarching structural changes we made during the second quarter, we continue to evaluate ways to improve efficiency throughout the organization, focusing on our real estate portfolio management, back-office services, procurement and IT services. 
And as for the details, our salary and service costs are variable and fluctuate with revenue. Salary and related costs declined by $162 million in the quarter, reflecting the net impact of staffing actions we undertook in the second quarter as well as the impact of benefits from government reimbursements and tax credit programs, which were offset by the impairment charge. 
Third-party service costs, which are directly linked to changes in our revenue, include expenses incurred with third-party vendors when we act as a principal when performing our services for our clients. These costs decreased by $152 million in the quarter or 12.7%. In comparison, the year-over-year decrease in third-party service costs was nearly 40% and 20% in the second quarter and third quarter, respectively. Occupancy and other costs, which are less linked to changes in revenue, declined by approximately $41 million, again, reflecting the ongoing efforts to reduce our infrastructure costs as well as reductions in general office expenses related to the majority of our staff continuing to work remotely during the pandemic. 
Net interest expense for the quarter was $48 million, up $9.4 million compared to Q4 of last year and down $500,000 versus Q3 of 2020. When compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, our gross interest expense was up $3.3 million primarily resulting from additional interest on the incremental $600 million of debt we issued in early April at the onset of the pandemic, partially offset by the reduction in interest expense from having no commercial paper borrowings in Q4 when compared to 2019. 
Net interest expense was also negatively impacted by a decrease in interest income of $6.1 million versus Q4 of 2019 due to lower interest rates on our cash balances. When compared to the third quarter of 2020, interest expense increased by $900,000, while interest income increased by $1.4 million on higher cash on hand when compared to the previous quarter. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.1%, which was slightly lower than Q4 of 2019, primarily due to the lower effective tax rate on our foreign earnings resulting from a change in legislation. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 27.1%, an increase from 26% for the 2019 full year rate. The effective rate for 2020 reflects an increase from the nondeductibility in certain jurisdictions of a portion of the repositioning costs reported in Q2, which was offset by the lower effective rate on our foreign earnings, as described previously. 
In addition, our effective tax rate in 2019 reflected a benefit of $10.8 million primarily related to the net favorable settlement of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions. Excluding the impact of these items from each period, the effective rate for 2020 would approximate the 2019 rate. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2021 will remain between approximately 26.5% to 27%, excluding the impact of share-based compensation items, which we cannot predict because they are subject to changes in our share price. 
Earnings from our affiliates totaled $3.3 million for the quarter, up versus Q4 of last year. And the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in certain of our agencies was $30.4 million during the quarter, down when compared to last year. As a result, our reported net income for the fourth quarter was $398.1 million, down 4.1% or $16.9 million when compared to Q4 of 2019. Our diluted share count for the quarter decreased 1.5% versus Q4 of last year to 216.1 million shares, resulting from share repurchases prior to the suspension of our program in mid-March. As a result, our diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.84 versus $1.89 per share when compared to our Q4 EPS for last year. 
On Slide 2, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. Primarily due to the negative effects on our revenue arising from the pandemic, worldwide revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 decreased 11.9% to $13.2 billion. Negative organic growth decreased revenue 11.1% for the year, while FX reduced revenue 0.4%, and acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by 0.4% as well. 
As a reminder, in response to the pandemic, during the second quarter, we took repositioning actions, including severance actions to reduce employee headcount, real estate lease impairments, terminations and related fixed asset charges that will allow us additional flexibility to match our anticipated changes in the need for space based on our headcount as well as the disposition of several small agencies. These repositioning charges totaled $278 million, which reduced our year-to-date net income by $223 million. 
The full year results also include the impact of an asset impairment charge of $56 million we recorded in the fourth quarter. Lastly, our full year results include the benefit of reductions in salary-related costs of $163 million related to reimbursements and tax credits under various government programs. Additional details regarding the impact of these items on our operating expenses are presented in the supplemental slides that accompany the presentation. And our full year reported diluted EPS for 2020 was $4.37 per share. 
Returning to the details of our revenue performance on Slide 4. While the decrease this quarter was an improvement from the reductions in client spending we experienced during the last 2 quarters, we continue to see marketers across a wide spectrum of geographies and industries adjust spending levels versus prior years as they continue to assess the continuing impact of the pandemic on their businesses. Our reported revenue for the fourth quarter was $3.76 billion, down $384 million or 9.3% from Q4 2019. 
In summary, as we've discussed in our last 2 calls, regarding our performance by client sector, we see certain industries, particularly T&E, continue to be more negatively affected than others. Regarding our performance by discipline, CRM Execution & Support continues to be negatively impacted from reductions in client activity in certain areas, including field marketing and research. And CRM Consumer Experience was also negative, but performance within this discipline was more mixed. The events businesses continue to face significant declines, while our commerce and branding disciplines continue to lag. 
These declines were somewhat offset by relatively strong performance in our precision marketing businesses. Our Healthcare discipline also performed well. However, it faced a difficult comparison back to Q4 of last year, when it delivered organic growth of 12.9%. It was down slightly for the quarter. And PR had marginally positive organic growth due in part to election-year spending in the U.S. 
Turning to the FX impact. On a year-over-year basis, the impact of foreign exchange rates was mixed when translating our foreign revenue to U.S. dollars. The net impact of changes in exchange rates increased reported revenue by 8/10 of 1% or $32 million in revenue for the quarter. While the dollar weakened against some of our largest major foreign currencies, we also saw some strengthening against others. 
In the quarter, the dollar weakened against the euro, the British pound, the Chinese won and the Australian dollar. And the dollar strengthened against the Brazilian real, the Russian ruble and the Turkish lira. Projecting the FX impact for the upcoming year is challenging. But in light of the recent strengthening of our basket of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar and where rates currently are, our current estimate is that FX could increase our reported revenues by over 2.5% in the first quarter, by over 4% in the second quarter and then moderate in the second half of 2021, resulting in a full year projection of approximately 2.5% positive. These estimates are subject to significant adjustment as we move forward in 2021. 
The impact of our disposition activities over the past 12 months, reduced somewhat by our relatively recent acquisition in the U.K., decreased revenue by just over $19 million in the quarter or 5/10 of 1%, which is consistent with our estimates. Inclusive of the disposition activity through the end of 2020, we estimate the projected net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity will reduce reported revenue by approximately 40 basis points in the first quarter of 2021, 25 basis points in Q2, with marginal reductions in the second half of 2021. However, we continue to evaluate our portfolio for both potential disposition opportunities and acquisition targets. 
During Q4, we recorded asset impairment charges of approximately $56 million related to businesses that we expect to dispose of in the first half of 2021. Organic revenue increased just under $400 million or 9.6% in the third quarter when compared to the prior year. As mentioned earlier, our revenue once again was down across all major geographic markets. But overall, percentage decreases in organic revenue continue to improve when compared to those we experienced over the previous 2 quarters. 
Turning to our mix of business by discipline on Page 5. For the second quarter, the split was 58% for advertising and 42% for marketing services. As for the organic change by discipline, advertising was down 9.7%. Within the discipline, our media businesses have continued to see sequential organic improvement over the past 2 quarters. And our global and national advertising agencies also showed improvement this quarter, although that was certainly mixed by agency. 
CRM Consumer Experience was down 15.8% for the quarter. As previously discussed, this was primarily due to a large year-over-year decline at our events businesses, which continue to face significant obstacles due to many restrictions resulting from the pandemic. CRM Execution & Support was down 13.7% as our field marketing and research businesses lagged for the quarter. PR, buoyed by increased activity in the quarter related to the U.S. elections, was marginally positive in Q4. And our Healthcare agencies, facing a very difficult comparison back to Q4 2019 when they generated double-digit organic growth, were down 2%. But the performance of the underlying businesses remained solid across all geographies. 
Now turning to the details of our regional mix by business on Page 6. You can see the quarterly split was 52% in the U.S., 3% for the rest of North America and 9% in the U.K., 20% for the rest of Europe, 12% for Asia Pacific, and 2% each for Latin America and Middle East and Africa. In reviewing the details of our performance by region on Slide 7, organic revenue in the fourth quarter in the U.S. was down $202 million or 9.4%. For the quarter, our domestic events business has once again experienced our largest organic decline. And while we again saw year-over-year decreases in our advertising and media activity, they continued to have sequential improvement when compared to the previous 2 quarters. 
Our precision marketing businesses continued to perform well, and our domestic PR businesses were positive in the quarter, again, resulting primarily from election-related activities in the U.S. Outside the U.S., our other North American agencies were down 3.2%. Our U.K. agencies were down 12.4%, continuing solid performance from our precision marketing and Healthcare agencies was offset by reductions from our Advertising and field marketing businesses. The rest of Europe was down 9.2% organically. 
In the Eurozone, among our major markets, Germany, Belgium, Ireland and Italy were down single digits, while Spain and France experienced double-digit reductions. Outside the Eurozone, organic growth was down around 3% during the quarter, with decreased activity in Russia and Sweden offsetting improved performance elsewhere in Continental Europe. 
Organic revenue performance in Asia Pacific for the quarter was negative 3.9%. Positive performance from our agencies in Australia and New Zealand were more than offset by decreases in Greater China and Singapore, while our Indian agencies were effectively flat. Latin America was down 9.2% organically in the quarter. Although our agencies in Brazil continue to feel the effects of reduced activity, the single-digit reduction in organic growth was an improvement. And lastly, the Middle East and Africa was negative for the quarter due to a significant reduction in project revenue. 
As you can see on the revenue by industry information that will be presented on Slides 8 to 10, certain client sectors continue to be more negatively affected than others. In particular, our travel and entertainment and energy clients are continuing to curtail their marketing expenditures to match the significant decline in business activity in those sectors, while spending by clients in the technology industry was up versus Q4 of 2019. Client spend in other industries such as autos, food and beverage and consumer products continue to be lower when compared to the prior year but improved from the lowest levels we saw back in the second quarter. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 11. You can see that in 2020, we generated nearly $1.7 billion of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, down when compared to 2019 but less than the year-over-year decrease in our net income. The $558 million generated in the fourth quarter was up $35 million versus the $523 million generated during the fourth quarter of 2019. 
And as for our primary uses of cash on Slide 12, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $563 million, effectively unchanged when compared to last year. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders was down slightly year-over-year to $96 million. Capital expenditures for the year were $75 million, down when compared to last year. As we previously discussed, we've reduced our capital spending in the near term to only those projects that are essential or were previously committed. 
Acquisitions, including earnout payments, totaled $117 million and stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $218 million, down compared to last year due to the suspension of our share repurchase program in mid-March. As a result of our continuing efforts to prudently manage the use of our cash, we were able to generate $625 million of free cash flow during 2020 with approximately $340 million generated in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to our capital structure as of year-end. Our total debt was just over $5.8 billion, up around $670 million since last year. The major components of the change were the issuance of $600 million of 10-year senior notes due in 2030, which were issued in early April at the outset of the pandemic, along with the increase in debt of approximately $100 million resulting from the FX impact of converting our $1 billion of euro-denominated borrowings into dollars at the balance sheet date. 
Our net debt position as of December 31 was $211 million, down $624 million from last year-end. Year-on-year, the improvement in net debt is primarily due to our positive free cash flow of $625 million and positive changes in operating capital of $31 million. As for our debt ratios, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.2x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.1x. 
And finally, moving to our historical returns on Page 14. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio was 23%, while our return on equity is 31.8%, both reflecting the decline in operating results driven by the economic effects of the pandemic as well as the impact of the repositioning charges we took back in the second quarter. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included several of the supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

I saw this morning that there were some -- possibly some confusion out there in some of the writings that were there. But that's what's really going to happen. 
In terms of specific industries and specific responses, we see an improving positive attitude, but COVID is still here. Progress is getting made with the vaccine as it rolls out, but it's going to take a little bit of time. And I don't think anybody has baked in the stimulus payments into their spending habits. But if that occurs, I'm sure it will only be a positive -- have a positive effect on what happens as we get into the second quarter and beyond. I don't know if you want to add, Phil?"

But at some point in the second quarter, we do expect to rebound, especially given the comps in the second quarter are much easier as well as the third quarter. So I think we definitely expect to return back to growth mode in Q2 and likely for the first 6 months based on that Q2 performance. We'll be back in growth mode and more optimistic about the rest of the year.

So still like field marketing, events, so any business impacted by virus from a lockdown and reduced mobility? So we can have an idea because I would think that your percentage is higher than other agencies. And therefore, when things recover, you should grow faster than the others.

The second one is you generated good cash flow in '20, but -- and you end up with not a lot of debt or net debt of $0.2 billion. But you do have $5.8 billion of debt and $5.6 billion of cash.

So specifically, with respect to events and field marketing, they've certainly been challenged, and events, for certain, even more so in 2020. And I think we saw a slow pickup in China, which got hit first, which is when we saw it first in the first quarter of 2020. We saw a little bit of a pickup in the fourth quarter of 2020 as well. But our events business is somewhere around 3.5% or 4% of the business and field marketing might be 2% to 3%. So those certainly are 2 of the most affected. 
I think many of our businesses, though, even the creative agencies and throughout the portfolio, branding businesses, et cetera, we rely on project work. We think that will pick up more as the economies come back. But I think the most sensitive to an open economy, no travel restrictions, those kinds of things and being able to go to live sports and things, events is going to be on the top of that list. Field marketing, because much of it happens in day-to-day life, grocery stores, et cetera, we expect that will come back sooner. 
And as far as debt and cash and reducing interest, I think our performance certainly has been very good from a cash flow perspective or a cash management perspective during the pandemic. We took out the additional $600 million of debt in early April as kind of a liquidity insurance policy. We will be evaluating internally with our Board our approaches as we get past the first quarter and things stabilize more as to what alternatives we're going to pursue. 
From a cash perspective, right now, we're comfortable where we are, but it is on our list to address what the alternatives might be to more efficiently and effectively use that cash. And then in terms of media, as far as 2020 goes, I think the media business certainly sequentially improved throughout the year, Q4 versus Q3 and versus Q2. We do expect improvements as we head into 2021. But I think we're optimistic about the business in 2021. And certainly, we've won more than our fair share of pitches, and we're in more as we head into the early part of the year here. So our expectations are certainly positive."

Those are the -- that capital structure and approach has served us very, very well over the last 30 years.

I'm pleased to update you on how we continue to respond to and overcome the challenges of the pandemic. I'll first discuss our financial results, then we'll cover our performance with respect to our strategic priorities and operations and we'll end with our expectations for the remainder of 2021.
For the first quarter, organic growth was negative 1.8%, which positions us for a very strong recovery for 2021. Going forward, we expect to see positive organic growth.
Before I go into our results in more detail, as you have seen in our investor presentation slides, we have provided a further breakdown of our CRM discipline. The new disciplines we have disclosed are as follows: CRM Precision Marketing, which includes our market consulting digital and direct marketing agencies; CRM Commerce and Branding consultancy includes our branding consultancies, shopper marketing and specialty production agencies; CRM Experiential includes our events agencies; and CRM Execution & Support is unchanged for the most part from our prior reporting and includes primarily our field marketing, research agencies and our agency servicing not for profit sector.
We believe this additional level of disclosure will allow you to have a better understanding of our operations, getting back to our organic growth by geography. In the United States, organic growth was down 1%, an improvement of over 8% from the fourth quarter. Advertising and Media and CRM Precision Marketing were positive in the U.S., while the rest of our disciplines continue to be negative with CRM Experiential having the largest negative impact on our growth.
Europe continued to face significant challenges due to the pandemic in Q1, although overall, the markets continue to improve. While the roll-out of the vaccine in Europe lags that of the United States and the U.K., some countries like Germany and the Netherlands are starting to make progress. The U.K. was down 6.4%, about half the decline in the fourth quarter. CRM Precision Marketing, CRM Commerce and Branding Consultancy and Health were all positive in the U.K., primarily offset by a significant reduction in CRM Execution & Support due to our field marketing operations.
The euro and the non-euro markets were down 3.2% as compared to a negative 9.2% in Q4. Multiple countries had positive growth in the quarter, and the majority continued to improve sequentially.
Asia turned positive in Q1 with organic growth of 2.5%. Australia continued to perform well, and we saw a significant return to growth in our events business in China, which combined with improvements in the other operations in the market, resulted in double-digit growth.
Latin America experienced negative 2.4% growth in Q1, a meaningful sequential improvement compared to the fourth quarter. EBIT margin in the first quarter was 13.6% as compared to 12.3% in the first quarter of 2020. EBIT improved due to the repositioning and cost management actions we took in 2020. In 2021, our management teams are continuing to align costs with revenues, and we're also seeing continued benefits from reductions in addressable spend.
While we expect addressable spend will not return to pre-COVID levels, travel and certain other addressable costs will likely increase during the course of 2021 as conditions improve. Overall, our expectation is that operating margins for the full year of 2021 will exceed our 2020 operating margin, excluding repositioning costs incurred in Q2 of 2020. 
Net income for the quarter was $287.8 million, an improvement of 11.5% from 2020, and EPS was $1.33 per share, a year-over-year increase of 11.8%.
Turning to our liquidity. The refinancing steps we took early in 2020, combined with our enhanced working capital processes and the curtailment of our share repurchase program, have positioned us extremely well. We generated $383 million in free cash flow in the quarter and ended with $4.9 billion in cash.
Given the continuing improvements in our operations, strong liquidity and credit profile, our Board has approved the resumption of our share repurchases beginning in the second quarter. This follows our recent decision to increase our dividend by 7.7% to $0.70 per share. Both actions are a testament to the steady improvement in our results and our expectations for further improvement for the remainder of 2021.
Our traditional uses of our free cash, flow paying dividends, pursuing accretive acquisitions and using our remaining cash for share repurchases is now fully back in effect. Phil will cover our first quarter performance in more detail during his remarks.
Turning now to our strategy and operations. In the midst of the pandemic, our key strategic objectives served as well. These strategies are centered around hiring and retaining the best talent, driving organic growth by evolving our service offerings, improving operational efficiencies and investing in areas of growth.
As part of this process, we continue to make internal investments in our agencies across all practice areas during a very difficult year. We made good progress on enhancing our capabilities throughout our portfolio, and we continue to pursue investment focus in Precision Marketing, MarTech and digital transformation, commerce, media and Healthcare. We are also accelerating our pursuit of acquisitions in these areas, and we've recently completed 2 transactions.
Omnicom Health Group acquired U.S.-based Arch Bo consulting. Arch helps pharmaceutical and biotech companies design, build and optimize market access operations. product distribution and patient access hubs. These capabilities will deepen Omnicom's Health Group's consultative services to biotech and pharma companies across a broad spectrum from operations to marketing.
Also in the quarter, Credera, our MarTech and Digital Transformation Consulting business and part of Omnicom's Precision Marketing Group acquired Areteans. Areteans will extend Credera's depth in digital transformation, digital marketing and e-commerce. The company specializes in the design, delivery and implementation of real-time interaction and digital customer relationship management for some of the world's largest brands. It expands our operations in Australia, India, New Zealand, Singapore and the U.K. I want to welcome both companies and their entire teams to Omnicom.
Turning to Omni, our data and insights platform. As I've mentioned in our last call, looking beyond our media business, our practice areas are increasingly leveraging Omni to identify insights for their specific disciplines and clients. Last quarter, Omnicom Public Relations Group launched omniearnedID, a solution that allows clients to evaluate the outcomes of earned media with the same precision as paid media.
More recently, our Health Group launched Omni Health, which integrates key health care data sets within a privacy compliant ecosystem. Thanks to this momentum, the Omni platform has trained 20,000 users in more than 15 markets, and it has become the foundation of our agency operating systems company-wide.
Since we launched Omni 3 years ago, we've continued to invest in its credentials as the industry's leading marketing orchestration and insights platform. As compared to other solutions built on limited proprietary data sets, Omni's open source approach connects more data sources across more media and commerce platforms to deliver better outcomes to our clients.
In Q2, we will be launching Omni 2.0 using next-generation API connections to seamlessly orchestrate identity resources and platforms in one collaborative workspace and at greater speed. Better and faster orchestration of data leads to more actionable insights and superior decisioning for our clients across all our networks and practice areas.
Just as important, Omni 2.0 continues to build on our commitment to consumer privacy and transparency. Our data neutral approach, which results in the most diverse compilation of data sets, continues to be rooted in a robust data privacy compliance methodology. This approach puts us in a strong position for a post-cookie world. A few points on this are through our prior entering work creating data clean moves, we have direct connections to the first-party data of many of our clients. Because we are open source and data neutral, Omni works seamlessly across wall garden environments as well as the broader ecosystem. At the same time, we orchestrate data sets from about 100 privacy-compliant sources to provide a comprehensive view of the consumer across devices.
As the marketplace and technologies continue to rapidly advance, we are confident our talent, platforms and strategies built on a foundation of our creative culture give us a competitive advantage in effectively serving both new and existing clients. As a testament to this success, we've had several key new business wins this past quarter, including a multiyear agreement with Allianz, a leading financial services provider for creative development and production services. Through this master framework agreement, Omnicom will produce work for Allianz on a global and local level, offering creative solutions to activate the global brand strategy for more than 70 countries where Allianz operates.
In addition, after recently selecting OMD as its U.S. media agency of record, Home Depot is named BBDO as its Creative Agency of record. Avocados for Mexico hired GST&M as its agency of record. TBWA was named agency of record for 3 new clients: Barra Paint, Moderna and Schwan's company. has picked up the strategic and creative accounts for Vanguard in Vantage, and OMD won the Media Business for Dr. Shoals.
In summary, we made significant strides in evolving our services, capabilities and organization to better service our clients with data science and technology, while remaining grounded in our core strength of creativity. I'm proud to lead the company with an extraordinary group of people who continually deliver the best creative work in our industry from their unwavering dedication, creativity and innovation came a number of industry awards and recognition. Here are just a few highlights. For the Drums Wealth Creator rankings, Omnicom was the #1 holding company for the fourth year in a row, and BBDO won the network category. Silverstein & Partners was named Campaign U.S. 2020 Advertising Agency of the Year. Critical mass was named at Age's 2021 Best Places to Work list. BBDO, TBWA and Silverstein & Partners were all named to Fast Companies Prestige's list of most innovative companies for 2021, making Omnicom the only holding company that have 3 agencies ranked in the top 10 in the advertising sector. And PHD was named EMEA's Media Network of the Year and U.K. Media Agency of the Year Campaigns U.K. Agency of the Year Award.
Our people have a wealth of knowledge, experiences and perspectives that lead us to this innovation and forward-thinking work. The diversity of our group is something that needs to be celebrated, prioritized and improved upon, and it's a strategic focus for us in the year ahead.
With our launch of OPEN 2.0 last year, We have made a clear action plan for achieving systemic equity across Omnicom. We have more than doubled the number of DE&I leaders throughout Omnicom, and we are establishing specific KPIs for our networks and practice areas to deliver on and to be measured by.
I look forward to sharing the progress we are making on DE&I on our future calls. As I discussed earlier, we're confident in both our organic growth expectations and EBIT performance for 2021. It has taken some time to turn the corner, and we are now on a clear path to return to growth. At the same time, we know that we must continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and to adapt to any unforeseen challenges that may arise. If 2020 taught us anything, it's to expect the unexpected and we will move forward maintaining our vigilance.
As we continue to enhance our operations, we are also evaluating what the future of work looks like at Omnicom. Our leadership on a local and office level are working on gathering feedback from employees and clients to help us decide what the new normal will be, one where we can service our clients efficiently, while also connecting with colleagues in the safest and most flexible way possible.
The incredible talent within Omnicom has helped us maintain business continuity through the lows of 2020 and overcome its challenges. We would never be here without their dedication, so a sincere thank you to everyone as we are at the beginning of the end of the pandemic. I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our results. Phil?"

As we anticipat",2836,"Thanks, John, and good morning. As John said, as we move through the first quarter of 2021, we continue to see an improvement in business conditions, particularly when compared to the peak of the pandemic during the second quarter of 2020. As we anticipated, we again saw sequential improvement in our organic revenue performance, a decrease of 1.8% in the first quarter of this year, which is a considerable improvement in comparison to the last 3 quarters of 2020. 
And now that we've cycled through a full year of operations since the start of the pandemic, We expect to return to positive organic growth in the second quarter and for the full year. We continue to see operating margin improvement year-over-year, resulting from the proactive management of our discretionary addressable spend cost categories and the benefits from our repositioning actions taken back in the second quarter of 2020.
Turning to Slide 3 for a summary of our revenue performance for the first quarter. Organic revenue performance was negative $60.6 million or 1.8% for the quarter. The decrease represented a sequential improvement versus the last 3 quarters of 2020, including the unprecedented decrease organic revenue of 23% in Q2, 11.7% in Q3 and 9.6% in Q4. Regionally, although we continue to experience declines in the Americas, we continue to see improvement when compared to what we experienced over the previous 3 quarters. In Europe, FX gains helped to offset negative organic growth, and our Asia Pacific region saw positive organic growth with a mixed performance by country.
The impact of foreign exchange rates increased our revenue by 2.8% in the quarter, above the 250 basis point increase we estimated entering the quarter, as the dollar continued to weaken against some of our larger currencies compared to the prior year. The impact on revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, decreased revenue by 0.4%, in line with our previous projection. And as a result, our reported revenue in the first quarter increased 0.6% to $3.43 billion when compared to Q1 of 2020. I will return to discuss the details of the changes in revenue in a few minutes.
Returning to Slide 1, our reported operating profit for the quarter was $465 million, up 10.8% when compared to Q1 of 2020. And operating margin for the quarter improved to 13.6% compared to 12.3% during Q1 of 2020. Our operating profit and the 130 basis point improvement in our margins this quarter was again positively impacted from our actions to reduce payroll and real estate costs during the second quarter of 2020, as well as continued savings from our discretionary addressable spend cost categories, including T&E, general office expenses, professional fees, personnel fees and other items, including cost savings resulting primarily from the remote working environment. Our reported EBITDA for the quarter was $485 million and EBITDA margin was 14.2%, also up 130 basis points when compared to Q1 of last year.
On Slide 2 of our investor presentation, we presented the details of our operating expenses. As we've discussed previously, we have and will continue to actively manage our costs to ensure they are aligned with our current revenues. In addition to the overarching structural changes we made during the second quarter, we continue to evaluate ways to improve efficiency throughout the organization, focusing on real estate portfolio management, back-office services, procurement and IT services.
As for the details, our salary and service costs are valuable and fluctuate with revenue. They increased by about $7 million in the quarter. But excluding the impact of exchange rates, these costs were down by about 2.6%.
While there was a reduction in base compensation overall from the staffing actions we undertook during the second quarter of last year, it varies by agency, and certain of our agencies have added people as business conditions improved in their markets.
In addition, third-party service costs were effectively flat on a reported basis and down slightly on a constant currency basis. In comparison, these costs, which are directly linked to changes in our revenue, decreased nearly 40% in the second quarter of last year, 20% in the third quarter and 12.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020, consistent with the decline in our revenues across all of our businesses in those quarters. Occupancy and other costs, which are less linked to changes in revenue, declined by approximately $18 million, reflecting our continuing efforts to reduce our infrastructure costs as well as the decrease in general office expenses since the majority of our staff has continued to work remotely. 
In addition, SG&A expenses declined by $15.2 million in the quarter. And finally, depreciation and amortization declined by $3.7 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $47.5 million, up $1.7 million compared to Q1 of last year and down $500,000 versus Q4 of 2020.
When compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, our gross interest expense was down $1.5 million, and interest income decreased by $1 million. When compared to the first quarter of 2020, interest expense was down $4.7 million, mainly resulting from a $7.7 million charge we took in Q1 of 2020, in connection with the early retirement of $600 million of senior notes that were due to mature in Q3 of 2020. That was offset by the incremental increase in interest expense from the additional interest on the incremental $600 million of debt we issued at the onset of the pandemic in early April 2020.
Net interest expense was also negatively impacted by a decrease in interest income of $6.4 million versus Q1 of 2020 due to lower interest rates on our cash balances. Based on our current debt portfolio structure and FX rates, we're anticipating net interest expense to be relatively flat in 2021 when compared to 2020. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 26.8%, up a bit from the Q1 2020 tax rate of 26%, but in line with the range we estimate for 2021 of 26.5% to 27%.
Earnings from our affiliates was marginally positive for the quarter, representing an improvement compared to last year. And the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders and certain of our agencies was $18.2 million during the quarter, up about $4.6 million when compared to Q1 of last year, reflecting the improved performance this year in our less than fully-owned subsidiaries. As a result, our reported net income for the first quarter was $287.8 million, up 11.5% or $29.7 million when compared to Q1 of 2020. Our diluted share count for the quarter decreased 0.3% versus Q1 of last year to 216.8 million shares. As a result, our diluted EPS for the first quarter was $1.33, up $0.14 or 11.8% from the $1.19 per share when compared to our Q1 EPS for last year.
Returning to the details of the changes in our revenue performance on Slide 3. Organic revenue performance improved again compared to the reductions in client spending we experienced during the last 3 quarters. We continue to see our clients across a wide spectrum of industry sectors and geographic regions modify spending as they assess the continuing impact of the pandemic on their businesses. While helped by FX, our reported revenue for the first quarter was $3.43 billion or up $20 million or 0.6% from Q1 of 2020.
As part of our continuing efforts to provide meaningful information to our investors, we've expanded the presentation of our CRM disciplines to give additional detail regarding the performance of these agencies, which are now grouped within 4 disciplines: CRM Precision Marketing, which includes our precision marketing and digital direct marketing agencies, which were previously included in our CRM Consumer experience discipline; CRM Commerce and Brand consulting, which is primarily comprised of the Omnicom commerce group and our brand consulting agencies, both previously included in CRM consumer experience; CRM Experiential, which includes our events and sports marketing businesses, which was also included in CRM consumer experience; and our CRM Execution & Support discipline, which includes our field marketing, merchandising and point-of-sale, research and not-for-profit consulting agencies and remains largely unchanged. 
Turning to the FX impact. On a year-over-year basis, the impact of foreign exchange rates was mixed when translating our foreign revenues to U.S. dollars. The net impact of changes in exchange rates increased reported revenue by 2.8% or $95.7 million in revenue for the quarter. While the dollar weakened against some of our largest major foreign currencies, we also saw some strengthening against a handful of others. In the quarter, the dollar weakened against the euro, the British pound, the Chinese yuan and the Australian dollar, while the dollar strengthened against the Brazilian real, the Russian ruble and the Turkish lira. In light of the recent strengthening of our basket of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar and where currency rates currently are, our current estimate is that FX could increase our reported revenues by around 3.5% to 4% in the second quarter and moderate in the second half of 2021, resulting in a full year projection of approximately 2% positive. These estimates are subject to significant adjustments as we move forward in 2021. The impact of our acquisition and disposition activities over the past 12 months resulted in a decrease in revenue of $15.1 million in the quarter, or 0.4%, which is consistent with our estimate entering the year.
Our projection of the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity for the balance of the year, including recently completed acquisitions and dispositions, is currently similar to Q1. As previously mentioned, our organic revenue decreased $60.6 million or 1.8% in the first quarter when compared to the prior year. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and on our clients' planned marketing spend appears to be moderating in certain major markets. As long as the COVID-19 pandemic remains a public health threat, global economic conditions will continue to be volatile. We expect global economic performance and the performance of our businesses to vary by geography and discipline until the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy moderates. We expect to return to positive organic growth in the second quarter and for the full year.
Turning to our mix of business by discipline on Page 4. For the first quarter, the split was 59% for advertising and 41% for marketing services. As for the organic change by discipline, advertising was up 1.2%. Our Media businesses achieved positive organic growth for the first time since Q1 of 2020. And our global and national advertising agencies again showed improvement this quarter when compared to the last 3 quarters, although performance remains mixed by agency.
CRM Precision Marketing increased 7.2% on continued strong performance and the delivery of a superior service offering. CRM Commerce and Brand Consulting was down 4.2%, mainly related to decreased activity in our shopper marketing businesses due to client losses in prior quarters.
CRM Experiential continued to face significant obstacles due to the many restrictions from holding large events. In the quarter, the discipline was down over 33%.
CRM Execution & Support was down 13% as our field marketing, non-for-profit and research businesses continue to lag. PR was negative 3.5% in Q1 on mixed performance from our global PR agencies.
And finally, our Healthcare agencies, again, facing a very difficult comparison, back to the performance of Q1 2020 when they experienced growth in excess of 9%, were flat organically. But the businesses remained solid across the group.
Now turning to the details of our regional mix of business on Page 5. You can see the quarterly split was 54.5% in the U.S., 3% for the rest of North America, 10.4% in the U.K., 17.1% for the rest of Europe, 11.7% for Asia Pacific, 1.8% for Latin America and 1.5% for the Middle East and Africa.
In reviewing the details of our performance by region, organic revenue in the first quarter in the U.S. was down $18 million or 1%. Our advertising discipline was positive for the quarter, on the strength of our Media businesses and our CRM Precision Marketing businesses, while our Healthcare agencies facing a very difficult comp to Q1 of 2020, were down 2.4%. Offsetting these performances was our Events businesses, which once again experienced our largest organic decline, over 34% in the U.S., while our other disciplines were down single digits organically. Outside the U.S., our North American agencies were down 3.2%. Our U.K. agencies were down 6.4% organically. Our CRM Precision Marketing, CRM Commerce and Brand consulting and Healthcare agencies continue to have solid performance. They again were offset by reductions from our Advertising, CRM Experiential and CRM Execution & Support businesses.
The rest of Europe was down 3.2% organically. In the Eurozone, among our major markets, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands were positive organically. Germany, Ireland and France were down single digits, while Spain was down double digits. Outside the Eurozone, organic growth was up around 5% during the quarter. An organic revenue performance in Asia Pacific for the quarter was up 2.5%. Positive performance from our agencies in Australia, Greater China and India were able to offset decreases in Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and Indonesia. Latin America was down 2.4% organically in the quarter. While our agencies in Mexico and Colombia were positive in the quarter, a double-digit decrease from our agencies in Brazil offset that performance.
And lastly, the Middle East and Africa was down 10% for the quarter.
On Slide 6, we present our revenue by industry information for Q1 of 2021. Again, we've seen general improvement in the performance across most industries when compared to the previous few quarters. But the overall mix of revenue by industry was relatively consistent to what we saw in prior quarters.
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 7. You can see that in the first quarter, we generated $382 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, which is up about $20 million versus the first quarter of last year. As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 8, dividends paid to our common shareholders were up $140 million, effectively unchanged when compared to last year. The $0.05 per share increase in the quarterly dividend that we announced in February will impact our cash payments from Q2 forward.
Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $14 million. Capital expenditures in Q1 were $12 million, down as expected when compared to last year. As we mentioned previously, we reduced our capital spending in the near term to only those projects that are essential or were previously committed. Acquisitions, including earn-out payments, totaled $9 million. And since we stopped stock repurchases, the positive $2.7 million in net proceeds represents cash received from stock issuances under our employee share plans. As a result of our continuing efforts to prudently manage the use of our cash, we were able to generate $210 million of free cash flow during the first 3 months of the year.
Regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt is $5.76 billion. up about $650 million since this time last year, but down $50 million as of this past year-end. When compared to March 31 of last year, the major components of the change were the issuance of $600 million of 10-year senior notes due in 2030, which were issued in early April at the outset of the pandemic, along with the increase in debt of approximately $80 million, resulting from the FX impact of converting our EUR 1 billion denominated borrowings into dollars at the balance sheet date. While the change from December 31 was the result of just the FX impact of converting the euro notes.
Our net debt position as of March 31 was $863 million. up about $650 million from last year-end, but down $1.5 billion when compared to Q1 of 2020. The increase in net debt since year-end was a result of the typical uses of working capital that historically occur in our first quarter, which totaled about $840 million and was partially offset by the $210 million we generated in free cash flow during the past 3 months.
Over the past 12 months, the improvement of net debt is primarily due to our positive free cash flow of $860 million, positive changes in operating capital of $537 million and the impact of FX on our cash and debt balances, which decreased our net debt position by about $190 million.
As for our debt ratios, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.1x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.5x.

We've seen it in our results as we've gone through the year and as we've gone through the quarter. which is why we're optimistic about the rest of 2021. As far as Q2 growth, from the data we have to date, and we'll be getting an update again over the next 2 weeks in our meetings with our operating companies, but we're certainly optimistic that our growth expectations are not going to be what we would consider a normal or typical quarterly growth pattern. Given the comps of Q2 of 2020, we certainly expect to do better than we normally would. And there's a lot of positive trends. There are some things that are happening or could happen that are out of our control. in terms of some of the larger markets in Europe and some of the challenges they've been having with COVID. But as the vaccine continues to roll out in the U.S. and globally, our growth expectation certainly for Q2 are pretty robust."

Domestically, our clients are generally big events, Olympic type of events and very well-established events that aren't going to decline once people can actually return to attending activities and is also -- when it's looking at the domestic market, the things that we do with respect to recruiting people for the U.S. government, which will keep us on the road for quite a while. I mean so positive in the U.S. once movement and schools are reopened and people are -- increasing number of people are allowed back into long-standing events.
And with respect to our international business, that's Very exciting. I mean the biggest aspects of that business when it returns is China, which has already started; established clients, big car companies; very well established, very well-financed markets in the Middle East; and just the biggest markets in Western Europe. So it's a business that we've held on to, and we've kept all the critical people. And in some instances, our individuals have expertise in certain categories that their clients have continued to pay us at least something with the promise that we keep them on board and don't lose them because the clients feel that they have great knowledge of their products and what their strategies are. So it's not a huge business. It's big enough to hurt you in downtimes and makes a contribution both from a profit EBIT point of view as well as a revenue point of view when things open up.
And since we are positive about it, probably more positive than other people and some of their competitors, there might even be an additional boost when things do open up because a lot of people haven't had the staying power to continue those businesses during this period of time."

So just to start on the media point. We don't break out media specifically. And frankly, when you go through the practice areas and the disciplines that we report, the vast majority of those disciplines actually have media in their numbers. So we don't carve it out and look at it that way. Essentially, businesses like PR and Healthcare and Precision Marketing, there are immediate components to those businesses. They're integrated into those businesses. Several markets throughout the world, advertising and media are integrated, and it isn't as simple as just pulling out a media number. Certainly, We did indicate that media grew in the first quarter, not -- I would say, not robustly relative to the first quarter of last year. But we're comfortable with the disclosures we make as far as adding the disciplines and providing what we think is very useful and helpful information similar to how we look at the business from a management perspective.
As far as margins go, I think what we've said, we still hold to, which is we look at 2019 as the best proxy of what ongoing margin expectations should be for our business. I think we look at the first part of coming out of the pandemic when it's likely to travel and related and some of the other controllable costs can continue to be reduced relative to past -- relative to the past as likely benefiting our margins in the near term. But in terms of looking at the business, prospectively, '19 is probably the best proxy. And I can tell you what we've always said, which is we always are looking for efficiencies and trying to expand our operating margins, but we're mostly focused on our operating EBIT dollars and the margins kind of fall into place. We're going to continue to invest where we believe the best organic growth opportunities are. And we're going to continue to drive operating profits. And our margin performance, we think, will be a positive result if we continue that approach.
Last question on the buyback front. I don't think we have today sitting here a margin -- sorry, a buyback dollar amount in mind. I think we certainly expect to continue with a very consistent approach to capital allocation. We'll continue to pay a healthy dividend. We're going to be more aggressive in pursuing acquisition opportunities in the areas where we think there's the most promise in our disciplines that we're in today, as we've said before, and the amount of money we spend on buybacks is going to be the residual. If we can find more acquisitions, we're going to put more of our free cash flow in any 1 year into those acquisitions that we for buybacks as a result. And certainly, that approach and that strategy, we're planning on consistently following that as we emerge from the pandemic and can get back into growth mode."

I'm not quite sure I'd commit to every quarter being kind of sequential growth.

We won't lose our discipline in terms of pricing expectations, but we will be more aggressive in terms of pursuing those opportunities. I don't think there's going to be a dramatic change, though. While we'll look at big deals, the deals we can successfully integrate with our existing platforms are the ones that we found work best. We're going to consider any and all deals in the areas that we're committed to and want to invest in. But we are going to do -- we are going to pursue acquisition opportunities in a variety of sizes, and to the extent that we can do more rather than less. That's certainly our intention.
Yes. The only thing I might add is I'm happy today with our M&A team and the efforts that there. they're going through than -- certainly than any other time in the last decade.

I'm pleased to update you on how we continue to respond to and overcome the challenges of the pandemic. I'll first discuss our financial results. Then we'll cover our performance with respect to our strategic priorities and operations, and we'll end with our expectations for the remainder of 2021. 
For the first quarter, organic growth was negative 1.8%, which positions us for a very strong recovery for 2021. Going forward, we expect to see positive organic growth. 
Before I go into our results in more detail, as you have seen in our investor presentation slides, we have provided a further breakdown of our CRM discipline. The new disciplines we have disclosed are as follows: CRM Precision Marketing, which includes our MarTech consulting, digital and direct marketing agencies; CRM Commerce and Branding Consultancy includes our branding consultancies, shopper marketing and specialty production agencies; CRM Experiential includes our events agencies; and CRM Execution & Support is unchanged for the most part from our prior reporting and includes primarily our field marketing, research agencies and our agency servicing the not-for-profit sector. 
We believe this additional level of disclosure will allow you to have a better understanding of our operations, getting back to our organic growth by geography. In the United States, organic growth was down 1%, an improvement of over 8% from the fourth quarter. Advertising and Media and CRM Precision Marketing were positive in the U.S., while the rest of our disciplines continue to be negative, with CRM Experiential having the largest negative impact on our growth. 
Europe continued to face significant challenges due to the pandemic in Q1, although overall, the markets continue to improve. While the rollout of vaccine in Europe lags that of the United States and the U.K., some countries like Germany and the Netherlands are starting to make progress. The U.K. was down 6.4%, about half the decline in the fourth quarter. CRM Precision Marketing, CRM Commerce Branding Consultancy and Health were all positive in the U.K.,  primarily offset by a significant reduction in CRM Execution & Support due to our field marketing operations. 
The Euro and the non-Euro markets were down 3.2% as compared to a negative 9.2% in Q4. Multiple countries had positive growth in the quarter, and the majority continued to improve sequentially. Asia turned positive in Q1, with organic growth of 2.5%. Australia continued to perform well, and we saw a significant return to growth in our events business in China, which combined with improvements in the other operations in the market resulted in double-digit growth. Latin America experienced negative 2.4% growth in Q1, a meaningful sequential improvement compared to the fourth quarter. 
EBIT margin in the first quarter was 13.6% as compared to 12.3% in the first quarter of 2020. EBIT improved due to the repositioning and cost management actions we took in 2020. In 2021, our management teams are continuing to align costs with revenues, and we're also seeing continued benefits from reductions in addressable spend. While we expect addressable spend will not return to pre-COVID levels, travel and certain other addressable costs will likely increase during the course of 2021 as conditions improve. 
Overall, our expectation is that operating margins for the full year of 2021 will exceed our 2020 operating margin, excluding repositioning costs incurred in Q2 of 2020. Net income for the quarter was $287.8 million, an improvement of 11.5% from 2020; and EPS was $1.33 per share, a year-over-year increase of 11.8%. 
Turning to our liquidity. The refinancing steps we took early in 2020, combined with our enhanced working capital processes and the curtailment of our share repurchase program, have positioned us extremely well. We generated $383 million in free cash flow in the quarter and ended with $4.9 billion in cash. 
Given the continuing improvements in our operations, strong liquidity and credit profile, our Board has approved the resumption of our share repurchases beginning in the second quarter. This follows our recent decision to increase our dividend by 7.7% to $0.70 per share. Both actions are a testament to the steady improvement in our results and our expectations for further improvement for the remainder of 2021. 
Our traditional uses of our free cash flow: paying dividends, pursuing accretive acquisitions and using our remaining cash for share repurchases is now fully back in effect. Phil will cover our first quarter performance in more detail during his remarks. 
Turning now to our strategy and operations. In the midst of the pandemic, our key strategic objectives served us well. These strategies are centered around hiring and retaining the best talent, driving organic growth by evolving our service offerings, improving operational efficiencies and investing in areas of growth. 
As part of this process, we continue to make internal investments in our agencies across all practice areas during a very difficult year. We made good progress on enhancing our capabilities throughout our portfolio, and we continue to pursue investments with a specific focus in precision marketing, MarTech and digital transformation, commerce, media and Healthcare. We are also accelerating our pursuit of acquisitions in these areas, and we've recently completed 2 transactions. 
Omnicom Health Group acquired U.S.-based Archbow Consulting. Archbow helps pharmaceutical and biotech companies design, build and optimize market access operations, product distribution and patient access hubs. These capabilities will deepen Omnicom Health Group's consultative services to biotech and pharma companies across a broad spectrum from operations to marketing. 
Also in the quarter, Credera, our MarTech and digital transformation consulting business and part of Omnicom's Precision Marketing Group acquired Areteans. Areteans will extend Credera's depth in digital transformation, digital marketing and e-commerce. The company specializes in the design, delivery and implementation of real-time interaction and digital customer relationship management for some of the world's largest brands. It expands our operations in Australia, India, New Zealand, Singapore and the U.K. I want to welcome both companies and their entire teams to Omnicom. 
Turning to Omni, our data and insights platform. As I've mentioned in our last call, looking beyond our media business, our practice areas are increasingly leveraging Omni to identify insights for their specific disciplines and clients. Last quarter, Omnicom Public Relations Group launched omniearnedID, a solution that allows clients to evaluate the outcomes of earned media with the same precision as paid media. 
More recently, our Health Group launched Omni Health, which integrates key health care data sets within a privacy-compliant ecosystem. Thanks to this momentum, the Omni platform has trained 20,000 users in more than 50 markets, and it has become the foundation of our agency operating systems company-wide. 
Since we launched Omni 3 years ago, we've continued to invest in its credentials as the industry's leading marketing orchestration and insights platform. As compared to other solutions built on limited proprietary data sets, Omni's open source approach connects more data sources across more media and commerce platforms to deliver better outcomes to our clients. 
In Q2, we will be launching Omni 2.0 using next-generation API connections to seamlessly orchestrate identity sources and platforms in one collaborative workspace and at greater speed. Better and faster orchestration of data leads to more actionable insights and superior decisioning for our clients across all our networks and practice areas. 
Just as important, Omni 2.0 continues to build on our commitment to consumer privacy and transparency. Our data-neutral approach, which results in the most diverse compilation of data sets, continues to be rooted in a robust data privacy compliance methodology. This approach puts us in a strong position for a post-cookie world. A few points on this are: through our pioneering work creating data clean rooms, we have direct connections to the first-party data of many of our clients. Because we are open source and data neutral, Omni works seamlessly across walled garden environments as well as the broader ecosystem. At the same time, we orchestrate data sets from about 100 privacy-compliant sources to provide a comprehensive view of the consumer across devices. 
As the marketplace and technologies continue to rapidly advance, we are confident our talent, platforms and strategies built on a foundation of our creative culture give us a competitive advantage in effectively serving both new and existing clients. As testament to this success, we've had several key new business wins this past quarter, including a multiyear agreement with Allianz, a leading financial services provider for creative development and production services. Through this master framework agreement, Omnicom will produce work for Allianz on a global and local level, offering creative solutions to activate the global brand strategy for more than 70 countries where Allianz operates. 
In addition, after recently selecting OMD as its U.S. media agency of record, Home Depot has named BBDO as its creative agency of record. Avocados From Mexico hired GSD&M as its agency of record. TBWA\Chiat\Day LA was named agency of record for 3 new clients: Behr Paint, Moderna and Schwan's Company. [ Dream ] has picked up the strategic and creative accounts for [ Vanguard Advantage ], and OMD won the media business for Dr. Scholl’s. 
In summary, we made significant strides in evolving our services, capabilities and organization to better service our clients with data science and technology, while remaining grounded in our core strength of creativity. I'm proud to lead the company with an extraordinary group of people who continually deliver the best creative work in our industry, from their unwavering dedication, creativity and innovation came a number of industry awards and recognition. Here are just a few highlights. 
For the Drum's World Creative Rankings, Omnicom was the #1 holding company for the fourth year in a row, and BBDO won the network category. Goodby Silverstein & Partners was named Campaign US's 2020 Advertising Agency of the Year. Critical Mass was named Ad Age's 2021 Best Places to Work list. BBDO, TBWA and Goodby Silverstein &  Partners were all named to Fast Company's prestigious list of Most Innovative Companies for 2021, making Omnicom the only holding company that have 3 agencies ranked in the top 10 in the advertising sector. And PHD was named EMEA's Media Network of the Year and U.K. Media Agency of the Year and Campaign's UK Agency of the Year award. 
Our people have a wealth of knowledge, experiences and perspectives that lead us to this innovation and forward-thinking work. The diversity of our group is something that needs to be celebrated, prioritized and improved upon, and it's a strategic focus for us in the year ahead. 
With our launch of OPEN 2.0 last year, we have made a clear action plan for achieving systemic equity across Omnicom. We have more than doubled the number of DE&I leaders throughout Omnicom, and we are establishing specific KPIs for our networks and practice areas to deliver on and to be measured by. 
I look forward to sharing the progress we are making on DE&I on our future calls. As I discussed earlier, we're confident in both our organic growth expectations and EBIT performance for 2021. It has taken some time to turn the corner, and we are now on a clear path to return to growth. At the same time, we know that we must continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and to adapt to any unforeseen challenges that may arise. If 2020 taught us anything, it's to expect the unexpected and we will move forward maintaining our vigilance. 
As we continue to enhance our operations, we are also evaluating what the future of work looks like at Omnicom. Our leadership on a local and office level are working on gathering feedback from employees and clients to help us decide what the new normal will be, one where we can service our clients efficiently while also connecting with colleagues in the safest and most flexible way possible. 
The incredible talent within Omnicom has helped us maintain business continuity through the lows of 2020 and overcome its challenges. We would never be here without their dedication, so a sincere thank you to everyone as we are at the beginning of the end of the pandemic. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our results. Phil?"

As John said, as we move through the first quarter of 2021, we continue to see an improvement in business conditions, particularly when compared to the peak of the pandemic during the second quarter of 2020. As we anticipated, we again saw sequential improvement in our organic revenue performance, a decrease of 1.8% in the first quarter of this year, which is a considerable improvement in comparison to the last 3 quarters of 2020.  
And now that we've cycled through a full year of operations since the start of the pandemic, we expect to return to positive organic growth in the second quarter and for the full year. We continue to see operating margin improvement year-over-year, resulting from the proactive management of our discretionary addressable spend cost categories and the benefits from our repositioning actions taken back in the second quarter of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 3 for a summary of our revenue performance for the first quarter. Organic revenue performance was negative $60.6 million or 1.8% for the quarter. The decrease represented a sequential improvement versus the last 3 quarters of 2020, including the unprecedented decrease in organic revenue of 23% in Q2, 11.7% in Q3 and 9.6% in Q4. Regionally, although we continue to experience declines in the Americas, we continue to see improvement when compared to what we experienced over the previous 3 quarters. In Europe, FX gains helped to offset negative organic growth, and our Asia Pacific region saw positive organic growth with a mixed performance by country. 
The impact of foreign exchange rates increased our revenue by 2.8% in the quarter, above the 250 basis point increase we estimated entering the quarter, as the dollar continued to weaken against some of our larger currencies compared to the prior year. The impact on revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, decreased revenue by 0.4%, in line with our previous projection. And as a result, our reported revenue in the first quarter increased 0.6% to $3.43 billion when compared to Q1 of 2020. I will return to discuss the details of the changes in revenue in a few minutes. 
Returning to Slide 1. Our reported operating profit for the quarter was $465 million, up 10.8% when compared to Q1 of 2020. And operating margin for the quarter improved to 13.6% compared to 12.3% during Q1 of 2020. Our operating profit and the 130 basis point improvement in our margins this quarter was again positively impacted from our actions to reduce payroll and real estate costs during the second quarter of 2020 as well as continued savings from our discretionary addressable spend cost categories, including T&E, general office expenses, professional fees, personnel fees and other items, including cost savings resulting primarily from the remote working environment. Our reported EBITDA for the quarter was $485 million and EBITDA margin was 14.2%, also up 130 basis points when compared to Q1 of last year. 
On Slide 2 of our investor presentation, we presented the details of our operating expenses. As we've discussed previously, we have and will continue to actively manage our costs to ensure they are aligned with our current revenues.
In addition to the overarching structural changes we made during the second quarter, we continue to evaluate ways to improve efficiency throughout the organization, focusing on real estate portfolio management, back-office services, procurement and IT services. As for the details, our salary and service costs are variable and fluctuate with revenue. They increased by about $7 million in the quarter, but excluding the impact of exchange rates, these costs were down by about 2.6%. While there was a reduction in base compensation overall from the staffing actions we undertook during the second quarter of last year, it varies by agency, and certain of our agencies have added people as business conditions improved in their markets. 
In addition, third-party service costs were effectively flat on a reported basis and down slightly on a constant currency basis. In comparison, these costs, which are directly linked to changes in our revenue, decreased nearly 40% in the second quarter of last year, 20% in the third quarter and 12.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020, consistent with the decline in our revenues across all of our businesses in those quarters. Occupancy and other costs, which are less linked to changes in revenue, declined by approximately $18 million, reflecting our continuing efforts to reduce our infrastructure costs as well as the decrease in general office expenses since the majority of our staff has continued to work remotely.  In addition, SG&A expenses declined by $15.2 million in the quarter. And finally, depreciation and amortization declined by $3.7 million. 
Net interest expense for the quarter was $47.5 million, up $1.7 million compared to Q1 of last year and down $500,000 versus Q4 of 2020. When compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, our gross interest expense was down $1.5 million, and interest income decreased by $1 million. When compared to the first quarter of 2020, interest expense was down $4.7 million, mainly resulting from a $7.7 million charge we took in Q1 of 2020 in connection with the early retirement of $600 million of senior notes that were due to mature in Q3 of 2020. That was offset by the incremental increase in interest expense from the additional interest on the incremental $600 million of debt we issued at the onset of the pandemic in early April 2020. 
Net interest expense was also negatively impacted by a decrease in interest income of $6.4 million versus Q1 of 2020 due to lower interest rates on our cash balances. Based on our current debt portfolio structure and FX rates, we are anticipating net interest expense to be relatively flat in 2021 when compared to 2020. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 26.8%, up a bit from the Q1 2020 tax rate of 26%, but in line with the range we estimate for 2021 of 26.5% to 27%. 
Earnings from our affiliates was marginally positive for the quarter, representing an improvement compared to last year. And the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in certain of our agencies was $18.2 million during the quarter, up about $4.6 million when compared to Q1 of last year, reflecting the improved performance this year in our less-than-fully-owned subsidiaries. As a result, our reported net income for the first quarter was $287.8 million, up 11.5% or $29.7 million when compared to Q1 of 2020. Our diluted share count for the quarter decreased 0.3% versus Q1 of last year to 216.8 million shares. As a result, our diluted EPS for the first quarter was $1.33, up $0.14 or 11.8% from the $1.19 per share when compared to our Q1 EPS for last year. 
Returning to the details of the changes in our revenue performance on Slide 3. Organic revenue performance improved again compared to the reductions in client spending we experienced during the last 3 quarters. We continue to see our clients across a wide spectrum of industry sectors and geographic regions modify spending as they assess the continuing impact of the pandemic on their businesses. While helped by FX, our reported revenue for the first quarter was $3.43 billion, or up $20 million or 0.6% from Q1 of 2020. 
As part of our continuing efforts to provide meaningful information to our investors, we've expanded the presentation of our CRM disciplines to give additional detail regarding the performance of these agencies, which are now grouped within 4 disciplines: CRM Precision Marketing, which includes our precision marketing and digital direct marketing agencies, which were previously included in our CRM Consumer Experience discipline; CRM Commerce and Brand Consulting, which is primarily comprised of the Omnicom Commerce Group and our brand consulting agencies, both previously included in CRM Consumer Experience; CRM Experiential, which includes our events and sports marketing businesses, which was also included in CRM Consumer Experience; and our CRM Execution & Support discipline, which includes our field marketing, merchandising and point of sale, research and not-for-profit consulting agencies and remains largely unchanged. 
Turning to the FX impact. On a year-over-year basis, the impact of foreign exchange rates was mixed when translating our foreign revenues to U.S. dollars. The net impact of changes in exchange rates increased reported revenue by 2.8% or $95.7 million in revenue for the quarter. While the dollar weakened against some of our largest major foreign currencies, we also saw some strengthening against a handful of others. In the quarter, the dollar weakened against the euro, the British pound, the Chinese yuan and the Australian dollar; while the dollar strengthened against the Brazilian reais, the Russian ruble and the Turkish lira. 
In light of the recent strengthening of our basket of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar and where currency rates currently are, our current estimate is that FX could increase our reported revenues by around 3.5% to 4% in the second quarter and moderate in the second half of 2021, resulting in a full year projection of approximately 2% positive. These estimates are subject to significant adjustments as we move forward in 2021. The impact of our acquisition and disposition activities over the past 12 months resulted in a decrease in revenue of $15.1 million in the quarter, or 0.4%, which is consistent with our estimate entering the year. 
Our projection of the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity for the balance of the year, including recently completed acquisitions and dispositions, is currently similar to Q1. As previously mentioned, our organic revenue decreased $60.6 million or 1.8% in the first quarter when compared to the prior year. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and on our clients' planned marketing spend appears to be moderating in certain major markets. As long as the COVID-19 pandemic remains a public health threat, global economic conditions will continue to be volatile. We expect global economic performance and the performance of our businesses to vary by geography and discipline until the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy moderates. We expect to return to positive organic growth in the second quarter and for the full year. 
Turning to our mix of business by discipline on Page 4. For the first quarter, the split was 59% for advertising and 41% for marketing services. As for the organic change by discipline, advertising was up 1.2%. Our media businesses achieved positive organic growth for the first time since Q1 of 2020. And our global and national advertising agencies again showed improvement this quarter when compared to the last 3 quarters, although performance remains mixed by agency. 
CRM Precision Marketing increased 7.2% on continued strong performance and the delivery of a superior service offering. CRM Commerce and Brand Consulting was down 4.2%, mainly related to decreased activity in our shopper marketing businesses due to client losses in prior quarters. CRM Experiential continued to face significant obstacles due to the many restrictions from holding large events. In the quarter, the discipline was down over 33%. 
CRM Execution & Support was down 13% as our field marketing, non-for-profit and research businesses continue to lag. PR was negative 3.5% in Q1 on mixed performance from our global PR agencies. And finally, our Healthcare agencies, again, facing a very difficult comparison, back to the performance of Q1 2020 when they experienced growth in excess of 9%, were flat organically. But the businesses remained solid across the group. 
Now turning to the details of our regional mix of business on Page 5. You can see the quarterly split was 54.5% in the U.S., 3% for the rest of North America, 10.4% in the U.K., 17.1% for the rest of Europe, 11.7% for Asia Pacific, 1.8% for Latin America and 1.5% for the Middle East and Africa. 
In reviewing the details of our performance by region, organic revenue in the first quarter in the U.S. was down $18 million or 1%. Our advertising discipline was positive for the quarter, on the strength of our media businesses and our CRM Precision Marketing businesses, while our Healthcare agencies facing a very difficult comp to Q1 of 2020, were down 2.4%. Offsetting these performances was our events businesses, which once again experienced our largest organic decline, over 34% in the U.S., while our other disciplines were down single digits organically. 
Outside the U.S., our North American agencies were down 3.2%. Our U.K. agencies were down 6.4% organically. Our CRM Precision Marketing, CRM Commerce and Brand Consulting and Healthcare agencies continue to have solid performance. They again were offset by reductions from our Advertising, CRM Experiential and CRM Execution & Support businesses.  The rest of Europe was down 3.2% organically. 
In the Eurozone, among our major markets, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands were positive organically. Germany, Ireland and France were down single digits, while Spain was down double digits. Outside the Eurozone, organic growth was up around 5% during the quarter. And organic revenue performance in Asia Pacific for the quarter was up 2.5%. Positive performance from our agencies in Australia, Greater China and India were able to offset decreases in Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and Indonesia. Latin America was down 2.4% organically in the quarter. While our agencies in Mexico and Colombia were positive in the quarter, a double-digit decrease from our agencies in Brazil offset that performance.  And lastly, the Middle East and Africa was down 10% for the quarter. 
On Slide 6, we present our revenue by industry information for Q1 of 2021. Again, we've seen general improvement in the performance across most industries when compared to the previous few quarters. But the overall mix of revenue by industry was relatively consistent to what we saw in prior quarters. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 7. You can see that in the first quarter, we generated $382 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, which is up about $20 million versus the first quarter of last year. As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 8, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $140 million, effectively unchanged when compared to last year. The $0.05 per share increase in the quarterly dividend that we announced in February will impact our cash payments from Q2 forward. 
Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $14 million. Capital expenditures in Q1 were $12 million, down as expected when compared to last year. As we mentioned previously, we reduced our capital spending in the near term to only those projects that are essential or were previously committed. Acquisitions, including earn-out payments, totaled $9 million. And since we stopped stock repurchases, the positive $2.7 million in net proceeds represents cash received from stock issuances under our employee share plans. As a result of our continuing efforts to prudently manage the use of our cash, we were able to generate $210 million of free cash flow during the first 3 months of the year. 
Regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt is $5.76 billion, up about $650 million since this time last year, but down $50 million as of this past year-end. When compared to March 31 of last year, the major components of the change were the issuance of $600 million of 10-year senior notes due in 2030, which were issued in early April at the outset of the pandemic. Along with the increase in debt of approximately $80 million, resulting from the FX impact of converting our EUR 1 billion euro-denominated borrowings into dollars at the balance sheet date, while the change from December 31 was the result of just the FX impact of converting the euro notes. 
Our net debt position as of March 31 was $863 million, up about $650 million from last year-end, but down $1.5 billion when compared to Q1 of 2020. The increase in net debt since year-end was a result of the typical uses of working capital that historically occur in our first quarter, which totaled about $840 million and was partially offset by the $210 million we generated in free cash flow during the past 3 months. 
Over the past 12 months, the improvement of net debt is primarily due to our positive free cash flow of $860 million, positive changes in operating capital of $537 million and the impact of FX on our cash and debt balances, which decreased our net debt position by about $190 million.  As for our debt ratios, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.1x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.5x. 
And finally, moving to our historical returns on Slide 10. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio was 19.9%, while our return on equity was 34.5%, both reflecting the decline in operating results, driven by the economic effects of the pandemic as well as the impact of the repositioning charges we took back in the second quarter of 2020. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included several other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

But things -- broadly speaking, things have been improving throughout the end of the second half of 2020 and into 2021 pretty consistently. So we've seen those trends improve. We've seen it in our results as we've gone through the year and as we've gone through the quarter, which is why we're optimistic about the rest of 2021. 
As far as Q2 growth, from the data we have to date, and we'll be getting an update again over the next 2 weeks in our meetings with our operating companies, but we're certainly optimistic that our growth expectations are not going to be what we would consider a normal or typical quarterly growth pattern. Given the comps of Q2 of 2020, we certainly expect to do better than we normally would. And there's a lot of positive trends. There are some things that are happening or could happen that are out of our control in terms of some of the larger markets in Europe and some of the challenges they've been having with COVID. But as the vaccine continues to roll out in the U.S. and globally, our growth expectation certainly for Q2 are pretty robust."

Domestically, our clients are generally big events, Olympic type of events and very well-established events that aren't going to decline once people can actually return to attending activities and is also -- when it's looking at the domestic market, the things that we do with respect to recruiting people for the U.S. government, which will keep us on the road for quite a while. I mean so positive in the U.S. once movement and schools reopen and people are allowed -- increasing number of people are allowed back into long-standing events.
And with respect to our international business, that's very exciting. I mean the biggest aspects of that business when it returns is China, which has already started; established clients, big car companies; very well-established, very well-financed markets in the Middle East; and just the biggest markets in Western Europe. So it's a business that we've held on to, and we've kept all the critical people. And in some instances, our individuals have expertise in certain categories that their clients have continued to pay us at least something with the promise that we keep them on board and don't lose them because the clients feel that they have great knowledge of their products and what their strategies are. So I mean it's not a huge business. It's big enough to hurt you in downtimes and makes a contribution both from a profit EBIT point of view as well as a revenue point of view when things open up.
And since we are positive about it, probably more positive than other people and some of their competitors, there might even be an additional boost when things do open up because a lot of people haven't had the staying power to continue those businesses during this period of time."

So just to start on the media point. We don't break out media specifically. And frankly, when you go through the practice areas and the disciplines that we report, the vast majority of those disciplines actually have media in their numbers. So we don't carve it out and look at it that way. Essentially, businesses like PR and Healthcare and Precision Marketing, there are media components to those businesses. They're integrated into those businesses. Several markets throughout the world, advertising and media are integrated, and it isn't as simple as just pulling out a media number. Certainly, we did indicate that media grew in the first quarter, not -- I would say, not robustly relative to the first quarter of last year. But we're comfortable with the disclosures we make as far as adding the disciplines and providing what we think is very useful and helpful information similar to how we look at the business from a management perspective.
As far as margins go, I think what we've said, we still hold to, which is we look at 2019 as the best proxy of what ongoing margin expectations should be for our business. I think we look at the first part of coming out of the pandemic when it's likely to travel and related and some of the other controllable costs can continue to be reduced relative to past -- relative to the past as likely benefiting our margins in the near term. 
But in terms of looking at the business prospectively, '19 is probably the best proxy. And I can tell you what we've always said, which is we always are looking for efficiencies and trying to expand our operating margins, but we're mostly focused on our operating EBIT dollars and the margins kind of fall into place. We're going to continue to invest where we believe the best organic growth opportunities are, and we're going to continue to drive operating profits. And our margin performance, we think, will be a positive result if we continue that approach.
Last question on the buyback front. I don't think we have today sitting here a margin -- sorry, a buyback dollar amount in mind. I think we certainly expect to continue with a very consistent approach to capital allocation. We'll continue to pay a healthy dividend. We're going to be more aggressive in pursuing acquisition opportunities in the areas where we think there's the most promise in our disciplines that we're in today, as we've said before, and the amount of money we spend on buybacks is going to be the residual. If we can find more acquisitions, we're going to put more of our free cash flow in any 1 year into those acquisitions that we less for buybacks as a result. And certainly, that approach and that strategy, we're planning on consistently following that as we emerge from the pandemic and get back into growth mode."

I'm not quite sure I'd commit to every quarter being kind of sequential growth. But the field marketing business, given it's pan-European, they've had some setbacks recently in some of their key markets because of some of the shutdowns that happened recently in Europe. But we do expect them to get back into growth mode.

So yes, we do currently plan to be a little more aggressive in terms of looking for the right opportunities. We won't lose our discipline in terms of pricing expectations, but we will be more aggressive in terms of pursuing those opportunities. I don't think there's going to be a dramatic change though.

We're going to consider any and all deals in the areas that we're committed to and want to invest in.

We are pleased to kick off today's call by reporting that we've rounded the corner into positive growth. We had extremely strong results, top and bottom line, and continue to make very good progress on several of our strategic initiatives. 
Organic growth for the second quarter was a positive 24.4%. This growth was broad-based across our agencies, geographies, disciplines and client sectors. We experienced a significant increase in spend from existing clients as the effects of the pandemic subsided, and we benefited from strong new business wins. 
EBIT was $568 million in the quarter, an increase of 67% versus the second quarter of 2020. Q2 2021 included a gain of $50.5 million from the sale of ICON International in early June. And Q2 2020 EBIT included $278 million of charges related to the repositioning actions. 
Excluding gains and charges, EBIT margin was 14.5% in the quarter compared to 12.2% in Q2 2020. Phil will provide further details on expected impact of the sale of ICON on our results for the balance of the year. 
As we stated on our last call, we view 2019 as a reasonable proxy for our ongoing margin expectations. Excluding the sale of ICON, our 6-month 2021 EBIT margin was 14%, which is in line with our EBIT margin of 13.9% for the first 6 months of 2019. 
Net income was $348 million in the second quarter, an increase of 75% from the second quarter of 2020. And EPS was $1.60 per share, an increase of 74%. The net impact of the gain on the sale of ICON, which was offset by an interest expense charge related to the early retirement of debt, increased EPS in Q2 2021 by $0.14 per share. 
Before I provide more comments on our financial performance and progress on our strategic initiatives, I want to acknowledge the work of our leadership team and all of our people for these financial results. Our leaders took difficult and effective actions over the past 1.5 years. At the same time, they remain laser-focused on the health of their teams, servicing our clients, winning new business and managing their cost structures. 
Our ability to navigate in this environment and come out the other side with such strong results is a testament to their commitment as well as the dedication and tireless effort of our people around the world. I want to thank them for their outstanding contributions. 
Turning now to our performance by geography. Every region had double-digit growth in the quarter. The U.S. was up just shy of 20% in the quarter. All U.S. disciplines had double-digit growth, except for Healthcare, which was up in the low single digits. It was the one discipline that grew in Q2 of 2020. 
Other North America was up 37.1%. The U.K. was up 23.8% with all disciplines in double digits. Overall growth in the Euro and non-Euro region was 34.5%. In Asia Pacific, we had 27.9% increase with all major countries who experienced double-digit growth. Our Events business in China had another quarter of strong performance. Latin America was up 20.8%. And  the Middle East and Africa increased 42.8%. 
By discipline, all areas were up year-over-year as follows: Advertising and Media, 29.8%; CRM Precision Marketing, 25%; CRM Commerce and Brand Consultancy, 15.2%; CRM Experiential, 53%; CRM Execution & Support, 22.7%; PR, 15.1%; and Healthcare, 4.5%. 
Looking forward, we expect to continue to see positive organic growth as client spend increases, albeit at a slower pace than we experienced in Q2. Our management teams are continuing to align costs with our revenues as markets reopen around the world. 
Many of our companies are hiring staff to service an increase in client spend and the new business wins. And we are seeing some pressure on our staff costs, particularly in the U.S., as the labor markets remain tight. 
We're also beginning to see a return of travel and certain other addressable spend as government restrictions have eased. Based on our use of technology during the pandemic, we are developing practices, particularly with respect to travel, that should allow us to continue to retain some of the benefits we achieved in addressable spend. We expect that the increase in addressable spend in the second half of the year will be mitigated in part by the benefits we will achieve from a hybrid and agile workforce. 
Turning to our cash flow. We again performed very strongly. For the first half of the year, we generated approximately $800 million in free cash flow. 
As we indicated last quarter, in addition to our dividend increase, in May, our Board approved the reinstatement of our share repurchase program. In the second quarter, we repurchased $102 million in shares. 
We took further actions to reduce our debt during the quarter. In late April, we issued $800 million of senior notes due in 2031. The proceeds from this issuance, together with cash on hand, were used to repay $1.25 billion of senior notes due in 2022. As a result of these actions, our balance sheet and credit ratings remain very strong. 
While we are very optimistic about our future prospects, we remain vigilant and are maintaining flexibility and are planning as conditions can quickly change. As we recently experienced in markets like Brazil, India and Japan, the pandemic remains a significant health risk. 
Overall, we are extremely pleased with our performance this quarter and proud of how we've navigated through the pandemic. Our results reflect Omnicom's ability to adapt and respond to changes in the market and deliver through down economic cycles. 
Let me now turn to the progress on our strategic and operational initiatives. As I mentioned, in early June, we completed the sale of ICON International, our specialty media business. The divestiture was part of our continuing realignment of portfolio of businesses and is consistent with our plan to dispose of companies that are no longer aligned with our long-term strategies and investment priorities. 
With the closing of this transaction, we are substantially complete with disposals. We expect our primary focus moving forward will be on pursuing accretive acquisitions in the areas of precision marketing, MarTech and digital transformation, commerce, media and health care. We have ramped up our M&A efforts in these areas, and we're pleased with the opportunities we are seeing. We remain disciplined with respect to our strategic approach and valuation parameters. 
Operationally, Omnicom continues to successfully deliver to our clients a comprehensive suite of marketing and communication services, supported by technology and analytic capabilities around the world. The leaders of our practice area, agencies and global clients have used this formula to strengthen our relationships and grow with existing clients as well as pursuing new business. 
Importantly, our organization allows our leadership team to quickly mobilize our efforts to deliver strategic solutions for our clients from across the group. Whether their need is for integrated services across regions or more bespoke individualized solutions in specific countries, we can simplify and organize our services in a manner that meets our clients' needs. 
For example, we have a long history of providing integrated services to some of the world's largest brands such as Apple, AT&T, Nissan and State Farm. And we continue to be successful in winning new business. A good example of this is our win with Philips, who named Omnicom as their global integrated service partner for creative media and communications. Over months long and highly competitive pitch, we are able to demonstrate the strength of our agencies and a delivery model that connects creativity, culture and technology to position Philips as a leader in the changing health industry. 
Another example of our integrated creative media and communications offerings is our recent win of the baby wipes brand, WaterWipes. We also serve clients and consistently win new business across dedicated service areas and geographies. For example, some of the wins this quarter, in addition to the ones mentioned above, were BBDO being named global lead strategic and creative agency partner for the Facebook app, Discover naming TBWA its brand creative agency of record, JetBlue hiring Adam & Eve as its new global creative partner, Red Bull awarding PHD in its media business in North America, BBDO being awarded Audi creative duties and social media communications in Singapore and PHD winning art media business in China and Virgin Atlantic selecting Lucky Generals as its lead creative agency. 
Our comprehensive suite of services and our ability to simplify how we bring them to our clients will continue to drive our success. Congratulations and thank you to our people for these wins and many more. 
In the second half, we expect to see an increase in new business activity across industry sectors, including CPG, luxury, health care, retail and automotive. I'm confident that our exceptional talent, range of services and our ability to organize our offerings to meet the needs of potential clients will allow us to capture more than our fair share of new business. 
Our constant innovation and service delivery has also resulted in highly regarded industry awards. At Cannes Lion Live 2021, our agencies were recognized for their excellence in both the creative and media disciplines. Omnicom's global creative networks, BBDO, DDB and TBWA, placed in the top 10 of the network over the festival competition, taking a highly coveted title. AMV BBDO was named Agency of the Festival. Omnicom media agencies, PHD and OMD, earned first and second place, respectively, in the media network of the festival's competition. And overall, more than 160 Omnicom agencies from 45 countries won more than 180 Lions. This impressive showing at Cannes Lion is just one example of how our agencies excelled. 
They received a number of other industry awards, which include FleishmanHillard being named Campaign Global PR Agency of the Year and TBWA APAC winning Digital Network of the Year, Goodby Silverstein & Partners making Ad Age's A-List and TBWA being made as an agency standout, DDB Worldwide winning 2021 Network of the Year at the 100th anniversary of the ADC award hosted by the One Club and DDB Germany being named Agency of the Year. These awards are a direct reflection of our relentless pursuit of creative excellence. 
Our best-in-class talent is what defines Omnicom and makes us an award-winning company. With this in mind, we are constantly looking to invest in our people and create opportunities across the enterprise, including at the C-suite level and throughout our senior leadership. 
A recent addition to our practice area leadership is Chris Foster, who is appointed CEO of Omnicom's Public Relations Group. Chris will oversee our entire PR portfolio, focusing on talent, innovation and cross-agency collaboration to drive growth. I'm confident that his track record of leading global growth initiatives, counseling executive-level clients and driving business development will lead to the continued success of OPRG. John Doolittle has been elevated to Chairman of OPRG. 
Another key leadership position we recently created is focused on our environmental sustainability initiatives. Last week, we appointed Karen van Bergen as Chief Environmental Sustainability Officer. Karen will be responsible for overseeing our climate change initiatives and processes, which includes setting measurable goals, policies and partnerships that will reduce our carbon footprint. This new position will be in addition to Karen's current role as EVP and Dean of Omnicom University. 
Environmental sustainability is an area where we are doubling down on our efforts. We established goals 5 years ago to lessen the impact of our operations on the environment, and we are now looking to drive even more progress. We are currently establishing new goals and commitments to reduce the carbon emissions produced by our operations and increase the amount of electricity we derive from renewable sources. 
In addition to these internal goals, Omnicom has joined numerous industry initiatives that will serve as catalysts for change. For example, several of our U.K. agencies have joined Ad Net Zero, the industry's initiative to achieve real net zero carbon emissions from the development, production, immediate placement of advertising by the end of 2030. 
And we are a founding member of #ChangeTheBrief Alliance, which calls for the agencies and marketers to harness the power of their advertising to promote sustainable consumer choices and behaviors. Karen is just the right leader for driving our initiatives in this critical area, given her long tenure with Omnicom and excellent previous experience working on environmental initiatives at multinational corporations. I have no doubt we will continue to raise the bar on our global operations and our work with organizations and clients to reduce our impact on the environment. 
Another critical area we have intensified our efforts over the past 12 months is DE&I. We have doubled the number of DE&I leaders throughout Omnicom over this time, and we have established specific KPIs to measure our progress. The KPIs are focused on hiring, advancement, promotion, retention, training and employee resource groups. This is a key step to ensuring DE&I is embedded across the leadership agenda with a full commitment and accountability of our network and practice areas CEOs. 
For Omnicom, DE&I starts at the top with our Board of Directors. Currently, our Board is the most diverse in the S&P 500, with 6 women and 4 African-American members, including our Lead Independent Director. We're also pleased that 3 of our 12 network and practice area CEOs are people of color or female. 
While it is still too early to measure our progress, I'm pleased to report that a preliminary review of our employee diversity in the United States shows a meaningful increase in the number of diverse employees as of June 30, 2021, compared to the end of 2020. I look forward to a lot more progress being made in the months ahead. 
Continuing the focus on our people, we are pleased many of them have returned to the office as government restrictions are reduced or eliminated. We are encouraging our people to begin to make plans to return to offices as conditions improve in their local markets. 
Overall, we believe a return to an office-centric culture will enable us to invent, collaborate and learn together most effectively. In turn, it will allow us to best serve our clients. The return to office will be grounded in safety and flexibility, and local leaders will determine what combination of office and remote work is most effective for their teams. I personally look forward to reengaging in person with our people and our clients over the coming weeks and months. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the second quarter results. Phil?"
96161,1673844609,2348060,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2021",2021-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning.

As John discussed in his remarks, while the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt across the globe, that impact has moderated significantly as evidenced by our return to growth in Q2. We expect our return to growth will continue in the second half. However, as long as COVID-19 remains a public health threat, some uncertainty regarding economic conditions will continue, which could impact our client spending plans. And the performance of our businesses may vary by geography and discipline. 
Organic growth for the quarter was 24.4% or $682 million, which represents a significant increase compared to Q2 of 2020, which reflected the onset of the pandemic when revenue declined by 23% or $855 million. In addition, in early June, we completed the disposition of ICON, our specialty media business, which resulted in a pretax gain of $50.5 million. The sale of ICON was consistent with our strategic plan and investment priorities, and the disposition is not expected to have a material impact on our ongoing operating income for 2021. 
Flipping to Slide 4 for a summary of our revenue performance for the second quarter. In addition to our organic revenue growth of 24.4% for the quarter, the impact of foreign exchange rates increased our revenue by 5.4% in the quarter, higher than we anticipated entering the quarter as the dollar continued to weaken against most of our larger currencies compared to the prior year. 
The impact on revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, decreased revenue by 2.2% primarily related to the sale of ICON. As a result, our reported revenue in the second quarter increased 27.5% to $3.57 billion from the $2.8 billion we reported for Q2 of 2020. I'll return to discuss the details of the changes in revenue in a few minutes. 
Turning back to Slide 1. Our reported operating profit for the quarter increased to $568 million, including the $50.5 million gain on the sale of ICON. As you remember, our Q2 2020 results included a $278 million COVID-19 repositioning charge, which included severance actions, real estate lease impairments and terminations and related fixed asset charges as well as a loss on the disposition of several small noncore underperforming agencies. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 15.9%, up significantly from Q2 2020 even after excluding the gain on the sale of ICON in the current period and adding back the repositioning charge recorded in Q2 of 2020. We also continue to see operating margin improvement year-over-year resulting from the proactive management of our discretionary addressable spend cost categories, including a reduction in travel and related costs as well as reductions in certain costs of operating our offices given the continued remote work environment as well as benefits from some of the repositioning actions taken back in the second quarter of 2020. 
Our reported EBITDA for the quarter was $590 million, and EBITDA margin was 16.5%. Excluding the $50.5 million gain on the ICON disposition, EBITDA margin for Q2 2021 was 15.1%. EBITDA margin in Q2 of 2020, after adding back the $278 million repositioning charge, was 12.9%. 
On Slide 3 of our investor presentation, we presented the details of our operating expenses. We've also included a supplemental slide on Page 15 that shows the 2021 amounts presented in constant dollars to exclude the effects of year-on-year FX changes. 
As we've discussed previously, we have and will continue to actively manage our costs to ensure they are aligned with our current revenues. We also continue to evaluate ways to improve efficiency throughout the organization focusing on real estate portfolio management, back-office services, procurement and IT services. 
As for the details, our salary and service costs are variable and fluctuate with revenue. They increased by about $300 million versus Q2 of 2020 or $220 million on a constant dollar basis driven by the increase in our overall business activity. We would also note that the Q2 2020 salary and service cost amounts were reduced by reimbursements received from government programs of $49.2 million. 
Third-party service costs increased by $275 million or $242 million on a constant dollar basis. These costs include expenses incurred with third-party vendors when we act as a principal when performing services for our clients. 
Occupancy and other costs, which are not directly linked to changes in revenue, increased by $4 million. Excluding the impact of FX, these costs declined by $10 million in the quarter as we continued our efforts to reduce infrastructure costs, and we benefited from a decrease in general office expenses as the majority of our staff continue to work remotely in Q2. 
SG&A expenses increased by $21 million or $18 million on a constant dollar basis, again related to the return to more normal activities in the quarter. And finally, depreciation and amortization declined by $3.6 million. 
Net interest expense in the second quarter of 2021 increased $26.3 million period-over-period to $73.5 million. Because of our solid working capital and cash flow performance during the pandemic period, in Q2, we determined we no longer needed the liquidity insurance we added in early April 2020 when we issued $600 million in debt and added a $400 million, 364-day revolving credit facility. 
In April 2021, the credit facility expired unused. In May, we issued $800 million of 2.6% senior notes due 2031. In June, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2.6% notes plus cash on hand we used to redeem early all of our outstanding $1.25 billion, 3.625% notes that were due in May of 2022. 
Gross interest expense in the second quarter of 2021 increased $26.6 million, resulting from the loss we recognized on the early redemption of all the outstanding $1.2 billion of 3.625% 2022 senior notes. Additionally, the impact of this refinancing activity reduced our leverage ratio to 2.2x at June 30, 2021, and is expected to result in lower interest expense on our debt in the second half of approximately $6 million as compared to the prior year. 
Interest income in the second quarter of 2021 was relatively flat. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 24.9%, down a bit from the effective tax rate we estimated for 2021 of between 26.5% to 27% primarily due to nominal taxes recorded on the book gain on sale. 
Earnings from our affiliates was marginally negative for the quarter, while the allocation of earnings to minority shareholders in certain of our agencies increased to $23.4 million. As a result, reported net income for the second quarter was $348.2 million. 
While we restarted our share repurchase program during the second quarter, our diluted share count for the quarter increased slightly versus Q2 of last year to 217.1 million shares, resulting from the year-over-year increase in our share price and the increase in common stock equivalents included in our diluted share count. As a result, our diluted EPS for the second quarter was $1.60 versus the loss of $0.11 per share we reported in Q2 of 2020. 
The gain on the sale of ICON and the loss on the early redemption of the 2022 senior notes resulted in a net increase of $31 million to net income or $0.14 to EPS. As we previously discussed, the prior year period included the net impact of the repositioning charges, which reduced last year's second quarter net income and EPS by $223.1 million and $1.03, respectively. 
On Slide 2, for your reference, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. 
Now returning to the details of the changes in our revenue performance on Slide 4. Our reported revenue for the second quarter was $3.57 billion, up $771 million or 27.5% from Q2 of 2020. 
Turning to the FX impact. On a year-over-year basis, the impact of foreign exchange rates increased our reported U.S. dollar revenue by 5.4% or $150.8 million, which was above the 3.5% to 4% increase that we estimated entering the quarter. The strengthening of foreign currencies against the dollar was widespread and included most of our largest major foreign currencies. 
In the quarter, the largest FX increases were driven by the strengthening of the euro, the British pound, the Chinese yuan and the Australian dollar. In the quarter, the U.S. dollar only strengthened against the Japanese yen and the Russian ruble. In light of the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to 2020, assuming FX rates continue where they currently stand, our estimate is that FX could increase our reported revenues by approximately 1.5% for the third quarter and 1% for the fourth quarter, resulting in a full year projected increase of approximately 2.5%. 
The impact of our acquisition and disposition activities over the past 12 months, primarily reflecting the ICON disposition as well as the recent acquisitions of Archbow and Areteans during the second quarter of 2021 resulted in a net decrease in revenue of $62 million in the quarter or 2.2%. Based on transactions that have been completed through June 30, 2021, our estimate is the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity for the balance of the year will decrease revenue by between 6% to 7% for the third and fourth quarters, resulting in a full year reduction of approximately 4%. 
While we will continue our process of evaluating our portfolio of businesses as part of our strategic planning, as John has said with regard to dispositions, we're substantially complete. Our organic growth of $682 million or 24.4% in the second quarter reflects strong performance across all of our major geographic markets and across all of our service disciplines. 
Turning to our mix of business by discipline on Page 5. For the second quarter, the split was 56% for advertising and 44% for marketing services. As for the organic change by discipline, advertising was up nearly 30% primarily on the growth of our media businesses, reflecting a strong recovery of activity within the media space. 
Our global and national advertising agencies achieved strong growth this quarter, although the pace of growth by agency remains somewhat mixed. CRM Precision Marketing increased 25%. Through the strength of their service offerings, the agencies within this discipline have delivered solid revenue performance throughout the pandemic, and they continue to perform well. 
CRM Commerce and Brand Consulting was up 15.2%, but the performance within this discipline was mixed as our shopper marketing agencies cycled through the effects of recent client losses. While organic revenue for CRM Experiential was up over 50%, it should be noted that events were virtually shut down as lockdowns took effect in March and April of 2020. While government restrictions on events have been eased recently in certain markets, these businesses still face challenges regarding when they will return to prepandemic levels. 
CRM Execution & Support was up 22.7%, reflecting a recovery in client spend compared to Q2 of 2020 in our field marketing and merchandising point-of-sale businesses, while our non-for-profit businesses continue to lag. PR was up 15.1% coming off pandemic lows in 2020. 
And finally, our Healthcare discipline was up 4.5% organically. Healthcare was the only one of our service disciplines that had positive organic growth in Q2 of 2020. The performance of these agencies remain solid across the group. 
Now turning to the details of our regional mix of businesses on Page 6. You can see the quarterly split was 51.5% in the U.S., 3.3% for the rest of North America, 10.6% in the U.K., 18.6% for the rest of Europe, 12.5% for Asia Pacific, 2% for Latin America and 1% to the Middle East and Africa. 
In reviewing the details of our performance by region on Page 7, organic revenue in the second quarter in the U.S. was up nearly 20% or $316 million. Our advertising discipline was positive for the quarter. Our media agencies excelled in the quarter as did our CRM Precision Marketing agencies and our PR agencies and our Commerce and Brand Consulting category rebounded to growth in the quarter, while our Healthcare agencies were flat versus last year when organic growth was 3.7% in the quarter. 
Our other CRM domestic disciplines, Experiential and Execution & Support, also performed well organically versus Q2 of 2020. We expect it will take a bit longer for them to return to 2019 revenue levels as social distancing restrictions and pandemic concerns subside. 
Outside the U.S., our other North American agencies were up 37% driven by the strength of our media and precision marketing agencies in Canada. Our U.K. agencies were up 23.8% organically led by the performance of our CRM Precision Marketing, Advertising and Healthcare agencies. The rest of Europe was up 34.5% organically. 
In the Eurozone, among our major markets, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands were up greater than 30% organically, while Spain was up in the mid-single digits. Outside the Eurozone, our organic growth was up around 35% during the quarter. 
Organic revenue performance in Asia Pacific for the quarter was up 27.9% with our performance from our agencies in Australia, Greater China, India and New Zealand leading the way. Latin America was up 20.8% organically in the quarter, with our agencies in Mexico and Colombia growing more than 20%, and Brazil was up almost 17%. And lastly, the Middle East and Africa was up over 40% for the quarter. 
On Slide 8, we present our revenue by industry information on a year-to-date basis. We've seen an improvement in performance across most industries with the overall mix of revenue by industry remaining relatively stable. The travel and entertainment sector was boosted in Q2 of 2021 by increased activity related to spend by clients in the entertainment category, which mitigated continued reduced spend levels for many of our travel and lodging clients. 
Turning to our cash flow performance. On Slide 9, you can see that the first 6 months of the year, we generated nearly $800 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, up over $70 million versus the first half of last year. 
As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 10, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $292 million, up about $10 million when compared to last year due to the $0.05 per share increase in the quarterly payment, effective with dividend payment we made in April. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $39 million. 
Capital expenditures in the first half of 2021 were $23 million. Acquisitions, which include our recently completed transactions as well as earnout payments, totaled $36 million. And stock repurchases were $95 million, net of the proceeds from our stock plans, reflecting the resumption of our share repurchases during the second quarter of this year. As a result of our continuing efforts to prudently manage the use of our cash, we were able to generate $311 million of free cash flow during the first half of the year. 
Regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter as detailed on Slide 11, our total debt is $5.31 billion, down about $410 million since this time last year and down just over $500 million compared to year-end 2020. Both changes reflect the early retirement in Q2 of 2021 of $1.25 billion of 3.65% senior notes, which were due in 2022, partially replaced with the issuance of $800 million of 2.6% 10-year notes due in 2031. 
In addition to the net reduction in debt of $450 million from the refinancing, the only other meaningful change to the net balance for the LTM period was an increase of approximately $65 million, resulting from the FX impact of converting our EUR 1 billion denominated borrowings into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date. Our net debt position as of June 30 was $922 million, up about $710 million from last year-end, but down $1.5 billion when compared to where we stood 12 months ago. The increase in net debt since year-end was a result of the typical uses of working capital that occur over the first half of the year totaling just under $1.1 billion, which was partially offset by the $311 million we generated in free cash flow in the first half of the year. Over the past 12 months, the improvement in net debt is primarily due to our positive free cash flow of $790 million, positive changes in operating capital of $525 million and the impact of FX on our cash and debt balances, which decreased our net debt position by $154 million. 
As for our debt ratios, as a result of our overall operating improvement versus Q2 of 2020 on our recent refinancing activity, we've reduced our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 0.4x. As a result of our overall operating improvement versus Q2 of 2020 and our recent refinancing activity, we've reduced our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 0.4x. 
And finally, moving to our historical returns on Page 12. In the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio was 25.9%, while our return on equity was 46.8%, both significantly better than our returns from 12 months ago. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included several of the supplemental slides in our presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

The first one, really, I guess, on ICON and the disposition there. I think you mentioned it won't have too much of an impact on the business going forward, but it sounds like it's a pretty sizable revenue contributor, given the fact that it is impacting the disposition going forward. 
So I'm wondering you must be -- as a much more of a low-margin business, so maybe a positive for profitability longer term now that you're no longer involved in that business? And then maybe just if you can comment on margins in general, how we should think about them longer term? I think you mentioned this year more of a baseline looking like 2019, but given the efficiencies that some of them might be permanent on the real estate side, should we think of maybe slightly higher margins longer term?"

We had purchased ICON in 2000, and it grew rather nicely for the first 10 or 15 years. And then for the last several years, it's actually -- it hasn't declined, but it hasn't grown. 
And you take a large number with no growth, it mutes the growth of the rest of the organization. And the margins are such that we more than make it up for in our pursuit of more profit and EBIT, and we've taken all that into consideration. Took quite a long time to take a decision, but we finally did. 
And the most important aspect because we can cover the profits, it was a low-margin business, is that we're substantially complete with the exercise that we started 3, 4 years ago of scrutinizing the portfolio and ridding ourselves of legacy companies that weren't going to contribute to our long-term growth. So we're very happy with the decision and [ that's for that ] spend. I'll do a great [indiscernible] on margin, and Phil can add to both of my comments. 
With respect to margins, we've said all along that we think 2019 is really the benchmark that we're going to look at and then start to plan some growth from. Last year, you had the disruption of COVID in every single office of Omnicom. You had the restructuring charges we had to take, and you had government subsidies in certain instances, but they certainly didn't cover the cost that we've incurred. We will get efficiencies for certain out of the real estate actions that we took in the agile workforce and hybrid workforce that will be impacted as we come back to work. 
But against that, what you have is you have some inflation in terms of wages. And net of -- and the resurgence of some of the addressable spend that when people weren't permitted to get on the airplanes and visit offices, they will be and hopefully, in the near term. I know I've been able to travel, but principally because of my position, I've been able to go wherever I want. But most people can't do that. So Phil, you might want to add on both parts."

We do expect, and we did expect that the first half certainly of '20 would be a little easier, given the remote workforce impact on both the addressable spend that John just touched on. And not having as many people back in the office reduces some of the operating costs associated with running those offices when people are back. 
Some of that's going to come back. We're going to welcome a bunch of costs back. When we're in growth mode like we are now, the challenge is going to be continuing to be disciplined about controlling those costs. So I think the goal is certainly to do a bit better than '19, but t '19 is really the baseline for the business going forward and then striving to do better than it."

We're starting to bring back the vaccinated people that we have in earnest after Labor Day. And I think people are encouraged to come back to the office. So yes, there's hesitancy on the part of everyone because we don't know, we can't predict the future. But we do know that we have lived through a hell of the past, and we've done it successfully. So that gives us confidence. 
And the other thing which will be temporary, I think, is there's going to be certain industries where we're already seeing some concern about the adjustments that have had to be made to certain clients' supply lines and certain components, but they need a delay in receiving them. But we see that as a temporary issue as do most of our clients, at least ones that I've been speaking to."

And without the burden of a [ known ] growth large entity makes it more achievable than it was the last time I said it. 
Doesn't mean it's going to happen next week, but we do know the quality of our businesses and the quality of our portfolio. We have the benefit of having always protected the creative product, which is our ISP. And whilst we have the technology and all the other systems, we can service a client, like in the case of Philips as if we're one company Omnicom or if a client has individual needs, our brands are more than happy and excellent and excel at taking care of them. So that's all going to benefit that. 
In terms of acquisition pricing, you're absolutely right. There's an insane amount of money chasing things that are out there. We've always looked for people who wanted to be partners on a longer term, and we've always looked to do accretive acquisitions. And when we have been able to find accretive acquisitions, we've borne the expense of taking -- of starting up companies and doing things ourselves. 
I think as we have -- I know, I don't think, as we go forward, there's 1 or 2 areas which I'm not going to tell you -- speak about it on the phone. And probably I'd be willing to break even on if I had to pay the price to get the reputation to use as a basis from which spend to grow organically. But none of that at this point is going to result in the increase in our leverage and our capital program, which I typically have in my script and I didn't bother to mention this time is exactly the same. 
It's first to pay our dividends; second to do accretive acquisitions; and last but not least, share buybacks. Again, Phil, you want to?"

On the call with me today is John Wren, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Angelastro, our Chief Financial Officer. 
We hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release. We have posted to www.omnicomgroup.com this morning's press release along with the presentation covering the information that we will review this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website. 
Before we start, I've been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that we have included at the end of our investor presentation and to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements, and that these statements are our present expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially. 
I would also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials. 
We are going to begin this morning's call with an overview of our business from John Wren. Then Phil Angelastro will review our financial results for the quarter, and then we will open the line for your questions."

I hope you are staying safe and healthy. We are pleased to kick off today's call by reporting that we've rounded the corner into positive growth. We had extremely strong results, top and",2448,"Thank you, Joanne, and good morning to everyone on the call today. I hope you are staying safe and healthy. 
We are pleased to kick off today's call by reporting that we've rounded the corner into positive growth. We had extremely strong results, top and bottom line, and continue to make very good progress on several of our strategic initiatives. 
Organic growth for the second quarter was a positive 24.4%. This growth was broad-based across our agencies, geographies, disciplines and client sectors. We experienced a significant increase in spend from existing clients as the effects of the pandemic subsided, and we benefited from strong new business wins. 
EBIT was $568 million in the quarter, an increase of 67% versus the second quarter of 2020. Q2 2021 included a gain of $50.5 million from the sale of ICON International in early June. And Q2 2020 EBIT included $278 million of charges related to the repositioning actions. 
Excluding gains and charges, EBIT margin was 14.5% in the quarter compared to 12.2% in Q2 2020. Phil will provide further details on expected impact of the sale of ICON on our results for the balance of the year. 
As we stated on our last call, we view 2019 as a reasonable proxy for our ongoing margin expectations. Excluding the sale of ICON, our 6-month 2021 EBIT margin was 14%, which is in line with our EBIT margin of 13.9% for the first 6 months of 2019. 
Net income was $348 million in the second quarter, an increase of 75% from the second quarter of 2020. And EPS was $1.60 per share, an increase of 74%. The net impact of the gain on the sale of ICON, which was offset by an interest expense charge related to the early retirement of debt increased EPS in Q2 2021 by $0.14 per share. 
Before I provide more comments on our financial performance and progress on our strategic initiatives, I want to acknowledge the work of our leadership team and all of our people for these financial results. Our leaders took difficult and effective actions over the past 1.5 years. At the same time, they remained laser-focused on the health of their teams, servicing our clients, winning new business and managing their cost structures. 
Our ability to navigate in this environment and come out the other side with such strong results is a testament to their commitment as well as the dedication and tireless effort of our people around the world. I want to thank them for their outstanding contributions. 
Turning now to our performance by geography. Every region had double-digit growth in the quarter. The U.S. was up just shy of 20% in the quarter. All U.S. disciplines had double-digit growth, except for Healthcare, which was up in the low single digits. It was the one discipline that grew in Q2 of 2020. 
Other North America was up 37.1%. The U.K. was up 23.8% with all disciplines in double digits. Overall growth in the Euro and non-Euro region was 34.5%. In Asia Pacific, we had 27.9% increase, with all major countries who experienced double-digit growth. Our events business in China had another quarter of strong performance. Latin America was up 20.8%. And the Middle East and Africa increased 42.8%. 
By discipline, all areas were up year-over-year as follows: Advertising and Media, 29.8%; CRM Precision Marketing, 25%; CRM Commerce and Brand Consultancy, 15.2%; CRM Experiential, 53%; CRM Execution & Support, 22.7%; PR, 15.1%; and Healthcare, 4.5%. 
Looking forward, we expect to continue to see positive organic growth as client spend increases, albeit at a slower pace than we experienced in Q2. Our management teams are continuing to align costs with our revenues as markets reopen around the world. 
Many of our companies are hiring staff to service an increase in client spend and the new business wins. And we are seeing some pressure on our staff costs, particularly in the U.S., as the labor markets remain tight. 
We're also beginning to see a return of travel and certain other addressable spend as government restrictions have eased. Based on our use of technology during the pandemic, we are developing practices, particularly with respect to travel, that should allow us to continue to retain some of the benefits we achieved in addressable spend. We expect that the increase in addressable spend in the second half of the year will be mitigated in part by the benefits we will achieve from a hybrid and agile workforce. 
Turning to our cash flow. We again performed very strongly. For the first half of the year, we generated approximately $800 million in free cash flow. 
As we indicated last quarter, in addition to our dividend increase, in May, our Board approved the reinstatement of our share repurchase program. In the second quarter, we repurchased $102 million in shares. 
We took further actions to reduce our debt during the quarter. In late April, we issued $800 million of senior notes due in 2031. The proceeds from this issuance, together with cash on hand, were used to repay $1.25 billion of senior notes due in 2022. As a result of these actions, our balance sheet and credit ratings remain very strong. 
While we are very optimistic about our future prospects, we remain vigilant and are maintaining flexibility and are planning as conditions can quickly change. As we recently experienced in markets like Brazil, India and Japan, the pandemic remains a significant health risk. 
Overall, we are extremely pleased with our performance this quarter and proud of how we've navigated through the pandemic. Our results reflect Omnicom's ability to adapt and respond to changes in the market and deliver through down economic cycles. 
Let me now turn to the progress on our strategic and operational initiatives. As I mentioned, in early June, we completed the sale of ICON International, our specialty media business. The divestiture was part of our continuing realignment of portfolio of businesses and is consistent with our plan to dispose of companies that are no longer aligned with our long-term strategies and investment priorities. 
With the closing of this transaction, we are substantially complete with disposals. We expect our primary focus moving forward will be on pursuing accretive acquisitions in the areas of precision marketing, MarTech and digital transformation, commerce, media and health care. We have ramped up our M&A efforts in these areas, and we're pleased with the opportunities we are seeing. We remain disciplined with respect to our strategic approach and valuation parameters. 
Operationally, Omnicom continues to successfully deliver to our clients a comprehensive suite of marketing and communication services, supported by technology and analytic capabilities around the world. The leaders of our practice area, agencies and global clients have used this formula to strengthen our relationships and grow with existing clients as well as pursuing new business. 
Importantly, our organization allows our leadership teams to quickly mobilize our efforts to deliver strategic solutions for our clients from across the group. Whether their need is for integrated services across regions or more bespoke individualized solutions in specific countries, we can simplify and organize our services in a manner that meets our clients' needs. 
For example, we have a long history of providing integrated services to some of the world's largest brands such as Apple, AT&T, Nissan and State Farm. And we continue to be successful in winning new business. A good example of this is our win with Philips, who named Omnicom as their global integrated service partner for creative media and communications. Over months long and highly competitive pitch, we are able to demonstrate the strength of our agencies and a delivery model that connects creativity, culture and technology to position Philips as a leader in the changing health industry. 
Another example of our integrated creative media and communications offerings is our recent win of the baby wipes brand, WaterWipes. We also serve clients and consistently win new business across dedicated service areas and geographies. For example, some of the wins this quarter, in addition to the ones mentioned above, were BBDO being named global lead strategic and creative agency partner for the Facebook app, Discover naming TBWA its brand creative agency of record, JetBlue hiring adam&eve as its new global creative partner, Red Bull awarding PHD in its media business in North America, BBDO being awarded Audi creative duties and social media communications in Singapore and PHD winning Audi media business in China, and Virgin Atlantic selecting Lucky Generals as its lead creative agency. 
Our comprehensive suite of services and our ability to simplify how we bring them to our clients will continue to drive our success. Congratulations and thank you to our people for these wins and many more. 
In the second half, we expect to see an increase in new business activity across industry sectors, including CPG, luxury, health care, retail and automotive. I'm confident that our exceptional talent, range of services and our ability to organize our offerings to meet the needs of potential clients will allow us to capture more than our fair share of new business. 
Our constant innovation and service delivery has also resulted in highly regarded industry awards. At Cannes Lion Live 2021, our agencies were recognized for their excellence in both the creative and media disciplines. Omnicom's global creative networks, BBDO, DDB and TBWA, placed in the top 10 of the network over the festival competition. Taking a highly coveted title, AMV BBDO was named Agency of the Festival. Omnicom media agencies, PHD and OMD, earned first and second place, respectively, in the media network of the festival's competition. And overall, more than 160 Omnicom agencies from 45 countries won more than 180 Lions. This impressive showing at Cannes Lion is just one example of how our agencies excelled. 
They received a number of other industry awards, which include FleishmanHillard being named Campaign Global PR Agency of the Year and TBWA APAC winning Digital Network of the Year, Goodby Silverstein & Partners making Ad Age's A-Lis,t, and TBWA being made as an agency standout, DDB Worldwide winning 2021 Network of the Year at the 100th anniversary of the ADC Awards hosted by The One Club, and DDB Germany being named Agency of the Year. These awards are a direct reflection of our relentless pursuit of creative excellence.  
Our best-in-class talent is what defines Omnicom and makes us an award-winning company. With this in mind, we are constantly looking to invest in our people and create opportunities across the enterprise, including at the C-suite level and throughout our senior leadership. 
A recent addition to our practice area leadership is Chris Foster, who is appointed CEO of Omnicom's Public Relations Group. Chris will oversee our entire PR portfolio, focusing on talent, innovation and cross-agency collaboration to drive growth. I'm confident that his track record of leading global growth initiatives, counseling executive-level clients and driving business development will lead to the continued success of OPRG. John Doolittle has been elevated to Chairman of OPRG. 
Another key leadership position we recently created is focused on our environmental sustainability initiatives. Last week, we appointed Karen van Bergen as Chief Environmental Sustainability Officer. Karen will be responsible for overseeing our climate change initiatives and processes, which includes setting measurable goals, policies and partnerships that will reduce our carbon footprint. This new position will be in addition to Karen's current role as EVP and Dean of Omnicom University. 
Environmental sustainability is an area where we are doubling down on our efforts. We established goals 5 years ago to lessen the impact of our operations on the environment, and we are now looking to drive even more progress. We are currently establishing new goals and commitments to reduce the carbon emissions produced by our operations and increase the amount of electricity we derive from renewable sources. 
In addition to these internal goals, Omnicom has joined numerous industry initiatives that will serve as catalysts for change. For example, several of our U.K. agencies have joined Ad Net Zero, the industry's initiative to achieve real net zero carbon emissions from the development, production, immediate placement of advertising by the end of 2030. 
And we are a founding member of #ChangeTheBrief Alliance, which calls for the agencies and marketers to harness the power of their advertising to promote sustainable consumer choices and behaviors. Karen is just the right leader for driving our initiatives in this critical area, given her long tenure with Omnicom and excellent previous experience working on environmental initiatives at multinational corporations. I have no doubt we will continue to raise the bar on our global operations and our work with organizations and clients to reduce our impact on the environment. 
Another critical area we have intensified our efforts over the past 12 months is DE&I. We have doubled the number of DE&I leaders throughout Omnicom over this time, and we have established specific KPIs to measure our progress. The KPIs are focused on hiring, advancement, promotion, retention, training and employee resource groups. This is a key step to ensuring DE&I is embedded across the leadership agenda with a full commitment and accountability of our network and practice areas CEOs. 
For Omnicom, DE&I starts at the top with our Board of Directors. Currently, our Board is the most diverse in the S&P 500, with 6 women and 4 African-American members, including our Lead Independent Director. We're also pleased that 3 of our 12 network and practice area CEOs are people of color or female. 
While it is still too early to measure our progress, I'm pleased to report that a preliminary review of our employee diversity in the United States shows a meaningful increase in the number of diverse employees as of June 30, 2021, compared to the end of 2020. I look forward to a lot more progress being made in the months ahead. 
Continuing the focus on our people, we are pleased many of them have returned to the office as government restrictions are reduced or eliminated. We are encouraging our people to begin to make plans to return to offices as conditions improve in their local markets. 
Overall, we believe a return to an office-centric culture will enable us to invent, collaborate and learn together most effectively. In turn, it will allow us to best serve our clients. The return to office will be grounded in safety and flexibility, and local leaders will determine what combination of office and remote work is most effective for their teams. I personally look forward to reengaging in person with our people and our clients over the coming weeks and months. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the second quarter results. Phil?"
96161,1673844609,2348139,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2021",2021-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning. As John discussed in his remarks, while the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt across the globe, that impact has moderated significantly as evidenced by our return to growth in Q2. We expect our return to growth wi",2889,"Thanks, John, and good morning. As John discussed in his remarks, while the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt across the globe, that impact has moderated significantly as evidenced by our return to growth in Q2. We expect our return to growth will continue in the second half. However, as long as COVID-19 remains a public health threat, some uncertainty regarding economic conditions will continue, which could impact our clients' spending plans, and the performance of our businesses may vary by geography and discipline. 
Organic growth for the quarter was 24.4% or $682 million, which represents a significant increase compared to Q2 of 2020, which reflected the onset of the pandemic when revenue declined by 23% or $855 million. In addition, in early June, we completed the disposition of ICON, our specialty media business, which resulted in a pretax gain of $50.5 million. The sale of ICON was consistent with our strategic plan and investment priorities, and the disposition is not expected to have a material impact on our ongoing operating income for 2021. 
Flipping to Slide 4 for a summary of our revenue performance for the second quarter. In addition to our organic revenue growth of 24.4% for the quarter, the impact of foreign exchange rates increased our revenue by 5.4% in the quarter, higher than we anticipated entering the quarter as the dollar continued to weaken against most of our larger currencies compared to the prior year. 
The impact on revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, decreased revenue by 2.2% primarily related to the sale of ICON. As a result, our reported revenue in the second quarter increased 27.5% to $3.57 billion from the $2.8 billion we reported for Q2 of 2020. I'll return to discuss the details of the changes in revenue in a few minutes. 
Turning back to Slide 1. Our reported operating profit for the quarter increased to $568 million, including the $50.5 million gain on the sale of ICON. As you remember, our Q2 2020 results included a $278 million COVID-19 repositioning charge, which included severance actions, real estate lease impairments and terminations and related fixed asset charges as well as a loss on the disposition of several small noncore underperforming agencies. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 15.9%, up significantly from Q2 2020 even after excluding the gain on the sale of ICON in the current period and adding back the repositioning charge recorded in Q2 of 2020. We also continued to see operating margin improvement year-over-year resulting from the proactive management of our discretionary addressable spend cost categories, including a reduction in travel and related costs as well as reductions in certain costs of operating our offices given the continued remote work environment as well as benefits from some of the repositioning actions taken back in the second quarter of 2020. 
Our reported EBITDA for the quarter was $590 million, and EBITDA margin was 16.5%. Excluding the $50.5 million gain on the ICON disposition, EBITDA margin for Q2 2021 was 15.1%. EBITDA margin in Q2 of 2020, after adding back the $278 million repositioning charge, was 12.9%. 
On Slide 3 of our investor presentation, we presented the details of our operating expenses. We've also included a supplemental slide on Page 15 that shows the 2021 amounts presented in constant dollars to exclude the effects of year-on-year FX changes. 
As we've discussed previously, we have and will continue to actively manage our costs to ensure they are aligned with our current revenues. We also continue to evaluate ways to improve efficiency throughout the organization, focusing on real estate portfolio management, back-office services, procurement and IT services. 
As for the details, our salary and service costs are variable and fluctuate with revenue. They increased by about $300 million versus Q2 of 2020 or $220 million on a constant dollar basis driven by the increase in our overall business activity. We would also note that the Q2 2020 salary and service cost amounts were reduced by reimbursements received from government programs of $49.2 million. 
Third-party service costs increased by $275 million or $242 million on a constant dollar basis. These costs include expenses incurred with third-party vendors when we act as a principal when performing services for our clients. 
Occupancy and other costs, which are not directly linked to changes in revenue, increased by $4 million. Excluding the impact of FX, these costs declined by $10 million in the quarter as we continued our efforts to reduce infrastructure costs, and we benefited from a decrease in general office expenses as the majority of our staff continue to work remotely in Q2. 
SG&A expenses increased by $21 million or $18 million on a constant dollar basis, again related to the return to more normal activities in the quarter. And finally, depreciation and amortization declined by $3.6 million. 
Net interest expense in the second quarter of 2021 increased $26.3 million period-over-period to $73.5 million. Because of our solid working capital and cash flow performance during the pandemic period, in Q2, we determined we no longer needed the liquidity insurance we added in early April 2020 when we issued $600 million in debt and added a $400 million, 364-day revolving credit facility. 
In April 2021, the credit facility expired unused. In May, we issued $800 million of 2.6% senior notes due 2031. In June, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2.6% notes plus cash on hand we used to redeem early all of our outstanding $1.25 billion 3.625% notes that were due in May of 2022. 
Gross interest expense in the second quarter of 2021 increased $26.6 million, resulting from the loss we recognized on the early redemption of all the outstanding $1.2 billion of 3.625% 2022 senior notes. Additionally, the impact of this refinancing activity reduced our leverage ratio to 2.2x at June 30, 2021, and is expected to result in lower interest expense on our debt in the second half of approximately $6 million as compared to the prior year. 
Interest income in the second quarter of 2021 was relatively flat. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 24.9%, down a bit from the effective tax rate we estimated for 2021 of between 26.5% to 27% primarily due to nominal taxes recorded on the book gain on sale. 
Earnings from our affiliates was marginally negative for the quarter, while the allocation of earnings to minority shareholders in certain of our agencies increased to $23.4 million. As a result, our reported net income for the second quarter was $348.2 million. 
While we restarted our share repurchase program during the second quarter, our diluted share count for the quarter increased slightly versus Q2 of last year to 217.1 million shares, resulting from the year-over-year increase in our share price and the increase in common stock equivalents included in our diluted share count. As a result, our diluted EPS for the second quarter was $1.60 versus the loss of $0.11 per share we reported in Q2 of 2020. 
The gain on the sale of ICON and the loss on the early redemption of the 2022 senior notes resulted in a net increase of $31 million to net income or $0.14 to EPS. As we previously discussed, the prior year period included the net impact of the repositioning charges, which reduced last year's second quarter net income and EPS by $223.1 million and $1.03, respectively. 
On Slide 2, for your reference, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. 
Now returning to the details of the changes in our revenue performance on Slide 4. Our reported revenue for the second quarter was $3.57 billion, up $771 million or 27.5% from Q2 of 2020. 
Turning to the FX impact. On a year-over-year basis, the impact of foreign exchange rates increased our reported U.S. dollar revenue by 5.4% or $150.8 million, which was above the 3.5% to 4% increase that we estimated entering the quarter. The strengthening of foreign currencies against the dollar was widespread and included most of our largest major foreign currencies. 
In the quarter, the largest FX increases were driven by the strengthening of the euro, the British pound, the Chinese yuan and the Australian dollar. In the quarter, the U.S. dollar only strengthened against the Japanese yen and the Russian ruble. In light of the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to 2020, assuming FX rates continue where they currently stand, our estimate is that FX could increase our reported revenues by approximately 1.5% for the third quarter and 1% for the fourth quarter, resulting in a full year projected increase of approximately 2.5%. 
The impact of our acquisition and disposition activities over the past 12 months, primarily reflecting the ICON disposition as well as the recent acquisitions of Archbow and Areteans during the second quarter of 2021 resulted in a net decrease in revenue of $62 million in the quarter or 2.2%. Based on transactions that have been completed through June 30, 2021, our estimate is the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity for the balance of the year will decrease revenue by between 6% to 7% for the third and fourth quarters, resulting in a full year reduction of approximately 4%. 
While we will continue our process of evaluating our portfolio of businesses as part of our strategic planning, as John has said with regard to dispositions, we're substantially complete. Our organic growth of $682 million or 24.4% in the second quarter reflects strong performance across all of our major geographic markets and across all of our service disciplines. 
Turning to our mix of business by discipline on Page 5. For the second quarter, the split was 56% for advertising and 44% for marketing services. As for the organic change by discipline, advertising was up nearly 30% primarily on the growth of our media businesses, reflecting a strong recovery of activity within the media space. 
Our global and national advertising agencies achieved strong growth this quarter, although the pace of growth by agency remains somewhat mixed. CRM Precision Marketing increased 25%. Through the strength of their service offerings, the agencies within this discipline have delivered solid revenue performance throughout the pandemic, and they continue to perform well. 
CRM Commerce and Brand Consulting was up 15.2%, but the performance within this discipline was mixed as our shopper marketing agencies cycled through the effects of recent client losses. While organic revenue for CRM Experiential was up over 50%, it should be noted that events were virtually shut down as lockdowns took effect in March and April of 2020. While government restrictions on events have been eased recently in certain markets, these businesses still face challenges regarding when they will return to pre-pandemic levels. 
CRM Execution & Support was up 22.7%, reflecting a recovery in client spend compared to Q2 of 2020 in our field marketing and merchandising point-of-sale businesses, while our non-for-profit businesses continue to lag. PR was up 15.1% coming off pandemic lows in 2020. 
And finally, our Healthcare discipline was up 4.5% organically. Healthcare was the only one of our service disciplines that had positive organic growth in Q2 of 2020. The performance of these agencies remain solid across the group. 
Now turning to the details of our regional mix of businesses on Page 6. You can see the quarterly split was 51.5% in the U.S., 3.3% for the rest of North America, 10.6% in the U.K., 18.6% for the rest of Europe, 12.5% for Asia Pacific, 2% for Latin America and 1% for the Middle East and Africa. 
In reviewing the details of our performance by region on Page 7, organic revenue in the second quarter in the U.S. was up nearly 20% or $316 million. Our Advertising discipline was positive for the quarter. Our media agencies excelled in the quarter as did our CRM Precision Marketing agencies and our PR agencies and our Commerce and Brand Consulting category rebounded to growth in the quarter, while our Healthcare agencies were flat versus last year when organic growth was 3.7% in the quarter. 
Our other CRM domestic disciplines, Experiential and Execution & Support, also performed well organically versus Q2 of 2020. We expect it will take a bit longer for them to return to 2019 revenue levels as social distancing restrictions and pandemic concerns subside. 
Outside the U.S., our Other North American agencies were up 37% driven by the strength of our media and precision marketing agencies in Canada. Our U.K. agencies were up 23.8% organically led by the performance of our CRM Precision Marketing, Advertising and Healthcare agencies. The rest of Europe was up 34.5% organically. 
In the Eurozone, among our major markets, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands were up greater than 30% organically, while Spain was up in the mid-single digits. Outside the Eurozone, our organic growth was up around 35% during the quarter. 
Organic revenue performance in Asia Pacific for the quarter was up 27.9% with our performance from our agencies in Australia, Greater China, India and New Zealand leading the way. Latin America was up 20.8% organically in the quarter, with our agencies in Mexico and Colombia growing more than 20%, and Brazil was up almost 17%. And lastly, the Middle East and Africa was up over 40% for the quarter. 
On Slide 8, we present our revenue by industry information on a year-to-date basis. We've seen an improvement in performance across most industries with the overall mix of revenue by industry remaining relatively stable. The travel and entertainment sector was boosted in Q2 of 2021 by increased activity related to spend by clients in the entertainment category, which mitigated continued reduced spend levels for many of our travel and lodging clients. 
Turning to our cash flow performance. On Slide 9, you can see that the first 6 months of the year, we generated nearly $800 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, up over $70 million versus the first half of last year. 
As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 10, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $292 million, up about $10 million when compared to last year due to the $0.05 per share increase in the quarterly payment, effective with dividend payment we made in April. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $39 million. 
Capital expenditures in the first half of 2021 were $23 million. Acquisitions, which include our recently completed transactions as well as earnout payments, totaled $36 million. And stock repurchases were $95 million, net of the proceeds from our stock plans, reflecting the resumption of our share repurchases during the second quarter of this year. As a result of our continuing efforts to prudently manage the use of our cash, we were able to generate $311 million of free cash flow during the first half of the year. 
Regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter as detailed on Slide 11, our total debt is $5.31 billion, down about $410 million since this time last year and down just over $500 million compared to year-end 2020. Both changes reflect the early retirement in Q2 of 2021 of $1.25 billion of 3.65% senior notes which were due in 2022, partially replaced with the issuance of $800 million of 2.6% 10-year notes due in 2031. 
In addition to the net reduction in debt of $450 million from the refinancing, the only other meaningful change to the net balance for the LTM period was an increase of approximately $65 million, resulting from the FX impact of converting our EUR 1 billion denominated borrowings into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date. Our net debt position as of June 30 was $922 million, up about $710 million from last year-end, but down $1.5 billion when compared to where we stood 12 months ago. The increase in net debt since year-end was a result of the typical uses of working capital that occur over the first half of the year totaling just under $1.1 billion, which was partially offset by the $311 million we generated in free cash flow in the first half of the year. Over the past 12 months, the improvement in net debt is primarily due to our positive free cash flow of $790 million, positive changes in operating capital of $525 million and the impact of FX on our cash and debt balances, which decreased our net debt position by $154 million. 
As for our debt ratios, as a result of our overall operating improvement versus Q2 of 2020 on our recent refinancing activity, we've reduced our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 0.4x. As a result of our overall operating improvement versus Q2 of 2020 and our recent refinancing activity, we've reduced our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 0.4x. 
And finally, moving to our historical returns on Page 12. In the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio was 25.9%, while our return on equity was 46.8%, both significantly better than our returns from 12 months ago. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included several of the supplemental slides in our presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

The first one, really, I guess, on ICON and the disposition there. I think you mentioned it won't have too much of an impact on the business going forward, but it sounds like it's a pretty sizable revenue contributor, given the fact that it is impacting the disposition going forward. 
So I'm wondering it must be -- is it much more of a low-margin business, so maybe a positive for profitability longer term now that you're no longer involved in that business? And then maybe just if you can comment on margins in general, how we should think about them longer term? I think you mentioned this year more of a baseline looking like 2019, but given the efficiencies that some of them might be permanent on the real estate side, should we think of maybe slightly higher margins longer term?"

We had purchased ICON in 2000, and it grew rather nicely for the first 10 or 15 years. And then for the last several years, it's actually -- it hasn't declined, but it hasn't grown. 
And you take a large number with no growth, it mutes the growth of the rest of the organization. And the margins were such that we more than make it up for in our pursuit of more profit and EBIT, and we've taken all that into consideration. Took quite a long time to take a decision, but we finally did. 
And the most important aspect, because we can cover the profits, it was a low-margin business, is that we're substantially complete with the exercise that we started 3, 4 years ago of scrutinizing the portfolio and ridding ourselves of legacy companies that weren't going to contribute to our long-term growth. So we're very happy with the decision and [ that's for that ] spend. I'll do a quick thing on margins, and Phil can add to both of my comments. 
With respect to margins, we've said all along that we think 2019 is really the benchmark that we're going to look at and then start to plan some growth from. Last year, you had the disruption of COVID in every single office of Omnicom. You had the restructuring charges we had to take, and you had government subsidies in certain instances, but they certainly didn't cover the cost that we've incurred. We will get efficiencies for certain out of the real estate actions that we took and the agile workforce and hybrid workforce that will be impacted as we come back to work. 
But against that, what you have is you have some inflation in terms of wages. And net of -- and the resurgence of some of the addressable spend that when people weren't permitted to get on the airplanes and visit offices, they will be and hopefully, in the near term. I know I've been able to travel, but principally because of my position, I've been able to go wherever I want. But most people can't do that. So Phil, you might want to add on both parts."

I think as far as margins, certainly, going forward, we think '19 is the right baseline. We do expect, and we did expect that the first half certainly of '20 would be a little easier, given the remote workforce impact on both the addressable spend that John just touched on. And not having as many people back in the office reduces some of the operating costs associated with running those offices when people are back. 
Some of that's going to come back. We're going to welcome a bunch of costs back. When we're in growth mode like we are now, the challenge is going to be continuing to be disciplined about controlling those costs. So I think the goal is certainly to do a bit better than '19, but '19 is really the baseline for the business going forward and then striving to do better than it."

One of the things that gives me some comfort is that when you get past the headlines and you read the people that have been impacted, it's people who haven't been vaccinated.

We're starting to bring back the vaccinated people that we have in earnest after Labor Day. And I think people are encouraged to come back to the office. So yes, there's hesitancy on the part of everyone because we don't know, we can't predict the future. But we do know that we have lived through a hell of a past, and we've done it successfully. So that gives us confidence. 
And the other thing, which will be temporary, I think, is there's going to be certain industries where we're already seeing some concern about the adjustments that have had to be made to certain clients' supply lines and certain components, but they need a delay in receiving them. But we see that as a temporary issue, as do most of our clients, at least ones that I've been speaking to."

And without the burden of a non-growth large entity makes it more achievable than it was the last time I said it. 
Doesn't mean it's going to happen next week, but we do know the quality of our businesses and the quality of our portfolio. We have the benefit of having always protected the creative product, which is our ISP. And whilst we have the technology and all the other systems, we can service a client, like in the case of Philips, as if we're one company Omnicom. Or if a client has individual needs, our brands are more than happy and excellent and excel at taking care of them. So that's all going to benefit that. 
In terms of acquisition pricing, you're absolutely right. There's an insane amount of money chasing things that are out there. We've always looked for people who wanted to be partners on a longer term, and we've always looked to do accretive acquisitions. And when we have been able to find accretive acquisitions, we've borne the expense of taking -- of starting up companies and doing things ourselves. 
I think as we have -- I know, I don't think, as we go forward, there's 1 or 2 areas which I'm not going to tell you -- speak about it on the phone, that I'm probably -- I'd be willing to break even on if I had to pay the price to get the reputation to use as a basis from which spend to grow organically. But none of that at this point is going to result in the increase in our leverage. And our capital program, which I typically have in my script and I didn't bother to mention this time is exactly the same. 
It's first to pay our dividends; second, to do accretive acquisitions; and last but not least, the share buybacks. Again, Phil, you want to?"

And with all the confusion and noise and various medias that you can reach out to, I cannot understate our creativity.

Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining today. We're very pleased to report that in the third quarter, we continued our year-over-year double-digit growth in our key financial performance metrics led by a very robust top line",1400,"Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining today. We're very pleased to report that in the third quarter, we continued our year-over-year double-digit growth in our key financial performance metrics led by a very robust top line.
As you can see on Slide 4 of our presentation, organic growth for the third quarter was 11.5%. The top line results were broad-based across our agencies, geographies and disciplines. Our growth was especially strong in CRM Precision at 24%. Our CRM Precision Group is helping clients on their martech transformation, digital and e-commerce communications and direct-to-consumer marketing. The group has played a key role in many of our recent new business wins where, overall, we continued our very strong momentum in Q3.
Broadly, across our group, growth was driven by improved economic conditions. Omnicom's suite of services and capabilities are positioning us to be extremely competitive in the marketplace to: reimagine and strengthen our clients' brands, seamlessly connect them with their customers across their marketing journey, transform their marketing technology platforms and innovate in e-commerce and new media channels.
Our revenue performance flowed through to our operating profit in bottom line. Our EBIT margins for the third quarter were 15.8%, which exceeded our 2020 margins and significantly outpaced the comparable period in 2019. Net income and EPS for the quarter grew by more than 13% versus 2020 and were also significantly above our 2019 results.
As we head into the fourth quarter, we are well positioned competitively and expect to benefit as economic growth continues to improve globally and from ongoing cost management. We currently expect our full year organic growth to be approximately 9% and our full year EBIT margin to exceed our year-to-date margin for the 9 months ended September 30, 2021 of 15.1%.
Going forward, we remain focused on our key strategic initiatives, which is centered around our talent, dedication to creativity and building on our already strong capabilities in precision marketing and martech consulting, e-commerce, digital and performance media and predictive data-driven insights.
In the third quarter, we made progress across these strategic initiatives as we announced 3 acquisitions. Omnicom Media Group acquired Jump 450 Media, a performance marketing agency. The company leverages algorithmic scaling strategies, rapid creative testing and data analytics to optimize digital media spend and drive customer acquisition. Jump 450 will form the foundation for a dedicated performance media platform and business operation within OMG. Its focus on e-commerce and pure performance marketing will strengthen and add a distinct set of capabilities to OMG's existing performance media offerings.
Also in late September, we announced the acquisition of 2 German-based companies: antoni and OSK. antoni is one of the most innovative and creative agencies in Europe and was born with data and digital capabilities at its core. antoni's creative leadership and depth of talent will significantly strengthen our capabilities in Europe and around the globe.
OSK has been in the top 10 of PR and commerce agencies in Germany since 2008 and is the undisputed #1 for automotive. It provides a broad portfolio of services at the intersection of PR and social media and excels in the convergence of technology, mobility and communications.
Our ability to bring together the brightest talent and data-driven consumer insights from across our organization to deliver holistic and integrated brand experiences is proving to be highly successful in our new business opportunities as well as in servicing our existing clients.
Following on the heels of Philips naming Omnicom their global integrated service partner for creative and media communications, in the third quarter, Mercedes-Benz appointed Omnicom its global marketing communications partner. One of the world's most iconic brands, Mercedes-Benz is today the leading luxury automotive experience company.
TMX, a dedicated team from across our groups, will bring together the best-in-class talent and capabilities across Mercedes-Benz' customer journey with expertise in media and CRM, brand and performance creator, web personalization and content automation, public relations and events as well as paid and organic social.
And just last week, we won the Chanel media business globally, adding another iconic global brand. As in all our significant wins as well as for our existing clients, our teams are able to showcase our creativity, better analysis and predictive insights and technology capabilities to deliver connected, personalized and seamless brand experiences for their respective customers at all touch points of the consumer journey.
One key differentiator for Omnicom in servicing our clients is our cohesive culture that binds us together. It's a culture of creativity, flexibility and caring that our common value shared across our group. I often hear from clients that a deciding factor in the decision to hire Omnicom is that our people who bring distinct specialized skills to them, know and respect one another and genuinely collaborate.
Our ability to integrate services from across our marketing disciplines is underpinned by Omni, our open operating system, that orchestrates better outcomes. Omni is built for collaboration, acting as a conductor between different specialists using a single processing workflow from insights to execution. It empowers our people and our clients to make better and faster decisions, maximizing efficiency and ROI.
Omni also provides better intelligence by orchestrating first-, second- and third-party data sets to present a single comprehensive view of consumers. Our teams can then develop insights to create, plan and deliver the most impactful messages, content and communications to them at each stage of the consumer journey.
Omni is a unique and powerful tool for us, and we now have over 40,000 Omnicom colleagues provisioned on the platform in over 60 countries. Hundreds of our clients, including all of our top 20, utilized Omni. Moreover, the open-source system enables our practice areas like commerce, health and PR to customize Omni with different data sources for their clients.
For example, Omnicom Health Group created a custom offering called Omni Health. Since rolling it out in April of this year, OHG has leveraged the platform to play a key role in expanding the group's omnichannel offering with new and existing clients, including AstraZeneca and Janssen Xarelto, to name a few.
In summary, even during the pandemic, we accelerated the strength of our services, capabilities and organization to deliver better outcomes for our clients and win new business. Our offering is powerful and differentiated. We have best-in-class talent and creativity using best-in-class operating systems and technologies. It's a formula that will continue to win for us.
Before I turn it over to Phil, I want to spend a few moments on our relentless focus on talent. Throughout one of the most difficult times in recent history, our people have shown ingenuity, resilience and strength. We continue to spend and invest in training and development programs for all of our people from basic skills training all the way through the advanced programs of Omnicom University.
We recently expanded the curriculum for our DE&I and OPEN 2.0 strategies. As the pandemic continues to present a substantial health risk, the well-being of our colleagues remains our top priority. We are ensuring we have a safe work environment and are offering a variety of programs for managers and individuals to support their wellness, resilience and health at work.
I recently traveled to several of our U.S. and European offices and have met with many colleagues and clients who are happy to be back in the office. We are looking at many alternatives to provide our people a safe return back to the office. For example, this week, we're testing a private transportation service for New York City-based colleagues. In the months ahead, we look forward to welcoming more of our staff back with a continuing priority on their safety and flexibility.
It is truly our world-class talent and our dedication to creativity and innovative solutions that drive real business outcomes for our clients. A key recent proof point reflecting the quality of our account is Omnicom being named the Most Effective Holding Company in the U.S. by the 2020 Report. Overall, we're extremely pleased with the third quarter I'm proud to see that our strategic focus and the decisions we made throughout the pandemic are now leading to positive results. Our results once again reflect Omnicom's ability to adapt and respond to the changes in the market and deliver through economic cycles.
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financials. Phil?"
96161,1684884736,2407648,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2021",2021-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good afternoon. While the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt across the globe, that impact has continued to moderate significantly as evidenced by our continued growth in the third quarter.Slide 3 shows our third quarter impro",1930,"Thanks, John, and good afternoon. While the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt across the globe, that impact has continued to moderate significantly as evidenced by our continued growth in the third quarter.
Slide 3 shows our third quarter improvement across our income statement, where our revenue growth and expense control drove an 8% increase in operating profit. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24.1%, down from our estimated effective rate for 2021 of between 26.5% and 27%. This was primarily due to the favorable settlement of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions, the impact of which was approximately $10 million. These items positively impacted net income and diluted earnings per share, which was $1.65, up $0.20 or 13.8% versus Q3 of last year and up $0.33 versus the third quarter of 2019. So our growth continues on this important metric as well. And finally, our $0.70 quarterly dividend, which was raised back in February, is 7.7% higher than last year.
Let's now flip to Slide 4 and look at the quarter in more detail, beginning with revenues. Our total revenue growth was 7.1%. Organic growth for the quarter was 11.5% or $367 million, which represents a significant improvement compared to Q3 of 2020 when the pandemic drove an organic revenue decline of 11.7%. The impact of foreign exchange rates increased our revenue by 1.6% in the quarter as the dollar continued to weaken against most of our larger currencies compared to the prior year. If FX rates stay where they were on October 15, we expect foreign exchange to decrease our reported revenue by approximately 1% for the fourth quarter and increase our reported revenue by 2% for the full year.
The impact on revenue from net acquisitions and dispositions decreased revenue by 5.9%. Based on transactions that have been completed through September 30, 2021, our estimate is the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity for the balance of the year will decrease reported revenue by approximately 7% in the fourth quarter and by approximately 4% for the full year.
While we will continue our process of evaluating our portfolio of businesses as part of our strategic planning, as John has said regarding dispositions, we are substantially complete.
If you turn to Slide 5, you can see our organic growth by discipline. Advertising, our largest discipline at 53% of our total revenues, posted 8.6% organic growth with very strong performance from both our creative agencies and our media agencies. Please note that reported Advertising growth is down 0.4% due primarily to the disposition of ICON in Q2 of 2021.
Our agencies focused on direct, digital and marketing transformation consulting services in our Precision Marketing discipline also posted strong organic growth of 24.3%. With the exception of the second quarter of 2020, this discipline has been a consistent grower for some time and has become a larger portion of our business each quarter.
CRM Commerce and Brand Consulting was up 18%, with our branding agencies leading the discipline's performance. CRM Experiential was up 50%. This business declined far more than our other disciplines in the third quarter of last year during the pandemic and has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels due to various global restrictions. However, this remains an important area for our clients, and we look forward to further growth as global economies continue lifting social distancing restrictions.
CRM Execution & Support was up 8.3%, reflecting a recovery in client spend compared to the prior year in our field marketing businesses, while our research businesses continued to lag. PR was up 10.5%. We have a positive outlook for the discipline, especially within our global agencies, as clients adjust to the new post pandemic realities. And finally, our Healthcare discipline was up 6.6% organically. Healthcare was the only one of our service disciplines that had positive organic growth during the depths of the pandemic and continue to perform well.
Flipping to Slide 6, our revenue by region. Key takeaway is that all of our geographies again posted solid organic growth. This growth was driven by virtually every discipline within each region. Outside the U.S., our total organic growth was 16%. Double-digit growth in each region was led by Germany, the U.K., Canada and Australia. Our advertising, media and PR agencies performed well with double-digit growth, and our precision marketing agencies were sizable contributors and also posted strong double-digit growth. In addition, Experiential growth outside the U.S. was over 100% in total.
In the U.S., we generated 7.7% organic growth, which was boosted by strong double-digit growth in our Precision Marketing and PR disciplines as well as solid growth at our health care agencies. Our Advertising and Experiential disciplines also grew in the U.S. but at a slower rate than the growth outside the U.S.
The last revenue view I'd like to share with you is by industry sector on Slide 7. The change in mix by sector in the portfolio was small on a year-to-date basis when compared to last year. In summary, our revenue performance was very strong across the board on both a reported and organic basis and when analyzed by discipline, geography or industry sector.
Let's now turn to Slide 8 and look at our operating expenses. To make the analysis more relevant, we have also included a supplemental slide in the appendix that shows the 2021 amounts presented in constant dollars.
Beginning with our largest category, salary and service costs. These costs increased by 7.6% in total, and they tend to fluctuate with the change in revenue. We would also note that Q3 2020 salary and service cost amounts were reduced by reimbursements received from government programs of $68.7 million. As we continue to look forward, we expect a healthy advertising and marketing spending outlook, and strong demand from our clients will necessitate an increase in staffing. The tight labor market will create challenges in the near term that we are confident our management teams will overcome.
Moving down the P&L. Third-party service costs, which fluctuate with changes in revenue, decreased 6.9% during the quarter due to our net disposition activity, primarily related to the disposition of ICON and partially offset by the organic growth in revenue as well as the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Occupancy and other costs, which are not directly linked to changes in revenue, were up 4.5% year-on-year or 2.9% when excluding foreign exchange rate translation impacts. As expected, these good results continue to reflect our efforts to reduce infrastructure costs and also benefited from a decrease in general office expenses as the majority of our staff continue to work remotely in Q3.
SG&A expense levels were up 5.3% on a year-over-year basis or 4.2% when excluding foreign exchange rate translation impacts. We are beginning to see a return of travel and certain other addressable spend costs as pandemic-related government restrictions ease. However, based on our use of technology during the pandemic, we're developing practices, particularly with respect to travel, that we expect will allow us to continue to retain some of the benefits we achieved in reducing addressable spend during the pandemic. Overall, we expect that the increase in addressable spend for the balance of the year will be mitigated in part by the benefits we will continue to achieve from a hybrid and agile workforce.
As we think about our future expense levels, we certainly expect that some areas will increase in line with our business as activity picks up and life returns to normal. But at the same time, we will also continue to evaluate ways to improve efficiently throughout the organization by continuing to focus on real estate portfolio management, back-office services, procurement and IT services. With the strong revenue growth we discussed earlier, coupled with good expense control, you can see a notable improvement in our operating profit on a year-over-year basis at the bottom of the slide, up 8% for the quarter and 60.1% year-to-date.
Growing our operating profit dollars remains one of our most important areas of focus. This strong growth in operating profit was also accompanied by improved margins, which you can see on Slide 9. For the third quarter, our operating profit margin was 15.8% as expressed in terms of our reported total revenues. We continue to see operating margin improvement year-over-year, resulting from the proactive management of our discretionary addressable spend cost categories, including a reduction in travel and related costs, reductions in certain costs of operating our offices given the continued remote work environment as well as benefits from some of the repositioning actions taken back in the second quarter of 2020.
Lastly, on this slide, our reported EBITDA for the quarter was $560.3 million, up 7.4% for the quarter and 56.3% year-to-date. EBITDA margins also remained strong for the quarter and have expanded nicely year-to-date compared to last year, and we expect this strong performance to continue through the rest of this year.
Let's now turn to our cash flow performance on Slide 10, where you can see that in the first 9 months of 2021, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow excluding changes in working capital, a $114 million or 10% increase versus the same period last year. There were no material year-over-year changes for CapEx or acquisitions as we continue to conservatively manage our cash.
While stock repurchases are down relative to pre-pandemic periods due to curtailment during the pandemic, we resumed our activity during the second and third quarters of this year, and we expect to continue in Q4 and beyond. You should not expect a change in our historical approach to capital allocation and the use of our free cash flow in the future. We will continue to pay an attractive dividend. We have indicated that we increased our focus on acquisition opportunities and are in the process of closing on several acquisitions. Importantly, our acquisition strategy is focusing on the faster-growing disciplines in our portfolio and driving future organic growth for the company. And we will use the balance of our free cash flow to repurchase our stock.
Our strong cash generation again enhanced our credit and liquidity, which you can see summarized on Slide 11. Our total debt was down about $500 million since this time last year as we eliminated the extra liquidity we added early on in the pandemic. We did this through the early retirement in Q2 of $1.25 billion of our 3.65% senior notes, which were due next year, partially replaced with the issuance of $800 million of 2.6% 10-year notes due in 2031.
As you can see in the slide, our maturities are well laddered with nothing due until late 2024 as we delevered to pre-pandemic levels. As for our debt ratios, due to our overall operating improvement versus Q3 of 2020 and our recent refinancing activity, we've reduced our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 0.4x.
I'll end our prepared remarks today on Slide 12, where you can see for the 12 months ending September 30, 2021, we generated a strong return on invested capital of 26.4% and a return on equity of 47%. Both metrics increased substantially over the 2020 levels. While these are just 2 points in time, it's important to remember our long-term track record of providing solid returns to shareholders through business execution and the resulting consistent allocation of capital to dividends, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases.
And that concludes our prepared remarks today. Operator, please open the lines up for questions and answers. Thank you."

There are still some areas to come that clients would like to deploy money to, especially when it comes to live events and execution type of activities. We saw that start up again very robustly in China in the beginning of the third quarter, slowdown in China as China continues to have some problems. But wherever it's possible, you can see that we're coming back. And companies like the insurance companies or some of our government accounts would like to get back out on the road and visit with people constantly. So there's more to come, I think.
Having said that, our underlying growth areas have been -- as I said in the call, CRM Advertising and media, they've been strong, and they're more than compensated for the not-yet-returned segments where people will, in fact, spend money as we move forward, as more people get back to a regular schedule. And I think it's been 20 months since most people have shut down. And it's -- without any severe disease setbacks, I think we'll increasingly see more and more people back in offices and -- because they're already going to sporting events and dinner and enjoying themselves. So more to come, and I'm pretty bullish about the future."

We just don't know if there'll be those year-end situations where they can deploy more dollars.

I think as we look out into the future, we don't expect that our margins are going to deteriorate from that. It's too early to forecast '22, but we're optimistic that we'll be able to maintain those levels. There's an awful lot of unknown at the moment with COVID and returning to travel. We have benefited from a reduction in travel expenses and some of the other addressable spend costs that our agencies have done a great job managing. We do expect to maintain some of that permanently.
But as we grow, costs are going to come back. And the challenge for us is going to be to maintain them relative to a growing cost base. And we're confident that our performance through 9 months will be sustainable, and our expectations for this year will be similar from a margin perspective going forward."

We're going to continue, as we said, more aggressively to pursue acquisition opportunities in those higher-growth areas, and we expect to continue to be successful on that front.
We did start to get back in the market a little bit in the second quarter, more in the third quarter of this year, in terms of buying back shares and using our free cash flow for buying back shares. That will continue in Q4. We don't set and won't set an acquisition bogey for 2022 in terms of a dollar amount or a percentage of free cash flow. And if there are more attractive deals available, we're going to pursue them. And if we overspend or underspend our free cash flow, we're going to do it for the right reasons. And our share buyback approach won't change in that broader context either."

Most of the conversations that I've been having with our clients have been multifaceted. I mean they're generally very optimistic that as people return to the workplace and start to spend money and start to get out of the house that we'll see more and more spending in growth, at least in the near term. It's probably tempered by the supply that some of our clients can come through with in terms of the goods that are held up in port or they know will come -- they'll be able to market, but they're not certain that they'll have them in their parking lots or stores to sell today.
That's their issue for the most part. We've spent a great deal of time looking at this and talking to people about it to find out what the impact is from those issues on the current level of spending that we're seeing.

And last year, we started to truly search for and support using our acquisition dollars some of the areas that we have decided will be large contributors to growth going forward. And so our portfolio has changed, I guess, over the last several years. And we've been very deliberate during the pandemic to not take our foot off of the accelerator.

Communication was certainly critical and continues to be critical with all the constituencies that make up our businesses. So our employees, the people have managed our individual agencies, our clients, staying close to them throughout the pandemic was certainly made possible by the technology investments we had made over the last several years and were able to do so without a hitch. So technology played a large role.
I think we've learned that there's an awful lot that we can do as a business and our people can do to service their clients using that technology to do things that we never thought were possible before. That's going to enable us going forward to look at the business a little differently and our infrastructure a little bit differently so that we can continue to get the most out of those technology investments going forward.
We also think from a people perspective, mentoring our people, especially our younger colleagues, it works best when people are together. Creativity works best when people are together. There's an awful lot we can do remotely, no question. We proved that out. But over time, we're a culture that works best when we're together. Certainly, the pandemic proved that we need to be flexible in that approach, and it may differ market by market or business by business. But I think we are a culture of collaboration. And while we can utilize technology to take advantage of a number of opportunities, we do work best and look forward to our people coming together to collaborate again in person.
And certainly, the acceleration of digital and e-commerce broadly in the marketplace and each of our clients pursuing their own strategies, our agencies have done a great job in helping them deal with all the changes that come with that. And certainly, our Precision Marketing Group has done extremely well in that area, helping its clients on a number of initiatives that they're pursuing in digital and e-commerce.

As Phil said, we also spend -- as part of that culture, very dedicated. I mean you never cut back a penny on this on what we dedicate to training and the development of our younger staff. So that challenge is ever present.
Now we, like everybody else, are faced with some nuance and some different challenges during this period. But we're also -- as we face some salary increases for certain things, we're a very highly incentive compensation-type model. So in terms of what we pay out in total comp, we're well within our capability of dealing with any challenges that we've seen thus far and can anticipate in terms of the inflation in salary costs. So environment and culture becomes terribly important.
The other thing when looking at groups like ours which can't be overlooked is that our clients in their marketing departments are facing more severe challenges of losing talent and requiring our assistance in certain areas that maybe in more comfortable times they wouldn't have been as keen to buy or as wanting to be first in the queue to make sure that we can reserve those people to service their needs.

But to date, the feedback we've gotten in our discussions with clients, it really hasn't been a negative or positive in having any kind of a meaningful impact at this point on their spending plans near term. So we haven't seen and don't expect significant reductions in consumer spending in the near term. And ultimately, I don't think there's a definitive answer that anyone has at this point in time. We're just going to have to see how it plays out.
And then regarding the precision marketing space, we've done a few deals of some business transformation consulting firms and also some martech consulting firms that have been quite successful. And we've built out Cidara, the initial acquisition we did several years ago. It has some global offices now and more offices in the U.S. than it had before, extremely successful. And we expect that, that success will continue. And certainly, those are areas within precision marketing that we're looking for opportunities and we expect to find some additional opportunities. There's some other strategic areas within what could be viewed as a relatively broad category, but we haven't finalized any of those transactions, and we're not sure whether we'll be successful or note.

We're very pleased to report that in the third quarter, we continued our year-over-year double-digit growth in our key financial performance metrics led by a very robust top line. 
As you can see on Slide 4 of our presentation, organic growth for the third quarter was 11.5%. The top line results were broad-based across our agencies, geographies and disciplines. Our growth was especially strong in CRM Precision at 24%. Our CRM Precision Group is helping clients on their MarTech transformation, digital and e-commerce communications and direct-to-consumer marketing. The group has played a key role in many of our recent new business wins where, overall, we continued our very strong momentum in Q3. 
Broadly, across our group, growth was driven by improved economic conditions. Omnicom's suite of services and capabilities are positioning us to be extremely competitive in the marketplace to: reimagine and strengthen our clients' brands, seamlessly connect them with their customers across their marketing journey, transform their marketing technology platforms and innovate in e-commerce and new media channels. 
Our revenue performance flowed through to our operating profit in bottom line. Our EBIT margins for the third quarter were 15.8%, which exceeded our 2020 margins and significantly outpaced the comparable period in 2019. Net income and EPS for the quarter grew by more than 13% versus 2020 and were also significantly above our 2019 results. 
As we head into the fourth quarter, we are well positioned competitively and expect to benefit as economic growth continues to improve globally and from ongoing cost management. We currently expect our full year organic growth to be approximately 9% and our full year EBIT margin to exceed our year-to-date margin for the 9 months ended September 30, 2021 of 15.1%. 
Going forward, we remain focused on our key strategic initiatives, which is centered around our talent, dedication to creativity and building on our already strong capabilities in precision marketing and MarTech consulting, e-commerce, digital and performance media and predictive data-driven insights. 
In the third quarter, we made progress across these strategic initiatives as we announced 3 acquisitions. Omnicom Media Group acquired Jump 450 Media, a performance marketing agency. The company leverages algorithmic scaling strategies, rapid creative testing and data analytics to optimize digital media spend and drive customer acquisition. Jump 450 will form the foundation for a dedicated performance media platform and business operation within OMG. Its focus on e-commerce and pure performance marketing will strengthen and add a distinct set of capabilities to OMG's existing performance media offerings. 
Also in late September, we announced the acquisition of 2 German-based companies: antoni and OSK. antoni is one of the most innovative and creative agencies in Europe and was born with data and digital capabilities at its core. antoni's creative leadership and depth of talent will significantly strengthen our capabilities in Europe and around the globe. 
OSK has been in the top 10 of PR and comms agencies in Germany since 2008 and is the undisputed #1 for automotive. It provides a broad portfolio of services at the intersection of PR and social media and excels in the convergence of technology, mobility and communications. 
Our ability to bring together the brightest talent and data-driven consumer insights from across our organization to deliver holistic and integrated brand experiences is proving to be highly successful in our new business opportunities as well as in servicing our existing clients. 
Following on the heels of Philips naming Omnicom their global integrated service partner for creative and media communications, in the third quarter, Mercedes-Benz appointed Omnicom its global marketing communications partner. One of the world's most iconic brands, Mercedes-Benz is today the leading luxury automotive experience company. 
TMX, a dedicated team from across our groups, will bring together the best-in-class talent and capabilities across Mercedes-Benz' customer journey with expertise in media and CRM, brand and performance creator, web personalization and content automation, public relations and events as well as paid and organic social. 
And just last week, we won the Chanel media business globally, adding another iconic global brand. As in all our significant wins as well as for our existing clients, our teams are able to showcase our creativity, better analysis and predictive insights and technology capabilities to deliver connected, personalized and seamless brand experiences for their respective customers at all touch points of the consumer journey. 
One key differentiator for Omnicom in servicing our clients is our cohesive culture that binds us together. It's a culture of creativity, flexibility and caring that our common value shared across our group. I often hear from clients that a deciding factor in their decision to hire Omnicom is that our people who bring distinct specialized skills to them, know and respect one another and genuinely collaborate. 
Our ability to integrate services from across our marketing disciplines is underpinned by Omni, our open operating system, that orchestrates better outcomes. Omni is built for collaboration, acting as a conductor between different specialists using a single processing workflow from insights to execution. It empowers our people and our clients to make better and faster decisions, maximizing efficiency and ROI. 
Omni also provides better intelligence by orchestrating first-, second- and third-party data sets to present a single comprehensive view of consumers. Our teams can then develop insights to create, plan and deliver the most impactful messages, content and communications to them at each stage of that consumer journey. 
Omni is a unique and powerful tool for us, and we now have over 40,000 Omnicom colleagues provisioned on the platform in over 60 countries. Hundreds of our clients, including all of our top 20, utilized Omni. Moreover, the open-source system enables our practice areas like commerce, health and PR to customize Omni with different data sources for their clients. 
For example, Omnicom Health Group created a custom offering called Omni Health. Since rolling it out in April of this year, OHG has leveraged the platform to play a key role in expanding the group's omnichannel offering with new and existing clients, including AstraZeneca and Janssen, XARELTO, to name a few. 
In summary, even during the pandemic, we accelerated the strength of our services, capabilities and organization to deliver better outcomes for our clients and win new business. Our offering is powerful and differentiated. We have best-in-class talent and creativity using best-in-class operating systems and technologies. It's a formula that will continue to win for us. 
Before I turn it over to Phil, I want to spend a few moments on our relentless focus on talent. Throughout one of the most difficult times in recent history, our people have shown ingenuity, resilience and strength. We continue to spend and invest in training and development programs for all of our people from basic skills training all the way through the advanced programs of Omnicom University. We recently expanded the curriculum for our DE&I and OPEN 2.0 strategies. As the pandemic continues to present a substantial health risk, the well-being of our colleagues remains our top priority. We are ensuring we have a safe work environment and are offering a variety of programs for managers and individuals to support their wellness, resilience and health at work. 
I recently traveled to several of our U.S. and European offices and have met with many colleagues and clients who are happy to be back in the office. We are looking at many alternatives to provide our people a safe return back to the office. For example, this week, we're testing a private transportation service for New York City-based colleagues. In the months ahead, we look forward to welcoming more of our staff back with a continuing priority on their safety and flexibility. 
It is truly our world-class talent and our dedication to creativity and innovative solutions that drive real business outcomes for our clients. A key recent proof point reflecting the quality of our talent is Omnicom being named the Most Effective Holding Company in the U.S. by the 2020 [indiscernible] report. Overall, we're extremely pleased with the third quarter. I'm proud to see that our strategic focus and the decisions we made throughout the pandemic are now leading to positive results. Our results once again reflect Omnicom's ability to adapt and respond to the changes in the market and deliver through economic cycles. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financials. Phil?"
96161,1684884736,2407681,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2021",2021-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good afternoon. While the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt across the globe, that impact has continued to moderate significantly as evidenced by our continued growth in the third quarter. Slide 3 shows our third quarter impr",1931,"Thanks, John, and good afternoon. While the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt across the globe, that impact has continued to moderate significantly as evidenced by our continued growth in the third quarter. 
Slide 3 shows our third quarter improvement across our income statement, where our revenue growth and expense control drove an 8% increase in operating profit. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24.1%, down from our estimated effective rate for 2021 of between 26.5% and 27%. This was primarily due to the favorable settlement of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions, the impact of which was approximately $10 million. These items positively impacted net income and diluted earnings per share, which was $1.65, up $0.20 or 13.8% versus Q3 of last year and up $0.33 versus the third quarter of 2019. So our growth continues on this important metric as well. And finally, our $0.70 quarterly dividend, which was raised back in February, is 7.7% higher than last year. 
Let's now flip to Slide 4 and look at the quarter in more detail, beginning with revenues. Our total revenue growth was 7.1%. Organic growth for the quarter was 11.5% or $367 million, which represents a significant improvement compared to Q3 of 2020 when the pandemic drove an organic revenue decline of 11.7%. The impact of foreign exchange rates increased our revenue by 1.6% in the quarter as the dollar continued to weaken against most of our larger currencies compared to the prior year. If FX rates stay where they were on October 15, we expect foreign exchange to decrease our reported revenue by approximately 1% for the fourth quarter and increase our reported revenue by 2% for the full year. 
The impact on revenue from net acquisitions and dispositions decreased revenue by 5.9%. Based on transactions that have been completed through September 30, 2021, our estimate is the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity for the balance of the year will decrease reported revenue by approximately 7% in the fourth quarter and by approximately 4% for the full year. While we will continue our process of evaluating our portfolio of businesses as part of our strategic planning, as John has said regarding dispositions, we are substantially complete. 
If you turn to Slide 5, you can see our organic growth by discipline. Advertising, our largest discipline at 53% of our total revenues, posted 8.6% organic growth with very strong performance from both our creative agencies and our media agencies. Please note that reported Advertising growth is down 0.4% due primarily to the disposition of ICON in Q2 of 2021. 
Our agencies focused on direct, digital and marketing transformation consulting services in our precision marketing discipline also posted strong organic growth at 24.3%. With the exception of the second quarter of 2020, this discipline has been a consistent grower for some time and has become a larger portion of our business each quarter. 
CRM Commerce and Brand Consulting was up 18%, with our branding agencies leading the discipline's performance. CRM Experiential was up 50%. This business declined far more than our other disciplines in the third quarter of last year during the pandemic and has not yet recovered to prepandemic levels due to various global restrictions. However, this remains an important area for our clients, and we look forward to further growth as global economies continue lifting social distancing restrictions. 
CRM Execution & Support was up 8.3%, reflecting a recovery in client spend compared to the prior year in our field marketing businesses, while our research businesses continued to lag. PR was up 10.5%. We have a positive outlook for the discipline, especially within our global agencies, as clients adjust to the new post pandemic realities. And finally, our Healthcare discipline was up 6.6% organically. Healthcare was the only one of our service disciplines that had positive organic growth during the depths of the pandemic and continue to perform well. 
Flipping to Slide 6, our revenue by region. The key takeaway is that all of our geographies again posted solid organic growth. This growth was driven by virtually every discipline within each region. Outside the U.S., where total organic growth was 16%. Double-digit growth in each region was led by Germany, the U.K., Canada and Australia. Our advertising, media and PR agencies performed well with double-digit growth, and our precision marketing agencies were sizable contributors and also posted strong double-digit growth. In addition, experiential growth outside the U.S. was over 100% in total. 
In the U.S., we generated 7.7% organic growth, which was boosted by strong double-digit growth in our precision marketing and PR disciplines as well as solid growth at our health care agencies. Our advertising and experiential disciplines also grew in the U.S. but at a slower rate than the growth outside the U.S. 
The last revenue view I'd like to share with you is by industry sector on Slide 7. The change in mix by sector in the portfolio was small on a year-to-date basis when compared to last year. In summary, our revenue performance was very strong across the board on both a reported and organic basis and when analyzed by discipline, geography or industry sector. 
Let's now turn to Slide 8 and look at our operating expenses. To make the analysis more relevant, we have also included a supplemental slide in the appendix that shows the 2021 amounts presented in constant dollars. 
Beginning with our largest category, salary and service costs. These costs increased by 7.6% in total, and they tend to fluctuate with the change in revenue. We would also note that Q3 2020 salary and service cost amounts were reduced by reimbursements received from government programs of $68.7 million. As we continue to look forward, we expect a healthy advertising and marketing spending outlook, and strong demand from our clients will necessitate an increase in staffing. The tight labor market will create challenges in the near term that we are confident our management teams will overcome. 
Moving down the P&L. Third-party service costs, which fluctuate with changes in revenue, decreased 6.9% during the quarter due to our net disposition activity, primarily related to the disposition of ICON and partially offset by the organic growth in revenue as well as the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Occupancy and other costs, which are not directly linked to changes in revenue, were up 4.5% year-on-year or 2.9% when excluding foreign exchange rate translation impacts. As expected, these good results continue to reflect our efforts to reduce infrastructure costs and also benefited from a decrease in general office expenses as the majority of our staff continue to work remotely in Q3. 
SG&A expense levels were up 5.3% on a year-over-year basis or 4.2% when excluding foreign exchange rate translation impacts. We are beginning to see a return of travel and certain other addressable spend costs as pandemic-related government restrictions ease. However, based on our use of technology during the pandemic, we're developing practices, particularly with respect to travel, that we expect will allow us to continue to retain some of the benefits we achieved in reducing addressable spend during the pandemic. 
Overall, we expect that the increase in addressable spend for the balance of the year will be mitigated in part by the benefits we will continue to achieve from a hybrid and agile workforce. 
As we think about our future expense levels, we certainly expect that some areas will increase in line with our business as activity picks up and life returns to normal. But at the same time, we will also continue to evaluate ways to improve efficiently throughout the organization by continuing to focus on real estate portfolio management, back-office services, procurement and IT services. With the strong revenue growth we discussed earlier, coupled with good expense control, you can see a notable improvement in our operating profit on a year-over-year basis at the bottom of the slide, up 8% for the quarter and 60.1% year-to-date. 
Growing our operating profit dollars remains one of our most important areas of focus. This strong growth in operating profit was also accompanied by improved margins, which you can see on Slide 9. For the third quarter, our operating profit margin was 15.8% as expressed in terms of our reported total revenues. We continue to see operating margin improvement year-over-year, resulting from the proactive management of our discretionary addressable spend cost categories, including a reduction in travel and related costs, reductions in certain costs of operating our offices given the continued remote work environment as well as benefits from some of the repositioning actions taken back in the second quarter of 2020. 
Lastly, on this slide, our reported EBITDA for the quarter was $560.3 million, up 7.4% for the quarter and 56.3% year-to-date. EBITDA margins also remained strong for the quarter and have expanded nicely year-to-date compared to last year, and we expect this strong performance to continue through the rest of this year. 
Let's now turn to our cash flow performance on Slide 10, where you can see that in the first 9 months of 2021, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow excluding changes in working capital, a $114 million or 10% increase versus the same period last year. There were no material year-over-year changes for CapEx or acquisitions as we continue to conservatively manage our cash. 
While stock repurchases are down relative to prepandemic periods due to curtailment during the pandemic, we resumed our activity during the second and third quarters of this year, and we expect to continue in Q4 and beyond. You should not expect a change in our historical approach to capital allocation and the use of our free cash flow in the future. We will continue to pay an attractive dividend. We have indicated that we increased our focus on acquisition opportunities and are in the process of closing on several acquisitions. Importantly, our acquisition strategy is focusing on the faster-growing disciplines in our portfolio and driving future organic growth for the company. And we will use the balance of our free cash flow to repurchase our stock. 
Our strong cash generation again enhanced our credit and liquidity, which you can see summarized on Slide 11. Our total debt was down about $500 million since this time last year as we eliminated the extra liquidity we added early on in the pandemic. We did this through the early retirement in Q2 of $1.25 billion of our 3.65% senior notes, which were due next year, partially replaced with the issuance of $800 million of 2.6% 10-year notes due in 2031. 
As you can see in the slide, our maturities are well laddered with nothing due until late 2024 as we delevered to prepandemic levels. As for our debt ratios, due to our overall operating improvement versus Q3 of 2020 and our recent refinancing activity, we've reduced our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 0.4x. 
I'll end our prepared remarks today on Slide 12, where you can see for the 12 months ending September 30, 2021, we generated a strong return on invested capital of 26.4% and a return on equity of 47%. Both metrics increased substantially over the 2020 levels. While these are just 2 points in time, it's important to remember our long-term track record of providing solid returns to shareholders through business execution and the resulting consistent allocation of capital to dividends, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks today. Operator, please open the lines up for questions and answers. Thank you."

There are still some areas to come that clients would like to deploy money to, especially when it comes to live events and execution type of activities. We saw that start up again very robustly in China in the beginning of the third quarter, slowdown in China as China continues to have some problems. But wherever it's possible, you can see that we're coming back. And companies like the insurance companies or some of our government accounts would like to get back out on the road and visit with people constantly. So there's more to come, I think.
Having said that, our underlying growth areas have been, as I said in the call, CRM Advertising and media, they've been strong, and they're more than compensated for the not-yet-returned segments where people will, in fact, spend money as we move forward, as more people get back to a regular schedule. And I think it's been 20 months since most people have shut down. And it's -- without any severe disease setbacks, I think we'll increasingly see more and more people back in offices and -- because they're already going to sporting events and dinner and enjoying themselves. So more to come, and I'm pretty bullish about the future."

We just don't know if there'll be those year-end situations where they can deploy more dollars.
So I think it was pretty clear that we believe that -- I think for the first time, I didn't warn about that in all the calls that you listened to. And probably for the first time I told you what we believe organic growth can be for the full year in terms of what we see right now."

I think as we look out into the future, we don't expect that our margins are going to deteriorate from that. It's too early to forecast '22, but we're optimistic that we'll be able to maintain those levels. There's an awful lot of unknown at the moment with COVID and returning to travel. We have benefited from a reduction in travel expenses and some of the other addressable spend costs that our agencies have done a great job managing. We do expect to maintain some of that permanently.
But as we grow, costs are going to come back. And the challenge for us is going to be to maintain them relative to a growing cost base. And we're confident that our performance through 9 months will be sustainable, and our expectations for this year will be similar from a margin perspective going forward."

What is different, and I did mention it in the last call, you're right, was we went from a mode of cleaning up the portfolio to really reactivating our people that are looking for certain acquisitions in the areas that I outlined. And the practice -- in addition to the corporate effort that's going on there, each one of the practice areas that we're focused on for acquisitions is -- has a similar group to the corporate group out scouring the market to find out if we can find partners that we want to do business with going forward."

Certainly, our preference, as we've indicated, is to spend more of our free cash flow on acquisitions that the characteristics that we've typically described and that John touched on. So we're very confident in the areas that we want to grow in and where we're looking for acquisitions, the faster growth areas and businesses that are going to contribute to an acceleration of organic growth in the future.
But I don't think you can -- you should expect anything to change significantly in our approach to capital allocation. We'll continue to look at our free cash flow and pay an attractive dividend. We're going to continue, as we said, more aggressively to pursue acquisition opportunities in those higher-growth areas, and we expect to continue to be successful on that front.
We did start to get back in the market a little bit in the second quarter, more in the third quarter of this year, in terms of buying back shares and using our free cash flow for buying back shares. That will continue in Q4. We don't set and won't set an acquisition bogey for 2022 in terms of a dollar amount or a percentage of free cash flow. And if there are more attractive deals available, we're going to pursue them. And if we overspend or underspend our free cash flow, we're going to do it for the right reasons. And our share buyback approach won't change in that broader context either."

Most of the conversations that I've been having with our clients have been multifaceted. I mean they're generally very optimistic that as people return to the workplace and start to spend money and start to get out of the house that we'll see more and more spending in growth, at least in the near term. It's probably tempered by the supply that some of our clients can come through with in terms of the goods that are held up in port or they know will come -- they'll be able to market, but they're not certain that they'll have them in their parking lots or stores to sell today.
That's their issue for the most part. We've spent a great deal of time looking at this and talking to people about it to find out what the impact is from those issues on the current level of spending that we're seeing.

And last year, we started to truly search for and support using our acquisition dollars some of the areas that we have decided will be large contributors to growth going forward. And so our portfolio has changed, I guess, over the last several years. And we've been very deliberate during the pandemic to not take our foot off of the accelerator. And so I think the portfolio we're left with matches where clients need and they're going to spend their money now and for the foreseeable future.

So our employees, the people that manage our individual agencies, our clients, staying close to them throughout the pandemic, was certainly made possible by the technology investments we had made over the last several years and were able to do so without a hitch. So technology played a large role.
I think we've learned that there's an awful lot that we can do as a business and our people can do to service their clients using that technology to do things that we never thought were possible before. That's going to enable us going forward to look at the business a little differently and our infrastructure a little bit differently so that we can continue to get the most out of those technology investments going forward.
We also think from a people perspective, mentoring our people, especially our younger colleagues, it works best when people are together. Creativity works best when people are together. There's an awful lot we can do remotely, no question. We proved that out. But over time, we're a culture that works best when we're together. Certainly, the pandemic proved that we need to be flexible in that approach, and it may differ market by market or business by business. But I think we are a culture of collaboration. And while we can utilize technology to take advantage of a number of opportunities, we do work best and look forward to our people coming together to collaborate again in person.

As Phil said, we also spend -- as part of that culture, very dedicated. I mean you never cut back a penny on this on what we dedicate to training and the development of our younger staff. So that challenge is ever present.
Now we, like everybody else, are faced with some nuance and some different challenges during this period.

So in terms of what we pay out in total comp, we're well within our capability of dealing with any challenges that we've seen thus far and can anticipate in terms of the inflation in salary costs. So environment and culture becomes terribly important.
The other thing when looking at groups like ours, which can't be overlooked, is that our clients in their marketing departments are facing more severe challenges of losing talent and requiring our assistance in certain areas that maybe in more comfortable times they wouldn't have been as keen to buy or as wanting to be first in the queue to make sure that we can reserve those people to service their needs.

We're just going to have to see how it plays out.
And then regarding the precision marketing space, we've done a few deals of some business transformation consulting firms and also some MarTech consulting firms that have been quite successful. And we've built out Credera, the initial acquisition we did several years ago. It has some global offices now and more offices in the U.S. than it had before, extremely successful. And we expect that, that success will continue. And certainly, those are areas within precision marketing that we're looking for opportunities and we expect to find some additional opportunities. There's some other strategic areas within what could be viewed as a relatively broad category, but we haven't finalized any of those transactions, and we're not sure whether we'll be successful or not.

Before we start, I would like to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial and other information that we have included at the end of our investor presentation. Certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements, and these statements are our present expectations. Relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are listed in our earnings materials and in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10-K and our June 2021 Form 10-Q. Also during the course of today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials. 
We will begin the call with an overview of our business from John, then Phil will review our financial results for the quarter. After our prepared remarks, we will open the line up for your questions."

Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining today. We're very pleased to report that in the third quarter, we continued our year-over-year double-digit growth in our key financial performance metrics led by a very robust top line",1401,"Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining today. We're very pleased to report that in the third quarter, we continued our year-over-year double-digit growth in our key financial performance metrics led by a very robust top line. 
As you can see on Slide 4 of our presentation, organic growth for the third quarter was 11.5%. The top line results were broad-based across our agencies, geographies and disciplines. Our growth was especially strong in CRM Precision at 24%. Our CRM Precision Group is helping clients on their MarTech transformation, digital and e-commerce communications and direct-to-consumer marketing. The group has played a key role in many of our recent new business wins where, overall, we continued our very strong momentum in Q3. 
Broadly, across our group, growth was driven by improved economic conditions. Omnicom's suite of services and capabilities are positioning us to be extremely competitive in the marketplace to: reimagine and strengthen our clients' brands, seamlessly connect them with their customers across their marketing journey, transform their marketing technology platforms and innovate in e-commerce and new media channels. 
Our revenue performance flowed through to our operating profit in bottom line. Our EBIT margins for the third quarter were 15.8%, which exceeded our 2020 margins and significantly outpaced the comparable period in 2019. Net income and EPS for the quarter grew by more than 13% versus 2020 and were also significantly above our 2019 results. 
As we head into the fourth quarter, we are well positioned competitively and expect to benefit as economic growth continues to improve globally and from ongoing cost management. We currently expect our full year organic growth to be approximately 9% and our full year EBIT margin to exceed our year-to-date margin for the 9 months ended September 30, 2021 of 15.1%. 
Going forward, we remain focused on our key strategic initiatives, which is centered around our talent, dedication to creativity and building on our already strong capabilities in precision marketing and MarTech consulting, e-commerce, digital and performance media and predictive data-driven insights. 
In the third quarter, we made progress across these strategic initiatives as we announced 3 acquisitions. Omnicom Media Group acquired Jump 450 Media, a performance marketing agency. The company leverages algorithmic scaling strategies, rapid creative testing and data analytics to optimize digital media spend and drive customer acquisition. Jump 450 will form the foundation for a dedicated performance media platform and business operation within OMG. Its focus on e-commerce and pure performance marketing will strengthen and add a distinct set of capabilities to OMG's existing performance media offerings. 
Also in late September, we announced the acquisition of 2 German-based companies: antoni and OSK. antoni is one of the most innovative and creative agencies in Europe and was born with data and digital capabilities at its core. antoni's creative leadership and depth of talent will significantly strengthen our capabilities in Europe and around the globe. 
OSK has been in the top 10 of PR and comms agencies in Germany since 2008 and is the undisputed #1 for automotive. It provides a broad portfolio of services at the intersection of PR and social media and excels in the convergence of technology, mobility and communications. 
Our ability to bring together the brightest talent and data-driven consumer insights from across our organization to deliver holistic and integrated brand experiences is proving to be highly successful in our new business opportunities as well as in servicing our existing clients. 
Following on the heels of Philips naming Omnicom their global integrated service partner for creative and media communications, in the third quarter, Mercedes-Benz appointed Omnicom its global marketing communications partner. One of the world's most iconic brands, Mercedes-Benz is today the leading luxury automotive experience company. 
TMX, a dedicated team from across our groups, will bring together the best-in-class talent and capabilities across Mercedes-Benz' customer journey with expertise in media and CRM, brand and performance creator, web personalization and content automation, public relations and events as well as paid and organic social. 
And just last week, we won the Chanel media business globally, adding another iconic global brand. As in all our significant wins as well as for our existing clients, our teams are able to showcase our creativity, better analysis and predictive insights and technology capabilities to deliver connected, personalized and seamless brand experiences for their respective customers at all touch points of the consumer journey. 
One key differentiator for Omnicom in servicing our clients is our cohesive culture that binds us together. It's a culture of creativity, flexibility and caring that our common value shared across our group. I often hear from clients that a deciding factor in their decision to hire Omnicom is that our people who bring distinct specialized skills to them, know and respect one another and genuinely collaborate. 
Our ability to integrate services from across our marketing disciplines is underpinned by Omni, our open operating system, that orchestrates better outcomes. Omni is built for collaboration, acting as a conductor between different specialists using a single processing workflow from insights to execution. It empowers our people and our clients to make better and faster decisions, maximizing efficiency and ROI. 
Omni also provides better intelligence by orchestrating first-, second- and third-party data sets to present a single comprehensive view of consumers. Our teams can then develop insights to create, plan and deliver the most impactful messages, content and communications to them at each stage of that consumer journey. 
Omni is a unique and powerful tool for us, and we now have over 40,000 Omnicom colleagues provisioned on the platform in over 60 countries. Hundreds of our clients, including all of our top 20, utilized Omni. Moreover, the open-source system enables our practice areas like commerce, health and PR to customize Omni with different data sources for their clients. 
For example, Omnicom Health Group created a custom offering called Omni Health. Since rolling it out in April of this year, OHG has leveraged the platform to play a key role in expanding the group's omnichannel offering with new and existing clients, including AstraZeneca and Janssen, XARELTO, to name a few. 
In summary, even during the pandemic, we accelerated the strength of our services, capabilities and organization to deliver better outcomes for our clients and win new business. Our offering is powerful and differentiated. We have best-in-class talent and creativity using best-in-class operating systems and technologies. It's a formula that will continue to win for us. 
Before I turn it over to Phil, I want to spend a few moments on our relentless focus on talent. Throughout one of the most difficult times in recent history, our people have shown ingenuity, resilience and strength. We continue to spend and invest in training and development programs for all of our people from basic skills training all the way through the advanced programs of Omnicom University. We recently expanded the curriculum for our DE&I and OPEN 2.0 strategies. As the pandemic continues to present a substantial health risk, the well-being of our colleagues remains our top priority. We are ensuring we have a safe work environment and are offering a variety of programs for managers and individuals to support their wellness, resilience and health at work. 
I recently traveled to several of our U.S. and European offices and have met with many colleagues and clients who are happy to be back in the office. We are looking at many alternatives to provide our people a safe return back to the office. For example, this week, we're testing a private transportation service for New York City-based colleagues. In the months ahead, we look forward to welcoming more of our staff back with a continuing priority on their safety and flexibility. 
It is truly our world-class talent and our dedication to creativity and innovative solutions that drive real business outcomes for our clients. A key recent proof point reflecting the quality of our talent is Omnicom being named the Most Effective Holding Company in the U.S. by the 2020 [indiscernible] report. Overall, we're extremely pleased with the third quarter. I'm proud to see that our strategic focus and the decisions we made throughout the pandemic are now leading to positive results. Our results once again reflect Omnicom's ability to adapt and respond to the changes in the market and deliver through economic cycles. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financials. Phil?"
96161,1684884736,2407684,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2021",2021-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good afternoon. While the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt across the globe, that impact has continued to moderate significantly as evidenced by our continued growth in the third quarter. Slide 3 shows our third quarter impr",1931,"Thanks, John, and good afternoon. While the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt across the globe, that impact has continued to moderate significantly as evidenced by our continued growth in the third quarter. 
Slide 3 shows our third quarter improvement across our income statement, where our revenue growth and expense control drove an 8% increase in operating profit. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24.1%, down from our estimated effective rate for 2021 of between 26.5% and 27%. This was primarily due to the favorable settlement of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions, the impact of which was approximately $10 million. These items positively impacted net income and diluted earnings per share, which was $1.65, up $0.20 or 13.8% versus Q3 of last year and up $0.33 versus the third quarter of 2019. So our growth continues on this important metric as well. And finally, our $0.70 quarterly dividend, which was raised back in February, is 7.7% higher than last year. 
Let's now flip to Slide 4 and look at the quarter in more detail, beginning with revenues. Our total revenue growth was 7.1%. Organic growth for the quarter was 11.5% or $367 million, which represents a significant improvement compared to Q3 of 2020 when the pandemic drove an organic revenue decline of 11.7%. The impact of foreign exchange rates increased our revenue by 1.6% in the quarter as the dollar continued to weaken against most of our larger currencies compared to the prior year. If FX rates stay where they were on October 15, we expect foreign exchange to decrease our reported revenue by approximately 1% for the fourth quarter and increase our reported revenue by 2% for the full year. 
The impact on revenue from net acquisitions and dispositions decreased revenue by 5.9%. Based on transactions that have been completed through September 30, 2021, our estimate is the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity for the balance of the year will decrease reported revenue by approximately 7% in the fourth quarter and by approximately 4% for the full year. While we will continue our process of evaluating our portfolio of businesses as part of our strategic planning, as John has said regarding dispositions, we are substantially complete. 
If you turn to Slide 5, you can see our organic growth by discipline. Advertising, our largest discipline at 53% of our total revenues, posted 8.6% organic growth with very strong performance from both our creative agencies and our media agencies. Please note that reported Advertising growth is down 0.4% due primarily to the disposition of ICON in Q2 of 2021. 
Our agencies focused on direct, digital and marketing transformation consulting services in our precision marketing discipline also posted strong organic growth at 24.3%. With the exception of the second quarter of 2020, this discipline has been a consistent grower for some time and has become a larger portion of our business each quarter. 
CRM Commerce and Brand Consulting was up 18%, with our branding agencies leading the discipline's performance. CRM Experiential was up 50%. This business declined far more than our other disciplines in the third quarter of last year during the pandemic and has not yet recovered to prepandemic levels due to various global restrictions. However, this remains an important area for our clients, and we look forward to further growth as global economies continue lifting social distancing restrictions. 
CRM Execution & Support was up 8.3%, reflecting a recovery in client spend compared to the prior year in our field marketing businesses, while our research businesses continued to lag. PR was up 10.5%. We have a positive outlook for the discipline, especially within our global agencies, as clients adjust to the new post pandemic realities. And finally, our Healthcare discipline was up 6.6% organically. Healthcare was the only one of our service disciplines that had positive organic growth during the depths of the pandemic and continue to perform well. 
Flipping to Slide 6, our revenue by region. The key takeaway is that all of our geographies again posted solid organic growth. This growth was driven by virtually every discipline within each region. Outside the U.S., where total organic growth was 16%. Double-digit growth in each region was led by Germany, the U.K., Canada and Australia. Our advertising, media and PR agencies performed well with double-digit growth, and our precision marketing agencies were sizable contributors and also posted strong double-digit growth. In addition, experiential growth outside the U.S. was over 100% in total. 
In the U.S., we generated 7.7% organic growth, which was boosted by strong double-digit growth in our precision marketing and PR disciplines as well as solid growth at our health care agencies. Our advertising and experiential disciplines also grew in the U.S. but at a slower rate than the growth outside the U.S. 
The last revenue view I'd like to share with you is by industry sector on Slide 7. The change in mix by sector in the portfolio was small on a year-to-date basis when compared to last year. In summary, our revenue performance was very strong across the board on both a reported and organic basis and when analyzed by discipline, geography or industry sector. 
Let's now turn to Slide 8 and look at our operating expenses. To make the analysis more relevant, we have also included a supplemental slide in the appendix that shows the 2021 amounts presented in constant dollars. 
Beginning with our largest category, salary and service costs. These costs increased by 7.6% in total, and they tend to fluctuate with the change in revenue. We would also note that Q3 2020 salary and service cost amounts were reduced by reimbursements received from government programs of $68.7 million. As we continue to look forward, we expect a healthy advertising and marketing spending outlook, and strong demand from our clients will necessitate an increase in staffing. The tight labor market will create challenges in the near term that we are confident our management teams will overcome. 
Moving down the P&L. Third-party service costs, which fluctuate with changes in revenue, decreased 6.9% during the quarter due to our net disposition activity, primarily related to the disposition of ICON and partially offset by the organic growth in revenue as well as the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Occupancy and other costs, which are not directly linked to changes in revenue, were up 4.5% year-on-year or 2.9% when excluding foreign exchange rate translation impacts. As expected, these good results continue to reflect our efforts to reduce infrastructure costs and also benefited from a decrease in general office expenses as the majority of our staff continue to work remotely in Q3. 
SG&A expense levels were up 5.3% on a year-over-year basis or 4.2% when excluding foreign exchange rate translation impacts. We are beginning to see a return of travel and certain other addressable spend costs as pandemic-related government restrictions ease. However, based on our use of technology during the pandemic, we're developing practices, particularly with respect to travel, that we expect will allow us to continue to retain some of the benefits we achieved in reducing addressable spend during the pandemic. 
Overall, we expect that the increase in addressable spend for the balance of the year will be mitigated in part by the benefits we will continue to achieve from a hybrid and agile workforce. 
As we think about our future expense levels, we certainly expect that some areas will increase in line with our business as activity picks up and life returns to normal. But at the same time, we will also continue to evaluate ways to improve efficiently throughout the organization by continuing to focus on real estate portfolio management, back-office services, procurement and IT services. With the strong revenue growth we discussed earlier, coupled with good expense control, you can see a notable improvement in our operating profit on a year-over-year basis at the bottom of the slide, up 8% for the quarter and 60.1% year-to-date. 
Growing our operating profit dollars remains one of our most important areas of focus. This strong growth in operating profit was also accompanied by improved margins, which you can see on Slide 9. For the third quarter, our operating profit margin was 15.8% as expressed in terms of our reported total revenues. We continue to see operating margin improvement year-over-year, resulting from the proactive management of our discretionary addressable spend cost categories, including a reduction in travel and related costs, reductions in certain costs of operating our offices given the continued remote work environment as well as benefits from some of the repositioning actions taken back in the second quarter of 2020. 
Lastly, on this slide, our reported EBITDA for the quarter was $560.3 million, up 7.4% for the quarter and 56.3% year-to-date. EBITDA margins also remained strong for the quarter and have expanded nicely year-to-date compared to last year, and we expect this strong performance to continue through the rest of this year. 
Let's now turn to our cash flow performance on Slide 10, where you can see that in the first 9 months of 2021, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow excluding changes in working capital, a $114 million or 10% increase versus the same period last year. There were no material year-over-year changes for CapEx or acquisitions as we continue to conservatively manage our cash. 
While stock repurchases are down relative to prepandemic periods due to curtailment during the pandemic, we resumed our activity during the second and third quarters of this year, and we expect to continue in Q4 and beyond. You should not expect a change in our historical approach to capital allocation and the use of our free cash flow in the future. We will continue to pay an attractive dividend. We have indicated that we increased our focus on acquisition opportunities and are in the process of closing on several acquisitions. Importantly, our acquisition strategy is focusing on the faster-growing disciplines in our portfolio and driving future organic growth for the company. And we will use the balance of our free cash flow to repurchase our stock. 
Our strong cash generation again enhanced our credit and liquidity, which you can see summarized on Slide 11. Our total debt was down about $500 million since this time last year as we eliminated the extra liquidity we added early on in the pandemic. We did this through the early retirement in Q2 of $1.25 billion of our 3.65% senior notes, which were due next year, partially replaced with the issuance of $800 million of 2.6% 10-year notes due in 2031. 
As you can see in the slide, our maturities are well laddered with nothing due until late 2024 as we delevered to prepandemic levels. As for our debt ratios, due to our overall operating improvement versus Q3 of 2020 and our recent refinancing activity, we've reduced our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 0.4x. 
I'll end our prepared remarks today on Slide 12, where you can see for the 12 months ending September 30, 2021, we generated a strong return on invested capital of 26.4% and a return on equity of 47%. Both metrics increased substantially over the 2020 levels. While these are just 2 points in time, it's important to remember our long-term track record of providing solid returns to shareholders through business execution and the resulting consistent allocation of capital to dividends, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks today. Operator, please open the lines up for questions and answers. Thank you."

And any thoughts, staying on that vein, of how we should think about the project-based business at the end of the year? I know you don't usually have a lot of insight just early on, but if you have any thoughts on that, I'd appreciate it."

There are still some areas to come that clients would like to deploy money to, especially when it comes to live events and execution type of activities. We saw that start up again very robustly in China in the beginning of the third quarter, slowdown in China as China continues to have some problems. But wherever it's possible, you can see that we're coming back. And companies like the insurance companies or some of our government accounts would like to get back out on the road and visit with people constantly. So there's more to come, I think.
Having said that, our underlying growth areas have been, as I said in the call, CRM Advertising and media, they've been strong, and they're more than compensated for the not-yet-returned segments where people will, in fact, spend money as we move forward, as more people get back to a regular schedule. And I think it's been 20 months since most people have shut down. And it's -- without any severe disease setbacks, I think we'll increasingly see more and more people back in offices and -- because they're already going to sporting events and dinner and enjoying themselves. So more to come, and I'm pretty bullish about the future."

They have gotten a bit more severe, but not outrageously more severe. And we know that clients will continue to spend at the level they're currently spending at. We just don't know if there'll be those year-end situations where they can deploy more dollars.
So I think it was pretty clear that we believe that -- I think for the first time, I didn't warn about that in all the calls that you listened to. And probably for the first time I told you what we believe organic growth can be for the full year in terms of what we see right now."

Just you have more of a normalized cost structure, but maybe not 100% back to the way it was pre-COVID. And of course, you have some of the benefit of the divestiture in the restructuring.

I think as we look out into the future, we don't expect that our margins are going to deteriorate from that. It's too early to forecast '22, but we're optimistic that we'll be able to maintain those levels. There's an awful lot of unknown at the moment with COVID and returning to travel. We have benefited from a reduction in travel expenses and some of the other addressable spend costs that our agencies have done a great job managing. We do expect to maintain some of that permanently.
But as we grow, costs are going to come back. And the challenge for us is going to be to maintain them relative to a growing cost base. And we're confident that our performance through 9 months will be sustainable, and our expectations for this year will be similar from a margin perspective going forward."

But I'm just wondering if you think -- if you would like to do larger deals if you can find them and they make sense financially, particularly in areas like precision marketing or if that's just a business where you're generally either building organically and/or buying kind of tuck-ins?
And Phil, the same kind of question on the buyback. I mean you guys bought back -- you picked up the pace this quarter. But your balance sheet is in great shape. You don't have any charities anytime soon. Money's pretty cheap. Business is growing. Just curious if you guys think that the balance sheet should be a more offensive weapon, for lack of a better phrase, than what we've seen recently."

The size of the opportunity really has never gotten in our way, one way or the other, in terms of our ability or affordability for what we believe is a strategic and an accretive transaction. What is different, and I did mention it in the last call, you're right, was we went from a mode of cleaning up the portfolio to really reactivating our people that are looking for certain acquisitions in the areas that I outlined. And the practice -- in addition to the corporate effort that's going on there, each one of the practice areas that we're focused on for acquisitions is -- has a similar group to the corporate group out scouring the market to find out if we can find partners that we want to do business with going forward."

Certainly, our preference, as we've indicated, is to spend more of our free cash flow on acquisitions that the characteristics that we've typically described and that John touched on. So we're very confident in the areas that we want to grow in and where we're looking for acquisitions, the faster growth areas and businesses that are going to contribute to an acceleration of organic growth in the future.
But I don't think you can -- you should expect anything to change significantly in our approach to capital allocation. We'll continue to look at our free cash flow and pay an attractive dividend. We're going to continue, as we said, more aggressively to pursue acquisition opportunities in those higher-growth areas, and we expect to continue to be successful on that front.
We did start to get back in the market a little bit in the second quarter, more in the third quarter of this year, in terms of buying back shares and using our free cash flow for buying back shares. That will continue in Q4. We don't set and won't set an acquisition bogey for 2022 in terms of a dollar amount or a percentage of free cash flow. And if there are more attractive deals available, we're going to pursue them. And if we overspend or underspend our free cash flow, we're going to do it for the right reasons. And our share buyback approach won't change in that broader context either."

Most of the conversations that I've been having with our clients have been multifaceted. I mean they're generally very optimistic that as people return to the workplace and start to spend money and start to get out of the house that we'll see more and more spending in growth, at least in the near term. It's probably tempered by the supply that some of our clients can come through with in terms of the goods that are held up in port or they know will come -- they'll be able to market, but they're not certain that they'll have them in their parking lots or stores to sell today.
That's their issue for the most part. We've spent a great deal of time looking at this and talking to people about it to find out what the impact is from those issues on the current level of spending that we're seeing.

And last year, we started to truly search for and support using our acquisition dollars some of the areas that we have decided will be large contributors to growth going forward. And so our portfolio has changed, I guess, over the last several years. And we've been very deliberate during the pandemic to not take our foot off of the accelerator.

So technology played a large role.
I think we've learned that there's an awful lot that we can do as a business and our people can do to service their clients using that technology to do things that we never thought were possible before. That's going to enable us going forward to look at the business a little differently and our infrastructure a little bit differently so that we can continue to get the most out of those technology investments going forward.
We also think from a people perspective, mentoring our people, especially our younger colleagues, it works best when people are together. Creativity works best when people are together. There's an awful lot we can do remotely, no question. We proved that out. But over time, we're a culture that works best when we're together.

Now we, like everybody else, are faced with some nuance and some different challenges during this period.

So environment and culture becomes terribly important.
The other thing when looking at groups like ours, which can't be overlooked, is that our clients in their marketing departments are facing more severe challenges of losing talent and requiring our assistance in certain areas that maybe in more comfortable times they wouldn't have been as keen to buy or as wanting to be first in the queue to make sure that we can reserve those people to service their needs.

And we've built out Credera, the initial acquisition we did several years ago. It has some global offices now and more offices in the U.S. than it had before, extremely successful. And we expect that, that success will continue. And certainly, those are areas within precision marketing that we're looking for opportunities and we expect to find some additional opportunities. There's some other strategic areas within what could be viewed as a relatively broad category, but we haven't finalized any of those transactions, and we're not sure whether we'll be successful or not.

Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining today. We're very pleased to report that in the third quarter we continued our year-over-year double-digit growth in our key financial performance metrics led by a very robust top line.",1402,"Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining today. We're very pleased to report that in the third quarter we continued our year-over-year double-digit growth in our key financial performance metrics led by a very robust top line. 
As you can see on Slide 4 of our presentation, organic growth for the third quarter was 11.5%. The top line results were broad-based across our agencies, geographies and disciplines. Our growth was especially strong in CRM Precision at 24%. Our CRM Precision Group is helping clients on their MarTech transformation, digital and e-commerce communications and direct-to-consumer marketing. The group has played a key role in many of our recent new business wins where, overall, we continued our very strong momentum in Q3. 
Broadly, across our group, growth was driven by improved economic conditions. Omnicom's suite of services and capabilities are positioning us to be extremely competitive in the marketplace to: reimagine and strengthen our clients' brands, seamlessly connect them with their customers across their marketing journey, transform their marketing technology platforms and innovate in e-commerce and new media channels. 
Our revenue performance flowed through to our operating profit in bottom line. Our EBIT margins for the third quarter were 15.8%, which exceeded our 2020 margins and significantly outpaced the comparable period in 2019. Net income and EPS for the quarter grew by more than 13% versus 2020 and were also significantly above our 2019 results. 
As we head into the fourth quarter, we are well positioned competitively and expect to benefit as economic growth continues to improve globally and from ongoing cost management. We currently expect our full year organic growth to be approximately 9% and our full year EBIT margin to exceed our year-to-date margin for the 9 months ended September 30, 2021 of 15.1%. 
Going forward, we remain focused on our key strategic initiatives, which is centered around our talent, dedication to creativity and building on our already strong capabilities in precision marketing and MarTech consulting, e-commerce, digital and performance media and predictive data-driven insights. 
In the third quarter, we made progress across these strategic initiatives as we announced 3 acquisitions. Omnicom Media Group acquired Jump 450 Media, a performance marketing agency. The company leverages algorithmic scaling strategies, rapid creative testing and data analytics to optimize digital media spend and drive customer acquisition. Jump 450 will form the foundation for a dedicated performance media platform and business operation within OMG. Its focus on e-commerce and pure performance marketing will strengthen and add a distinct set of capabilities to OMG's existing performance media offerings. 
Also in late September, we announced the acquisition of 2 German-based companies: antoni and OSK. Antoni is one of the most innovative and creative agencies in Europe and was born with data and digital capabilities at its core. Antoni's creative leadership and depth of talent will significantly strengthen our capabilities in Europe and around the globe. 
OSK has been in the top 10 of PR and comms agencies in Germany since 2008 and is the undisputed #1 for automotive. It provides a broad portfolio of services at the intersection of PR and social media and excels in the convergence of technology, mobility and communications. 
Our ability to bring together the brightest talent and data-driven consumer insights from across our organization to deliver holistic and integrated brand experiences is proving to be highly successful in our new business opportunities as well as in servicing our existing clients. 
Following on the heels of Philips naming Omnicom their global integrated service partner for creative and media communications, in the third quarter Mercedes-Benz appointed Omnicom its global marketing communications partner. One of the world's most iconic brands, Mercedes-Benz is today the leading luxury automotive experience company. 
Team X, a dedicated team from across our groups, will bring together the best-in-class talent and capabilities across Mercedes-Benz customer journey with expertise in media and CRM, brand and performance creator, web personalization and content automation, public relations and events as well as paid and organic social. 
And just last week, we won the Chanel media business globally, adding another iconic global brand. As in all our significant wins as well as for our existing clients, our teams are able to showcase our creativity, better analysis and predictive insights and technology capabilities to deliver connected, personalized and seamless brand experiences for their respective customers at all touch points of the consumer journey. 
One key differentiator for Omnicom in servicing our clients is our cohesive culture that binds us together. It's a culture of creativity, flexibility and caring that our common value shared across our group. I often hear from clients that a deciding factor in their decision to hire Omnicom is that our people, who bring distinct specialized skills to them, know and respect one another and genuinely collaborate. 
Our ability to integrate services from across our marketing disciplines is underpinned by Omni, our open operating system, that orchestrates better outcomes. Omni is built for collaboration, acting as a conductor between different specialists using a single processing workflow from insights to execution. It empowers our people and our clients to make better and faster decisions, maximizing efficiency and ROI. 
Omni also provides better intelligence by orchestrating first-, second- and third-party data sets to present a single comprehensive view of consumers. Our teams can then develop insights to create, plan and deliver the most impactful messages, content and communications to them at each stage of that consumer journey. 
Omni is a unique and powerful tool for us, and we now have over 40,000 Omnicom colleagues provisioned on the platform in over 60 countries. Hundreds of our clients, including all of our top 20, utilize Omni. Moreover, the open-source system enables our practice areas like commerce, health and PR to customize Omni with different data sources for their clients. 
For example, Omnicom Health Group created a custom offering called Omni Health. Since rolling it out in April of this year, OHG has leveraged the platform to play a key role in expanding the group's omnichannel offering with new and existing clients, including AstraZeneca and Janssen, XARELTO, to name a few. 
In summary, even during the pandemic, we accelerated the strength of our services, capabilities and organization to deliver better outcomes for our clients and win new business. Our offering is powerful and differentiated. We have best-in-class talent and creativity using best-in-class operating systems and technologies. It's a formula that will continue to win for us. 
Before I turn it over to Phil, I want to spend a few moments on our relentless focus on talent. Throughout one of the most difficult times in recent history, our people have shown ingenuity, resilience and strength. We continue to spend and invest in training and development programs for all of our people from basic skills training all the way through the advanced programs of Omnicom University. We recently expanded the curriculum for our DE&I and OPEN 2.0 strategies. As the pandemic continues to present a substantial health risk, the well-being of our colleagues remains our top priority. We are ensuring we have a safe work environment and are offering a variety of programs for managers and individuals to support their wellness, resilience and health at work. 
I recently traveled to several of our U.S. and European offices and have met with many colleagues and clients who are happy to be back in the office. We are looking at many alternatives to provide our people a safe return back to the office. For example, this week, we're testing a private transportation service for New York City based colleagues. In the months ahead, we look forward to welcoming more of our staff back with a continuing priority on their safety and flexibility. 
It is truly our world-class talent and our dedication to creativity and innovative solutions that drive real business outcomes for our clients. A key recent proof point reflecting the quality of our talent is Omnicom being named the Most Effective Holding Company in the U.S. by the [indiscernible] report. Overall, we're extremely pleased with the third quarter. I'm proud to see that our strategic focus and the decisions we made throughout the pandemic are now leading to positive results. Our results once again reflect Omnicom's ability to adapt and respond to the changes in the market and deliver through economic cycles. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financials. Phil?"
96161,1684884736,2415395,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2021",2021-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good afternoon. While the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt across the globe, that impact has continued to moderate significantly, as evidenced by our continued growth in the third quarter. Slide 3 shows our third quarter imp",1930,"Thanks, John, and good afternoon. While the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt across the globe, that impact has continued to moderate significantly, as evidenced by our continued growth in the third quarter. 
Slide 3 shows our third quarter improvement across our income statement, where our revenue growth and expense control drove an 8% increase in operating profit. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24.1%, down from our estimated effective rate for 2021 of between 26.5% and 27%. This was primarily due to the favorable settlement of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions, the impact of which was approximately $10 million. These items positively impacted net income and diluted earnings per share, which was $1.65, up $0.20 or 13.8% versus Q3 of last year and up $0.33 versus the third quarter of 2019. So our growth continues on this important metric as well. And finally, our $0.70 quarterly dividend, which was raised back in February, is 7.7% higher than last year. 
Let's now flip to Slide 4 and look at the quarter in more detail, beginning with revenues. Our total revenue growth was 7.1%. Organic growth for the quarter was 11.5% or $367 million, which represents a significant improvement compared to Q3 of 2020 when the pandemic drove an organic revenue decline of 11.7%. The impact of foreign exchange rates increased our revenue by 1.6% in the quarter as the dollar continued to weaken against most of our larger currencies compared to the prior year. If FX rates stay where they were on October 15, we expect foreign exchange to decrease our reported revenue by approximately 1% for the fourth quarter and increase our reported revenue by 2% for the full year. 
The impact on revenue from net acquisitions and dispositions decreased revenue by 5.9%. Based on transactions that have been completed through September 30, 2021, our estimate is the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity for the balance of the year will decrease reported revenue by approximately 7% in the fourth quarter and by approximately 4% for the full year. While we will continue our process of evaluating our portfolio of businesses as part of our strategic planning, as John has said regarding dispositions, we are substantially complete. 
If you turn to Slide 5, you can see our organic growth by discipline. Advertising, our largest discipline, at 53% of our total revenues, posted 8.6% organic growth with very strong performance from both our creative agencies and our media agencies. Please note that reported Advertising growth is down 0.4% due primarily to the disposition of ICON in Q2 of 2021. 
Our agencies focused on direct, digital and marketing transformation consulting services in our Precision marketing discipline also posted strong organic growth at 24.3%. With the exception of the second quarter of 2020, this discipline has been a consistent grower for some time and has become a larger portion of our business each quarter. 
CRM Commerce and Brand Consulting was up 18%, with our branding agencies leading the discipline's performance. CRM Experiential was up 50%. This business declined far more than our other disciplines in the third quarter of last year during the pandemic and has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels due to various global restrictions. However, this remains an important area for our clients, and we look forward to further growth as global economies continue lifting social distancing restrictions. 
CRM Execution & Support was up 8.3%, reflecting a recovery in client spend compared to the prior year in our field marketing businesses, while our research businesses continued to lag. PR was up 10.5%. We have a positive outlook for the discipline, especially within our global agencies, as clients adjust to the new post pandemic realities. And finally, our Healthcare discipline was up 6.6% organically. Healthcare was the only one of our service disciplines that had positive organic growth during the depths of the pandemic and continue to perform well. 
Flipping to Slide 6, our revenue by region. The key takeaway is that all of our geographies again posted solid organic growth. This growth was driven by virtually every discipline within each region. Outside the U.S., where total organic growth was 16%, double-digit growth in each region was led by Germany, the U.K., Canada and Australia. Our Advertising, Media and PR agencies performed well with double-digit growth, and our Precision marketing agencies were sizable contributors and also posted strong double-digit growth. In addition, Experiential growth outside the U.S. was over 100% in total. 
In the U.S., we generated 7.7% organic growth, which was boosted by strong double-digit growth in our Precision marketing and PR disciplines as well as solid growth at our Healthcare agencies. Our Advertising and Experiential disciplines also grew in the U.S. but at a slower rate than the growth outside the U.S. 
The last revenue view I'd like to share with you is by industry sector on Slide 7. The change in mix by sector in the portfolio was small on a year-to-date basis when compared to last year. In summary, our revenue performance was very strong across the board on both a reported and organic basis and when analyzed by discipline, geography or industry sector. 
Let's now turn to Slide 8 and look at our operating expenses. To make the analysis more relevant, we have also included a supplemental slide in the appendix that shows the 2021 amounts presented in constant dollars. 
Beginning with our largest category, salary and service costs. These costs increased by 7.6% in total, and they tend to fluctuate with the change in revenue. We would also note that Q3 2020 salary and service cost amounts were reduced by reimbursements received from government programs of $68.7 million. As we continue to look forward, we expect a healthy advertising and marketing spending outlook, and strong demand from our clients will necessitate an increase in staffing. The tight labor market will create challenges in the near term that we are confident our management teams will overcome. 
Moving down the P&L. Third-party service costs, which fluctuate with changes in revenue, decreased 6.9% during the quarter due to our net disposition activity, primarily related to the disposition of ICON and partially offset by the organic growth in revenue as well as the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Occupancy and other costs, which are not directly linked to changes in revenue, were up 4.5% year-on-year or 2.9% when excluding foreign exchange rate translation impacts. As expected, these good results continue to reflect our efforts to reduce infrastructure costs and also benefited from a decrease in general office expenses as the majority of our staff continue to work remotely in Q3. 
SG&A expense levels were up 5.3% on a year-over-year basis or 4.2% when excluding foreign exchange rate translation impacts. We are beginning to see a return of travel and certain other addressable spend costs as pandemic-related government restrictions ease. However, based on our use of technology during the pandemic, we're developing practices, particularly with respect to travel, that we expect will allow us to continue to retain some of the benefits we achieved in reducing addressable spend during the pandemic. 
Overall, we expect that the increase in addressable spend for the balance of the year will be mitigated in part by the benefits we will continue to achieve from a hybrid and agile workforce. 
As we think about our future expense levels, we certainly expect that some areas will increase in line with our business as activity picks up and life returns to normal. But at the same time, we will also continue to evaluate ways to improve efficiently throughout the organization by continuing to focus on real estate portfolio management, back-office services, procurement and IT services. With the strong revenue growth we discussed earlier, coupled with good expense control, you can see a notable improvement in our operating profit on a year-over-year basis at the bottom of the slide, up 8% for the quarter and 60.1% year-to-date. 
Growing our operating profit dollars remains one of our most important areas of focus. This strong growth in operating profit was also accompanied by improved margins, which you can see on Slide 9. For the third quarter, our operating profit margin was 15.8% as expressed in terms of our reported total revenues. We continue to see operating margin improvement year-over-year, resulting from the proactive management of our discretionary addressable spend cost categories, including a reduction in travel and related costs, reductions in certain costs of operating our offices given the continued remote work environment as well as benefits from some of the repositioning actions taken back in the second quarter of 2020. 
Lastly, on this slide, our reported EBITDA for the quarter was $560.3 million, up 7.4% for the quarter and 56.3% year-to-date. EBITDA margins also remained strong for the quarter and have expanded nicely year-to-date compared to last year, and we expect this strong performance to continue through the rest of this year. 
Let's now turn to our cash flow performance on Slide 10, where you can see that in the first 9 months of 2021 we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow excluding changes in working capital, a $114 million or 10% increase versus the same period last year. There were no material year-over-year changes for CapEx or acquisitions as we continue to conservatively manage our cash. 
While stock repurchases are down relative to pre-pandemic periods due to curtailment during the pandemic, we resumed our activity during the second and third quarters of this year, and we expect to continue in Q4 and beyond. You should not expect a change in our historical approach to capital allocation and the use of our free cash flow in the future. We will continue to pay an attractive dividend. We have indicated that we increased our focus on acquisition opportunities and are in the process of closing on several acquisitions. Importantly, our acquisition strategy is focusing on the faster-growing disciplines in our portfolio and driving future organic growth for the company. And we will use the balance of our free cash flow to repurchase our stock. 
Our strong cash generation again enhanced our credit and liquidity, which you can see summarized on Slide 11. Our total debt was down about $500 million since this time last year as we eliminated the extra liquidity we added early on in the pandemic. We did this through the early retirement in Q2 of $1.25 billion of our 3.65% senior notes, which were due next year, partially replaced with the issuance of $800 million of 2.6% 10-year notes due in 2031. 
As you can see in the slide, our maturities are well laddered with nothing due until late 2024 as we delevered to pre-pandemic levels. As for our debt ratios, due to our overall operating improvement versus Q3 of 2020 and our recent refinancing activity, we've reduced our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 0.4x. 
I'll end our prepared remarks today on Slide 12, where you can see for the 12 months ending September 30, 2021, we generated a strong return on invested capital of 26.4% and a return on equity of 47%. Both metrics increased substantially over the 2020 levels. While these are just 2 points in time, it's important to remember our long-term track record of providing solid returns to shareholders through business execution and the resulting consistent allocation of capital to dividends, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks today. Operator, please open the lines up for questions and answers. Thank you."

There are still some areas to come that clients would like to deploy money to, especially when it comes to live events and execution type of activities. We saw that start up again very robustly in China in the beginning of the third quarter, slowdown in China as China continues to have some problems. But wherever it's possible, you can see that we're coming back. And companies like the insurance companies or some of our government accounts would like to get back out on the road and visit with people constantly. So there's more to come, I think.
Having said that, our underlying growth areas have been, as I said in the call, CRM Advertising and Media, they've been strong, and they're more than compensated for the not-yet-returned segments where people will, in fact, spend money as we move forward, as more people get back to a regular schedule. And I think it's been 20 months since most people have shut down. And it's -- without any severe disease setbacks, I think we'll increasingly see more and more people back in offices and -- because they're already going to sporting events and dinner and enjoying themselves. So more to come, and I'm pretty bullish about the future."

We just don't know if there'll be those year-end situations where they can deploy more dollars.

I think as we look out into the future we don't expect that our margins are going to deteriorate from that. It's too early to forecast '22, but we're optimistic that we'll be able to maintain those levels. There's an awful lot of unknown at the moment with COVID and returning to travel. We have benefited from a reduction in travel expenses and some of the other addressable spend costs that our agencies have done a great job managing. We do expect to maintain some of that permanently.
But as we grow, costs are going to come back. And the challenge for us is going to be to maintain them relative to a growing cost base. And we're confident that our performance through 9 months will be sustainable, and our expectations for this year will be similar from a margin perspective going forward."

But the growth outside the U.S., which is more, say, large event driven as opposed to the U.S. business having some component of consultative part of the business, grew less rapidly. It grew great. Its performance was really, really good. But the U.S. business grew at a less rapid rate than the international business. And we're happy with the performance of both. And then in the U.S., as you said before, ICON, the disposition is largely a U.S.-based business."

And Phil, the same kind of question on the buyback. I mean you guys bought back -- you picked up the pace this quarter. But your balance sheet is in great shape. You don't have any maturities anytime soon. Money's pretty cheap. Business is growing.

The size of the opportunity really has never gotten in our way, one way or the other, in terms of our ability or affordability for what we believe is a strategic and an accretive transaction. What is different, and I did mention it in the last call, you're right, was we went from a mode of cleaning up the portfolio to really reactivating our people that are looking for certain acquisitions in the areas that I outlined. And the practice -- in addition to the corporate effort that's going on there, each one of the practice areas that we're focused on for acquisitions is -- has a similar group to the corporate group out scouring the market to find out if we can find partners that we want to do business with going forward."

Certainly, our preference, as we've indicated, is to spend more of our free cash flow on acquisitions that meet the characteristics that we've typically described and that John touched on. So we're very confident in the areas that we want to grow in and where we're looking for acquisitions, the faster growth areas and businesses that are going to contribute to an acceleration of organic growth in the future.
But I don't think you can -- you should expect anything to change significantly in our approach to capital allocation. We'll continue to look at our free cash flow and pay an attractive dividend. We're going to continue, as we said, more aggressively to pursue acquisition opportunities in those higher-growth areas, and we expect to continue to be successful on that front.
We did start to get back in the market a little bit in the second quarter, more in the third quarter of this year, in terms of buying back shares and using our free cash flow for buying back shares. That will continue in Q4. We don't set and won't set an acquisition bogey for 2022 in terms of a dollar amount or a percentage of free cash flow. And if there are more attractive deals available, we're going to pursue them. And if we overspend or underspend our free cash flow, we're going to do it for the right reasons. And our share buyback approach won't change in that broader context either."

So environment and culture becomes terribly important.
The other thing when looking at groups like ours, which can't be overlooked, is that our clients in their marketing departments are facing more severe challenges of losing talent and requiring our assistance in certain areas that maybe in more comfortable times they wouldn't have been as keen to buy or as wanting to be first in the queue to make sure that we can reserve those people to service their needs.

Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining today. We're very pleased to report that in the third quarter we continued our year-over-year double-digit growth in our key financial performance metrics led by a very robust top line.",1402,"Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining today. We're very pleased to report that in the third quarter we continued our year-over-year double-digit growth in our key financial performance metrics led by a very robust top line. 
As you can see on Slide 4 of our presentation, organic growth for the third quarter was 11.5%. The top line results were broad-based across our agencies, geographies and disciplines. Our growth was especially strong in CRM Precision at 24%. Our CRM Precision Group is helping clients on their MarTech transformation, digital and e-commerce communications and direct-to-consumer marketing. The group has played a key role in many of our recent new business wins where, overall, we continued our very strong momentum in Q3. 
Broadly, across our group, growth was driven by improved economic conditions. Omnicom's suite of services and capabilities are positioning us to be extremely competitive in the marketplace to: reimagine and strengthen our clients' brands, seamlessly connect them with their customers across their marketing journey, transform their marketing technology platforms and innovate in e-commerce and new media channels. 
Our revenue performance flowed through to our operating profit in bottom line. Our EBIT margins for the third quarter were 15.8%, which exceeded our 2020 margins and significantly outpaced the comparable period in 2019. Net income and EPS for the quarter grew by more than 13% versus 2020 and were also significantly above our 2019 results. 
As we head into the fourth quarter, we are well positioned competitively and expect to benefit as economic growth continues to improve globally and from ongoing cost management. We currently expect our full year organic growth to be approximately 9% and our full year EBIT margin to exceed our year-to-date margin for the 9 months ended September 30, 2021 of 15.1%. 
Going forward, we remain focused on our key strategic initiatives, which is centered around our talent, dedication to creativity and building on our already strong capabilities in precision marketing and MarTech consulting, e-commerce, digital and performance media and predictive data-driven insights. 
In the third quarter, we made progress across these strategic initiatives as we announced 3 acquisitions. Omnicom Media Group acquired Jump 450 Media, a performance marketing agency. The company leverages algorithmic scaling strategies, rapid creative testing and data analytics to optimize digital media spend and drive customer acquisition. Jump 450 will form the foundation for a dedicated performance media platform and business operation within OMG. Its focus on e-commerce and pure performance marketing will strengthen and add a distinct set of capabilities to OMG's existing performance media offerings. 
Also in late September, we announced the acquisition of 2 German-based companies: antoni and OSK. Antoni is one of the most innovative and creative agencies in Europe and was born with data and digital capabilities at its core. Antoni's creative leadership and depth of talent will significantly strengthen our capabilities in Europe and around the globe. 
OSK has been in the top 10 of PR and comms agencies in Germany since 2008 and is the undisputed #1 for automotive. It provides a broad portfolio of services at the intersection of PR and social media and excels in the convergence of technology, mobility and communications. 
Our ability to bring together the brightest talent and data-driven consumer insights from across our organization to deliver holistic and integrated brand experiences is proving to be highly successful in our new business opportunities as well as in servicing our existing clients. 
Following on the heels of Philips naming Omnicom their global integrated service partner for creative and media communications, in the third quarter Mercedes-Benz appointed Omnicom its global marketing communications partner. One of the world's most iconic brands, Mercedes-Benz is today the leading luxury automotive experience company. 
Team X, a dedicated team from across our groups, will bring together the best-in-class talent and capabilities across Mercedes-Benz customer journey with expertise in media and CRM, brand and performance creator, web personalization and content automation, public relations and events as well as paid and organic social. 
And just last week, we won the Chanel media business globally, adding another iconic global brand. As in all our significant wins as well as for our existing clients, our teams are able to showcase our creativity, better analysis and predictive insights and technology capabilities to deliver connected, personalized and seamless brand experiences for their respective customers at all touch points of the consumer journey. 
One key differentiator for Omnicom in servicing our clients is our cohesive culture that binds us together. It's a culture of creativity, flexibility and caring that our common value shared across our group. I often hear from clients that a deciding factor in their decision to hire Omnicom is that our people, who bring distinct specialized skills to them, know and respect one another and genuinely collaborate. 
Our ability to integrate services from across our marketing disciplines is underpinned by Omni, our open operating system, that orchestrates better outcomes. Omni is built for collaboration, acting as a conductor between different specialists using a single processing workflow from insights to execution. It empowers our people and our clients to make better and faster decisions, maximizing efficiency and ROI. 
Omni also provides better intelligence by orchestrating first-, second- and third-party data sets to present a single comprehensive view of consumers. Our teams can then develop insights to create, plan and deliver the most impactful messages, content and communications to them at each stage of that consumer journey. 
Omni is a unique and powerful tool for us, and we now have over 40,000 Omnicom colleagues provisioned on the platform in over 60 countries. Hundreds of our clients, including all of our top 20, utilize Omni. Moreover, the open-source system enables our practice areas like commerce, health and PR to customize Omni with different data sources for their clients. 
For example, Omnicom Health Group created a custom offering called Omni Health. Since rolling it out in April of this year, OHG has leveraged the platform to play a key role in expanding the group's omnichannel offering with new and existing clients, including AstraZeneca and Janssen, XARELTO, to name a few. 
In summary, even during the pandemic, we accelerated the strength of our services, capabilities and organization to deliver better outcomes for our clients and win new business. Our offering is powerful and differentiated. We have best-in-class talent and creativity using best-in-class operating systems and technologies. It's a formula that will continue to win for us. 
Before I turn it over to Phil, I want to spend a few moments on our relentless focus on talent. Throughout one of the most difficult times in recent history, our people have shown ingenuity, resilience and strength. We continue to spend and invest in training and development programs for all of our people from basic skills training all the way through the advanced programs of Omnicom University. We recently expanded the curriculum for our DE&I and OPEN 2.0 strategies. As the pandemic continues to present a substantial health risk, the well-being of our colleagues remains our top priority. We are ensuring we have a safe work environment and are offering a variety of programs for managers and individuals to support their wellness, resilience and health at work. 
I recently traveled to several of our U.S. and European offices and have met with many colleagues and clients who are happy to be back in the office. We are looking at many alternatives to provide our people a safe return back to the office. For example, this week, we're testing a private transportation service for New York City based colleagues. In the months ahead, we look forward to welcoming more of our staff back with a continuing priority on their safety and flexibility. 
It is truly our world-class talent and our dedication to creativity and innovative solutions that drive real business outcomes for our clients. A key recent proof point reflecting the quality of our talent is Omnicom being named the Most Effective Holding Company in the U.S. by the [indiscernible] report. Overall, we're extremely pleased with the third quarter. I'm proud to see that our strategic focus and the decisions we made throughout the pandemic are now leading to positive results. Our results once again reflect Omnicom's ability to adapt and respond to the changes in the market and deliver through economic cycles. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financials. Phil?"
96161,1684884736,2415400,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2021",2021-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good afternoon. While the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt across the globe, that impact has continued to moderate significantly, as evidenced by our continued growth in the third quarter. Slide 3 shows our third quarter imp",1930,"Thanks, John, and good afternoon. While the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt across the globe, that impact has continued to moderate significantly, as evidenced by our continued growth in the third quarter. 
Slide 3 shows our third quarter improvement across our income statement, where our revenue growth and expense control drove an 8% increase in operating profit. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24.1%, down from our estimated effective rate for 2021 of between 26.5% and 27%. This was primarily due to the favorable settlement of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions, the impact of which was approximately $10 million. These items positively impacted net income and diluted earnings per share, which was $1.65, up $0.20 or 13.8% versus Q3 of last year and up $0.33 versus the third quarter of 2019. So our growth continues on this important metric as well. And finally, our $0.70 quarterly dividend, which was raised back in February, is 7.7% higher than last year. 
Let's now flip to Slide 4 and look at the quarter in more detail, beginning with revenues. Our total revenue growth was 7.1%. Organic growth for the quarter was 11.5% or $367 million, which represents a significant improvement compared to Q3 of 2020 when the pandemic drove an organic revenue decline of 11.7%. The impact of foreign exchange rates increased our revenue by 1.6% in the quarter as the dollar continued to weaken against most of our larger currencies compared to the prior year. If FX rates stay where they were on October 15, we expect foreign exchange to decrease our reported revenue by approximately 1% for the fourth quarter and increase our reported revenue by 2% for the full year. 
The impact on revenue from net acquisitions and dispositions decreased revenue by 5.9%. Based on transactions that have been completed through September 30, 2021, our estimate is the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity for the balance of the year will decrease reported revenue by approximately 7% in the fourth quarter and by approximately 4% for the full year. While we will continue our process of evaluating our portfolio of businesses as part of our strategic planning, as John has said regarding dispositions, we are substantially complete. 
If you turn to Slide 5, you can see our organic growth by discipline. Advertising, our largest discipline, at 53% of our total revenues, posted 8.6% organic growth with very strong performance from both our creative agencies and our media agencies. Please note that reported Advertising growth is down 0.4% due primarily to the disposition of ICON in Q2 of 2021. 
Our agencies focused on direct, digital and marketing transformation consulting services in our Precision marketing discipline also posted strong organic growth at 24.3%. With the exception of the second quarter of 2020, this discipline has been a consistent grower for some time and has become a larger portion of our business each quarter. 
CRM Commerce and Brand Consulting was up 18%, with our branding agencies leading the discipline's performance. CRM Experiential was up 50%. This business declined far more than our other disciplines in the third quarter of last year during the pandemic and has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels due to various global restrictions. However, this remains an important area for our clients, and we look forward to further growth as global economies continue lifting social distancing restrictions. 
CRM Execution & Support was up 8.3%, reflecting a recovery in client spend compared to the prior year in our field marketing businesses, while our research businesses continued to lag. PR was up 10.5%. We have a positive outlook for the discipline, especially within our global agencies, as clients adjust to the new post pandemic realities. And finally, our Healthcare discipline was up 6.6% organically. Healthcare was the only one of our service disciplines that had positive organic growth during the depths of the pandemic and continue to perform well. 
Flipping to Slide 6, our revenue by region. The key takeaway is that all of our geographies again posted solid organic growth. This growth was driven by virtually every discipline within each region. Outside the U.S., where total organic growth was 16%, double-digit growth in each region was led by Germany, the U.K., Canada and Australia. Our Advertising, Media and PR agencies performed well with double-digit growth, and our Precision marketing agencies were sizable contributors and also posted strong double-digit growth. In addition, Experiential growth outside the U.S. was over 100% in total. 
In the U.S., we generated 7.7% organic growth, which was boosted by strong double-digit growth in our Precision marketing and PR disciplines as well as solid growth at our Healthcare agencies. Our Advertising and Experiential disciplines also grew in the U.S. but at a slower rate than the growth outside the U.S. 
The last revenue view I'd like to share with you is by industry sector on Slide 7. The change in mix by sector in the portfolio was small on a year-to-date basis when compared to last year. In summary, our revenue performance was very strong across the board on both a reported and organic basis and when analyzed by discipline, geography or industry sector. 
Let's now turn to Slide 8 and look at our operating expenses. To make the analysis more relevant, we have also included a supplemental slide in the appendix that shows the 2021 amounts presented in constant dollars. 
Beginning with our largest category, salary and service costs. These costs increased by 7.6% in total, and they tend to fluctuate with the change in revenue. We would also note that Q3 2020 salary and service cost amounts were reduced by reimbursements received from government programs of $68.7 million. As we continue to look forward, we expect a healthy advertising and marketing spending outlook, and strong demand from our clients will necessitate an increase in staffing. The tight labor market will create challenges in the near term that we are confident our management teams will overcome. 
Moving down the P&L. Third-party service costs, which fluctuate with changes in revenue, decreased 6.9% during the quarter due to our net disposition activity, primarily related to the disposition of ICON and partially offset by the organic growth in revenue as well as the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Occupancy and other costs, which are not directly linked to changes in revenue, were up 4.5% year-on-year or 2.9% when excluding foreign exchange rate translation impacts. As expected, these good results continue to reflect our efforts to reduce infrastructure costs and also benefited from a decrease in general office expenses as the majority of our staff continue to work remotely in Q3. 
SG&A expense levels were up 5.3% on a year-over-year basis or 4.2% when excluding foreign exchange rate translation impacts. We are beginning to see a return of travel and certain other addressable spend costs as pandemic-related government restrictions ease. However, based on our use of technology during the pandemic, we're developing practices, particularly with respect to travel, that we expect will allow us to continue to retain some of the benefits we achieved in reducing addressable spend during the pandemic. 
Overall, we expect that the increase in addressable spend for the balance of the year will be mitigated in part by the benefits we will continue to achieve from a hybrid and agile workforce. 
As we think about our future expense levels, we certainly expect that some areas will increase in line with our business as activity picks up and life returns to normal. But at the same time, we will also continue to evaluate ways to improve efficiently throughout the organization by continuing to focus on real estate portfolio management, back-office services, procurement and IT services. With the strong revenue growth we discussed earlier, coupled with good expense control, you can see a notable improvement in our operating profit on a year-over-year basis at the bottom of the slide, up 8% for the quarter and 60.1% year-to-date. 
Growing our operating profit dollars remains one of our most important areas of focus. This strong growth in operating profit was also accompanied by improved margins, which you can see on Slide 9. For the third quarter, our operating profit margin was 15.8% as expressed in terms of our reported total revenues. We continue to see operating margin improvement year-over-year, resulting from the proactive management of our discretionary addressable spend cost categories, including a reduction in travel and related costs, reductions in certain costs of operating our offices given the continued remote work environment as well as benefits from some of the repositioning actions taken back in the second quarter of 2020. 
Lastly, on this slide, our reported EBITDA for the quarter was $560.3 million, up 7.4% for the quarter and 56.3% year-to-date. EBITDA margins also remained strong for the quarter and have expanded nicely year-to-date compared to last year, and we expect this strong performance to continue through the rest of this year. 
Let's now turn to our cash flow performance on Slide 10, where you can see that in the first 9 months of 2021 we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow excluding changes in working capital, a $114 million or 10% increase versus the same period last year. There were no material year-over-year changes for CapEx or acquisitions as we continue to conservatively manage our cash. 
While stock repurchases are down relative to pre-pandemic periods due to curtailment during the pandemic, we resumed our activity during the second and third quarters of this year, and we expect to continue in Q4 and beyond. You should not expect a change in our historical approach to capital allocation and the use of our free cash flow in the future. We will continue to pay an attractive dividend. We have indicated that we increased our focus on acquisition opportunities and are in the process of closing on several acquisitions. Importantly, our acquisition strategy is focusing on the faster-growing disciplines in our portfolio and driving future organic growth for the company. And we will use the balance of our free cash flow to repurchase our stock. 
Our strong cash generation again enhanced our credit and liquidity, which you can see summarized on Slide 11. Our total debt was down about $500 million since this time last year as we eliminated the extra liquidity we added early on in the pandemic. We did this through the early retirement in Q2 of $1.25 billion of our 3.65% senior notes, which were due next year, partially replaced with the issuance of $800 million of 2.6% 10-year notes due in 2031. 
As you can see in the slide, our maturities are well laddered with nothing due until late 2024 as we delevered to pre-pandemic levels. As for our debt ratios, due to our overall operating improvement versus Q3 of 2020 and our recent refinancing activity, we've reduced our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 0.4x. 
I'll end our prepared remarks today on Slide 12, where you can see for the 12 months ending September 30, 2021, we generated a strong return on invested capital of 26.4% and a return on equity of 47%. Both metrics increased substantially over the 2020 levels. While these are just 2 points in time, it's important to remember our long-term track record of providing solid returns to shareholders through business execution and the resulting consistent allocation of capital to dividends, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks today. Operator, please open the lines up for questions and answers. Thank you."

There are still some areas to come that clients would like to deploy money to, especially when it comes to live events and execution type of activities. We saw that start up again very robustly in China in the beginning of the third quarter, slowdown in China as China continues to have some problems. But wherever it's possible, you can see that we're coming back. And companies like the insurance companies or some of our government accounts would like to get back out on the road and visit with people constantly. So there's more to come, I think.
Having said that, our underlying growth areas have been, as I said in the call, CRM Advertising and Media, they've been strong, and they're more than compensated for the not-yet-returned segments where people will, in fact, spend money as we move forward, as more people get back to a regular schedule. And I think it's been 20 months since most people have shut down. And it's -- without any severe disease setbacks, I think we'll increasingly see more and more people back in offices and -- because they're already going to sporting events and dinner and enjoying themselves. So more to come, and I'm pretty bullish about the future."

We just don't know if there'll be those year-end situations where they can deploy more dollars.

I think as we look out into the future we don't expect that our margins are going to deteriorate from that. It's too early to forecast '22, but we're optimistic that we'll be able to maintain those levels. There's an awful lot of unknown at the moment with COVID and returning to travel. We have benefited from a reduction in travel expenses and some of the other addressable spend costs that our agencies have done a great job managing. We do expect to maintain some of that permanently.
But as we grow, costs are going to come back. And the challenge for us is going to be to maintain them relative to a growing cost base.

The size of the opportunity really has never gotten in our way, one way or the other, in terms of our ability or affordability for what we believe is a strategic and an accretive transaction. What is different, and I did mention it in the last call, you're right, was we went from a mode of cleaning up the portfolio to really reactivating our people that are looking for certain acquisitions in the areas that I outlined.

Certainly, our preference, as we've indicated, is to spend more of our free cash flow on acquisitions that meet the characteristics that we've typically described and that John touched on. So we're very confident in the areas that we want to grow in and where we're looking for acquisitions, the faster growth areas and businesses that are going to contribute to an acceleration of organic growth in the future.
But I don't think you can -- you should expect anything to change significantly in our approach to capital allocation. We'll continue to look at our free cash flow and pay an attractive dividend. We're going to continue, as we said, more aggressively to pursue acquisition opportunities in those higher-growth areas, and we expect to continue to be successful on that front.
We did start to get back in the market a little bit in the second quarter, more in the third quarter of this year, in terms of buying back shares and using our free cash flow for buying back shares. That will continue in Q4. We don't set and won't set an acquisition bogey for 2022 in terms of a dollar amount or a percentage of free cash flow. And if there are more attractive deals available, we're going to pursue them. And if we overspend or underspend our free cash flow, we're going to do it for the right reasons.

The other thing when looking at groups like ours, which can't be overlooked, is that our clients in their marketing departments are facing more severe challenges of losing talent and requiring our assistance in certain areas that maybe in more comfortable times they wouldn't have been as keen to buy or as wanting to be first in the queue to make sure that we can reserve those people to service their needs.

The Fed has their own opinion as to whether it's transitory. But certainly, sectors like CPG, auto, food have been impacted, and we'll see how it plays out over time.
But to date, the feedback we've gotten in our discussions with clients, it really hasn't been a negative or positive in having any kind of a meaningful impact at this point on their spending plans near term. So we haven't seen and don't expect significant reductions in consumer spending in the near term. And ultimately, I don't think there's a definitive answer that anyone has at this point in time. We're just going to have to see how it plays out.
And then regarding the Precision Marketing space, we've done a few deals of some business transformation consulting firms and also some MarTech consulting firms that have been quite successful. And we've built out Credera, the initial acquisition we did several years ago. It has some global offices now and more offices in the U.S. than it had before, extremely successful. And we expect that that success will continue. And certainly, those are areas within Precision Marketing that we're looking for opportunities and we expect to find some additional opportunities. There's some other strategic areas within what could be viewed as a relatively broad category, but we haven't finalized any of those transactions, and we're not sure whether we'll be successful or not. But certainly, we've got our eye on a few different opportunities."

Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining today. We're very pleased to report that in the third quarter we continued our year-over-year double-digit growth in our key financial performance metrics led by a very robust top line.",1402,"Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining today. We're very pleased to report that in the third quarter we continued our year-over-year double-digit growth in our key financial performance metrics led by a very robust top line. 
As you can see on Slide 4 of our presentation, organic growth for the third quarter was 11.5%. The top line results were broad-based across our agencies, geographies and disciplines. Our growth was especially strong in CRM Precision at 24%. Our CRM Precision Group is helping clients on their MarTech transformation, digital and e-commerce communications and direct-to-consumer marketing. The group has played a key role in many of our recent new business wins where, overall, we continued our very strong momentum in Q3. 
Broadly, across our group, growth was driven by improved economic conditions. Omnicom's suite of services and capabilities are positioning us to be extremely competitive in the marketplace to: reimagine and strengthen our clients' brands, seamlessly connect them with their customers across their marketing journey, transform their marketing technology platforms and innovate in e-commerce and new media channels. 
Our revenue performance flowed through to our operating profit in bottom line. Our EBIT margins for the third quarter were 15.8%, which exceeded our 2020 margins and significantly outpaced the comparable period in 2019. Net income and EPS for the quarter grew by more than 13% versus 2020 and were also significantly above our 2019 results. 
As we head into the fourth quarter, we are well positioned competitively and expect to benefit as economic growth continues to improve globally and from ongoing cost management. We currently expect our full year organic growth to be approximately 9% and our full year EBIT margin to exceed our year-to-date margin for the 9 months ended September 30, 2021 of 15.1%. 
Going forward, we remain focused on our key strategic initiatives, which is centered around our talent, dedication to creativity and building on our already strong capabilities in precision marketing and MarTech consulting, e-commerce, digital and performance media and predictive data-driven insights. 
In the third quarter, we made progress across these strategic initiatives as we announced 3 acquisitions. Omnicom Media Group acquired Jump 450 Media, a performance marketing agency. The company leverages algorithmic scaling strategies, rapid creative testing and data analytics to optimize digital media spend and drive customer acquisition. Jump 450 will form the foundation for a dedicated performance media platform and business operation within OMG. Its focus on e-commerce and pure performance marketing will strengthen and add a distinct set of capabilities to OMG's existing performance media offerings. 
Also in late September, we announced the acquisition of 2 German-based companies: Antoni and OSK. Antoni is one of the most innovative and creative agencies in Europe and was born with data and digital capabilities at its core. Antoni's creative leadership and depth of talent will significantly strengthen our capabilities in Europe and around the globe. 
OSK has been in the top 10 of PR and comms agencies in Germany since 2008 and is the undisputed #1 for automotive. It provides a broad portfolio of services at the intersection of PR and social media and excels in the convergence of technology, mobility and communications. 
Our ability to bring together the brightest talent and data-driven consumer insights from across our organization to deliver holistic and integrated brand experiences is proving to be highly successful in our new business opportunities as well as in servicing our existing clients. 
Following on the heels of Philips naming Omnicom their global integrated service partner for creative and media communications, in the third quarter Mercedes-Benz appointed Omnicom its global marketing communications partner. One of the world's most iconic brands, Mercedes-Benz is today the leading luxury automotive experience company. 
Team X, a dedicated team from across our groups, will bring together the best-in-class talent and capabilities across Mercedes-Benz customer journey with expertise in media and CRM, brand and performance creator, web personalization and content automation, public relations and events as well as paid and organic social. 
And just last week, we won the Chanel media business globally, adding another iconic global brand. As in all our significant wins as well as for our existing clients, our teams are able to showcase our creativity, better analysis and predictive insights and technology capabilities to deliver connected, personalized and seamless brand experiences for their respective customers at all touch points of the consumer journey. 
One key differentiator for Omnicom in servicing our clients is our cohesive culture that binds us together. It's a culture of creativity, flexibility and caring that our common value shared across our group. I often hear from clients that a deciding factor in their decision to hire Omnicom is that our people, who bring distinct specialized skills to them, know and respect one another and genuinely collaborate. 
Our ability to integrate services from across our marketing disciplines is underpinned by Omni, our open operating system, that orchestrates better outcomes. Omni is built for collaboration, acting as a conductor between different specialists using a single processing workflow from insights to execution. It empowers our people and our clients to make better and faster decisions, maximizing efficiency and ROI. 
Omni also provides better intelligence by orchestrating first-, second- and third-party data sets to present a single comprehensive view of consumers. Our teams can then develop insights to create, plan and deliver the most impactful messages, content and communications to them at each stage of that consumer journey. 
Omni is a unique and powerful tool for us, and we now have over 40,000 Omnicom colleagues provisioned on the platform in over 60 countries. Hundreds of our clients, including all of our top 20, utilize Omni. Moreover, the open-source system enables our practice areas like commerce, health and PR to customize Omni with different data sources for their clients. 
For example, Omnicom Health Group created a custom offering called Omni Health. Since rolling it out in April of this year, OHG has leveraged the platform to play a key role in expanding the group's omnichannel offering with new and existing clients, including AstraZeneca and Janssen, XARELTO, to name a few. 
In summary, even during the pandemic, we accelerated the strength of our services, capabilities and organization to deliver better outcomes for our clients and win new business. Our offering is powerful and differentiated. We have best-in-class talent and creativity using best-in-class operating systems and technologies. It's a formula that will continue to win for us. 
Before I turn it over to Phil, I want to spend a few moments on our relentless focus on talent. Throughout one of the most difficult times in recent history, our people have shown ingenuity, resilience and strength. We continue to spend and invest in training and development programs for all of our people from basic skills training all the way through the advanced programs of Omnicom University. We recently expanded the curriculum for our DE&I and OPEN 2.0 strategies. As the pandemic continues to present a substantial health risk, the well-being of our colleagues remains our top priority. We are ensuring we have a safe work environment and are offering a variety of programs for managers and individuals to support their wellness, resilience and health at work. 
I recently traveled to several of our U.S. and European offices and have met with many colleagues and clients who are happy to be back in the office. We are looking at many alternatives to provide our people a safe return back to the office. For example, this week, we're testing a private transportation service for New York City based colleagues. In the months ahead, we look forward to welcoming more of our staff back with a continuing priority on their safety and flexibility. 
It is truly our world-class talent and our dedication to creativity and innovative solutions that drive real business outcomes for our clients. A key recent proof point reflecting the quality of our talent is Omnicom being named the Most Effective Holding Company in the U.S. by the [indiscernible] report. Overall, we're extremely pleased with the third quarter. I'm proud to see that our strategic focus and the decisions we made throughout the pandemic are now leading to positive results. Our results once again reflect Omnicom's ability to adapt and respond to the changes in the market and deliver through economic cycles. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financials. Phil?"
96161,1684884736,2466627,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2021",2021-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good afternoon. While the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt across the globe, that impact has continued to moderate significantly, as evidenced by our continued growth in the third quarter. Slide 3 shows our third quarter imp",1930,"Thanks, John, and good afternoon. While the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt across the globe, that impact has continued to moderate significantly, as evidenced by our continued growth in the third quarter. 
Slide 3 shows our third quarter improvement across our income statement, where our revenue growth and expense control drove an 8% increase in operating profit. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24.1%, down from our estimated effective rate for 2021 of between 26.5% and 27%. This was primarily due to the favorable settlement of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions, the impact of which was approximately $10 million. These items positively impacted net income and diluted earnings per share, which was $1.65, up $0.20 or 13.8% versus Q3 of last year and up $0.33 versus the third quarter of 2019. So our growth continues on this important metric as well. And finally, our $0.70 quarterly dividend, which was raised back in February, is 7.7% higher than last year. 
Let's now flip to Slide 4 and look at the quarter in more detail, beginning with revenues. Our total revenue growth was 7.1%. Organic growth for the quarter was 11.5% or $367 million, which represents a significant improvement compared to Q3 of 2020 when the pandemic drove an organic revenue decline of 11.7%. The impact of foreign exchange rates increased our revenue by 1.6% in the quarter as the dollar continued to weaken against most of our larger currencies compared to the prior year. If FX rates stay where they were on October 15, we expect foreign exchange to decrease our reported revenue by approximately 1% for the fourth quarter and increase our reported revenue by 2% for the full year. 
The impact on revenue from net acquisitions and dispositions decreased revenue by 5.9%. Based on transactions that have been completed through September 30, 2021, our estimate is the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity for the balance of the year will decrease reported revenue by approximately 7% in the fourth quarter and by approximately 4% for the full year. While we will continue our process of evaluating our portfolio of businesses as part of our strategic planning, as John has said regarding dispositions, we are substantially complete. 
If you turn to Slide 5, you can see our organic growth by discipline. Advertising, our largest discipline, at 53% of our total revenues, posted 8.6% organic growth with very strong performance from both our creative agencies and our media agencies. Please note that reported Advertising growth is down 0.4% due primarily to the disposition of ICON in Q2 of 2021. 
Our agencies focused on direct, digital and marketing transformation consulting services in our Precision marketing discipline also posted strong organic growth at 24.3%. With the exception of the second quarter of 2020, this discipline has been a consistent grower for some time and has become a larger portion of our business each quarter. 
CRM Commerce and Brand Consulting was up 18%, with our branding agencies leading the discipline's performance. CRM Experiential was up 50%. This business declined far more than our other disciplines in the third quarter of last year during the pandemic and has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels due to various global restrictions. However, this remains an important area for our clients, and we look forward to further growth as global economies continue lifting social distancing restrictions. 
CRM Execution & Support was up 8.3%, reflecting a recovery in client spend compared to the prior year in our field marketing businesses, while our research businesses continued to lag. PR was up 10.5%. We have a positive outlook for the discipline, especially within our global agencies, as clients adjust to the new post pandemic realities. And finally, our Healthcare discipline was up 6.6% organically. Healthcare was the only one of our service disciplines that had positive organic growth during the depths of the pandemic and continue to perform well. 
Flipping to Slide 6, our revenue by region. The key takeaway is that all of our geographies again posted solid organic growth. This growth was driven by virtually every discipline within each region. Outside the U.S., where total organic growth was 16%, double-digit growth in each region was led by Germany, the U.K., Canada and Australia. Our Advertising, Media and PR agencies performed well with double-digit growth, and our Precision marketing agencies were sizable contributors and also posted strong double-digit growth. In addition, Experiential growth outside the U.S. was over 100% in total. 
In the U.S., we generated 7.7% organic growth, which was boosted by strong double-digit growth in our Precision marketing and PR disciplines as well as solid growth at our Healthcare agencies. Our Advertising and Experiential disciplines also grew in the U.S. but at a slower rate than the growth outside the U.S. 
The last revenue view I'd like to share with you is by industry sector on Slide 7. The change in mix by sector in the portfolio was small on a year-to-date basis when compared to last year. In summary, our revenue performance was very strong across the board on both a reported and organic basis and when analyzed by discipline, geography or industry sector. 
Let's now turn to Slide 8 and look at our operating expenses. To make the analysis more relevant, we have also included a supplemental slide in the appendix that shows the 2021 amounts presented in constant dollars. 
Beginning with our largest category, salary and service costs. These costs increased by 7.6% in total, and they tend to fluctuate with the change in revenue. We would also note that Q3 2020 salary and service cost amounts were reduced by reimbursements received from government programs of $68.7 million. As we continue to look forward, we expect a healthy advertising and marketing spending outlook, and strong demand from our clients will necessitate an increase in staffing. The tight labor market will create challenges in the near term that we are confident our management teams will overcome. 
Moving down the P&L. Third-party service costs, which fluctuate with changes in revenue, decreased 6.9% during the quarter due to our net disposition activity, primarily related to the disposition of ICON and partially offset by the organic growth in revenue as well as the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Occupancy and other costs, which are not directly linked to changes in revenue, were up 4.5% year-on-year or 2.9% when excluding foreign exchange rate translation impacts. As expected, these good results continue to reflect our efforts to reduce infrastructure costs and also benefited from a decrease in general office expenses as the majority of our staff continue to work remotely in Q3. 
SG&A expense levels were up 5.3% on a year-over-year basis or 4.2% when excluding foreign exchange rate translation impacts. We are beginning to see a return of travel and certain other addressable spend costs as pandemic-related government restrictions ease. However, based on our use of technology during the pandemic, we're developing practices, particularly with respect to travel, that we expect will allow us to continue to retain some of the benefits we achieved in reducing addressable spend during the pandemic. 
Overall, we expect that the increase in addressable spend for the balance of the year will be mitigated in part by the benefits we will continue to achieve from a hybrid and agile workforce. 
As we think about our future expense levels, we certainly expect that some areas will increase in line with our business as activity picks up and life returns to normal. But at the same time, we will also continue to evaluate ways to improve efficiently throughout the organization by continuing to focus on real estate portfolio management, back-office services, procurement and IT services. With the strong revenue growth we discussed earlier, coupled with good expense control, you can see a notable improvement in our operating profit on a year-over-year basis at the bottom of the slide, up 8% for the quarter and 60.1% year-to-date. 
Growing our operating profit dollars remains one of our most important areas of focus. This strong growth in operating profit was also accompanied by improved margins, which you can see on Slide 9. For the third quarter, our operating profit margin was 15.8% as expressed in terms of our reported total revenues. We continue to see operating margin improvement year-over-year, resulting from the proactive management of our discretionary addressable spend cost categories, including a reduction in travel and related costs, reductions in certain costs of operating our offices given the continued remote work environment as well as benefits from some of the repositioning actions taken back in the second quarter of 2020. 
Lastly, on this slide, our reported EBITDA for the quarter was $560.3 million, up 7.4% for the quarter and 56.3% year-to-date. EBITDA margins also remained strong for the quarter and have expanded nicely year-to-date compared to last year, and we expect this strong performance to continue through the rest of this year. 
Let's now turn to our cash flow performance on Slide 10, where you can see that in the first 9 months of 2021 we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow excluding changes in working capital, a $114 million or 10% increase versus the same period last year. There were no material year-over-year changes for CapEx or acquisitions as we continue to conservatively manage our cash. 
While stock repurchases are down relative to pre-pandemic periods due to curtailment during the pandemic, we resumed our activity during the second and third quarters of this year, and we expect to continue in Q4 and beyond. You should not expect a change in our historical approach to capital allocation and the use of our free cash flow in the future. We will continue to pay an attractive dividend. We have indicated that we increased our focus on acquisition opportunities and are in the process of closing on several acquisitions. Importantly, our acquisition strategy is focusing on the faster-growing disciplines in our portfolio and driving future organic growth for the company. And we will use the balance of our free cash flow to repurchase our stock. 
Our strong cash generation again enhanced our credit and liquidity, which you can see summarized on Slide 11. Our total debt was down about $500 million since this time last year as we eliminated the extra liquidity we added early on in the pandemic. We did this through the early retirement in Q2 of $1.25 billion of our 3.65% senior notes, which were due next year, partially replaced with the issuance of $800 million of 2.6% 10-year notes due in 2031. 
As you can see in the slide, our maturities are well laddered with nothing due until late 2024 as we delevered to pre-pandemic levels. As for our debt ratios, due to our overall operating improvement versus Q3 of 2020 and our recent refinancing activity, we've reduced our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 0.4x. 
I'll end our prepared remarks today on Slide 12, where you can see for the 12 months ending September 30, 2021, we generated a strong return on invested capital of 26.4% and a return on equity of 47%. Both metrics increased substantially over the 2020 levels. While these are just 2 points in time, it's important to remember our long-term track record of providing solid returns to shareholders through business execution and the resulting consistent allocation of capital to dividends, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks today. Operator, please open the lines up for questions and answers. Thank you."

There are still some areas to come that clients would like to deploy money to, especially when it comes to live events and execution type of activities. We saw that start up again very robustly in China in the beginning of the third quarter, slowdown in China as China continues to have some problems. But wherever it's possible, you can see that we're coming back. And companies like the insurance companies or some of our government accounts would like to get back out on the road and visit with people constantly. So there's more to come, I think.
Having said that, our underlying growth areas have been, as I said in the call, CRM Advertising and Media, they've been strong, and they're more than compensated for the not-yet-returned segments where people will, in fact, spend money as we move forward, as more people get back to a regular schedule. And I think it's been 20 months since most people have shut down. And it's -- without any severe disease setbacks, I think we'll increasingly see more and more people back in offices and -- because they're already going to sporting events and dinner and enjoying themselves. So more to come, and I'm pretty bullish about the future."

In summary, I think based on everything we know today, as we look out into the future, beyond what John said in his prepared remarks, which was essentially we're comfortable that through 9 months, we're at an EBIT margin of 15.1%. We expect for the year, we will be 15.1%.
I think as we look out into the future we don't expect that our margins are going to deteriorate from that. It's too early to forecast '22, but we're optimistic that we'll be able to maintain those levels. There's an awful lot of unknown at the moment with COVID and returning to travel. We have benefited from a reduction in travel expenses and some of the other addressable spend costs that our agencies have done a great job managing. We do expect to maintain some of that permanently.
But as we grow, costs are going to come back. And the challenge for us is going to be to maintain them relative to a growing cost base. And we're confident that our performance through 9 months will be sustainable, and our expectations for this year will be similar from a margin perspective going forward."

The size of the opportunity really has never gotten in our way, one way or the other, in terms of our ability or affordability for what we believe is a strategic and an accretive transaction. What is different, and I did mention it in the last call, you're right, was we went from a mode of cleaning up the portfolio to really reactivating our people that are looking for certain acquisitions in the areas that I outlined.

Certainly, our preference, as we've indicated, is to spend more of our free cash flow on acquisitions that meet the characteristics that we've typically described and that John touched on. So we're very confident in the areas that we want to grow in and where we're looking for acquisitions, the faster growth areas and businesses that are going to contribute to an acceleration of organic growth in the future.
But I don't think you can -- you should expect anything to change significantly in our approach to capital allocation. We'll continue to look at our free cash flow and pay an attractive dividend. We're going to continue, as we said, more aggressively to pursue acquisition opportunities in those higher-growth areas, and we expect to continue to be successful on that front.
We did start to get back in the market a little bit in the second quarter, more in the third quarter of this year, in terms of buying back shares and using our free cash flow for buying back shares. That will continue in Q4. We don't set and won't set an acquisition bogey for 2022 in terms of a dollar amount or a percentage of free cash flow. And if there are more attractive deals available, we're going to pursue them. And if we overspend or underspend our free cash flow, we're going to do it for the right reasons.

So we've talked about supply chain issues a fair bit on this call. But in previous macro cycles, inflation has often been a good thing for ad spending, and therefore, for your business. And I wonder if you have any thoughts on that, how that looks now or if that maybe is a negative indication of some of the supply chain issues now instead?
And then the business question, you're talking a fair bit about precision marketing here, which is great to hear. I wonder if you can give us a bit more color maybe on what are some of the M&A opportunities. It seems like that's the areas that you're looking at to bolster your Precision Marketing business. What kind of areas do you feel like you would like to fill out better and how you would then look versus your peers?"

Is it transitory? Is it not transitory? Plenty of people have an opinion, many of which are different. The Fed has their own opinion as to whether it's transitory. But certainly,",277,"So there's certainly been lots of press on inflation for quite a while now. Is it transitory? Is it not transitory? Plenty of people have an opinion, many of which are different. The Fed has their own opinion as to whether it's transitory. But certainly, sectors like CPG, auto, food have been impacted, and we'll see how it plays out over time.
But to date, the feedback we've gotten in our discussions with clients, it really hasn't been a negative or positive in having any kind of a meaningful impact at this point on their spending plans near term. So we haven't seen and don't expect significant reductions in consumer spending in the near term. And ultimately, I don't think there's a definitive answer that anyone has at this point in time. We're just going to have to see how it plays out.
And then regarding the Precision Marketing space, we've done a few deals of some business transformation consulting firms and also some MarTech consulting firms that have been quite successful. And we've built out Credera, the initial acquisition we did several years ago. It has some global offices now and more offices in the U.S. than it had before, extremely successful. And we expect that that success will continue. And certainly, those are areas within Precision Marketing that we're looking for opportunities and we expect to find some additional opportunities. There's some other strategic areas within what could be viewed as a relatively broad category, but we haven't finalized any of those transactions, and we're not sure whether we'll be successful or not. But certainly, we've got our eye on a few different opportunities."
