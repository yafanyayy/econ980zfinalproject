Thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. Unfortunately, we don't have our new Chief Financial Officer, Felicia Hendricks, on board quite yet, though I know she's out there listening and eager to join",1796,"Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. Unfortunately, we don't have our new Chief Financial Officer, Felicia Hendricks, on board quite yet, though I know she's out there listening and eager to join the team here in a few weeks. We're excited for that. So in her place, I'll be providing a brief financial update this morning, following a high level year-end review and some additional color on what was really an exciting quarter for us in Q4 of 2020. 
Here with me, as usual, are members of my executive team this morning who can help answer your questions, including our Head of Operations, Todd George, who will answer questions about our core business; and Justin Sebastiano, our SVP, Finance and Treasurer, who will tag team with me as needed on the finance side. We're also joined for the first time by Harper Ko, our new Chief. Welcome, Harper. 
With that, let me begin by saying that as we close the final chapter on one of the most difficult and surreal years for all of us from a personal and professional standpoint, I'm immensely proud of the way our team members at all levels of our organization came together, weather the storm and helped us emerge as a stronger company than ever before. While we'll continue to adjust to the uncertainties of today's world until COVID-19 is behind us, we used all the adversities and challenges thrown at us in 2020 as catalysts to completely reevaluate and reimagine the way we do business, and we supercharge the digital transformation of our company at the same time. 
Our team at Penn proved a lot in 2020. For me, as I reflect the words agility, perseverance, tenacity, resilience, creativity and change agent all come to mind. Our results in 2020 speak to the relentless focus and nimbleness of our best-in-class corporate and property management teams and they reflect the power of our incredible partnership with our great friends at Barstool Sports. 
While I am equally proud -- what I am equally proud of, excuse me, and looking back on 2020 is how our company rose the occasion to support our team members and host communities in these times of great need and heightened social justice awareness. Through our Penn National Gaming Foundation, we created a COVID-19 emergency relief fund for our team members and raised over $3.7 million from our Board of Directors, senior management team and our foundation. In addition, we provided $13 million in onetime holiday cash bonuses to our nonexecutive team members company-wide in the fourth quarter to help with the financial impact to their families from the pandemic. 
We also created the Hurricane Laura relief funds with an initial contribution of $2.5 million to help our community and team members impacted by the storm, in addition to providing more than $6 million in full wages and benefits to our team members while the Bars Lake Charles was closed. 
Most importantly, we joined Dave Portnoy's latest mission at Barstool to help save and sustain small businesses across the country that have been impacted by COVID-19, contributing more than $4.6 million and counting to the Barstool funds. 
Finally, on the social justice front, our Diversity Committee announced a new $1 million annual scholarship program to support team members from historically disadvantaged and underrepresented groups. And we launched a series of new inclusion-related initiatives, to educate our team members across the organization and continue to foster a respectful and inclusive workplace. 
Turning now to our fourth quarter results. Both our revenues and adjusted EBITDA were trending ahead of forecast before COVID-19-related closures in Illinois, Michigan and Pennsylvania and increased restrictions in Ohio and Massachusetts amongst a few other states began in mid-November. While revenues contracted 23% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDAR declined by only 9% for the same period, reflecting structural changes that we -- that were put in place with the onset of the pandemic. These adjustments to our core business helped to expand adjusted EBITDAR margins by 580 basis points relative to Q4 '19 results despite the aforementioned headwinds, helped by an improvement of 720 basis points in the South segment, which was least affected by the COVID-19 restrictions despite the impact of Hurricane Laura in the fourth quarter in Lake Charles. We remain convinced that these structural changes to our business will result in meaningful EBITDAR growth once volumes return to pre-pandemic levels. 
Trends in January, thus far, are very encouraging, which Todd can provide more color on during our Q&A session. In fact, this past weekend, we saw our highest Friday, Saturday combined slot volumes across our company portfolio of properties since the first quarter of 2020. Our South segment has continued to be particularly strong with January revenues, the highest we have seen in the month of January and the last 5 years on a same-store basis, leading to exceptional flow through to EBITDA. 
We are continuing to see encouraging growth in the younger demographic tiers of our database, and we believe the rollout of COVID vaccinations and treatments will encourage more guests in all age segments of our database to return to our land-based facilities. When they do, they'll soon be met with the 3Cs: our new cashless, cardless and contactless technology, which will improve efficiency and provide a guest experience in line with other industries historically frequented by younger demographics, which we expect also to drive further incremental revenue for us. 
We're planning to launch the 3Cs at our Pennsylvania casinos in the first half of '21 subject to regulatory approval, and we'll continue that rollout for the remainder of 2021 to other regions. 
I'm sure Felicia would also want you to know that our cash balance stood at a healthy $1.9 billion at quarter end, even after paying down $115 million of our Term loan B. In turn, our net traditional debt decreased to approximately $578 million at December 31, 2020, bringing our lease-adjusted net leverage to 4.7% based on 2019 adjusted EBITDAR compared to 5.7% at the end of 2019. Some of you may have also noticed in our financial statements that we recorded a sizable unrealized gain related to our equity positions in Pointsbet and the score, which were received as part of our market access skin agreements. This is just an example of the significant value we think we will realize over the next several years from our portfolio of leading market access partners. 
Other highlights from the fourth quarter include the continued momentum we're seeing for our Barstool Sports book app in Pennsylvania, strong retention, CRM efforts and creative promotions including our matching of first-time deposits with donations to the Barstool fund to support small businesses throughout the state, have led to an increased handle and market share. And most importantly, highlight our unique and unmatched approach to efficient customer acquisition. 
More recently, on January 22, we introduced our Barstool Sportsbook Mobile app in Michigan to very strong demand. Dave Portnoy, as many of you know, went to the University of Michigan, and he and big cat have a very loyal fan base there. They've been hanging out at our Greentown property in Detroit, generating a lot of excitement and awareness, not just for our Barstool Mobile Sportsbook and fully integrated iCasino, which we launched on Monday, but also our retail Barstool Sportsbook in the Greentown Casino in general, which really highlights the power of our differentiated omnichannel strategy. We think this strategy is shared to only gain steam in a post-COVID environment. 
Importantly, Michigan's launched weekend had 68% more first time depositors than Pennsylvania's initial weekend. And the daily active users were nearly 2/3 higher than the average daily active users in Pennsylvania during 2020. All the more impressive when you consider the state of Michigan's population is only a little over 70% that of Pennsylvania. Also worth noting the attention and excitement from the Michigan launch has created a halo or spillover effect. And the publicity surrounding our Michigan launch helped our registrations and daily active users climb in Pennsylvania as well. We are just beginning to scale, but we are excited to see the early benefits from being live in our second state. 
Our next launch state will be in Illinois, where we plan to go live prior to March madness, pending regulatory approval, of course. And from there, we'll continue to roll out in new states every 3 to 5 weeks or so until we're operational in 10 or more states by the end of 2021. 
We achieved another milestone in Michigan with the launch of our Barstool-branded iCasino product on February 1. And although it's obviously early, we have been extremely pleased with the initial results as nearly 15% or as of this morning, over 15% now of our Michigan Sportsbook customers placed a wager on the Barstool iCasino during its first 2 days of operation. And average daily users exceeded our more mature Hollywood-branded iCasino product in Pennsylvania by more than 70% over the same 2-day period. 
Finally, we have now fully implemented our industry-leading mychoice reward program across all of our properties and our online channels. This program of over 20 million members connects our land-based casinos to our sports betting and iCasino products, offering players a wide range of compelling incentives to consolidate play across our various platforms. Our mychoice player affinity program has become even more compelling as we recently announced a strategic partnership with Choice Hotels that provides for yet even more earning and redemption options for our most valued and loyal guests as well as an additional funnel to fill our nearly 10,000 hotel rooms across the enterprise. 
Looking forward, we're anticipating an exciting new year as we continue to introduce Barstool-branded retail and mobile sports books across our portfolio, including brand-new builds at our 2 properties opening in Pennsylvania during the second half of '21. We have already seen very strong results from our retail sportsbooks, with our Indiana properties seeing meaningful increases in both gaming and non-gaming revenues following their rebranding at Barstool Sportsbooks. We are incredibly optimistic about the opportunities to unlock further upside as we introduce additional Barstool Sportsbook and sportsbars across the portfolio. 
In the meantime, on the legislative front, we're focused on the enabling legislation for voter-approved sports betting laws in Louisiana and Maryland, and we're aggressively lobbying in 2021 for new opportunities for sports betting in Ohio, New York, Texas, Massachusetts and Missouri, among others. We believe our industry-best geographic footprint, combined with the work we have done over the past year, has set the stage for a very exciting '21. And with that, I'd like to ask Frank for you to please turn it over to the line of questions."

And then, Jay, on the U.S. sports betting side, we're seeing not necessarily Pennsylvania and Michigan, but just in other markets that the environment has gotten a little bit more promotional and some kind of craziness with customer acquisition costs. When you look at the broad overall trends there, how does that factor into your thinking on how you're going to market and promote and acquire customers? How is your thinking evolve maybe over the last, I don't know, year or so that you've seen more experience? And then how does that translate into what you're doing in Michigan and thus far in Pennsylvania, which I know both markets are kind of early days. And then when you think about the initial performance in Michigan outperforming Pennsylvania, is it really just a function that Michigan is sort of a jump ball market for everybody and so therefore, you're a little bit more on an even playing field. And so therefore, share momentum is a little bit stronger. But I'd love to hear your thoughts on all these things."

And the answer to the second question around the differences between Michigan and PA, I would point to that as the primary reason. We've been pointing to Michigan for, I don't know, 6 months now, ever since we knew that Michigan was a state that was going to be ready to go sometime in the late fourth quarter or early first quarter. Because any other state that we could launch in out of the gate like Pennsylvania, you're playing catch-up. We launched in Pennsylvania, I think it was 14 or 15 months after sports betting had gone live on a -- from a mobile standpoint. So Michigan, for us is a great proving ground. We're at the starting gate at the same time. The gun goes off, and we're not playing catch-up. We can get out of the starting gate the same way that everybody else can. But of course, we definitely do things different. We have this amazing partnership in this fully integrated media strategy with what is the most compelling and fastest-growing sports and lifestyle media company on the Internet. So you look at the popularity of Barstool where it was when we announced our investment in Barstool 1 year ago to where it is today. And it's been so robust. It's beyond anything that any of us could have ever expected. And so we're in this really great position, Joe, where I think it's well documented that this is kind of tying into your first question, customer acquisition costs. It's -- I think most analysts have done a good job researching this and it's anywhere from $300 to $800 per customer for the space, right? What I would tell you is that for Penn, so far in the first 4 months in PA, despite all of the Barstool fund matching that we've done as well as in Michigan in our first month, we are well below the bottom end of that range. We have so much room for -- we have so much cushion to be opportunistic and figure out what we want to do and how we want to do it. And so we're starting to test some paid media, paid advertising in PA and Michigan. We're just dabbling. We're happy with the early returns, but we're in this great spot where we think we can generate meaningful market share and profitability just relying on that Barstool media partnership. And then anything else we do above and beyond there is for us just to continue to grow our share and do it in a way that delivers a nice return on investment. And I think that's a very different strategy than everybody else in the space."

And that number does seem to be coming in materially better than I think what we are probably The Street had modeled. There's a lot going on in that line item. And what I'm kind of trying to get at is, are we seeing an actual material contribution on the profit side from some combination of Penn Interactive, Barstool media and some of these other things that are going on, some of the -- maybe the market access piece? Or can you help us understand that a little bit better? Because it seems like it almost entirely offset your corporate costs in the quarter. If you could just help us unpack that a little bit."

Well, you are correct in all of your assumptions there around what sort of packed into that other category.

Well, you are correct in all of your assumptions there around what sort of packed into that other category. And we will at the right time, I would anticipate probably before the end of this year, this calendar year, start to report PI out separately. We're not ready to do that yet, but you should assume that what drove the other results is everything associated with Penn Interactive and what comes with that. We had an amazing quarter. And that's with doing -- we've done everything that we intended to do from a marketing standpoint in the fourth quarter. We haven't held back. Where is at the point now where it's what else do we want to do because our customer acquisition costs are so much lower than everyone else's, we can really be thoughtful around what we do, how we do it, when we do it. And we've got partners that are just in no shortage of ideas all the time. I don't know if how many of you guys saw, but for example,  one of the things that we're doing this weekend around the Super Bowl that I just don't know our competitors can do this because our media partners and their following is so compelling and so loyal. But Dave set up to where he's got 5 personalities at Barstool, and there's a contest throughout the day in the Super Bowl betting on the game throughout the game. And whoever ends up with winning the most money, if you bet $100 on our app on any bet on the Super Bowl, you get randomly assigned to one of these 5 personalities. And if your personality ends up at the Super Bowl with the most money, you get $1,000 dropped into your account. It's just -- those are ideas that no one else really maybe has thought of, but more importantly, they don't have the people and the following within their media partnerships that would even make a difference in doing something like that. And that's something that we're so excited about because we've got this list of dozens of ideas and we're just prioritizing which ones make the most sense, which ones are Dave and big Cat and the team at Barstool most excited about because you sense when they've got a great idea, just how much energy they throw at it. And so yes, we think we're in a really good position. And I think that what you see in that other line, Shaun, is that you're seeing really early on profitability. I'm not telling you that you should expect that every quarter because we may decide that as we launch, we want to be more aggressive in some of the things that we're learning on the paid media side. But as of right now, we're spending on the things that we know move the needle, and we're still able to look at our P&L and be really, really impressed."

And what you can do to maybe further drive and empower the brand? How should we think about kind of upstart and launch costs as we start to accelerate some of these new markets? Because I mean, you've done all this. You were, I guess, implied profitable in the quarter, and you were undoubtedly ready to ramp and ready to roll for getting going in Michigan, which is a huge launch for you. So I mean, it's impressive and we're trying to think about how do we extrapolate these numbers of this trend line going forward?"

Right now, we're trying to grow the funnel and really focus on as much on new customers, acquisition, first-time depositors as possible in all of these markets. And what's interesting is that even as aggressive as we were in the way that we are aggressive, and we matched over $3 million in Michigan in the first weekend on first-time deposits and wagers. And I sit back and I look at our customer acquisition cost for the Michigan launch, and it's still less than $200, right? So we have a lot of flexibility here in terms of what we want to do and how we want to do it. I would assume that 2021 maybe as sort of breakeven-ish on the interactive side. But we clearly have a path to ramping up profitability faster than anybody else, and I would expect to start to see that really ring through in 2022 and beyond from there."

All that cost is being spread across 2 states, right? So you can imagine as you scale this thing to 10 states, 11 states, 12 states, which is where we plan to be by the end of '21, you have all that much more dry powder to spend on growing the funnel and widening that funnel of acquisition. So we're testing things now. We spent some money on TV advertising in PA and Michigan, around AFC NFC championship weekend. Not a lot, but we dabbled.

I'm just wondering, what are some of the key items that you guys watching, which I assume most of it's tied to the virus and vaccinations and stuff like that.

So I think for modeling purposes, if you assume breakeven, then somewhere in that range, slightly positive, slightly not, but breakeven for the year is probably the way to model it.

And so if we assume from here through the remainder of the year that restriction and closures get no worse than they are today, and you map that out for the remainder of the year and the restrictions continue to ease every few months, we look at the consensus number and say that number looks fine. It's -- but I just, to your point, to put a number out there right now when we don't have full control over our destiny, the way you do in most years, we felt like wasn't the right approach, and I would be surprised if many decided to do that. But it really does depend on sort of what decisions are being made at the state level and at the regulatory level in terms of how we can operate and when we can really see some loosening of these restrictions."

I don't want to be on record of predicting what the first 10 days in Michigan came to. I think there's already some numbers out there that people are tracking related to GEO comply and the number of pings and things of that nature. I would just say that I think you have to look at Michigan, even with regard to pings differently than you have any other state launch because Michigan is the only state to date in the U.S. that went live on the same-day with both sports betting and online casino. And so you should expect that the number of pings relative to other state launches was going to be higher in Michigan. We just -- none of us know how many of those were specifically for downloading and betting on sports betting versus downloading and bedding on the online casino. What I would -- I think we did, in our slides, if you look -- look through those, we tried to do a good comparison of the first weekend and the first 10 days in Michigan versus Pennsylvania. We all know what our market share has looked like in Pennsylvania from a handle standpoint in that 12% to 13% range and really ending the year in December with our best month-to-date. And you look across the board in the Michigan metrics, whether you're looking at downloads, registration, first time deposit, daily active users, number of wagers per day or wagers per day, it -- was all significantly higher in Michigan than it was in the state of Pennsylvania. And back to one of the other questions, I think it is being at the starting gate, at the same time, makes a huge difference. We're not trying to convince sports betters to leave the app they've been betting on and download our app, that's the challenge that you run into when you're launching later than everybody else. This was -- it's fair game. Today is the first day and download Barstool, and I think we're seeing really good results out of the gate."

We had -- just to give you a quick stat, during AFC NFC championship weekends, when we launched in Michigan, between Michigan and Pennsylvania, we had 11,000 betters that on the can't lose parlay with big cat to get the free hat, right? So it just -- I think it speaks to sort of what might drive over the long term, that whole percentage. I wouldn't overly read into December. I don't think you should expect 20% of us every month. Maybe we end up above-average over the long term. But I would also remind everyone, we lost money in the first month we launched in September.

We have -- we've delivered and we're delivering now in our second state in terms of being a major player in online sports betting. And we have this great footprint in all of these skins, and we still have lots of excess skin.

I mean, Virginia has been kind of leak -- there's been operators kind of going live every 5 days or 7 days, and we're cautiously optimistic we'll be in that queue somewhere. They haven't announced all of their licenses up to this point. So for us, it was a pretty easy decision because you have to plan these things out. You can't just wake up one day and say, well, let's do that state tomorrow. You've got to work with the regulators. And every state has different controls and regulations and rules around betting on college versus not, but in a local teams versus not, what sports. And so you have to build these things out. Now Illinois for us is going to be, we think, an amazing state. Right behind Boston, there's no city in the country where Barstool's bigger than in Chicago. And so big cats from there. We've got a great following on the Barstool side. We have 3 casinos in the state. And for us, Illinois was a no-brainer. We want to be live before March Madness. We're cautiously optimistic. We'll be able to make that happen. We're just working with the regulators on dates. And after that, it's going to be a mad rush to get as many live as possible before football season that you -- from a pure sports viewing perspective of what's live, it's not all that exciting over June, July and August. But it's all about being prepared for September when college and NFL football kicks back in. So you should expect the Indianas and the New Jerseys. And when we say New Jersey, both sports betting and online casino, given that we just did both in Michigan successfully, we'll be ready to do both in New Jersey when we go live there. Colorado, Virginia, West Virginia, Iowa, Tennessee, I think that's probably the lineup there. And we're in a spot where we've got an opportunity depending on what happens and how fast Maryland moves and Louisiana move, if legislation gets going in Ohio, Massachusetts. We have a lot of flexibility on the second half of the year to continue to swap things in and out. And we think the bigger the state population and the bigger the Barstool brand in the state are really big factors for us. And of course, being at the starting gate is probably going to be factor number one. So if we can be at the starting gate, then that's probably going to move up from a prioritization standpoint."

People want to get out of the house. And I think as the COVID vaccinations continue to roll and treatment prove more and more effective, the weather warms up. Because you remember, most of our portfolio, we're on over-index, concentrated in Midwest and Northeast. You get to the March, April, May and if all these things are still moving in the right direction, I think you're going to see some real pent-up demand like we're seeing in the South right now."

Yes, I'll try and to be thoughtful around what I can say because, remember, we're 36% investors, we don't control or own majority today. And I don't want to speak for Eric and Nardini about too much about her business. Of course, what I would say is that 2020 was best year on record. The growth was unbelievable. There was a little bit of a pocket in that March, April, like every other company in the U.S. and probably the world for that matter was like, what's going to happen. And you saw some pullback on advertising spend, but really from May through the end of the year, every category, very strong. And this is something that I actually don't think gets enough attention. I actually appreciate you asking the question, Stephen, because we are going to own the majority, if not all, a Barstool at the third anniversary, which is only 2 years away. And you look at how -- there's been some really interesting transactions in the podcast space, sports media. We got a call the other day about a tiny little sports media company and the asking price compared to what we're going to end up paying for potentially all of Barstool makes me feel really good about the value of Barstool. And it's interesting, too. We talked about this with Dave and Erika and Dan a few times that Barstool Sports, by itself, was probably worth X and had the potential to get to Y sort of if they stayed on a stand-alone basis. And Penn maybe was worth A and had potential to get to B but then you put the 2 companies to be together and it became exponential in terms of what the platform that each provided for one another and the exposure and access to different customer bases. And they now have everybody on Wall Street following them, and we have everybody -- not everybody, but so many in that 21 to 40-year-old age group following us and wearing Penn gear. So it's -- there's so much synergy. The companies were very complementary for one another. And I think that value, again, without getting into too much detail, and I'm sure Erika will share whatever she's comfortable sharing at conferences, that value is only going to continue to grow given all of the great things that they've done and how they've proven to be just so agile. I mean, who would have thought that Dave, daytrader would be a thing, let alone a huge thing, and unboxing promotions would have millions of viewers every night and live streams have them playing digital Black Jack would garner so much attention. But the -- I say it all the time, you're probably sick of hearing me saying they're marketing geniuses, and we're really thrilled to be partnered with them and thrilled to be the future owners of that brand."

It's so smooth and easy to find in the app. It's got its own place on the bottom as well as in the menu bar. It's very intuitive. It's one wallet, you get in, play some Black Jack or some roulette maybe at half time of the game. And I think this is where we can do things that are really differentiated around Dave and big cat and the other Barstool personalities. So maybe people are staying tuned in throughout the game as to what they're doing betting on sports, but then you've got half time and what are they doing when they go play Blackjack or tinkering around with new slot machines. And we definitely -- one of the things that we will do. I don't have to share how we're going to do it. What we will do is we're definitely going to be in the business of creating our own gaming content around Barstool and our own games around Barstool because they've got a lot of great ideas, and we know that's something that would be really attractive to their followers."

February, as Jay spoke to, Friday and Saturday, where the best volumes we've seen from a slot standpoint since Q1 of last year. And even from a table standpoint, it was the second best Friday, Saturday we've seen. So then the storm wiped out much of that in the Northeast.

It's in our control. And that we want to be live in. The big question would be what happens, and this would be a good problem to have. What happens if Massachusetts, Missouri, Kansas, name your state, Ohio, Texas, if one of those legalize and can be ready by football season, then we're going to be figuring that out because we want to be at the starting gate. So being at the starting gate is really important. Size of population -- or population size of the state, popularity of Barstool in that given state. Those are all factors for us. But you're right in that you can't just snap your fingers and be live in every state tomorrow because you have you have a unique bespoke app in every one of these states that has to deliver on what the regulators want and what the rules are and what games you can bet on and all that. And some of that just takes a little bit of time. So I think what you should expect is that the cadence from here on out through the rest of the year is going to be much more rapid than what you saw from state 1 to state 2."

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. Unfortunately, we don't have our new Chief Financial Officer, Felicia Hendrix, on board quite yet, though I know she's out there listening and eager to join the team here in a few weeks. 
We're excited for that. So in her place, I'll be providing a brief financial update this morning, following a high-level year-end review and some additional color on what was really an exciting quarter for us in Q4 of 2020.  
Here with me, as usual, are members of my executive team this morning who can help answer your questions, including our Head of Operations, Todd George, who will answer questions about our core business; and Justin Sebastiano, our SVP, Finance and Treasurer, who will tag team with me as needed on the finance side. We're also joined for the first time by Harper Ko, our new Chief. Welcome, Harper.  
With that, let me begin by saying that as we close the final chapter on one of the most difficult and surreal years for all of us from a personal and professional standpoint, I'm immensely proud of the way our team members at all levels of our organization came together, weather the storm and helped us emerge as a stronger company than ever before. 
While we'll continue to adjust to the uncertainties of today's world until COVID-19 is behind us, we used all the adversities and challenges thrown at us in 2020 as catalysts to completely reevaluate and reimagine the way we do business, and we supercharge the digital transformation of our company at the same time.  
Our team at Penn proved a lot in 2020. For me, as I reflect the words agility, perseverance, tenacity, resilience, creativity and change agent all come to mind. Our results in 2020 speak to the relentless focus and nimbleness of our best-in-class corporate and property management teams and they reflect the power of our incredible partnership with our great friends at Barstool Sports.  
While I am equally proud -- what I am equally proud of, excuse me, on looking back on 2020 is how our company rose the occasion to support our team members and host communities in these times of great need and heightened social justice awareness. 
Through our Penn National Gaming Foundation, we created a COVID-19 emergency relief fund for our team members and raised over $3.7 million from our Board of Directors, senior management team and our foundation. 
In addition, we provided $13 million in onetime holiday cash bonuses to our nonexecutive team members company-wide in the fourth quarter to help with the financial impact to their families from the pandemic.  
We also created the Hurricane Laura relief funds with an initial contribution of $2.5 million to help our community and team members impacted by the storm, in addition to providing more than $6 million in full wages and benefits to our team members while the L’Auberge Lake Charles was closed.  
Most importantly, we joined Dave Portnoy's latest mission at Barstool to help save and sustain small businesses across the country that have been impacted by COVID-19, contributing more than $4.6 million and counting to the Barstool funds.  
Finally, on the social justice front, our Diversity Committee announced a new $1 million annual scholarship program to support team members from historically disadvantaged and underrepresented groups. 
And we launched a series of new inclusion-related initiatives, to educate our team members across the organization and continue to foster a respectful and inclusive workplace.  
Turning now to our fourth quarter results. Both our revenues and adjusted EBITDA were trending ahead of forecast before COVID-19-related closures in Illinois, Michigan and Pennsylvania and increased restrictions in Ohio and Massachusetts amongst a few other states began in mid-November. 
While revenues contracted 23% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA declined by only 9% for the same period, reflecting structural changes that we -- that were put in place with the onset of the pandemic. 
These adjustments to our core business helped to expand adjusted EBITDA margins by 580 basis points relative to Q4 '19 results despite the aforementioned headwinds, helped by an improvement of 720 basis points in the South segment, which was least affected by the COVID-19 restrictions despite the impact of Hurricane Laura in the fourth quarter in Lake Charles. 
We remain convinced that these structural changes to our business will result in meaningful EBITDAR growth once volumes return to pre-pandemic levels.  
Trends in January, thus far, are very encouraging, which Todd can provide more color on during our Q&A session. In fact, this past weekend, we saw our highest Friday, Saturday combined slot volumes across our company portfolio of properties since the first quarter of 2020. 
Our South segment has continued to be particularly strong with January revenues, the highest we have seen in the month of January in the last 5 years on a same-store basis, leading to exceptional flow through to EBITDA.  
We are continuing to see encouraging growth in the younger demographic tiers of our database, and we believe the rollout of COVID vaccinations and treatments will encourage more guests in all age segments of our database to return to our land-based facilities. 
When they do, they'll soon be met with the 3Cs: our new cashless, cardless and contactless technology, which will improve efficiency and provide a guest experience in line with other industries historically frequented by younger demographics, which we expect also to drive further incremental revenue for us.  
We're planning to launch the 3Cs at our Pennsylvania casinos in the first half of '21 subject to regulatory approval, and we'll continue that rollout for the remainder of 2021 to other regions.  
I'm sure Felicia would also want you to know that our cash balance stood at a healthy $1.9 billion at quarter end, even after paying down $115 million of our Term loan B. 
In turn, our net traditional debt decreased to approximately $578 million at December 31, 2020, bringing our lease-adjusted net leverage to 4.7% based on 2019 adjusted EBITDAR compared to 5.7% at the end of 2019. 
Some of you may have also noticed in our financial statements that we recorded a sizable unrealized gain related to our equity positions in PointsBet and the score, which were received as part of our market access skin agreements. 
This is just an example of the significant value we think we will realize over the next several years from our portfolio of leading market access partners.  
Other highlights from the fourth quarter include the continued momentum we're seeing for our Barstool Sportsbook app in Pennsylvania, strong retention, CRM efforts and creative promotions including our matching of first-time deposits with donations to the Barstool fund to support small businesses throughout the state, have led to an increased handle and market share. And most importantly, highlight our unique and unmatched approach to efficient customer acquisition.  
More recently, on January 22, we introduced our Barstool Sportsbook Mobile app in Michigan to very strong demand. Dave Portnoy, as many of you know, went to the University of Michigan, and he and Big Cat have a very loyal fan base there. 
They've been hanging out at our Greentown property in Detroit, generating a lot of excitement and awareness, not just for our Barstool Mobile Sportsbook and fully integrated iCasino, which we launched on Monday, but also our retail Barstool Sportsbook in the Greentown Casino in general, which really highlights the power of our differentiated omnichannel strategy. We think this strategy is shared to only gain steam in a post-COVID environment.  
Importantly, Michigan's launched weekend had 68% more first time depositors than Pennsylvania's initial weekend. 
And the daily active users were nearly 2/3 higher than the average daily active users in Pennsylvania during 2020. All the more impressive when you consider the state of Michigan's population is only a little over 70% that of Pennsylvania. 
Also worth noting the attention and excitement from the Michigan launch has created a halo or spillover effect. And the publicity surrounding our Michigan launch helped our registrations and daily active users climb in Pennsylvania as well. 
We are just beginning to scale, but we are excited to see the early benefits from being live in our second state.  
Our next to launch state will be in Illinois, where we plan to go live prior to March madness, pending regulatory approval, of course. And from there, we'll continue to roll out in new states every 3 to 5 weeks or so until we're operational in 10 or more states by the end of 2021.  
We achieved another milestone in Michigan with the launch of our Barstool-branded iCasino product on February 1. Although it's obviously early, we have been extremely pleased with the initial results as nearly 15% or as of this morning, over 15% now of our Michigan Sportsbook customers placed a wager on the Barstool iCasino during its first 2 days of operation. 
And average daily users exceeded our more mature Hollywood-branded iCasino product in Pennsylvania by more than 70% over the same 2-day period.  
Finally, we have now fully implemented our industry-leading mychoice reward program across all of our properties and our online channels. 
This program of over 20 million members connects our land-based casinos to our sports betting and iCasino products, offering players a wide range of compelling incentives to consolidate play across our various platforms. 
Our mychoice player affinity program has become even more compelling as we recently announced a strategic partnership with Choice Hotels that provides for yet even more earning and redemption options for our most valued and loyal guests as well as an additional funnel to fill our nearly 10,000 hotel rooms across the enterprise.  
Looking forward, we're anticipating an exciting new year as we continue to introduce Barstool-branded retail and mobile sports books across our portfolio, including brand-new builds at our 2 properties opening in Pennsylvania during the second half of '21. 
We have already seen very strong results from our retail sportsbooks, with our Indiana properties seeing meaningful increases in both gaming and non-gaming revenues following their rebranding at Barstool Sportsbooks. 
We are incredibly optimistic about the opportunities to unlock further upside as we introduce additional Barstool Sportsbook and sportsbars across the portfolio.  
In the meantime, on the legislative front, we're focused on the enabling legislation for voter-approved sports betting laws in Louisiana and Maryland, and we're aggressively lobbying in 2021 for new opportunities for sports betting in Ohio, New York, Texas, Massachusetts and Missouri, among others. 
We believe our industry-best geographic footprint, combined with the work we have done over the past year, has set the stage for a very exciting '21. And with that, I'd like to ask Frank for you to please turn it over to the line of questions."

When you look at the broad overall trends there, how does that factor into your thinking on how you're going to market and promote and acquire customers? 
How is your thinking evolve maybe over the last, I don't know, year or so that you've seen more experience? And then how does that translate into what you're doing in Michigan and thus far in Pennsylvania, which I know both markets are kind of early days. 
And then when you think about the initial performance in Michigan outperforming Pennsylvania, is it really just a function that Michigan is sort of a jump ball market for everybody and so therefore, you're a little bit more on an even playing field. 
And so therefore, share momentum is a little bit stronger. But I'd love to hear your thoughts on all these things."

And the answer to the second question around the differences between Michigan and PA, I would point to that as the primary reason. 
We've been pointing to Michigan for, I don't know, 6 months now, ever since we knew that Michigan was a state that was going to be ready to go sometime in the late fourth quarter or early first quarter. 
Because any other state that we could launch in out of the gate like Pennsylvania, you're playing catch-up. We launched in Pennsylvania, I think it was 14 or 15 months after sports betting had gone live on a -- from a mobile standpoint. 
So Michigan, for us is a great proving ground. We're at the starting gate at the same time. The gun goes off, and we're not playing catch-up. We can get out of the starting gate the same way that everybody else can. But of course, we definitely do things different. 
We have this amazing partnership and this fully integrated media strategy with what is the most compelling and fastest-growing sports and lifestyle media company on the Internet. 
So you look at the popularity of Barstool where it was when we announced our investment in Barstool, one year ago to where it is today. And it's been so robust. It's beyond anything that any of us could have ever expected. 
And so we're in this really great position, Joe, where I think it's well documented that this is kind of tying into your first question, customer acquisition costs. 
It's -- I think most analysts have done a good job researching this and it's anywhere from $300 to $800 per customer for the space, right? 
What I would tell you is that for Penn, so far in the first 4 months in PA, despite all of the Barstool fund matching that we've done as well as in Michigan in our first month, we are well below the bottom end of that range. 
We have so much room for -- we have so much cushion to be opportunistic and figure out what we want to do and how we want to do it. And so we're starting to test some paid media, paid advertising in PA, in Michigan. 
We're just dabbling. We're happy with the early returns, but we're in this great spot where we think we can generate meaningful market share and profitability just relying on that Barstool media partnership. 
And then anything else we do above and beyond there is for us just to continue to grow our share and do it in a way that delivers a nice return on investment. And I think that's a very different strategy than everybody else in the space."

Well, you are correct in all of your assumptions there around what sort of packed into that other category. 
And we will at the right time, I would anticipate probably before the end of this year, this calendar year, start to report PI out separately. 
We're not ready to do that yet, but you should assume that what drove the other results is everything associated with Penn Interactive and what comes with that. 
We had an amazing quarter. And that's with doing -- we've done everything that we intended to do from a marketing standpoint in the fourth quarter. We haven't held back. 
We're is at the point now where it's what else do we want to do because our customer acquisition costs are so much lower than everyone else's, we can really be thoughtful around what we do, how we do it, when we do it. 
And we've got partners that are just in no shortage of ideas all the time. I don't know if how many of you guys saw, but for example, one of the things that we're doing this weekend around the Super Bowl bit, I just don't know our competitors can do this because our media partners and their following is so compelling and so loyal. 
But Dave set up to where he's got 5 personalities at Barstool, and there's a contest throughout the day in the Super Bowl betting on the game throughout the game. 
And whoever ends up with winning the most money, if you bet $100 on our app on any bet on the Super Bowl, you get randomly assigned to one of these 5 personalities. 
And if your personality ends up at the Super Bowl with the most money, you get $1,000 dropped into your account. 
It's just -- those are ideas that no one else really maybe has thought of, but more importantly, they don't have the people and the following within their media partnerships that would even make a difference in doing something like that. 
And that's something that we're so excited about because we've got this list of dozens of ideas and we're just prioritizing which ones make the most sense, which ones are Dave and Big Cat and the team at Barstool most excited about because you sense when they've got a great idea, just how much energy they throw at it. 
And so yes, we think we're in a really good position. And I think that what you see in that other line, Shaun, is that you're seeing really early on profitability. 
I'm not telling you that you should expect that every quarter because we may decide that as we launch, we want to be more aggressive in some of the things that we're learning on the paid media side. 
But as of right now, we're spending on the things that we know move the needle, and we're still able to look at our P&L and be really, really impressed."

And what you can do to maybe further drive and empower the brand? How should we think about kind of upstart and launch costs as we start to accelerate some of these new markets? 
Because I mean, you've done all this. You were, I guess, implied profitable in the quarter, and you were undoubtedly ready to ramp and ready to roll for getting going in Michigan, which is a huge launch for you. 
So I mean, it's impressive and we're trying to think about how do we extrapolate these numbers of this trend line going forward?"

I'm not sure that, that's really what our #1 priority is. Right now, we're trying to grow the funnel and really focus on as much on new customers, acquisition, first-time depositors as possible in all of these markets. 
And what's interesting is that even as aggressive as we were in the way that we are aggressive, and we matched over $3 million in Michigan in the first weekend on first-time deposits and wagers. 
And I sit back, and I look at our customer acquisition cost for the Michigan launch, and it's still less than $200, right? 
So we have a lot of flexibility here in terms of what we want to do and how we want to do it. I would assume that 2021 maybe as sort of breakeven-ish on the interactive side. 
But we clearly have a path to ramping up profitability faster than anybody else, and I would expect to start to see that really ring through in 2022 and beyond from there."

So you can imagine as you scale this thing to 10 states, 11 states, 12 states, which is where we plan to be by the end of '21, you have all that much more dry powder to spend on growing the funnel and widening that funnel of acquisition.

We're really happy with what we saw on the returns on that. But I think most of what you're going to see us do is just going to be around the fully integrated media strategy or strategies.

I don't want to be on record of predicting what the first 10 days in Michigan came to. I think there's already some numbers out there that people are tracking with related to geo-comply and the number of pings and things of that nature. 
I would just say that I think you have to look at Michigan, even with regard to pings differently than you have any other state launch because Michigan is the only state to date in the U.S. that went live on the same-day with both sports betting and online casino. 
And so you should expect that the number of pings relative to other state launches was going to be higher in Michigan. We just -- none of us know how many of those were specifically for downloading and betting on sports betting versus downloading and bedding on the online casino. 
What I would -- I think we did, in our slides, if you look -- look through those, we tried to do a good comparison of the first weekend and then the first 10 days in Michigan versus Pennsylvania. 
We all know what our market share has looked like in Pennsylvania from a handle standpoint in that 12% to 13% range and really ending the year in December with our best month-to-date. 
And you look across the board in the Michigan metrics, whether you're looking at downloads, registration, first time deposit, daily active users, number of wagers per day or wagers per day, it -- was all significantly higher in Michigan than it was in the state of Pennsylvania. 
And back to one of the other questions, I think it is being at the starting gate, at the same time, makes a huge difference. We're not trying to convince sports betters to leave the app they've been betting on and download our app, that's the challenge that you run into when you're launching later than everybody else. 
This was -- it's fair game. Today is the first day and download Barstool, and I think we're seeing really good results out of the gate."

And some months, you get lucky and you hold well. And sometimes you don't. I think that for us, in PA, is we're continuing to build relationships with really good VIPs. 
And we're continuing to see more and more traction with the Barstool exclusive bets, and many of those are parlay bets, which tend to hold better, but are a lot of fun. 
We had -- just to give you a quick stat, during AFC NFC championship weekends, when we launched in Michigan, between Michigan and Pennsylvania, we had 11,000 betters that on the Can't Lose Parlay with Big Cat to get the free hat, right? 
So it just -- I think it speaks to sort of what might drive over the long term, that whole percentage. I wouldn't overly read into December. I don't think you should expect 20% of us every month. 
Maybe we end up above average over the long term. But I would also remind everyone, we lost money in the first month we launched in September. So it does go both ways and VIP play and how people do on parlays can really move that number significantly from 1 month to the next."

We weren't the first to announce a media partnership, but I think when we got to announcing it, we're really proud of the one that we put together and how it was structured and how both sides were incentivized. 
And so we're not going to chase something because of what you read yesterday about what somebody else did. I would tell you that we're maniacal about improving our strategy for the long term. 
And yes, we're very interested in figuring out how we can widen the funnel from an acquisition standpoint, whether that's through media partnerships or social media influencer partnerships. 
There's all sorts of things that we know we can do. We've just recently announced that we have relationships with Nick Merck, who's a video gamer in Michigan on an influencer basis. We just announced that we now have a partnership with an influencer Logan Paul, which we're really excited about, that's just going to get going. 
And obviously, the more we scale, the more impactful that will be because the national influencer. So we're doing things. We don't necessarily do huge splash announcements about some of the things that we do. 
But the things that we're doing, we know are delivering great returns, and we're going to continue to be really aggressive in terms of thinking through what might be next."

There's some differences between what the governor has said and what leading lawmakers want to do. And so we're staying close to that. 
The nice thing about where we find ourselves today, Barry, is that we've got a terrific balance sheet, sitting on almost $2 billion in cash. We have -- we've delivered and we're delivering now in our second state in terms of being a major player in online sports betting. 
And we have this great footprint in all of these skins, and we still have lots of excess skin. So as we think about how to get access to a state or how we want to think about a partnership and M&A, New York is a great example. 
We can acquire our way into access. We can partner our way into access and we can barter our way into access because of our excess skins. 
So we've got a lot of flexibility in that where we've got a lot of conversations that are warm right now, and we'll be hopefully announcing soon some of the things that we're currently working on with regard to access. 
And M&A, we're looking at all sorts of adjacencies because you just don't know how this is all going to come together in the out years. 
There's going to continue to be, we believe, a lot of industry convergence between gaming, sports betting, media and tech and potentially video gaming, e-sports. There's a lot out there to consider. 
And Chris Rogers and others on our team are very busy continuing to look at what all the potential options are for us to consider.

I mean, Virginia has been kind of weak -- there's been operators' kind of going live every 5 days or 7 days, and we're cautiously optimistic we'll be in that queue somewhere. 
They haven't announced all of their licenses up to this point. So for us, it was a pretty easy decision because you have to plan these things out. 
You can't just wake up one day and say, well, let's do that state tomorrow. You've got to work with the regulators. And every state has different controls and regulations and rules around betting on college versus not, betting on local teams versus not, what sports. 
And so you have to build these things out. Now Illinois for us is going to be, we think, an amazing state. Right behind Boston, there's no city in the country where Barstool's bigger than in Chicago. 
And so Big Cats from there. We've got a great following on the Barstool side. We have 3 casinos in the state. And for us, Illinois was a no-brainer. 
We want to be live before March Madness. We're cautiously optimistic. We'll be able to make that happen. We're just working with the regulators on dates. 
And after that, it's going to be a mad rush to get as many live as possible before football season that you -- from a pure sports viewing perspective of what's live, it's not all that exciting over June, July and August. But it's all about being prepared for September when college and NFL football kicks back in. 
So you should expect the Indianas and the New Jerseys. And when we say New Jersey, both sports betting and online casino, given that we just did both in Michigan successfully, we'll be ready to do both in New Jersey when we go live there. 
Colorado, Virginia, West Virginia, Iowa, Tennessee, I think that's probably the lineup there. And we're in a spot where we've got an opportunity depending on what happens and how fast Maryland moves and Louisiana move, if legislation gets going in Ohio, Massachusetts. 
We have a lot of flexibility on the second half of the year to continue to swap things in and out. And we think the bigger the state population and the bigger the Barstool brand in the state are really big factors for us. 
And of course, being at the starting gate is probably going to be factor number one. So if we can be at the starting gate, then that's probably going to move up from a prioritization standpoint."

There was a little bit of a pocket in that March, April, like every other company in the U.S. and probably the world for that matter was like, what's going to happen. 
And you saw some pullback on advertising spend, but really from May through the end of the year, every category, very strong. And this is something that I actually don't think gets enough attention. I actually appreciate you asking the question, Stephen, because we are going to own the majority, if not all of Barstool at the third anniversary, which is only 2 years away. 
And you look at how -- there's been some really interesting transactions in the podcast space, sports media. 
We got a call the other day about a tiny little sports media company and the asking price compared to what we're going to end up paying for potentially all of Barstool makes me feel really good about the value of Barstool. 
And it's interesting, too. We talked about this with Dave and Erika and Dan a few times that Barstool Sports, by itself, was probably worth X and had the potential to get to Y sort of if they stayed on a stand-alone basis. 
And Penn maybe was worth A and had potential to get to B but then you put the 2 companies to be together and it became exponential in terms of what the platform that each provided for one another and the exposure and access to different customer bases. 
And they now have everybody on the Wall Street following them, and we have everybody -- not everybody, but so many in that 21 to 40-year-old age group following us and wearing Penn gear. 
So it's -- there's so much synergy. The companies were very complementary for one another. And I think that value, again, without getting into too much detail, and I'm sure Erika will share whatever she's comfortable sharing at conferences, that value is only going to continue to grow given all of the great things that they've done and how they've proven to be just so agile. 
I mean, who would have thought that Davey Day Trader would be a thing, let alone a huge thing, and unboxing promotions would have millions of viewers every night and live streams have them playing digital Blackjack would garner so much attention. 
But there's -- I say it all the time, you're probably sick of hearing me saying they're marketing geniuses, and we're really thrilled to be partnered with them and thrilled to be the future owners of that brand."

February, as Jay spoke to, Friday and Saturday, where the best volumes we've seen from a slot standpoint since Q1 of last year. And even from a table standpoint, it was the second best Friday, Saturday we've seen. 
So then the storm wiped out much of that in the Northeast. So I think if we look at where February is trending now and we can stay close and then there's potential upside for March, so to be safe, I would say it's somewhere between, but there is upside potential there."

So yes, we're -- we've sort of pegged the 10 states that we know we can be live in. It's in our control. And that we want to be live in. The big question would be what happens, and this would be a good problem to have. 
What happens if Massachusetts, Missouri, Kansas, name your state, Ohio, Texas, if one of those legalize and can be ready by football season, then we're going to be figuring that out because we want to be at the starting gate. 
So being at the starting gate is really important. Size of population -- or population size of the state, popularity of Barstool in that given state. Those are all factors for us. But you're right in that you can't just snap your fingers and be live in every state tomorrow because you have you have a unique bespoke app in every one of these states that has to deliver on what the regulators want and what the rules are and what games you can bet on and all that. 
And some of that just takes a little bit of time. So I think what you should expect is that the cadence from here on out through the rest of the year is going to be much more rapid than what you saw from state 1 to state 2."

Here with me in why I'm missing for her first official 10 earnings call, at least on this side is our new CFO, Felicia Hendrix. So welcome, Felicia. We also have Todd George, our Head of Operations, here to help answer questions about our core business as well as other members of my executive team, who can help respond to your follow-up questions as needed. As you can see from our earnings release, our core business results are very strong and still ramping actually as we sit here in the second quarter. Meanwhile, our new online and retail Barstool Sportsbooks and iCasino offerings in Michigan and Pennsylvania, continue to perform very well. 
Further, we managed to fully integrate our industry-leading mychoice player loyalty program across all of our retail and digital offerings in time to take advantage of this momentum, which has significantly bolstered our unique omnichannel strategy and competitive advantages. At our land-based operations, the momentum has continued following the rollout of vaccines and the ongoing relaxation of COVID-19-related restrictions across the country. Our record first quarter results highlight the robust recovery in our land-based business. Benefiting from many actions taken in 2020, we generated adjusted EBITDAR growth of 7% on a revenue decline of 6% over 1Q '19, despite COVID-related property closures in January at a handful of our Midwest and Northeast properties, nearly a full closure of Zia Park in New Mexico and some harsh winter weather in the South in February. More impressive is our performance in March and April, which reflects the additional easing of restrictions and an increase in the percentage of people vaccinated. Revenues grew 8% over the same 2-month period in 2019, while adjusted EBITDAR accelerated 29% to $410 million and EBITDAR margins increased 650 basis points to nearly 40%. 
We also note that spend per visit is much higher than it was pre-COVID. In fact, our visitation is now at or near 2019 levels in most of our markets. Importantly, the younger demographic continues to view gaming as a compelling entertainment option, while the 55 and over age group has been steadily returning to our casinos. We illustrate this point in our slide deck on Page 7, where you can see that our 55 plus age segment continues to gain momentum, particularly in April, while growth from our younger age segments, 21 to 44 has accelerated since the beginning of the year. 
Further, unrated play is demonstrating unprecedented growth, which has provided us with the opportunity to convert these players to our mychoice loyalty program through new member programs and incentives. Our rated play trends continue to accelerate. This strong top line demand, coupled with the structural changes we put in place at the start of the pandemic has resulted in remarkable and sustainable margin improvement even as our interactive business continues to scale. 
As it relates to our partners at Barstool Sports, they've been able to maintain their incredible momentum from 2020 into the new Year with strong financial performance in audience growth. Barstool's promotion of Penn National's retail sports books has driven significant awareness and visitation to our land-based properties. This is especially true of those properties that have introduced Barstool branded sports books, and we plan to open 6 more of them by the end of this year. In addition, progress continues on the development of several stand-alone Barstool branded sports bar locations. We're really excited about these projects, and we're providing much more information along with our partners at Barstool in the next couple of months. 
On March 11, we successfully launched the Barstow Sportsbook app in Illinois ahead of the 2021 NCAA basketball tournament and just ahead of the return, thank goodness for us on timing of the in-person registration requirement in the state. The initial results for the first 30 days of operations exceeded our expectations, thanks in large part to the loyal following of stoolies in the Chicago land area with better first time deposit conversions relative to what we had generated in Pennsylvania or Michigan. 
During this period, we registered 54,700 new customers and generated total handle and gaming revenue of [indiscernible] [Audio Gap] The power of Barstool's social media reach was on full display upon the reinstatement of the in-person registration requirement in Illinois as they were able to help us drive an incredible 20,000 registrations during just a 36-hour period. Meanwhile, Batstool's creative promotions, exclusive bets, custom parlays, have led to a leading position in Pennsylvania and Michigan based on handle, GGR and NGR, life-to-date market share, despite limited external marketing spend. 
We expect our low customer acquisition costs, strong retention rates, unique promotions, exclusive betting features and high adoption among casual betters will drive outsized profitability over the long term. We continue to over-index a bit on GGR and NGR as compared to handle, and we anticipate this continuing to be a trend in the aggregate over the long term. The power of our mychoice customer base, combined with the fierce loyalty of Barstool's audience, has allowed us to successfully cross-sell our online offerings. In Michigan, for example, over 50% of our online sports betting monthly uniques, placed a wager on our iCasino product during the month of March, which was above our initial expectations. 
As we highlight on Slide 17, our experience in Michigan has shown that a customer's value increases significantly when they play on multiple channels, which highlights the benefits of our 100% owned and controlled omnichannel strategy. With the introduction of online gaming, we've been able to generate twice as much combined revenue as we have traditionally generated at Greektown by engaging with consumers on our digital products in addition to the physical property. 
We are really excited about yesterday's launch of the Barstow iCasino product in Pennsylvania, which we believe will greatly expand our penetration in aggregate revenue in the state, particularly in the Philadelphia MSA, where we currently do not have a land-based presence. Although we are pleased with the initial results of our first-generation Barstool iCasino product, we are really just scratching the surface of our potential in this space. Over the next few months, we will be adding significantly more third-party content to our Barstool Sportsbook app, which will increase -- help increase conversion of our mychoice database in both Michigan and Pennsylvania. 
In addition, we recently acquired Hit Point Studios, which will serve as the centerpiece of our newly formed Penn Game Studios and allow us to create customized Barstool themes as well as Casino-branded content that we believe will lead to an even greater cross-sell opportunities. 
Before I hand it over to Felicia for a summary of our first quarter results and a review of our financials, I want to call special attention to the continued strides we're making on the ESG front. As you know, this is a topic that's very personal to me, and I know our Board of Directors and my executive team share my same level of commitment and enthusiasm on taking care of our people, our host communities and our planet. Highlights from this quarter include the launch of a new $1 million annual diversity scholarship program. We're looking forward to providing up to 65,  2 and 4-year scholarships this year to the children of our team members, which reflects our commitment to equity in post secondary education. 
In addition, we implemented a supplier diversity initiative with the goal of developing new opportunities for minority-owned businesses. And last month, we hosted company-wide days of learning, days of listening, excuse me, to gather feedback from our team members on all matters of diversity and inclusion. Finally, on May 15, which is Armed Forces Day, we'll be launching a new initiative to honor our active duty military, veterans and first responders. 
We're calling it the My Heroes program, which is an exclusive fully integrated extension of our mychoice rewards program, and it's to provide our nation's heroes, access to exclusive discounts and offers at all of our properties across the country. With that, I'll pause and turn it over to Felicia."

Over the past few months, I've been asked by many of you what the biggest surprise was for me once I joined Penn. Having covered the company for over 20 years, I would say that there were more pleasant discoveries than surprises and 3 stand out. The first is the depth of the bench across the entire company. The level of talent, creativity and commitment to excellence that Penn is seen in every aspect of the company and at every level. The second is transparency. Jay's commitment to transparent communication is well-known and respected by the investment community and that ethos is no different internally. 
And finally, Penn's commitments to diversity and inclusion and community service is certainly inspiring. So with that being said, we're very proud of our first quarter results, especially given COVID-related closures in January and the late in the quarter reopening of Zia Park. Revenues of $1.27 billion and adjusted EBITDAR of $447 million after corporate overhead of $24 million, which, as you know, is reported in the other segment, represented 94% of 2019 revenues and 107% of 2019 EBITDA pro forma for a full quarter of Greektown, which is above our previously stated goals. 
Pro forma margins increased 434 basis points. Adjusting for the COVID-related closures and excluding Penn Interactive, our EBITDAR flow-through was even more impressive as our adjusted EBITDAR increased 12% compared to the first quarter of '19 on a 9% decline in revenues. On this adjusted basis, pro forma EBITDA margins increased more than 700 basis points. Our Midwest and South regions reported record EBITDAR and margins in the quarter despite COVID-related closures in January and uncharacteristically harsh weather in the South in February. 
Our performance in the South segment was particularly noteworthy as the region generated margin improvement of 1,100 basis points compared to the same period in the first quarter of '19. While cost savings, efficiencies and irrational marketing and promotional environment certainly benefited results, the less restricted COVID protocols drove revenue growth as compared to the first quarter of '19, which bodes well for the remainder of our portfolio as regions continue to reduce restrictions and open back up. 
Last week, for example, Mississippi removed all mandatory restrictions in the state. In the Midwest, adjusting for our property closures in the first quarter, that segment also reported an impressive EBITDA margin gain of nearly 900 basis points despite competitively unfavorable COVID restrictions in certain markets. Our balance sheet remains a key strength for us. Total liquidity as of March 31, 2021, was $2.7 billion, consisting of over $2 billion in cash and a fully undrawn revolver. 
Traditional net debt was $353 million compared to $578 million as of 12/31/2020. Our lease-adjusted net leverage was 4.5x based on 2019 adjusted EBITDA. CapEx in the quarter was $25.7 million, of which $9.1 million pertains to our Hollywood York project that we expect to open in August. And $1.7 million for our Hollywood Casino Morgantown development that we plan to open by the end of the year. Despite the ramp in vaccine distribution, the U.S. remains in a pandemic, which creates uncertainty. As such, we will continue our pause on providing guidance, which we will reevaluate quarter-to-quarter. I'll now turn it back to Jay."

So we're going to be in a much different position by the time we get to football season '21 versus where we were in September of '20. 
Some of the learnings that come to mind. We know that based on our differentiated approach and our fully integrated media partnership with Barstool, we have the best CPAs in the industry, and it's not even close. Our CPAs are running well under $100 right now across all 3 states that we operate in, which sets you up so well for the long-term as it relates to having dry powder and we're going to be a lot more aggressive in terms of spending to acquire customers as we head into football season '21 than we were in football season '20 because we now have scale. 
We were launching in 1 state. A year ago, football season start in September. And this year, we're going to be in 8 states. So we're going to take advantage of that great margin profile that we have. I think sometimes it gets lost with all the noise, the old, the focus right now is on monthly handle. And I think the focus should be much more focused on what is the real strategic differentiation between these approaches? What does that margin profile look like in the short term, medium-term and long term? 
We scaled our business. We have hundreds of people in Penn Interactive and we're live in 3 states. And you look at our Q1 results and we generated obviously nice revenue growth and interactive from Q4 to Q1, and we broke even. Nobody else can say that. And I'm not saying that we're going to break even every quarter. It's going to be quarter-to-quarter. And certainly, we're going to be opportunistic as it relates to what we want to do, especially come football season in terms of spending more money to drive more acquisition. So TBD, but the fact that we're alive in 3 states and have ramped up our staff the way that we have and all the expenses that come with launching in states, and you can still break even in an entire quarter when every other major competitor is burning hundreds of millions of dollars, I think, said a lot. 
We have a very different customer mix. If you look at the online offerings, our customer mix is a lot younger. The lion's share of our audience is 21 to 27 years old. I think that bodes really well for the future prospects of Penn, both online as well as in our brick-and-mortar casinos. 
I highlighted earlier some of the success that Barstool branded retail sports books, you see what it's doing, not just in terms of driving market share as it relates to the retail sports book, where Indiana, as an example, we have the top 2 retail sports books in the states, but we're also picking up casino market share. And so just bringing in all of these younger customers, we provided a slide that shows age segment growth, and we're really thrilled about what we see there. 
One of the things that we've obviously learned as well is that we have a very differentiated approach as it relates to unique promotions and content and the way that we engage and focus on retention is different than others in the space, and I think that's great for us long term. We've done a lot of work at Penn, looking at the U.K. model because it's been around for a long time. And you look at what Sky Bet was able to do from kind of 2008, 2010 that range to where they are today. And they had a very differentiated approach. That probably wasn't as appreciated in the early days as it turned out to be. 
And I think that their approach and our approach are quite similar. We've spent a lot of time on that, and we're really modeling ourselves on Sky Bet and what they were able to do over time. In the U.K. and that approach was being different. And then last but not least, we're very focused on product improvement and our tech stack. I think we have 2 really good B2B partners in Kambi and White Hat Gaming. I don't envy B2B businesses. It's always tough because you don't own it, but you hear about every problem that ever comes up. And I think there are certain aspects of our tech stack that we definitely want to have more control over over the long term. 
That doesn't mean something is imminent. It just means that we're learning a lot as we're still in the infancy, and there are certain things that make more sense to have control and ownership of, especially as it relates to anything that touches the end user. And we're very active right now. Part of why you see the growth in corporate expense from Q4 to Q1 is that I've got Chris Rogers and our business development folks, really busy looking at potential opportunities as it relates to M&A, in partnerships and we also, of course, I guess, as it relates to the corporate overhead growth from Q4 to Q1. 
We're very busy lobbying right now in states like New York and Florida to make sure that we have an opportunity to operate when all is said and done and the dust settles. So I think at a high level, Joe, it's kind of a simple question with a long answer, but we have a differentiated approach. I think it's going to really prove out here as time goes and the fact that we're able to have low-teen market share in the states that we've launched in, and we're not losing money, and we're still scaling the business, I think, bodes really well for the future."

We're looking at all right now. There could potentially be something that's international that comes along with that technology approach that could be compelling over the long term. And we're going to continue to look at if there's any other potential sort of widening, broadening of the funnel opportunities as it relates to acquisition, the Barstool partnership has paid in spades for us. And I think there's some other potential media organizations and offerings that could make a lot of sense if connected to us with what we're doing and just make that moat that we've built a little wider and a little deeper. 
So we're actively kicking tires on a lot of things. I think you should expect us to be relatively active this year heading into next year."

And I just -- I also don't think it's something that the investment community is thinking enough about. And currently, that's the power of our operating leverage and our market-leading levels of free cash flow conversion, which is only going to get stronger as we grow revenues and EBITDA. So if you think about it, based on our minimal and stable cash needs today, as increasing revenue drives higher EBITDA, our free cash flow should grow even faster, and that further bolsters our balance sheet puts us in even stronger position to both reinvest in our business and then to pursue the strategic growth opportunities that Jay just talked about."

I think there are for us on orthodox, but really effective ways. We talked about the Barstool-branded sports books in the casino. We talked about stand-alone sports bars in key markets. TBD, we're going to have more to share on that very soon. Investing at Barstool and new talents, potentially new verticals and potential media partnerships and/or acquisitions, I think we're going to be more aggressive in how we think about locking up more influencers and affiliates. 
And I think there's some sponsorship and partnership opportunities out there that can make a lot of sense for us as it relates to both digital and our core business. That's the nice thing about having this omnichannel approach where you control and own 100% of it because we just want to get people into the ecosystem. And so you can invest in your core business, you can invest in stand-alone on-prem, you can invest in digital media. And as long as it widens the funnel and brings more people into the ecosystem. We just want to keep them there, and we're confident we're going to be able to drive really healthy margins in all aspects of our business. So we really don't care where people decide to spend the majority of their time and wallet with us. 
I would not -- Bernie, expect us to be the linear TV and radio competitor to the others. I'm in Pennsylvania this week. And when I'm here, I listen to Sports Talk radio, and I'm a sucker, so I watch the Sixers, even though they let me down every year in the playoffs. And I will tell you that every commercial is noise about sports betting. I mean, it's overwhelming. You don't even know who's advertising to you. We're not going to play in that space. I think that is very low ROI return, and I'm a big believer that, that creates 0 loyalty. 
I think you're moving promiscuous customers around who are chasing the next promo. And the switching cost, this is actually something -- I know I'm going on a bit of a tangent, Bernie, but I think it's important to bring up. Lifetime value is something that's thrown around a lot. And it's interesting because people are calculating lifetime value is if that customer is going to be loyal to you forever. This is not like switching cell phone. This is not going from your Apple phone to Android and Apple touches every element of your life. I'm stuck with Apples forever. 
I can't switch. Switching costs with sports betting apps, takes about 3 minutes. You download the app, you register, you deposit and then you gamble. And I think what's going to happen over time is that the winners that have a real strategic structural advantages and media integration and loyal audiences, whether that's some combination of a daily fantasy sports database or a casino database or a very strong following of a media asset like Barstool, I think those are the ones that are going to have sort of bulletproof market share as time goes and all of this really aggressive spend on commercials and linear, I don't think that's going to be the business that sticks around. 
I think that's going to be the business that continues to jump from app to app. So that's my perspective. But yes, we're going to be more aggressive. We finally have scale as we head into football season, but we'll be doing it in different ways."

So yes, you should anticipate Dave Portnoy, Blackjack games and big cat craps and roulette and their dealers and their players and they're interacting and talking with you, and there's all sorts of fun stuff that we have planned. And I think the other thing to keep in mind is that we launched iCasino in Michigan because we didn't want to miss out, and we want to make sure that we're giving people an opportunity to convert from sports into casino. We would be the first to say, our iCasino product is not today where it needs to be. It's a little bit bare bones. I think we have 60 different titles and slot and table games that we offer, it's like 1/5 to 1/10 of what our competitors offer, and we're going to get that ramped up. I think, by football season, this upcoming, call it, September of this year, you're going to see the Barstool iCasino is going to be not just offering more well-known content from the side games and igTs of the world, but you're going to see some content that we created ourselves through our studio. 
And I think case in point, if you heard Bet MGM talk about how much -- what percentage of their sports betting audience, they've converted over to iCasino. We're not there yet. We're at 50%. I think they're at like 70% or 80% or 90% or so. It's a very high percentage. And we need to have better content, and that's what we're working on. But yes, you should expect us to do much like on the sports betting side. We're going to do things differently and really take advantage of tapping into that loyalty that comes with the Barstool names."

And I just wanted to get your kind of thoughts on when you guys launch in some of these -- some of the new markets, you seem to do exceptionally well, given the Barstool penetration, then we tend to see things kind of level out a little bit over time just given that where you are in market versus not and probably some of the follow-through there. Just how are you kind of thinking about that pattern as it moves over time as you start to gain a little bit more scale across markets?

One, take Michigan as an example. It's Uber expensive from a marketing standpoint right now. Everybody is just -- it's a gold rush for how much you can spend to drive the more promiscuous customers around from app to app. And we're not playing in that game right now. 
And we obviously headed into football season, '21 are going to have more scale, as I mentioned earlier. And so it makes a lot more sense for us to spend more and be more aggressive when you have scale and you can work on more regional and national marketing approaches as opposed to very localized, very expensive with very little long-term ROI. So that's one. Number two, I think every market is going to be a bit different. If you look at our results in Pennsylvania, they've been remarkably consistent. We've been in that low-teen 12% to 15% market share, whether you're looking at handle GGR, NGR pretty much every month since we launched in September. 
And so you really don't see the volatility in Pennsylvania. It's been pretty much clock work. Month-to-month, for the most part. And the other thing that I would mention is that -- and I don't think this will surprise anybody, but the Barstool folks, especially when you're talking about Portnoy and Big Cat, their top sports is football. And I think that what hurt us in Michigan is we launched right at the very end of football season. 
We got basically the AFC, NFC championship weekend, a little bit in Super Bowl. And then we headed into basketball and hockey, which is going to be -- I think we're going to be competitive, but I think we're probably going to be most competitive during the September through January months because of football season. And so the drop-off in Michigan, I think you're going to see that start to self-correct as you get back into football season, especially with some more marketing spend and efforts to get it ramped up once we have more scale. 
So we're not -- I continue to go back to what matters over the long term. And I think that there seems to be an overreaction to monthly handle. And I think you need to take a step back and really look at the strategy, the margin profile, the business model and what does it look like over a period of much more than a month or 2 and let's get through another football season, give us a second full season to get through. We've learned a lot, and we're confident with where things are going to shake out."

There's stimulus money in the marketplace. There's there's a lot of things driving that as well as you acknowledge the lack of entertainment offerings. 
But I would also point to, we're seeing it across all different groups, and that's everyone from unrated all the way to the high end customers, which are more of your core gamers. Q1 and definitely March and April, the trends are even more encouraging. In the South, Mississippi as they removed really any restrictions, we're seeing volumes, visitation, handle drop well over 100% of 2019 numbers. And and similar, in Louisiana, there was a group of us last week that went to Louisiana and visited 4 of our properties in Louisiana. And it was amazing to see. It was -- there's -- in a big way, you wouldn't even realize that there was a pandemic going on. So it was really encouraging to see people out there and enjoying themselves, having a great time being at the pool, spending time at tables, dining and restaurants. 
So it was really where we see the rest of the country going. To your point on margin, in the past, we've kind of provided a framework of [ 9,100 ]. And with a goal of saying that on 90% of 2019 volumes, we could get to 100% of 2019 EBITDA, which really, when you do the math, equates to about a 350 basis margin improvement. We obviously feel that, that number is now a little conservative. This has been discussed internally, maybe more than any other performance metric coming out of the first quarter. 
I think, we all got to a point where we feel the margin performance will continue to be driven by volumes. And as we're holding on to the younger demographic, as we're seeing the 55-plus come in after vaccines, those volumes remain steady. And through the first now 5 days of May, the trend continues from April. So very optimistic, very encouraged as we move into the rest of the year."

So even though we've opened these Barstool-branded sports books, it's still with very limited capacity Black Jack games that are every other seat and slot through every other slot and bars are half shut down or entirely shut down.

But the big picture, the amount of cash flow that we see you guys being able to generate in our model. How do you think about uses of cash and deploying that cash, the different buckets? I mean, is there an opportunity to continue to grow and invest in your digital business and perhaps think about shareholder returns or dividends or pay down a little bit of debt you have?

And I sort of know what I know, just based on what we have visibility and what we hear from our competitors, Stephen, so some of this would just be speculation. But in terms of what we know ourselves is that I mentioned earlier, we know that the lion's share of the sports betters and our ecosystem are young. They're younger than 30, call it, 21 to 29. They over-index there more than what I'm hearing competitors say about where their average age is maybe more in the 30 to 35, ours is 25 as an average age. 
And the average bet size, not surprisingly, for us, is a bit lower, especially in Michigan, we're seeing there. It's -- Illinois and Pennsylvania is sort of where we thought it would be, Michigan, the average bet size has been lower. But you're seeing our hold rates in Michigan higher. And so we're getting a lot of parlay bets in Michigan, a lot of casual betting, recreational betting. And I think that's great. That's what Skybet has been doing in the U.K. for a long time. And if you look at Skybet's hold percentage over the last 7 or 8 years, they tend to over-index on hold and GGR versus handle. It's still early to say exactly how that's all going to play out for us, but based on sort of life-to-date in the states that we've been in and now including Illinois, our hold rates are higher than the competition. 
And I think that's because we have a younger, more casual better. And when you think about lifetime value, I'd rather have an average better at 25 than anything older than 25 because they're in the ecosystem. So I don't know exactly how that compares to everybody else, but just based on what I've heard, what I've read from our competitive set and then what we've seen internally, that's what I think the difference is and how we really do line up quite well to the sky that model in the U.K."

It's also very tax-efficient in a number of these markets. And as you're looking at spending hard cash on paid media that maybe is attracting a little bit more of a promiscuous customer versus investing in somebody who's already in your ecosystem. And making sure they have compelling reasons and compelling content and compelling promotions to stay within the ecosystem. We view those 2 things very differently. So CPA for us, obviously, being as low as it is, begs the question of, well, what should it be?

I think money can be made, but the tax rate, obviously, is going to be hugely important, and we'll have to see how that plays out. I would say that if anybody can sort of monetize in an environment like that, I think that we're set up better than anybody because of our low CPAs and the fact that we have such a loyal audience that we don't have to spend money attracting to get into our ecosystem. 
So I don't want a high tax rate, trust me, and I don't think a high tax rate benefits the state at all. But if it's a higher-than-average tax rate, I think that is an environment we know we can still create long-term value and profitability.

As I mentioned, it's a 3 minute transaction. So I think we all have to -- some of those illegal operators have really good products. They've had them out there for decades. 
And so we all collectively have to continue to create a really good UI/UX and make sure that we have features and functionality that are as good, if not better, than some of those offshore operators. And I think, when you pull people, AGA has done this, we've done it internally at Penn as well. And you asked people, would you prefer to bet with legal versus illegal. It's not like people want to bet a lot of we don't know. And so I think some of this over time, [indiscernible], is that an option? And I think people over time are going to realize that which ones are legal and regulated and which ones aren't. But it's not going to happen overnight. I just think what you're going to see is our ability to convert sort of gray market betters into black market, you're going to see that just continue to grow and get better over time, especially as more states legalized, we have more scale.

Here with me in Wyomissing for her first official Penn earnings call, at least on this side is our new CFO, Felicia Hendrix. So welcome, Felicia. We also have Todd George, our Head of Operations, here to help answer questions about our core business as well as other members of my executive team, who can help respond to your follow-up questions as needed. As you can see from our earnings release, our core business results are very strong and still ramping actually as we sit here in the second quarter. Meanwhile, our new online and retail Barstool Sportsbooks and iCasino offerings in Michigan and Pennsylvania, continue to perform very well. 
Further, we managed to fully integrate our industry-leading mychoice player loyalty program across all of our retail and digital offerings in time to take advantage of this momentum, which has significantly bolstered our unique omnichannel strategy and competitive advantages. 
At our land-based operations, the momentum has continued following the rollout of vaccines and the ongoing relaxation of COVID-19-related restrictions across the country. Our record first quarter results highlight the robust recovery in our land-based business. Benefiting from many actions taken in 2020, we generated adjusted EBITDAR growth of 7% on a revenue decline of 6% over 1Q '19, despite COVID-related property closures in January at a handful of our Midwest and Northeast properties, nearly a full closure of Zia Park in New Mexico and some harsh winter weather in the South in February. 
More impressive is our performance in March and April, which reflects the additional easing of restrictions and an increase in the percentage of people vaccinated. Revenues grew 8% over the same 2-month period in 2019, while adjusted EBITDAR accelerated 29% to $410 million and EBITDAR margins increased 650 basis points to nearly 40%. 
We also note that spend per visit is much higher than it was pre-COVID. In fact, our visitation is now at or near 2019 levels in most of our markets. Importantly, the younger demographic continues to view gaming as a compelling entertainment option, while the 55 and over age group has been steadily returning to our casinos. We illustrate this point in our slide deck on Page 7, where you can see that our 55 plus age segment continues to gain momentum, particularly in April, while growth from our younger age segments, 21 to 44 has accelerated since the beginning of the year. 
Further, unrated play is demonstrating unprecedented growth, which has provided us with the opportunity to convert these players to our mychoice loyalty program through new member programs and incentives. Our rated play trends continue to accelerate. This strong top line demand, coupled with the structural changes we put in place at the start of the pandemic has resulted in remarkable and sustainable margin improvement even as our interactive business continues to scale. 
As it relates to our partners at Barstool Sports, they've been able to maintain their incredible momentum from 2020 into the new year with strong financial performance in audience growth. Barstool's promotion of Penn National's retail sportsbooks has driven significant awareness and visitation to our land-based properties. This is especially true of those properties that have introduced Barstool branded sportsbooks and we plan to open 6 more of them by the end of this year. In addition, progress continues on the development of several stand-alone Barstool branded sports bar locations. We're really excited about these projects, and we're providing much more information along with our partners at Barstool in the next couple of months. 
On March 11, we successfully launched the Barstool Sportsbook app in Illinois ahead of the 2021 NCAA basketball tournament and just ahead of the return, thank goodness for us on timing of the in-person registration requirement in the state. The initial results for the first 30 days of operations exceeded our expectations, thanks in large part to the loyal following of stoolies in the Chicago land area with better first time deposit conversions relative to what we had generated in Pennsylvania or Michigan. 
During this period, we registered 54,700 new customers and generated total handle and gaming revenue of 67 
[Audio Gap] 
The power of Barstool's social media reach was on full display upon the reinstatement of the in-person registration requirement in Illinois as they were able to help us drive an incredible 20,000 registrations during just a 36-hour period. 
Meanwhile, Barstool's creative promotions, exclusive bets, custom parlays, have led to a leading position in Pennsylvania and Michigan based on handle, GGR and NGR, life-to-date market share, despite limited external marketing spend. 
We expect our low customer acquisition costs, strong retention rates, unique promotions, exclusive betting features and high adoption among casual betters will drive outsized profitability over the long term. We continue to over-index a bit on GGR and NGR as compared to handle, and we anticipate this continuing to be a trend in the aggregate over the long term. 
The power of our mychoice customer base, combined with the fierce loyalty of Barstool's audience, has allowed us to successfully cross-sell our online offerings. In Michigan, for example, over 50% of our online sports betting monthly uniques, placed a wager on our iCasino product during the month of March, which was above our initial expectations. 
As we highlight on Slide 17, our experience in Michigan has shown that a customer's value increases significantly when they play on multiple channels, which highlights the benefits of our 100% owned and controlled omnichannel strategy. With the introduction of online gaming, we've been able to generate twice as much combined revenue as we have traditionally generated at Greektown by engaging with consumers on our digital products in addition to the physical property. 
We are really excited about yesterday's launch of the Barstool iCasino product in Pennsylvania, which we believe will greatly expand our penetration and aggregate revenue in the state, particularly in the Philadelphia MSA, where we currently do not have a land-based presence. 
Although we are pleased with the initial results of our first-generation Barstool iCasino product, we are really just scratching the surface of our potential in this space. Over the next few months, we will be adding significantly more third-party content to our Barstool Sportsbook app, which will increase -- help increase conversion of our mychoice database in both Michigan and Pennsylvania. 
In addition, we recently acquired Hit Point Studios, which will serve as the centerpiece of our newly formed Penn Game Studios and allow us to create customized Barstool themes as well as casino-branded content that we believe will lead to an even greater cross-sell opportunities. 
Before I hand it over to Felicia for a summary of our first quarter results and a review of our financials, I want to call special attention to the continued strides we're making on the ESG front. As you know, this is a topic that's very personal to me, and I know our Board of Directors and my executive team share my same level of commitment and enthusiasm on taking care of our people, our host communities and our planet. Highlights from this quarter include the launch of a new $1 million annual diversity scholarship program. We're looking forward to providing up to 65, 2 and 4-year scholarships this year to the children of our team members, which reflects our commitment to equity in post secondary education. 
In addition, we implemented a supplier diversity initiative with the goal of developing new opportunities for minority-owned businesses. And last month, we hosted company-wide days of learning -- days of listening, excuse me, to gather feedback from our team members on all matters of diversity and inclusion. 
Finally, on May 15, which is Armed Forces Day, we'll be launching a new initiative to honor our active duty military, veterans and first responders. We're calling it the myheroes program, which is an exclusive fully integrated extension of our mychoice rewards program, and it's to provide our nation's heroes, access to exclusive discounts and offers at all of our properties across the country. 
With that, I'll pause and turn it over to Felicia."
335919,710686554,2273234,"Penn National Gaming, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","PENN Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jay. It's great being here and being part of this tremendously talented team. Over the past few months, I've been asked by many of you what the biggest surprise was for me once I joined Penn.

Over the past few months, I've been asked by many of you what the biggest surprise was for me once I joined Penn. Having covered the company for over 20 years, I would say that there were more pleasant discoveries than surprises and 3 stand out. The first is the depth of the bench across the entire company. The level of talent, creativity and commitment to excellence at Penn is seen in every aspect of the company and at every level. The second is transparency. Jay's commitment to transparent communication is well-known and respected by the investment community and that ethos is no different internally. And finally, Penn's commitments to diversity and inclusion and community service is certainly inspiring. 
So with that being said, we're very proud of our first quarter results, especially given COVID-related closures in January and the late in the quarter reopening of Zia Park. Revenues of $1.27 billion and adjusted EBITDAR of $447 million after corporate overhead of $24 million, which, as you know, is reported in the other segment, represented 94% of 2019 revenues and 107% of 2019 EBITDAR pro forma for a full quarter of Greektown, which is above our previously stated goals. 
Pro forma margins increased 434 basis points. Adjusting for the COVID-related closures and excluding Penn Interactive, our EBITDAR flow-through was even more impressive as our adjusted EBITDAR increased 12% compared to the first quarter of '19 on a 9% decline in revenues. On this adjusted basis, pro forma EBITDA margins increased more than 700 basis points. Our Midwest and South regions reported record EBITDAR and margins in the quarter despite COVID-related closures in January and uncharacteristically harsh weather in the South in February. 
Our performance in the South segment was particularly noteworthy as the region generated margin improvement of 1,100 basis points compared to the same period in the first quarter of '19. While cost savings, efficiencies and a rational marketing and promotional environment certainly benefited results, the less restricted COVID protocols drove revenue growth as compared to the first quarter of '19, which bodes well for the remainder of our portfolio as regions continue to reduce restrictions and open back up. 
Last week, for example, Mississippi removed all mandatory restrictions in the state. In the Midwest, adjusting for our property closures in the first quarter, that segment also reported an impressive EBITDA margin gain of nearly 900 basis points despite competitively unfavorable COVID restrictions in certain markets. Our balance sheet remains a key strength for us. Total liquidity as of March 31, 2021, was $2.7 billion, consisting of over $2 billion in cash and a fully undrawn revolver. 
Traditional net debt was $353 million compared to $578 million as of 12/31/2020. Our lease-adjusted net leverage was 4.5x based on 2019 adjusted EBITDAR. 
CapEx in the quarter was $25.7 million, of which $9.1 million pertains to our Hollywood York project that we expect to open in August. And $1.7 million for our Hollywood Casino Morgantown development that we plan to open by the end of the year. Despite the ramp in vaccine distribution, the U.S. remains in a pandemic, which creates uncertainty. As such, we will continue our pause on providing guidance, which we will reevaluate quarter-to-quarter. I'll now turn it back to Jay."

In addition to these impressive results, we had many other notable accomplishments in the quarter, including being added to the S&P 500. And just last week, Moody's upgraded our senior secured rating 1 notch and moved our outlook to stable. As I look ahead, I remain excited about really every aspect of our business. 
The recovery is well underway at our land-based casinos, as evidenced by the strong trends we saw in March, which continued into the second quarter. Meanwhile, at Barstool, they remain focused on driving top of the funnel growth. Our differentiated strategy has earned us market-leading positions in Michigan and Pennsylvania in terms of handle, GGR and NGR, and we remain on track to be live in 8 states by football season and 10 or more states before the end of this year. 
Further, we remain busy at work on a variety of growth initiatives, all with a focus on driving shareholder value well into the future.

Look, there's been a lot of learnings. We just went live, as you know, in September. And so we got through our first football season, our first March madness, and we're now live in 3 states. We're going to be live in Indiana here in a couple of weeks in time for the Indy 500 and for the NBA playoffs, which we're really excited about and total of 8 states by football season. So we're going to be in a much different position by the time we get to football season '21 versus where we were in September of '20. 
Some of the learnings that come to mind. We know that based on our differentiated approach and our fully integrated media partnership with Barstool, we have the best CPAs in the industry, and it's not even close. Our CPAs are running well under $100 right now across all 3 states that we operate in, which sets you up so well for the long-term as it relates to having dry powder and we're going to be a lot more aggressive in terms of spending to acquire customers as we head into football season '21 than we were in football season '20 because we now have scale. 
We were launching in 1 state a year ago, football season start in September. And this year, we're going to be in 8 states. So we're going to take advantage of that great margin profile that we have. I think sometimes it gets lost with all the noise. I think all the focus right now is on monthly handle. And I think the focus should be much more focused on what is the real strategic differentiation between these approaches? What does that margin profile look like in the short term, medium-term and long term? 
We scaled our business. We have hundreds of people in Penn Interactive and we're live in 3 states. And you look at our Q1 results and we generated obviously nice revenue growth in Interactive from Q4 to Q1, and we broke even. Nobody else can say that. And I'm not saying that we're going to break even every quarter. It's going to be quarter-to-quarter. And certainly, we're going to be opportunistic as it relates to what we want to do, especially come football season in terms of spending more money to drive more acquisition. 
So TBD, but the fact that we're alive in 3 states and have ramped up our staff the way that we have and all the expenses that come with launching in states, and you can still break even in an entire quarter when every other major competitor is burning hundreds of millions of dollars, I think, says a lot. We have a very different customer mix. If you look at the online offerings, our customer mix is a lot younger. The lion's share of our audience is 21 to 27 years old. I think that bodes really well for the future prospects of Penn, both online as well as in our brick-and-mortar casinos. 
I highlighted earlier some of the success that Barstool branded retail sportsbooks, you see what it's doing, not just in terms of driving market share as it relates to the retail sportsbook, where Indiana, as an example, we have the top 2 retail sportsbooks in the states, but we're also picking up casino market share. And so just bringing in all of these younger customers, we provided a slide that shows age segment growth, and we're really thrilled about what we see there. 
One of the things that we've obviously learned as well is that we have a very differentiated approach as it relates to unique promotions and content and the way that we engage and focus on retention is different than others in the space, and I think that's great for us long term. We've done a lot of work at Penn, looking at the U.K. model because it's been around for a long time. And you look at what Sky Bet was able to do from kind of 2008, 2010 that range to where they are today. And they had a very differentiated approach. That probably wasn't as appreciated in the early days as it turned out to be. 
And I think that their approach and our approach are quite similar. We've spent a lot of time on that, and we're really modeling ourselves on Sky Bet and what they were able to do over time in the U.K. and that approach was being different. 
And then last but not least, we're very focused on product improvement and our tech stack. I think we have 2 really good B2B partners in Kambi and White Hat Gaming. I don't envy B2B businesses. It's always tough because you don't own it, but you hear about every problem that ever comes up. And I think there are certain aspects of our tech stack that we definitely want to have more control over over the long term. That doesn't mean something is imminent. It just means that we're learning a lot as we're still in the infancy, and there are certain things that make more sense to have control and ownership of, especially as it relates to anything that touches the end user. 
And we're very active right now. Part of why you see the growth in corporate expense from Q4 to Q1 is that I've got Chris Rogers and our business development folks, really busy looking at potential opportunities as it relates to M&A, in partnerships and we also, of course -- I guess, as it relates to the corporate overhead growth from Q4 to Q1, we're very busy lobbying right now in states like New York and Florida to make sure that we have an opportunity to operate when all is said and done and the dust settles. 
So I think at a high level, Joe, it's kind of a simple question with a long answer, but we have a differentiated approach. I think it's going to really prove out here as time goes and the fact that we're able to have low-teen market share in the states that we've launched in, and we're not losing money, and we're still scaling the business, I think, bodes really well for the future."

We're looking at all right now. There could potentially be something that's international that comes along with that technology approach that could be compelling over the long term. And we're going to continue to look at if there's any other potential sort of widening, broadening of the funnel opportunities as it relates to acquisition, the Barstool partnership has paid in spades for us. And I think there's some other potential media organizations and offerings that could make a lot of sense if connected to us with what we're doing and just make that moat that we've built a little wider and a little deeper. 
So we're actively kicking tires on a lot of things. I think you should expect us to be relatively active this year heading into next year."

And I do want to comment on one other that's been really evident to me in the short time that I've been here. And I just -- I also don't think it's something that the investment community is thinking enough about. And currently, that's the power of our operating leverage and our market-leading levels of free cash flow conversion, which is only going to get stronger as we grow revenues and EBITDA. 
So if you think about it, based on our minimal and stable cash needs today, as increasing revenue drives higher EBITDA, our free cash flow should grow even faster, and that further bolsters our balance sheet and puts us in even stronger position to both reinvest in our business and then to pursue the strategic growth opportunities that Jay just talked about."

TBD, we're going to have more to share on that very soon. Investing at Barstool and new talents, potentially new verticals and potential media partnerships and/or acquisitions, I think we're going to be more aggressive in how we think about locking up more influencers and affiliates. 
And I think there's some sponsorship and partnership opportunities out there that can make a lot of sense for us as it relates to both digital and our core business. That's the nice thing about having this omnichannel approach where you control and own 100% of it because we just want to get people into the ecosystem. And so you can invest in your core business, you can invest in stand-alone on-prem, you can invest in digital media. And as long as it widens the funnel and brings more people into the ecosystem, we just want to keep them there, and we're confident we're going to be able to drive really healthy margins in all aspects of our business. So we really don't care where people decide to spend the majority of their time and wallet with us. 
I would not, Bernie, expect us to be the linear TV and radio competitor to the others. I'm in Pennsylvania this week. And when I'm here, I listen to sports talk radio, and I'm a s*****, so I watch the Sixers, even though they let me down every year in the playoffs. And I will tell you that every commercial is noise about sports betting. I mean, it's overwhelming. You don't even know who's advertising to you. We're not going to play in that space. I think that is very low ROI return, and I'm a big believer that, that creates 0 loyalty. 
I think you're moving promiscuous customers around who are chasing the next promo. And the switching cost, this is actually something -- I know I'm going on a bit of a tangent, Bernie, but I think it's important to bring up. Lifetime value is something that's thrown around a lot. And it's interesting because people are calculating lifetime value as if that customer is going to be loyal to you forever. This is not like switching cell phone. This is not going from your Apple phone to Android and Apple touches every element of your life. I'm stuck with Apple forever. 
I can't switch. Switching costs with sports betting apps, takes about 3 minutes. You download the app, you register, you deposit and then you gamble. And I think what's going to happen over time is that the winners that have real strategic structural advantages and media integration and loyal audiences, whether that's some combination of a daily fantasy sports database or a casino database or a very strong following of a media asset like Barstool, I think those are the ones that are going to have sort of bulletproof market share as time goes and all of this really aggressive spend on commercials and linear, I don't think that's going to be the business that sticks around. 
I think that's going to be the business that continues to jump from app to app. So that's my perspective. But yes, we're going to be more aggressive. We finally have scale as we head into football season, but we'll be doing it in different ways."

Well, Bernie, you could have been sitting in our boardroom as we had these conversations. And you saw late last week that we announced the formation of -- sorry, I think it was Monday, actually, the formation of Penn Studios and our acquisition of HitPoint, that's exactly what we have in mind, and we've been actually working with HitPoint while we were working on getting the deal done on developing really bespoke content with our partners at Barstool. 
So yes, you should anticipate Dave Portnoy, Blackjack games and Big Cat, craps and roulette and their dealers and their players and they're interacting and talking with you, and there's all sorts of fun stuff that we have planned. And I think the other thing to keep in mind is that we launched iCasino in Michigan because we didn't want to miss out, and we want to make sure that we're giving people an opportunity to convert from sports into casino. 
We would be the first to say, our iCasino product is not today where it needs to be. It's a little bit bare bones. I think we have 60 different titles and slot and table games that we offer, it's like 1/5 to 1/10 of what our competitors offer, and we're going to get that ramped up. I think, by football season, this upcoming, call it, September of this year, you're going to see the Barstool iCasino is going to be not just offering well-known content from the sci games and IGTs of the world, but you're going to see some content that we created ourselves through our studio. 
And I think case in point, if you heard BetMGM talk about how much -- what percentage of their sports betting audience, they've converted over to iCasino, we're not there yet. We're at 50%. I think they're at like 70% or 80% or 90% or so. It's a very high percentage. And we need to have better content, and that's what we're working on. But yes, you should expect us to do much like on the sports betting side. We're going to do things differently and really take advantage of tapping into that loyalty that comes with the Barstool name."

And I think we've all been kind of staring at some of the sequential market share patterns. 
And I just wanted to get your kind of thoughts on when you guys launch in some of these -- some of the new markets, you seem to do exceptionally well, given the Barstool penetration, then we tend to see things kind of level out a little bit over time just given that where you are in market versus not and probably some of the follow-through there. Just how are you kind of thinking about that pattern as it moves over time as you start to gain a little bit more scale across markets? And what should investors expect kind of as you look at it, what KPIs are you watching to really judge how your assets are performing?"

One, take Michigan as an example, it's Uber expensive from a marketing standpoint right now. Everybody is just -- it's a gold rush for how much you can spend to drive the more promiscuous customers around from app to app. And we're not playing in that game right now. 
And we obviously headed into football season '21 are going to have more scale, as I mentioned earlier. And so it makes a lot more sense for us to spend more and be more aggressive when you have scale and you can work on more regional and national marketing approaches as opposed to very localized, very expensive with very little long-term ROI. So that's one. Number two, I think every market is going to be a bit different. If you look at our results in Pennsylvania, they've been remarkably consistent. We've been in that low-teen 12% to 15% market share, whether you're looking at handle, GGR, NGR pretty much every month since we launched in September. 
And so you really don't see the volatility in Pennsylvania. It's been pretty much clock work month-to-month, for the most part. And the other thing that I would mention is that -- and I don't think this will surprise anybody, but the Barstool folks, especially when you're talking about Portnoy and Big Cat, their top sport is football. And I think that what hurt us in Michigan is we launched right at the very end of football season. We got basically the AFC, NFC championship weekend, a little bit in Super Bowl. And then we headed into basketball and hockey, which is going to be -- I think we're going to be competitive, but I think we're probably going to be most competitive during the September through January months because of football season. 
And so the drop-off in Michigan, I think you're going to see that start to self-correct as you get back into football season, especially with some more marketing spend and efforts to get it ramped up once we have more scale. 
So we're not -- I continue to go back to what matters over the long term. And I think that there seems to be an overreaction to monthly handle. And I think you need to take a step back and really look at the strategy, the margin profile, the business model and what does it look like over a period of much more than a month or 2 and let's get through another football season, give us a second full season to get through. We've learned a lot, and we're confident with where things are going to shake out."

I think, what investors are asking us a lot about is just trying to understand how much of what we're seeing in March and April is truly sustainable in our eyes versus a lack of entertainment options, some of the stimulus funding, possibly some sort of onetime pent-up demand. 
You guys seem to have a lot of data around that. You've broken it out by cohorts for us. So I just want to get your thoughts and if you kind of tailor it to both a little revenues and a little bit on the margin front, too, just trying to kind of get our arms around what's real and repeating versus what's onetime?"

So obviously, we're encouraged by the revenue and the EBITDA performance trends. Revenue, it's a combination of many things. There is obviously pent-up demand. There's stimulus money in the marketplace. There's a lot of things driving that as well as you acknowledge the lack of entertainment offerings. 
But I would also point to, we're seeing it across all different groups, and that's everyone from unrated all the way to the high end customers, which are more of your core gamers. Q1 and definitely March and April, the trends are even more encouraging. In the South, Mississippi as they removed really any restrictions, we're seeing volumes, visitation, handle drop well over 100% of 2019 numbers. And and similar, in Louisiana, there was a group of us last week that went to Louisiana and visited 4 of our properties in Louisiana. And it was amazing to see. It was -- there's -- in a big way, you wouldn't even realize that there was a pandemic going on. So it was really encouraging to see people out there and enjoying themselves, having a great time being at the pool, spending time at tables, dining in restaurants. 
So it was really where we see the rest of the country going. To your point on margin, in the past, we've kind of provided a framework of 9,100. And with a goal of saying that on 90% of 2019 volumes, we could get to 100% of 2019 EBITDA, which really, when you do the math, equates to about a 350 basis point margin improvement. We obviously feel that, that number is now a little conservative. This has been discussed internally, maybe more than any other performance metric coming out of the first quarter. 
I think, we all got to a point where we feel the margin performance will continue to be driven by volumes. And as we're holding on to the younger demographic, as we're seeing the 55-plus come in after vaccines, those volumes remain steady. And through the first now 5 days of May, the trend continues from April. So very optimistic, very encouraged as we move into the rest of the year."

So even though we've opened these Barstool-branded sportsbooks, it's still with very limited capacity Blackjack games that are every other seat and slot through every other slot and bars are half shut down or entirely shut down. So when you think about we're seeing early results that are very encouraging, but I get a lot more excited thinking about how much stronger those volumes can be when we can really activate the audience.

And I sort of know what I know, just based on what we have visibility and what we hear from our competitors, Stephen, so some of this would just be speculation. But in terms of what we know ourselves is that I mentioned earlier, we know that the lion's share of the sports betters and our ecosystem are young. They're younger than 30, call it, 21 to 29. They over-index there more than what I'm hearing competitors say about where their average age is maybe more in the 30 to 35, ours is 25 as an average age. 
And the average bet size, not surprisingly, for us, is a bit lower, especially in Michigan, we're seeing there. It's -- Illinois and Pennsylvania is sort of where we thought it would be, Michigan, the average bet size has been lower. But you're seeing our hold rates in Michigan higher. And so we're getting a lot of parlay bets in Michigan, a lot of casual betting, recreational betting. And I think that's great. That's what Sky Bet has been doing in the U.K. for a long time. And if you look at Sky Bet's hold percentage over the last 7 or 8 years, they tend to over-index on hold and GGR versus handle. 
It's still early to say exactly how that's all going to play out for us, but based on sort of life-to-date in the states that we've been in and now including Illinois, our hold rates are higher than the competition. And I think that's because we have a younger, more casual better. And when you think about lifetime value, I'd rather have an average better at 25 than anything older than 25 because they're in the ecosystem. So I don't know exactly how that compares to everybody else, but just based on what I've heard, what I've read from our competitive set and then what we've seen internally, that's what I think the difference is and how we really do line up quite well to the Sky Bet model in the U.K."

But I think it's going to take a little bit of time. And honestly, I think it's going to take having great content and great product.

And so that's very much focused on how much did you have to spend to get that customer to download your app and to place a bet. And I think that from our standpoint, the promotional spend is much more about retention. We are laser-focused on retention. And that's why I think you'll see us maybe spend a little bit more on promos as it relates to a percentage of GGR. 
It's also very tax-efficient in a number of these markets. And as you're looking at spending hard cash on paid media that maybe is attracting a little bit more of a promiscuous customer versus investing in somebody who's already in your ecosystem and making sure they have compelling reasons and compelling content and compelling promotions to stay within the ecosystem. We view those 2 things very differently. 
So CPA for us, obviously, being as low as it is, begs the question of, well, what should it be? I think it should be higher, but we just want to make sure that we're being thoughtful around what we spend, where we spend it and that it's going to create long-term ROI.

I would say that if anybody can sort of monetize in an environment like that, I think that we're set up better than anybody because of our low CPAs and the fact that we have such a loyal audience that we don't have to spend money attracting to get into our ecosystem.

And I think that's an industry question even more than it is a Penn question. And I think that certainly, our competitors are doing their part by advertising all day every day in the markets that are legal to make sure people understand that it is now legal and pretty easy. As I mentioned, it's a 3 minute transaction. So I think we all have to -- some of those illegal operators have really good products. They've had them out there for decades. 
And so we all collectively have to continue to create a really good UI/UX and make sure that we have features and functionality that are as good, if not better, than some of those offshore operators. And I think, when you pull people, AGA has done this, we've done it internally at Penn as well. And you ask people, would you prefer to bet with legal versus illegal. It's not like people want to bet, a lot of people don't know. And so I think some of this over time, Bovada, is that an option? And I think people over time are going to realize that which ones are legal and regulated and which ones aren't. 
But it's not going to happen overnight. I just think what you're going to see is our ability to convert sort of gray market betters into black market, you're going to see that just continue to grow and get better over time, especially as more states legalize, we have more scale. The industry has more scale and it becomes more sort of common knowledge as to where it's legal and where it's not.

Thanks for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. And I would say, more importantly, the exciting announcement of the acquisition of Score Media and Gaming. I have with me here in Wyomissing, our CFO, Felicia",1073,"Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. And I would say, more importantly, the exciting announcement of the acquisition of Score Media and Gaming. I have with me here in Wyomissing, our CFO, Felicia Hendricks, our Head of Operations, Todd George, as well as other members of my executive team. And later on, John Levy, Founder and CEO of theScore, will join me to discuss our exciting new partnership that we announced this morning. We'll also be joined a bit by Barstool founder, Dave Portnoy and Barstool Sports CEO, Eric and Nardini, to get their perspective on the deal as well. 
But first, I'll begin today's call with the highlights of our record financial results this quarter, which exceeded our preannounced ranges. This is a reflection of the ongoing recovery in regional gaming, and it speaks more specifically to the outstanding job that Todd and his operating teams both here at corporate and at the property levels are doing to help drive our continued margin improvement and boost higher spend per visit from our existing 55-plus age group, while finding new ways to attract younger patrons looking for alternative entertainment options. We also saw impressive revenue growth and near breakeven EBITDA results across our Penn Interactive segment. We're preparing to launch the Barstool Sportsbook app in 4 or 5 more states by the start of NFL season next month. And by the end of this calendar year, we expect to be live in at least 10 states while also introducing several new features to the app such as same game parlay and shareable bet slip, which we're really excited about. With greater operating scale and leverage, improved products and unique value creating marketing strategies, we believe we are extremely well positioned for a strong fall as we roll into Barstool Sports favorite time of the year, football season. 
Which provides a nice segue to our pending acquisition of theScore, which is the #1 sports app and sports media name in Canada and the third most popular sports app and sports media name in North America. When we add theScore's unique integrated media and betting platform and modern state-of-the-art technology to the massive audience of Barstool Sports and it's wildly popular personalities and content, we'll be creating North America's leading digital sports content, gaming and technology company. Under the terms of the agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the Board of the Directors of both companies, we'll be acquiring theScore for approximately $2 billion in cash and stock. theScore's shareholders will receive $17 in cash and 0.2398 shares of Penn National common stock for each of theScore share, which implies a total purchase consideration of USD 34 per theScore share based on Penn National's 5-day volume-weighted average trading price as of July 30, 2021. 
We are uniquely positioned to seamlessly serve our customers with the most powerful ecosystem of sports, gaming and media in North America, ultimately creating a community that does not exist today. This transaction will allow us to provide state-of-the-art mobile sports betting and eye casino with highly customized bets and enhanced in-game wagering opportunities, along with highly engaging, personalized sports and media content and real-time score stats and videos. We believe this powerful new flywheel will result in best-in-class engagement, retention and loyalty, and this larger cross-promotion ecosystem will provide us with multiple growth channels that transcend our current business verticals. In the near term, we'll just be scratching the surface of where we can ultimately take this company. 
The transaction also provides us with a path to full control of our own tech stack with a deep pool of engineering talent. theScore has developed a modern player account management system and is currently in the process of finishing up the development of an in-house managed risk and trading service platform, built specifically for the North American market that should lead to significant savings in third-party platform costs and more importantly, allow us to broaden our product offerings, providing the missing piece for operating at what we believe will be industry-leading margins. In fact, we expect to realize margin improvement of 500 basis points or more over time for Penn Interactive. 
But more important than cost synergies, we believe the transaction will provide us with significant incremental revenues, not just in Canada but also in the U.S. The financial benefits of this transaction are very compelling. Despite significant planned investments in technology and new launches, we anticipate that the acquisition of the score will provide adjusted EBITDA accretion by year 2 and an incremental $200 million medium-term adjusted EBITDA opportunity with a $500 million incremental long-term adjusted EBITDA upside. Our perspective is that operators that have achieved early online market share have done so primarily through first-mover advantage, leveraging existing customer databases and significant paid media spend. We believe the long-term winners will be defined by best-in-class products with spoke content, efficient customer acquisition, multi-platform reach and broad market access, all of which we have in spades. 
Before turning it over to John, I want to speak for a minute about our excitement to be entering the Canadian gaming market, which represents a compelling revenue growth and talent acquisition opportunity. Canada, and particularly Toronto, is known for its deep pool of world-class engineering and technology expertise. And we and the score intend to tap into that pool to expand theScore's tech team there as the business continues to scale. I also want to reinforce that we intend to operate theScore as a stand-alone business, much like we have with Barstool, which will remain headquartered in Toronto. 
Finally, it goes without saying that this transaction reflects the deep respect we have had for theScore brand over the years and what John and his family have created. We have known the Levy family for years and like our Barstool acquisition, we don't want to come in and change who they are, which is what has made them so successful. A large part of what we love about both Barstool and theScore is their authentic voice, their scrapping nature and entrepreneurial spirit. We want theScore to keep on doing what it does best, and are proud to have John and his entire team and family bring their unique perspective to our Penn National family. This is going to be a long-term partnership. So with that, I'd like to turn it over to John Levy."

And as Jay mentioned, we've been strategic partners with Penn in the U.S. since 2019. And over that time, it's been great getting to know Jay and his team who really do share the same culture and like us, are proud to be disruptors. We quickly realized that when we shared a common vision and approach related to a rapidly growing opportunity in media gaming all across North America. We've admired how Penn has strategically built their business. And when this opportunity arose, it was clear that there was a natural alignment. This deal brings together 2 companies who've developed large and loyal customer bases. We can't wait to join forces with Penn and leverage our respective strengths to create the most powerful sports media, gaming and content company in the market. 
We will combine to create a first-of-its-kind company which brings together world-class technology, highly engaging sports content and unparalleled reach, enabling us to uniquely serve users like no one else can. Penn obviously has a massive retail footprint across the U.S. but their approach to online gaming is also equally appealing. Like us, Penn has made a strategic decision to build their gaming operation around a strategy that originally integrates media and betting. Through Barstool, leveraging their hugely influential content machine, it's been apparent how the powerful strategy how powerful the strategy can be. 
Our product-led approach to integrating media and betting with technology accomplishes the same objective through an entirely complementary way. We look forward to collaborating with Dave, Erika and Barstool team as we leverage our unique brands, large audience and respective approaches to serving score. 
Now I'd also like to thank our team at theScore for helping us build this truly incredible organization. For years, the team maintained a dedicated focus and attention to understanding how to empower the fan experience. That effort has driven the innovation and ultimate success across all of our verticals, sports media, esports and gaming. This concentrated unified mission took us head first into the regulated gaming industry, going the path less traveled for media companies and actually becoming the sports book. We knew there was a better way to serve sports book betters. In a few years, we've built an innovative, technology-led integrated media and gaming operation that has poised us for success across North America including the highly anticipated upcoming rollout of commercial sports betting right here in our home turf. 
This enormously potential and demonstrated ability to execute that has excited our partners at Penn and their shared vision of where we can take it has excited us. That very much includes the opportunity here in Canada. With support, we will continue to invest in building our Canadian operations, growing our footprint and expanding our workforce, including our technical capabilities. Mobile technology has always been the foundation of our organization since we began with apps on our flipped home. We have built it into a world-class technology platform and will continue to pioneer on that front setting the standards for digital sports, media and gaming. Now with Penn, we have the opportunity to leverage it on a much larger scale. 
This combined entity truly creates a unique market leadership position across media, gaming and technology, and we could not be more excited with the opportunity ahead. On a personal note, I'd like to thank Penn for being a great partner these past few years and express how much Benji and I look forward to continuing to work with them and now, obviously, in a much closer capacity as we continue to head up theScore as part of this new combined company. With that, now I will turn it back to Jay."

My answer is theScore. So Erika and I met with John way back, we had a meeting. We didn't have the resources at the time to pull it off.

So it's been a long time coming, but we just see the world the same way and continues on the belief of the convergence of media, sports, gambling in the next step, so I couldn't be more excited. It's a company that I know well and have believed in and really just fits the vision of where we want to go. So super excited."

And as you can imagine, we've spent quite a bit of time talking about this as a group. We actually had really good productive discussions with the Levy Family and Dave and Erika and Big Cat a couple of weeks ago in New York. And there's really strong consensus that leading with theScore brands in Canada, of course, makes tremendous sense, and we're all excited to do that. We think that much of the Barstool audience is already familiar with theScore. I know that Dave and Dan, they were super excited, and you heard Dave talk about it. They've been following theScore, and they've known the Levy family and have been using their app over ESPN or any of the alternatives for ever. 
And so leading with theScore brands in Canada makes a lot of sense. And of course, there'll be a lot of cross promotion and really get an opportunity to market to that Barstool audience that we are also theScore as leading in Canada. And I think in the U.S. Barstool, of course, is a super strong brand. It's going to be our lead brand in the U.S. But we do have nice optionality. We have a number of states where theScore has already launched, and they're continuing to build out their market share. I think they're live in 4 or 5 states already in the U.S. And so we've got a lot of options. I think that what's most exciting, Joe, from my perspective, and I think that John and Erika and Dave would all echo this, that we feel like we have 2 of the premier sport media brands in North America. 
And our business model is a bit different than everyone else. I sort of look at what the competitors are doing in this space, and it feels to me like a rental model. And we're planning to to buy and to build, and to do something that's really differentiated, but it's built for the long term. We have built-in structural advantages that we've talked about before, whether it's access and now it's totally vertical tech stack integrated media and betting capabilities and engagement. And we've got 2 amazing brands. So we'll see how this plays out. But for sure, the lead brand in Canada will be theScore and the lead brand in the U.S. will be Barstool."

And then on Slide 17, you have some illustrative scenarios for market share and revenues and margins, and that's for North America as a whole. Within that, what are your underlying assumptions for the Canadian market and market share, which I would imagine, given theScore's presence, the fact that it's the hometown team and its historical presence there would give you a higher market share than sort of that 10% top 3 that you've been targeting in North America?"

So if you actually flip to Slide 18 and 19, you'll see that we estimated a North American TAM of $30 billion, which is sort of down the middle, the TAMs are all over the place. Is there still a number of pending state and province opportunities between the U.S. and Canada. And when we say $30 billion, that's combined sports betting and iCasino. And so we've laid out a number of scenarios there of what in terms of what your margin improvement opportunities would be at 500 basis points if your market share were anywhere between that 8% and 19% range. We've always been sort of targeting that midpoint of 13%. We think that that's something that is very achievable for us, and we think that's achievable for us in the U.S. and in Canada. 
So I think that's a good baseline, Joe. Is there upside to that, we would feel good about what that potential is down the road, especially once we have full control of the product road map, and we are 100% on our own tech stack, both in Canada and in the U.S. So I think those 2 slides are the ones to really reference there. And of course, not just from a market share perspective and a margin improvement perspective. But I think overall, TAM and where we expect to be market share-wise, it's laid out quite well. So you've got -- the nice thing about this transaction, you've got natural, sort of easy to calculate cost synergies. And then I think it's a lot of fun when you start focusing on the revenue potential because in all of the assumptions that we've made here on these 2 slides, which are, I think, quite exciting, there's nothing in there around opportunities in media. There's nothing in there about opportunities in other verticals where we think this company, meaning Penn National is going to be focused down the road. What we're building here, again, really transcends any of the verticals that we're currently in. It's much bigger than that."

And then -- and you had also asked, I believe, about sort of what costs, what are the investments over the course of the next year since we said EBITDA accretive for year 2. And we're going to be, I guess, taking a step back, there's a couple of things coming up for football season this year and then soon thereafter that are really exciting for us. One, we're going to have real scale for the first time. Last year, football season, week 1, we were live in 0 states. We squeezed in week 2 in Pennsylvania, and we got into Michigan at the very, very end of last football season. Football is all of our favorite sports at Penn and at Barstool. And I won't speak for theScore but it's probably somewhere between football and hockey. 
But I would say that for us to have scale this year is a big difference. And so we're going to be investing, I think, more nationally from a marketing standpoint. And you've been reading about some of those sponsorships and actually announced last week, Dave and Erika spoke about not just being a key -- the title sponsor, but also having distribution rights and broadcast rights as it relates to the Arizona Bowl. So there are some things that we're able to do when you have scale that you can't really do when you're only live in 1 state. Dave has a golf match coming up with [ Brooks Kepka ] in September. We also are going to be the lead sponsor for the Jake Paul fight that's coming up at the end of August. 
What's nice about each one of these opportunities and the ones that we certainly look for is that it's not just going to be Barstool logo here or theScore logo there. These are deeply integrated. We're able to use our content creators able to use Dave and Big Cat and others at Barstool.  To not just put the name on it, but also to really make it an entertaining experience when people are tuned in to watch or listen to these events. So I think you're going to see that there's a lot of investment going into our marketing capabilities to widen the funnel going into football season, so we can continue to grow our market share. Admittedly, the last several months, our focus has really been on just getting ready to go live in 4 or 5 more states by football season, kind of a slow sports calendar, but we're ramped up and ready to go for football season at Barstool. 
I know the score is ramped up and ready to go. And we think Ontario is going to be ready to go live in sort of December, January, February time frame. So there's going to be clearly significant investments in Ontario for theScore as they get ready to launch. And then we're going to continue to invest in improving the products and capabilities that we have here in the U.S. as well as in Canada. So there's a lot of investment going in. And even with all that said, because of our built-in structural advantages, we think we'll be probably breakeven from the Penn Interactive and theScore combination in 2022. And then you'll see that EBITDA ramp really starts a hockey stick in '23 and beyond."

And the things that we announced last week weren't even on the table 2 months ago. So it's a great question, Bernie. I think the opportunities for us, as a company, with the great companies and brands of Barstool and theScore really are endless. And I don't -- look, from my perspective, there is no better, top of funnel brand in the U.S. from a sports, media, entertainment perspective than Barstool. Nobody knows how to engage an audience, acquire customers, attract eyeballs the way that Barstool does. They're brilliant at it. And the brilliance is really on this phone with Dave and Erika and of course, Big Cat and the team at Barstool. 
And I look at theScore and say, they're also very, very strong on the acquisition side. And where they're even stronger is on the engagement and on the retention side because there really isn't anyone better at sort of delivering personalized content. Again, I've been on theScore app for years myself. And I'm a Yankee fan. And it's so -- everything that they do is so real time. It's customized. It's personalized. And when you're in their app, you're attracted in there from maybe a headline or a highlight or some stats or scores. And then once you're in there, it's seamless. You also want to bet on the game, you can do it right there and it takes you to theScore bet. 
So this integration between media and betting, I think is we're going to do it better than anybody else because we own that entire ecosystem and the entire experience. So when you combine the power of Barstool from an acquisition standpoint, the strong brand, it's just getting bigger and bigger every day. both as it relates to sports and media and entertainment. And then you look at what theScore does best, we think it's -- we're building something that's best-in-class and something that can't be duplicated."

And I think Jay sort of hit the nail on the head. We've been building the brand in Canada, but obviously throughout North America for a whole bunch of years and 2/3 of all of our users come from the state, probably the most highly engaged audience of any sports, digital sports media company. And the key factor that Jay did mention is with respect to the retention and the engagement that we get from the users, they're on our app. We can tell on -- it's very personalized. We can tell what's going on on a -- almost on a minute-by-minute basis. Some days, people are banging the app left, right and center, and you know why they're doing that is because predominantly, they're betting on sports. 
And really, the experience in Canada is exactly the same. Our presence in Canada, the leading digital mobile sports company in Canada. We're like second or third throughout North America. And the footprint we have, both there on our social platforms is quite frankly, enormous. And it's -- there is -- Jay's right, there is going to be some overlap, but the opportunity here to collaborate with Penn sitting sort of at the core to collaborate with with Barstool is enormous. 
And just in terms of the type of efforts that we're going to do, it's pretty traditional stuff that you're seeing from the other media companies like Jay suggested. Logos on billboards and joke about sponsoring hotdog eating content and all that sort of stuff.  Our whole approach to sports, and I believe bar stools is as well is just an authentic approach to connecting with the end user with the sports fan. And we do connect, I think we connect in somewhat different ways, obviously, and I think that's what makes it so complementary. We're kind of like 2 sisters now or brothers in this family, and there's going to be all sorts of ways that we can collaborate and dig deeper and extend this relationship. 
And then when you put the power of -- one of the reasons that Penn was so excited and interested in theScore was because with the technology that we built over the years, it gives them the absolute control to be able to do whatever your mind can think of. So when we come up with different promotions that the other guys can't think of, marketing campaigns or some of the wild and crazy stuff that Dave and Barstool are going to come up with you don't have to wait around to be able to implement this stuff. And the guys at Barstool will tell you that 1 of the biggest opportunities is everything has to be immediate. You come up with an idea and you got to present it to the sports fan right off the top and you have to be able to deal with it instantaneously. 
One of the last things I'll comment upon is why the technology works so good and why it opens up so many opportunities, specifically in terms of revenue generation, is as probably most of you are aware, 40 -- almost 50% of all wagering now is in game. Well, if you don't have the technology that allows you to avoid that spinning wheel of death while people are trying to consume this content and have the indication that they want to make a bet instantly or price a wager instantly, you lose the momentum and you lose the ability to do that. So I think when you put all this together, I think Jay mentioned earlier, if you look at Penn and what they've gotten now, it ticks all the boxes. And this is something that we saw in talking to Jay years ago. We deal -- the first deal we did with Jay was our access deal, I guess, over 2 years ago now, which gave us a footprint of 11 states in the U.S. And even back then, we could see that there was a real tight shared vision, and it was the same culture. And now with resources to scale to accelerate what we're doing in -- throughout North America and predominantly in Canada, where we tap into that big resource pool, it really is a very, very unique offering."

And we couldn't become the most -- the most popular sports app in Canada in the second or third",653,"For sure. I mean it's interesting. It's -- I often think about -- people can't believe it's as app. And everybody uses it and it's simple.  And it just works. And we couldn't become the most -- the most popular sports app in Canada in the second or third in the U.S. without all the effort and work that's gone into it. It looks pretty simple. He used the comparison of the stock floating across the water and his legs are seriously pedaling underneath. And that kind of was what's driven this. So when the betting opportunity came up and PASPA fell in the U.S., and we made the big decision to become the only digital sports media company to actually become the operator and not just lease out our huge engaged user base, but actually take the bull by the horns. That was a pretty b***** and pretty gutsy decision for us because from a revenue standpoint, it wasn't easy just to suck up all the dollars that everybody would have been throwing at us to get access to our user base. But we said that just doesn't fit. And what really fits is when you focus on 1 thing first, which is the end user and the consumer and how to make it easy for them. We've decided we have to build our own technology, and that's what we did. And it was a process, and we did it over the course of the last 12, 24 months because you can't do this spring overnight. But the approach is absolutely right. 
And during that period, we assume more and more responsibility. And as Jay just mentioned, we just announced in our last quarter, we've taken for basically full charge of the whole stack. And the last element is the risk and trading trading team, which -- and providing risk and trading services, which are already mirroring inside of our company because risk and trading is still being handled by the company that we did a deal with originally to enter into the gaming space, which is that worked out of the U.S. 
So we're saying within the next 9 months, 12 months, I mean, it's basically some time and hopefully sooner in that time line. we will have all of that in-house. But in the meantime, it's about 90% of it is now inside of our own our capabilities. And that allows us, for example, full player account management system. We just launched our new promotion engine. And I know someone like Mr. Port is going to go crazy with stuff like that because you're going to come up with different ideas and different types of promotions. And if you typically have to wait on a third party who is handling all this stuff for you, you get to the bottom of the list or it takes too long or the event has come and gone. 
So in our case, it gives us the maximum flexibility to be very creative, but then to be able to execute almost instantaneously. And I know this is one of the reasons, Jay, in addition to loving everything that we're doing, they love the brand, they love the users that we have, what we've built. But I think a lot of it is just thinking differently than what the traditional sports media and sports gaming companies how they think. And this really is a transformational deal. If it wasn't, it wouldn't be something that me or my family would have been interested in. And we're banking on having this amazing relationship with Penn and utilizing the resources and scale to really blow it up here in Canada and also to blow it up all across North America. And I don't think anybody -- and I don't care who we're talking about, has the same capabilities of what we now have with this Triumph this tractor."

And so as you look at the different tech stack options that are in the market today, there are a lot of really good ones, but we're going to be on one that was built for the North American market and is going to be the most state-of-the-art, the freshest, the newest, the greatest, the most features out there. And we think that's going to allow us to leapfrog the competition as we go live in Canada very soon, and then bring it back to the U.S., which we anticipate happening in 2023. 
So I guess, the very last thing I would say about the tech stack is we have been partnered up with 2 really great companies in White Hat Gaming and Camby. And this is not a knock against White Hat Gaming or Camby. They've been great partners. They've been there for us. Very responsive. They're great B2B companies. And -- but at the end of the day, we ultimately, given how important this is for the company's future and how important it is for us strategically, as we think about where and how we create value for our shareholders and stakeholders over the long term, we just have to be in control of our tech stack. And you've heard me say that on calls before. And we went out looking for the right tech stack. And what we ended up with is not only best-in-class tech stack, but an amazing brand, an amazing company. and gateway to what is a huge opportunity in Canada with one of the strongest sports brands in all of Canada. So we think we got the best of all worlds here."

Just to give people kind of how it could potentially work. We -- at Barstow, we've never had the opportunity, as John was saying, to create things that would be specific for us because we're working with companies that serve multiple end users. But we talked about the Arizona Bowl, which will be controlling soup to nuts, for example, which we have the broadcast. We have to have everything you can name is up to us. So a scenario where we're able to create bets and things specific for them, put the content and highlight it on theScore, which serves all these people in train gambling as well as us and be able to have things that nobody else can offer and coverage of the game that nobody else can offer. 
And now the ability to create bets that we know we're going to focus on in the game. And the Arizona Bowl is just really the beginning. It's one of the things people look a lot of times like why is Barstool doing Arizona Bowl. Well, since then, we've been approached by other sports leagues, some of the major 4 interested in giving us rights. But we are going to control the experience of the bets and be able to offer things that simply nobody else will even know is coming, and they won't be able to react quickly. So it really gives us, again, the ecosystem from the beginning of the game, covering the game embedding during the game and then directing people a bet towards the game that will be totally unique."

Happy to, Shaun. And again, we're still finalizing the plan. But here's the way we're thinking about it currently, which I think is about as bulletproof as it gets, which is that theScore Bet is going to be going live in Ontario, whenever Ontario is ready to go, call it, December, January, already on their own [ PAM ], John had said on his last earnings call with Benji that they plan to be live on their own managed trading services platform sometime spring, summer of 2022, so call it in less than a year. And it gives us an amazing opportunity to make sure all the technology is working as planned in a really, really important market and what we believe will be under high-stress high volume because of how strong theScore brand is in Canada. 
And at the time that we believe it's ready to bring back to the U.S. and convert our tech stack over, that's when we're going to do it. We think that will probably happen in 2023. Is at a beginning of '23 or middle '23. Not sure yet, but I would say we're highly confident it will be before football season of '23. But we want to make sure that we get this all right first, and we get it right in a market that is really important with high volume and high market share and Canada, Ontario is the perfect opportunity for us to do that. So that's the way we're thinking about it today, Shaun. And we'll obviously continue to update everybody on the call as we have more information. I think we all have a pretty good idea given the DraftKings SBTech conversion, I think, took around 18 months. And so it feels like that's probably about the right time frame for us as well, 18 to 24 months before we bring it back to the U.S. But with all of that said, as Dave just mentioned and John mentioned earlier, there's so much we can do that's complementary between now and then mainly as it relates to promotions and exclusive betting options and things of that nature. We don't have to wait to all be on the same tech stack to start executing on that now."

I know you have talked over the last 6 months of getting more aggressive on regional and more pan-regional promotions. But obviously, there's some very large names coming with very, very big wallets into the fall that are also scaling really rapidly. So help us sort of outline both the competitive environment and how your competitive thinking is evolving."

So we -- and this is one of the things that I'm probably most proud of is that we went from not having a sports betting app at all 2.5 years ago to have launched our own in September of last year in Pennsylvania and have really scaled that",632,"Yes, happy to. So we -- and this is one of the things that I'm probably most proud of is that we went from not having a sports betting app at all 2.5 years ago to have launched our own in September of last year in Pennsylvania and have really scaled that across the 4 states that we're currently live in. And we've done a great job of that. Our iOS app rating is a 4.7 on a scale of 0 to 5, right up there with the top of the marketplace. So we're competing with DK, FanDuel and BetMGM as it relates to the overall experience. It's not like our product today has a poor experience. We have just been playing catch-up. So we launched and you look at what we're going to have from a product perspective at the start of football season this year versus what we had last year, both as it relates to sports betting and online casino and it's not even comparable. So we think we're going to continue to be competitive. 
And again, I complemented Kambi and White Hat Gaming. They've been working their tails off with us over the course of the last 12 months to make sure that we had new features and a great UI/UX heading into football season this year. We're going to have same game, Parlay, which is a huge, huge betting opportunity as it relates to NFL we're going to have shareable bet slip, which is something that Dave and Dan have been asking for since the day we met years ago, and we finally can offer that, which makes it really easy for them to post what their bets are on social media. It's one click and you're into the Barstool Sports book with a populated that flips. So there's a lot of things we're doing this year that we couldn't do last year. 
And then as it relates to online casino we launched as quickly as we could, and we knew that we had to be live in Michigan at the same time everybody else was. So we rushed to do that. But admittedly, we don't have -- we didn't have the full complement of content at the time. And as you look at what we're going to be able to offer in the fall this year as it relates to online casino, it's going to be a much larger, wider library of content. We're also going to have Blackjack -- sorry, excuse me, Barstool-themed games both on the Blackjack side as well as slot content that we've been developing at our Hit Point studio. That's going to be happening this fall as well. 
And then we're actually going to have custom live dealer, Barstool theme live dealer in New Jersey, when we launched eye Casino in New Jersey here in the next several weeks. So we've got a lot of really exciting things from a product perspective that are in the hopper, which is why, to the second part of your question, Shaun, we feel much more comfortable being more aggressive as it relates to not just getting the word out as it relates to Barstool but also spending some money to do things that we wouldn't have done last year because we didn't have the scale. You wouldn't sponsor a fight that has national appeal or you wouldn't do what our partners at Barstool are doing for the Arizona Bowl? You wouldn't have done that last year. There's things that we can do this year, and I don't want to share more because we have more that we're working on, but stay tuned.  That will be, I think, broader and sort of really focused on widening the funnel even beyond what we did in 2020."

Understanding it's still early, there seems to be a dichotomy in my mind between the quality of theScore product, which is very strong and then kind of the market share generated thus far in the U.S. How do you think about leveraging the product, the existing product in the U.S. to drive greater OSB gaining share? Like do you combine that -- do you combine theScore product with Barstool to amplify existing Penn Barfield product in the U.S.? Or is it about putting money and promotion behind theScore in the U.S. to get the name out there.

And good, John, I don't want to speak for you on this one, but I know that we are absolutely in the same boat as it relates to how we launched in the U.S., which is that both Penn, with Barstool sports book as well as theScore, we have spent virtually nothing on paid marketing. And the reason why is that, one, we wanted to make sure, from our perspective, on the Penn side that we allowed Barstool to do their thing and really prove out the model, which we continue to do. And I think it's great a result. And also because we needed to have the right product and capabilities. And I know that John and the Levy family were very focused on making sure the product is right before you start spending to drive market share. And so we're not concerned with where market share has been, it's more our focus is where it's going to be. And I just know that the power of Barstool and the cross-promoting opportunities that they present. And Dave and Dan, it's, of course, nice that they love theScore technology and application and being able to put theScore on even a bigger stage in the U.S. than it's been because of the fact that it's now part of the same family. I think, is a huge opportunity. 
And I think it will play out then in terms of what's the strategy in the U.S.? Is it 2 brands from a sports betting standpoint, or is it 1? We have plenty of time to figure that out, but I would expect to see improved market share results from both theScore Bet in the U.S. as well as Barstool's Sportsbook as we head into football season this year, and the product is better, and we have reasons to be marketing more aggressively than we did in 2020. John, anything you want to add to that?"

First of all, yes, I think Jay's got it right.

And we've said right from",694,"Yes. First of all, yes, I think Jay's got it right. I mean our approach and Jay's approach have been different than most in the context of sort of buying your way to huge market shares and then just hoping that it's sustainable. And we've said right from the get-go that you lead with the product and you build the product. And for example, in the U.S., we've talked about mid-single digit to low double-digit penetration that we're going to build to. And we are on course, building towards that over the history that we've had and where we are today. In Canada, obviously, it's going to be a bit of a different story or probably a lot of a different story because of how extensive the brand resonates. We've been around forever. Kids who are watching our TV network in Canada before we sold it to Rogers are now 20 and 30-year olds and betting on sports, right? 
So the infiltration in terms of the audience that we have on the app is -- you add up the other media companies in Canada and put them together, they don't come close to us. And even with the big U.S. brands coming into Canada because I'm sure they're going to come because Ontario is the equivalent in case you people don't -- aren't aware of it, the fifth largest state in the U.S. So while -- all of us are Jones in to get into Texas, Florida, New York, et cetera, and we are looking at strategies to do that. We're sitting right here in our home turf with the equivalent of -- and when it's operating at the end of -- towards the end of 2021, we'll be the largest jurisdiction in North America for sports betting. So very, very exciting for us. So one of the reasons that I think Penn and theScore hit it off so well is because of our approach to going after the market and doing it sensibly. And some of the stuff that Barstool's talking about now in terms of getting into a different way to present sports events. I think the key and what you should take away from that is sort of toss away all the sort of traditional legacy ways that people are consuming sports content. We've built a whole company on the basis of just following the consumer and how he or she consumes sports content. The same thing follows. And this is why all the teams and leagues are desperately looking at new alignments and it's all about engagement because people just aren't consuming exports the same way they historically have. 
So start from a digital perspective, which I think is what Dave is talking about in terms of doing this ball game, and work it up from there, start from the consumer figure out how he's watching or participating or going to these games, what excites him and then provide the product to be able to do that. And I think one of the things that Jay referenced earlier is if you look out, we know what we're doing today. We're building this amazing product. We know what sports betting looks like. We're doing it differently than anybody else with this integration into the media space. And if you're picking on a box score, you want to make a bet, it's 1 click away. I mean you have just amazing ability to make wagers in game very quickly and efficiently. 
But that's -- we're just the tip of the iceberg. Like we're going to look back a year or 2 or 3 from now and say, we felt we were good then. We didn't -- we were just doing nothing then as compared to what it's going to look like. So when you start to view it differently, you view it from a digital mobile perspective rather than just the legacy traditional way of looking at sports and how people are consuming it, where the big partly, and that's where the big opportunity is. And I think that's why we're also excited about what's come together here in -- with Penn."

I think something -- and this is Dave again from Barstool, that we've learned and Dan and I have learned and all the people at Barstool is our influence is really, really big. And through the years, we may be a little naive, but we would do deals with companies and it could be any vertical. It could be filters with like high noon. I'd argue that 1 of you could say sort of a competitor, but action network was built on our back, like we had the churn in connection, nobody knew what it was, and we were promoting that actively that app. All the user base is built on Barstool promotion. You can look at Robin Hotel. If you go look, where is the explosive user base from that. A lot of people point back at what we are doing with DDTG and the everyday trader and getting people involved, even our podcasts like color Daddy things, we have the ability to sort of king-make we have gotten better as the years where we stopped mentioning companies purposely because like why are we building other. 
We, I think, a huge opportunity and the synergistic nature of this is we know how good theScore is. I've used it forever. Dan has used it forever. We know it's best-in-breed. We are going to turn that faucet on. And if we think theScore is big now like relatively speaking, I think we're going to turn that 10, 20x because all of a sudden, every time we talk sports, games, gambling, it's theScore, it's theScore, it's theScore. We haven't had that. So when we talk about how is it going to grow in the United States to me, that's one of the biggest parts of this. People -- and John just kind of talked about this. To me, this deal is never about like, okay, what's the market share, anything like that. It's the perfect synergistic company we need to help each other and grow each other. So that -- in the United States, I expect theScore over the next year to -- I mean I don't even want to put a number on it, but we're going to make that a household, everybody will know what it is. Everybody will use it for scores, news, all of that stuff. We purposely don't mention companies now because we know the effect we have when we basically bless it. So we plan on doing that, obviously, now full boat."

As I said before, they grew up, everybody here is on the score, everybody. We compete -- we've never shied away from competing and these guys know that. We launched our TV network in the mid-90s up against your version of ESPN up here called TSN and Roger Sports Net. And we kicked their but because we did things differently. And then when we launched -- moved into the digital space, people just came to expect that same level of authenticity, respect for the customer, just given what they want. And we joke about it in the states, we're the most-used, least-known brand in the sports business. And we're kind of like the New York Rangers in New York, right?  Everybody who loves the Rangers goes to the game, right? And we joke about that with respect to theScore, right? 
Because people who are on our app in the U.S. and who are betting through Score Bet into the Score Media app, love that as well. So I think you're going to see an elevation, 
I've always said, when we get into betting, and this is even before the Penn deal and the sort of arrangement that we -- in this collaboration that we're going to have all the time with Barstool is that sort of the rising tide will raise both. Bedding will influence our ability to extend the brand in the U.S. and as we grow the brand in the U.S. bedding will take off. 
And now we're supercharging this with everything that Penn brings to the table and Barstool. And in Canada, we're already there. I mean, in Canada, we just can't wait unleash the power of our integrated betting operation, which will be, as Jay mentioned, under the same brand because that's what makes sense. And in the U.S., we're going to figure it out. And then we have the luxury of being able to figure it out because we're up and operating in the 4 states currently with Score Bet. And over the course of the next 12 months, we're -- I'm fully confident we're going to be able to decide what's the best path and really decide that, not from me, Score or a Barstool, Penn but focusing on the consumer and saying, how do we do that best?"

And I think that there's a lot of different approaches to calculating LTV. We have -- let's just talk about with regard to Barstool. That brand is the most relevant sports media and entertainment brand for anyone aged late teens, early 20s through mid-30s. And when you think about the average age of who's on the Barstool Sports book today, the average age for us is late 20s. No one can touch that. I don't need to know what everyone else's database looks like. I just know they can't touch that. And we also know that the loyalty to bar stool is very, very high. 
And I think that LTV is too easily calculated today. If you win a customer over by spending on linear TV, and you get a customer on a rich promotion, and you're assuming you're going to keep that customer forever on an LTV basis, I think that's flawed. And I think that our ability to calculate LTV is much stronger because of the retention value and the fact that the average age is so much younger. And I think that theScore, not to overuse the term amplify, but it really does amplify that because of how strong they are on engagement and retention that you heard all of us talk about so far the live media, live betting experiences, the customized, personalized offerings and engagement. So LTV, we just I think as wide as the funnel has been, now we're going to be able to do a much better job. I think Erika articulates this very well of keeping people in the ecosystem once they're there. And the score takes all of that to the next level, and I think LTV for us is going to be a real number, and we'll see how it plays out over time for everyone else. 
And Rita, I think that's it for the call. I really appreciate everybody joining us today. Excited to share with you the news, Erika, Dave, John, thank you for joining and just great to hear everybody's perspective. We're obviously really excited about this, and we're just getting started.

Thanks for joining us for our second quarter earnings call and, I would say, more importantly, the exciting announcement of the acquisition of Score Media and Gaming. I have with me here in Wyomissing our CFO, Felicia",1067,"Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter earnings call and, I would say, more importantly, the exciting announcement of the acquisition of Score Media and Gaming. I have with me here in Wyomissing our CFO, Felicia Hendricks; our Head of Operations, Todd George; as well as other members of my executive team. And later on, John Levy, Founder and CEO of theScore, will join me to discuss our exciting new partnership that we announced this morning. We'll also be joined in a bit by Barstool founder, Dave Portnoy, and Barstool Sports CEO, Erika Nardini, to get their perspective on the deal as well. 
But first, I'll begin today's call with the highlights of our record financial results this quarter, which exceeded our preannounced ranges. This is a reflection of the ongoing recovery in regional gaming, and it speaks more specifically to the outstanding job that Todd and his operating teams, both here at corporate and at the property levels, are doing to help drive our continued margin improvement and boost higher spend per visit from our existing 55-plus age group, while finding new ways to attract younger patrons looking for alternative entertainment options. 
We also saw impressive revenue growth and near breakeven EBITDA results across our Penn Interactive segment. We're preparing to launch the Barstool Sportsbook app in 4 or 5 more states by the start of NFL season next month. And by the end of this calendar year, we expect to be live in at least 10 states while also introducing several new features to the app, such as same game parlay and shareable bet slip, which we're really excited about. With greater operating scale and leverage, improved products and unique value-creating marketing strategies, we believe we are extremely well positioned for a strong fall as we roll into Barstool Sports' favorite time of the year, football season, which provides a nice segue to our pending acquisition of theScore, which is the #1 sports app and sports media name in Canada and the third most popular sports app and sports media name in North America. 
When we add theScore's unique integrated media and betting platform and modern state-of-the-art technology to the massive audience of Barstool Sports and it's wildly popular personalities and content, we'll be creating North America's leading digital sports content, gaming and technology company. Under the terms of the agreement, which have been unanimously approved by the Boards of the Directors of both companies, we'll be acquiring theScore for approximately $2 billion in cash and stock. theScore's shareholders will receive $17 in cash and 0.2398 shares of Penn National common stock for each of theScore share, which implies a total purchase consideration of USD 34 per theScore share based on Penn National's 5-day volume-weighted average trading price as of July 30, 2021.
We are uniquely positioned to seamlessly serve our customers with the most powerful ecosystem of sports, gaming and media in North America, ultimately creating a community that does not exist today. This transaction will allow us to provide state-of-the-art mobile sports betting and iCasino with highly customized bets and enhanced in-game wagering opportunities, along with highly engaging, personalized sports and media content and real-time scores, stats and videos. We believe this powerful new flywheel will result in best-in-class engagement, retention and loyalty, and this larger cross-promotion ecosystem will provide us with multiple growth channels that transcend our current business verticals. In the near term, we'll just be scratching the surface of where we can ultimately take this company.
The transaction also provides us with a path to full control of our own tech stack with a deep pool of engineering talent. theScore has developed a modern player account management system and is currently in the process of finishing up the development of an in-house managed risk and trading service platform built specifically for the North American market that should lead to significant savings in third-party platform costs and more importantly, allow us to broaden our product offerings, providing the missing piece for operating at what we believe will be industry-leading margins. In fact, we expect to realize margin improvement of 500 basis points or more over time for Penn Interactive.
But more important than cost synergies, we believe the transaction will provide us with significant incremental revenues, not just in Canada but also in the U.S. The financial benefits of this transaction are very compelling. Despite significant planned investments in technology and new launches, we anticipate that the acquisition of theScore will provide adjusted EBITDA accretion by year 2 and an incremental $200 million medium-term adjusted EBITDA opportunity with a $500 million incremental long-term adjusted EBITDA upside. 
Our perspective is that operators that have achieved early online market share have done so primarily through first-mover advantage, leveraging existing customer databases and significant paid media spend. We believe the long-term winners will be defined by best-in-class products, bespoke content, efficient customer acquisition, multi-platform reach and broad market access, all of which we have in spades.
Before turning it over to John, I want to speak for a minute about our excitement to be entering the Canadian gaming market, which represents a compelling revenue growth and talent-acquisition opportunity. Canada, and particularly Toronto, is known for its deep pool of world-class engineering and technology expertise, and we and theScore intend to tap into that pool to expand theScore's tech team there as the business continues to scale. I also want to reinforce that we intend to operate theScore as a stand-alone business, much like we have with Barstool, which will remain headquartered in Toronto.
Finally, it goes without saying that this transaction reflects the deep respect we have had for theScore brand over the years and what John and his family have created. We have known the Levy family for years and, like our Barstool acquisition, we don't want to come in and change who they are, which is what has made them so successful. A large part of what we love about both Barstool and theScore is their authentic voice, their scrappy nature and entrepreneurial spirit. We want theScore to keep on doing what it does best and are proud to have John and his entire team and family bring their unique perspective to our Penn National family. This is going to be a long-term partnership. 
So with that, I'd like to turn it over to John Levy."

And as Jay mentioned, we've been strategic partners with Penn in the U.S. since 2019. And over that time, it's been great getting to know Jay and his team who really do share the same culture and, like us, are proud to be disruptors. We quickly realized that when we shared a common vision and approach related to a rapidly growing opportunity in media gaming all across North America. We've admired how Penn has strategically built their business, and when this opportunity arose, it was clear that there was a natural alignment. This deal brings together 2 companies who've developed large and loyal customer bases. We can't wait to join forces with Penn and leverage our respective strengths to create the most powerful sports media, gaming and content company in the market. We will combine to create a first-of-its-kind company, which brings together world-class technology, highly engaging sports content and unparalleled reach, enabling us to uniquely serve users like no one else can. 
Penn obviously has a massive retail footprint across the U.S. but their approach to online gaming is also equally appealing. Like us, Penn has made a strategic decision to build their gaming operation around a strategy that originally integrates media and betting. Through Barstool, leveraging their hugely influential content machine, it's been apparent how the powerful strategy -- how powerful the strategy can be. Our product-led approach to integrating media and betting with technology accomplishes the same objective through an entirely complementary way. We look forward to collaborating with Dave, Erika and Barstool team as we leverage our unique brands, large audience and respective approaches to serving [sports].
Now I'd also like to thank our team at theScore for helping us build this truly incredible organization. For years, the team maintained a dedicated focus and attention to understanding how to empower the fan experience. That effort has driven the innovation and ultimate success across all of our verticals, sports media, esports and gaming. This concentrated unified mission took us head first into the regulated gaming industry, going the path less traveled for media companies and actually becoming the sportsbook. We knew there was a better way to serve sportsbook betters. In a few years, we've built an innovative, technology-led, integrated media and gaming operation that has poised us for success across North America, including the highly anticipated upcoming rollout of commercial sports betting right here in our home turf. 
This enormously potential and demonstrated ability to execute that has excited our partners at Penn and their shared vision of where we can take it has excited us. That very much includes the opportunity here in Canada. With Penn's support, we will continue to invest in building our Canadian operations, growing our footprint and expanding our workforce, including our technical capabilities. Mobile technology has always been the foundation of our organization since we began with apps on our flipped home. We have built it into a world-class technology platform and will continue to pioneer on that front, setting the standards for digital sports, media and gaming. Now with Penn, we have the opportunity to leverage it on a much larger scale. This combined entity truly creates a unique market leadership position across media, gaming and technology, and we could not be more excited with the opportunity ahead. 
On a personal note, I'd like to thank Penn for being a great partner these past few years and express how much Benjie and I look forward to continuing to work with them and now, obviously, in a much closer capacity as we continue to head up theScore as part of this new combined company. 
With that, now I will turn it back to Jay."

So Erika and I met with John way back and had a meeting. We didn't have the resources at the time to pull it off. But I think what makes Barstool successful and what has made the Barstool and Penn relationship work is we really know the market. We know the gambling space, we know sports gambling. And I've been a user of theScore for -- I don't even know how long I was trying to check when I installed the app on my phone. It's got to be 10, 15 years.

And as you can imagine, we've spent quite a bit of time talking about this as a group. We actually had really good productive discussions with the Levy family and Dave and Erika and Big Cat a couple of weeks ago in New York. And there's really strong consensus that leading with theScore brands in Canada, of course, makes tremendous sense, and we're all excited to do that. We think that much of the Barstool audience is already familiar with theScore. I know Dave and Dan, they were super excited, and you heard Dave talk about it. They've been following theScore, and they've known the Levy family and have been using their app over ESPN or any of the alternatives for ever.
And so leading with theScore brands in Canada makes a lot of sense. And of course, there'll be a lot of cross-promotion and really get an opportunity to market to that Barstool audience that we are also theScore leading in Canada. And I think in the U.S., Barstool, of course, is a super strong brand. It's going to be our lead brand in the U.S. But we do have nice optionality. We have a number of states where theScore has already launched, and they're continuing to build out their market share. I think they're live in 4 or 5 states already in the U.S. And so we've got a lot of options. I think that what's most exciting, Joe, from my perspective, and I think that John and Erika and Dave would all echo this, that we feel like we have 2 of the premier sport media brands in North America. And our business model is a bit different than everyone else. 
I sort of look at what the competitors are doing in this space, and it feels to me like a rental model. And we're planning to buy and to build and to do something that's really differentiated, but it's built for the long term. We have built-in structural advantages that we've talked about before, whether it's access and now it's totally vertical tech stack, integrated media and betting capabilities and engagement, and we've got 2 amazing brands. So we'll see how this plays out. But for sure, the lead brand in Canada will be theScore and the lead brand in the U.S. will be Barstool."

And then on Slide 17, you have some illustrative scenarios for market share and revenues and margins, and that's for North America as a whole. Within that, what are your underlying assumptions for the Canadian market and market share, which I would imagine, given theScore's presence, the fact that it's the hometown team and its historical presence there, would give you a higher market share than sort of that 10% top 3 that you've been targeting in North America?"

So if you actually flip to Slide 18 and 19, you'll see that we estimated a North American TAM of $30 billion, which is sort of down the middle, their TAMs are all over the place and there's still a number of pending state and province opportunities between the U.S. and Canada. And when we say $30 billion, that's combined sports betting and iCasino. And so we've laid out a number of scenarios there of what in terms of what your margin improvement opportunities would be at 500 basis points if your market share were anywhere between that 8% and 19% range. We've always been sort of targeting that midpoint of 13%. We think that, that's something that is very achievable for us, and we think that's achievable for us in the U.S. and in Canada. So I think that's a good baseline, Joe. 
Is there upside to that? We would feel good about what that potential is down the road, especially once we have full control of the product road map, and we are 100% on our own tech stack, both in Canada and in the U.S. So I think those 2 slides are the ones to really reference there. And of course, not just from a market share perspective and a margin improvement perspective. But I think overall, TAM and where we expect to be market share-wise, it's laid out quite well. So you've got -- the nice thing about this transaction, you've got natural sort of easy-to-calculate cost synergies. And then I think it's a lot of fun when you start focusing on the revenue potential, because in all of the assumptions that we've made here on these 2 slides, which are, I think, quite exciting, there's nothing in there around opportunities in media. There's nothing in there about opportunities in other verticals, where we think this company, meaning Penn National, is going to be focused down the road. What we're building here, again, really transcends any of the verticals that we're currently in. It's much bigger than that."

And then -- yes, and you had also asked, I believe, about sort of what costs are we in -- what are the investments over the course of the next year since we said EBITDA-accretive for year 2. And we're going to be, I guess, taking a step back. There's a couple of things coming up for football season this year and then soon thereafter that are really exciting for us. One, we're going to have real scale for the first time. Last year, football season, week 1, we were live in 0 states. We squeezed in week 2 in Pennsylvania, and we got into Michigan at the very, very end of last football season. Football is all of our favorite sports at Penn and at Barstool. And I won't speak for theScore but it's probably somewhere between football and hockey. But I would say that for us to have scale this year is a big difference. And so we're going to be investing, I think, more nationally from a marketing standpoint. And you've been reading about some of those sponsorships and actually announced last week, Dave and Erika spoke about not just being a key -- the title sponsor, but also having distribution rights and broadcast rights as it relates to the Arizona Bowl. So there are some things that we're able to do when you have scale that you can't really do when you're only live in 1 state. 
Dave has a golf match coming up with Brooks Koepka in September. We also are going to be the lead sponsor for the Jake Paul fight that's coming up at the end of August. And what's nice about each one of these opportunities and the ones that we certainly look for is that it's not just going to be Barstool logo here or theScore logo there. These are deeply integrated. We're able to use our content creators, able to use Dave and Big Cat and others at Barstool to not just put the name on it but also to really make it an entertaining experience when people are tuned into watch or listen to these events. So I think you're going to see that there's a lot of investment going into our marketing capabilities to widen the funnel going into football season, so we can continue to grow our market share. 
Admittedly, the last several months, our focus has really been on just getting ready to go live in 4 or 5 more states by football season, kind of a slow sports calendar, but we're ramped up and ready to go for football season at Barstool. I know theScore is ramped up and ready to go, and we think Ontario is going to be ready to go live in sort of December, January, February time frame. So there's going to be clearly significant investments in Ontario for theScore as they get ready to launch. And then we're going to continue to invest in improving the products and capabilities that we have here in the U.S. as well as in Canada. So there's a lot of investment going in. 
And even with all that said, because of our built-in structural advantages, we think we'll be probably breakeven from the Penn Interactive and theScore combination in 2022. And then you'll see that EBITDA ramp really start to hockey stick in '23 and beyond."

And the things that we announced last week weren't even on the table 2 months ago. So it's a great question, Bernie. I think the opportunities for us as a company, with the great companies and brands of Barstool and theScore, really are endless. And I don't -- look, from my perspective, there is no better top-of-funnel brand in the U.S. from a sports, media, entertainment perspective than Barstool. Nobody knows how to engage an audience, acquire customers, attract eyeballs the way that Barstool does. They're brilliant at it. And the brilliance is really on this phone with Dave and Erika and, of course, Big Cat and the team at Barstool.  
And I look at theScore and say, they're also very, very strong on the acquisition side. And where they're even stronger is on the engagement and on the retention side because there really isn't anyone better at sort of delivering personalized content. Again, I've been on theScore app for years myself, and I'm a Yankee fan. And it's so -- everything that they do is so real time, it's customized, it's personalized. And when you're in their app, you're attracted in there from maybe a headline or a highlight or some stats or scores. And then once you're in there, it's seamless. You also want to bet on the game, you can do it right there and it takes you to theScore bet. So this integration between media and betting I think is -- we're going to do it better than anybody else because we own that entire ecosystem and the entire experience. So when you combine the power of Barstool from an acquisition standpoint, the strong brand, it's just getting bigger and bigger every day, both as it relates to sports and media and entertainment, and then you look at what theScore does best, we think it's -- we're building something that's best-in-class and something that can't be duplicated."

And I think Jay sort of hit the nail on the head. We've been building the brand in Canada, but obviously throughout North America for a whole bunch of years and 2/3 of all of our users come from The States, probably the most highly engaged audience of any sports -- digital sports media company. And the key factor that Jay did mention is with respect to the retention and the engagement that we get from the users, they're on our app. We can tell on -- it's very personalized. We can tell what's going on, on a -- almost on a minute-by-minute basis. Some days, people are banging the app left, right and center, and you know why they're doing that is because predominantly, they're betting on sports.  
And really, the experience in Canada is exactly the same. Our presence in Canada, the leading digital mobile sports company in Canada, we're like second or third throughout North America. And the footprint we have both there on our social platforms is quite frankly enormous. And it's -- there is -- Jay's right, there is going to be some overlap, but the opportunity here to collaborate with Penn sitting sort of at the core to collaborate with Barstool is enormous and just in terms of the type of efforts that we're going to do. It's pretty traditional stuff that you're seeing from the other media companies, like Jay suggested. Logos on billboards and joke about sponsoring hotdog-eating contest and all that sort of stuff. Our whole approach to sports, and I believe Barstools' as well, is just this authentic approach to connecting with the end user, with the sports fan. And we do connect. I think we connect in somewhat different ways, obviously, and I think that's what makes it so complementary. We're kind of like 2 sisters now or brothers in this family, and there's going to be all sorts of ways that we can collaborate and dig deeper and extend this relationship.
And then when you put the power of -- one of the reasons that Penn was so excited and interested in theScore was because with the technology that we built over the years, it gives them the absolute control to be able to do whatever your mind can think of. So when we come up with different promotions that the other guys can't think of, marketing campaigns or some of the wild and crazy stuff that Dave and Barstool are going to come up with, you don't have to wait around to be able to implement this stuff. And the guys at Barstool will tell you that one of the biggest opportunities is everything has to be immediate. You come up with an idea and you got to present it to the sports fans right off the top and you have to be able to deal with it instantaneously.  
One of the -- just one last thing I'll comment upon is why the technology works so good and why it opens up so many opportunities, specifically in terms of revenue generation, is as probably most of you are aware, 40 -- almost 50% of all wagering now is in games. Well, if you don't have the technology that allows you to avoid that spinning wheel of death while people are trying to consume this content and have the indication that they want to make a bet instantly or price a wager instantly, you lose the momentum and you lose the ability to do that. So I think when you put all this together, I think Jay mentioned earlier, if you look at Penn and what they've gotten now, it ticks all the boxes. And this is something that we saw in talking to Jay years ago. We deal -- the first deal we did with Jay was our access deal, I guess, over 2 years ago now, which gave us a footprint of 11 states in the U.S. And even back then, we could see that there was a real tight shared vision and there was the same culture. And now with resources and scale to accelerate what we're doing in -- throughout North America and predominantly in Canada, where we tap into that big resource pool, it really is a very, very unique offering."

I would -- before I hand it to John, I would just say, again, we've known the Levies for years. 
And one of the things that I've always been really impressed by is that this is a company that was built on technology. They've always been digital-first, they've always been technology-first. Their home office and hub is in Toronto, which is the tech capital of Canada. And it's such a huge opportunity for us as we think about the future. It's so hard to compete for tech talent these days in the U.S., not that it isn't in Canada. But the nice thing about Toronto and the nice thing about theScore is that theScore is the premier company, the premier brand, especially as it relates to all things sports media and soon-to-come sports betting. And so our ability to continue to augment our current team in Philadelphia with the team in Toronto and build out in both cities. There's a huge opportunity there.

It's -- I often think about -- people can't believe it's this app. And everybody uses it and it's simple and it just works. And we couldn't become the most popular sports app in Canada and the second or third in the U.S. without all the effort and work that's gone into it. It looks pretty simple. He uses the comparison of this duck floating across the water and his legs are seriously pedaling underneath. And that's kind of what's driven this. So when the betting opportunity came up and PASPA fell in the U.S., and we made the big decision to become the only digital sports media company to actually become the operator and not just lease out our huge engaged user base, but actually take the bull by the horns, that was a pretty ballsy and pretty gutsy decision for us because from a revenue standpoint, it wasn't easy just to suck up all the dollars that everybody would have been throwing at us to get access to our user base. But we said that just doesn't fit. And what really fits is when you focus on one thing first, which is the end user and the consumer and how to make it easy for them, we decided we have to build our own technology, and that's what we did. And it was a process, and we did it over the course of the last 12, 24 months because you can't do this thing overnight, but the approach is absolutely right.
And during that period, we assumed more and more responsibility. And as Jay just mentioned, we just announced in our last quarter, we've taken full -- basically full charge of the whole stack. And the last element is the risk and trading team, which -- and providing risk and trading services, which were already mirroring inside of our company because risk and trading is still being handled by the company that we did a deal with originally to enter into the gaming space, which is -- that worked out of the U.S. So we're saying within the next 9 months, 12 months, I mean, it's basically some time and hopefully sooner in that time line, we will have all of that in-house. 
But in the meantime, it's about 90% of it is now inside of our own our capabilities. And that allows us, for example, full player account management system. We just launched our new promotion engine. And I know someone like Mr. Portnoy is going to go crazy with stuff like that because you're going to come up with different ideas and different types of promotions. And if you typically have to wait on a third-party who is handling all this stuff for you, you get to the bottom of the list or it takes too long or the event has come and gone. So in our case, it gives us the maximum flexibility to be very creative, but then to be able to execute almost instantaneously. And I know this is one of the reasons, Jay, in addition to loving everything that we're doing, they love the brand, they love the users that we have, what we've built. But I think a lot of it is just thinking differently than what the traditional sports media and sports gaming companies how they think. 
And this really is a transformational deal. If it wasn't, it wouldn't be something that me or my family would have been interested in. And we're banking on having this amazing relationship with Penn and utilizing the resources of scale to really blow it up here in Canada and also to blow it up all across North America. And I don't think anybody -- and I don't care who we're talking about, has the same capabilities of what we now have with this triumph or with this tri-actor."

And so as you look at the different tech stack options that are in the market today, there are a lot of really good ones, but we're going to be on one that was built for the North American market and is going to be the most state-of-the-art, the freshest, the newest, the greatest, the most features out there. And we think that's going to allow us to leapfrog the competition as we go live in Canada very soon, and then bring it back to the U.S., which we anticipate happening in 2023. 
So I guess, the very last thing I would say about the tech stack is we have been partnered up with 2 really great companies in White Hat Gaming and Kambi, and this is not a knock against White Hat Gaming or Kambi. They've been great partners. They've been there for us, very responsive. They're great B2B companies. And -- but at the end of the day, we ultimately, given how important this is for the company's future and how important it is for us strategically, as we think about where and how we create value for our shareholders and stakeholders over the long term, we just have to be in control of our tech stack. And you've heard me say that on calls before, and we went out looking for the right tech stack. And what we ended up with is not only best-in-class tech stack but an amazing brand, an amazing company and gateway to what is a huge opportunity in Canada with one of the strongest sports brands in all of Canada. So we think we got the best of all worlds here."

Just to give people kind of how it could potentially work. We -- Barstool, we've never had the opportunity, as John was saying, to create things that would be specific for us because we're working with companies that serve multiple end users. But we talked about the Arizona Bowl, which we'll be controlling soup to nuts, for example, which we have the broadcast, we have everything you can name is up to us. So a scenario where we're able to create bets and things specific for them, put the content and highlight it on theScore, which serves all these people interested in gambling as well as us and be able to have things that nobody else can offer and coverage of the game that nobody else can offer and now the ability to create bets that we know we're going to focus on in the game. And this, the Arizona Bowl, is just really the beginning. It's one of the things people look a lot of times like why is Barstool doing Arizona Bowl. Well, since then, we've been approached by other sports leagues, some of the major 4 interested in giving us rights. But we are going to control the experience of the bets and be able to offer things that simply nobody else will even know is coming and they won't be able to react quickly. So it really gives us, again, the ecosystem from the beginning of the game, covering the game, in-betting during the game and then directing people a bet towards the game that will be totally unique."

And again, we're still finalizing the plan. But here's the way we're thinking about it currently, which I think is about as bulletproof as it gets, which is that theScore Bet is going to be going live in Ontario, whenever Ontario is",378,"Sure. Happy to, Shaun. And again, we're still finalizing the plan. But here's the way we're thinking about it currently, which I think is about as bulletproof as it gets, which is that theScore Bet is going to be going live in Ontario, whenever Ontario is ready to go, call it, December, January, already on their own PAM. John had said on his last earnings call with Benjie that they plan to be live on their own managed trading services platform sometime spring, summer of 2022, so call it in less than a year. And it gives us an amazing opportunity to make sure all of the technology is working as planned in a really, really important market and what we believe will be under high stress, high volume because of how strong theScore brand is in Canada. 
And at the time that we believe it's ready to bring back to the U.S. and convert our tech stack over, that's when we're going to do it. We think that will probably happen in 2023. Is it the beginning of '23 or middle '23? Not sure yet, but I would say we're highly confident it will be before football season of '23. But we want to make sure that we get this all right first, and we get it right in a market that is really important with high volume and high market share and Canada, Ontario is the perfect opportunity for us to do that. So that's the way we're thinking about it today, Shaun. And we'll obviously continue to update everybody on the call as we have more information. 
I think we all have a pretty good idea given the DraftKings SBTech conversion, I think, took around 18 months. And so it feels like that's probably about the right time frame for us as well, 18 to 24 months before we bring it back to the U.S. But with all of that said, as Dave just mentioned and John mentioned earlier, there's so much we can do that's complementary between now and then mainly as it relates to promotions and exclusive betting options and things of that nature. We don't have to wait to all be on the same tech stack to start executing on that now."

So just wanted to get your thoughts heading into the fall around, just where we sit as it relates to both your technology offering and the national scale side of what you wanted to do on the marketing front. I know you have talked over the last 6 months of getting more aggressive on regional and more pan-regional promotions. But obviously, there's some very large names coming with very, very big wallets into the fall that are also scaling really rapidly. So help us sort of outline both the competitive environment and how your competitive thinking is evolving."

So we -- and this is one of the things that I'm probably most proud of is that we went from not having a sports betting app at all 2.5 years ago to have launched our own in September of last year in Pennsylvania and have really scaled that",626,"Yes, happy to. So we -- and this is one of the things that I'm probably most proud of is that we went from not having a sports betting app at all 2.5 years ago to have launched our own in September of last year in Pennsylvania and have really scaled that across the 4 states that we're currently live in. And we've done a great job of that. Our iOS app rating is a 4.7 on a scale of 0 to 5, right up there with the top of the marketplace. So we're competing with DK, FanDuel and BetMGM as it relates to the overall experience. It's not like our product today has a poor experience. We've just been playing catch-up. So we launched, and you look at what we're going to have from a product perspective at the start of football season this year versus what we had last year, both as it relates to sports betting and online casino and it's not even comparable. So we think we're going to continue to be competitive. 
And again, I complemented Kambi and White Hat Gaming. They've been working their tails off with us over the course of the last 12 months to make sure that we had new features and a great UI/UX heading into football season this year. We're going to have same-game parlay, which is a huge, huge betting opportunity as it relates to NFL. We're going to have shareable bet slip, which is something that Dave and Dan have been asking for since the day we met years ago, and we finally can offer that, which makes it really easy for them to post what their bets are on social media. It's one click and you're into the Barstool Sportsbook with a populated bet slip. So there's a lot of things we're doing this year that we couldn't do last year. 
And then as it relates to online casino, we launched as quickly as we could, and we knew that we had to be live in Michigan at the same time everybody else was. So we rushed to do that. But admittedly, we don't have -- we didn't have the full complement of content at the time. And as you look at what we're going to be able to offer in the fall this year as it relates to online casino, it's going to be a much larger, wider library of content. We're also going to have Blackjack -- sorry, excuse me, Barstool-themed games both on the Blackjack side as well as slot content that we've been developing at our HitPoint Studio. That's going to be happening this fall as well. And then we're actually going to have custom live dealer, Barstool-theme live dealer in New Jersey, when we launch iCasino in New Jersey here in the next several weeks. 
So we've got a lot of really exciting things from a product perspective that are in the hopper, which is why, to the second part of your question, Shaun, we feel much more comfortable being more aggressive as it relates to not just getting the word out as it relates to Barstool but also spending some money to do things that we wouldn't have done last year because we didn't have the scale. You wouldn't sponsor a fight that has national appeal or you wouldn't do what our partners at Barstool are doing for the Arizona Bowl. You wouldn't have done that last year. There's things that we can do this year, and I don't want to share more because we have more that we're working on, but stay tuned. That will be, I think, broader and sort of really focused on widening the funnel even beyond what we did in 2020."

Understanding it's still early, there seems to be a dichotomy in my mind between the quality of theScore product, which is very strong, and then kind of the market share generated thus far in the U.S. How do you think about leveraging the product, the existing product in the U.S., to drive greater OSB iGaming share? Like do you combine that -- do you combine theScore product with Barstool to amplify existing Penn Barstool product in the U.S.? Or is it about putting money and promotion behind Score in the U.S. to get the name out there? The tech and vertical integration totally makes sense coming at this more from a B2C product standpoint, if that makes sense."

It makes total sense, Ben. And John, I don't want to speak for you on this one, but I know that we are absolutely in the same boat as it relates to how we launched in the U.S., which is that both Penn -- with Barstool Sportsbook as well as theScore, we have spent virtually nothing on paid marketing. And the reason why is that, one, we wanted to make sure, from our perspective, on the Penn side that we allowed Barstool to do their thing and really prove out the model, which we continue to do, and I think it's great a result. And also because we needed to have the right product and capabilities. And I know that John and the Levy family were very focused on making sure the product is right before you start spending to drive market share. And so we're not concerned with where market share has been, it's more -- our focus is where it's going to be. And I just know that the power of Barstool and the cross-promoting opportunities that they present, and Dave and Dan, it's, of course, nice that they love theScore technology and application and being able to put theScore on even a bigger stage in the U.S. than it's been because of the fact that it's now part of the same family, I think, is a huge opportunity. 
And I think it will play out, Ben, in terms of what's the strategy in the U.S., is it 2 brands from a sports betting standpoint or is it 1. We have plenty of time to figure that out, but I would expect to see improved market share results from both theScore Bet in the U.S. as well as Barstool's Sportsbook as we head into football season this year, and the product is better, and we have reasons to be marketing more aggressively than we did in 2020. John, anything you want to add to that?"
335919,1673363485,2364722,"Penn National Gaming, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","PENN Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Yes. First of all, yes, I think Jay's got it right. I mean our approach and Jay's approach have been different than most in the context of sort of buying your way to huge market shares and then just hoping that it's sustainable. And we've said right from",695,"Yes. First of all, yes, I think Jay's got it right. I mean our approach and Jay's approach have been different than most in the context of sort of buying your way to huge market shares and then just hoping that it's sustainable. And we've said right from the get-go that you lead with the product and you build the product. And for example, in the U.S., we've talked about mid-single-digit to low double-digit penetrations that we're going to build to. And we are on course building towards that over the history that we've had and where we are today. In Canada, obviously, it's going to be a bit of a different story or probably a lot of a different story because of how extensive the brand resonates. We've been around forever. Kids who are watching our TV network in Canada before we sold it to Rogers are now 20- and 30-year olds and betting on sports, right? 
So the infiltration in terms of the audience that we have on the app is -- you add up the other media companies in Canada and put them together, they don't come close to us. And even with the big U.S. brands coming into Canada, because I'm sure they're going to come because Ontario is the equivalent, in case you people don't -- aren't aware of it, of the fifth largest state in the U.S. So while all of us are jonesing to get into Texas, Florida, New York, et cetera, and we are looking at strategies to do that, we're sitting right here in our home turf with the equivalent of -- and when it's operating at the end of -- towards the end of 2021, we'll be the largest jurisdiction in North America for sports betting. So very, very exciting for us. 
So one of the reasons that I think Penn and Score hit it off so well is because of our approach to going after the market and doing it sensibly. And some of the stuff that Barstool's talking about now in terms of getting into a different way to present sports events. I think the key and what you should take away from that is you've sort of tossed away all the sort of traditional legacy ways that people are consuming sports content. We've built a whole company on the basis of just following the consumer and how he or she consumes sports content. The same thing follows, and this is why all the teams and leagues are desperately looking at new alignments and it's all about engagement because people just aren't consuming sports the same way they historically have. 
So start from a digital perspective, which I think is what Dave is talking about in terms of doing this bowl game and work it up from there. Start from the consumer, figure out how he's watching or participating or going to these games, what excites him and then provide the product to be able to do that. And I think one of the things that Jay referenced earlier is if you look out, we know what we're doing today. We're building this amazing product. We know what sports betting looks like. We're doing it differently than anybody else with this integration into the media space. And if you're picking on a box score or you want to make a bet, it's one click away. I mean you have this amazing ability to make wagers in game very quickly and efficiently. 
But that's -- we're just the tip of the iceberg. Like we're going to look back a year or 2 or 3 from now and say, we felt we were good then. We didn't -- we were just doing nothing then as compared to what it's going to look like. So when you start to view it differently, you view it from a digital mobile perspective rather than just the legacy traditional way of looking at sports and how people are consuming it, that's where the big parlay and that's where the big opportunity is. And I think that's why we're also excited about what's come together here in -- with Penn."

I think something, and this is Dave again from Barstool, that we've learned and Dan and I have learned and all the people at Barstool is our influence is really, really big. And through the years, we may be a little naive, but we would do deals with companies and it could be any vertical. It could be shelters with like high noon. I'd argue that one of you could say sort of a competitor, but Action Network was built on our back, like we had the churn in connection, nobody knew what it was, and we were promoting that actively that app. All the user base was built on Barstool promotion. You could look at Robin Hood. If you go look, where is the explosive user base from that. A lot of people point back at what we are doing with DDTG and the everyday trader and getting people involved, even our podcasts like Call her Daddy, things -- we have the ability to sort of king-make we have gotten better as the years where we stopped mentioning companies purposely because like why are we building other. 
We -- I think, a huge opportunity and the synergistic nature of this is we know how good theScore is. I've used it forever. Dan has used it forever. We know it's best-in-breed. We are going to turn that faucet on. And if we think theScore is big now like relatively speaking, I think we're going to turn that 10, 20x because all of a sudden, every time we talk sports, games, gambling, it's theScore, it's theScore, it's theScore. We haven't had that. So when we talk about how is it going to grow in the United States, to me, that's one of the biggest parts of this. It's people -- and John just kind of talked about this. To me, this deal is never about like, okay, what's the market share, anything like that. It's the perfect synergistic company we need to help each other and grow each other. So that -- in the United States, I expect theScore over the next year to -- I mean I don't really want to put a number on it, but we're going to make that a household, everybody will know what it is, everybody will use it for scores, news, all of that stuff. We purposely don't mention companies now because we know the effect we have when we basically bless it. So we plan on doing that, obviously, our full boat."

As I said before, they grew up, everybody here is on theScore, everybody. We compete -- we've never shied away from competing and these guys know that. We launched our TV network in the mid-90s up against your version of ESPN up here called TSN and Roger Sports Net. And we kicked their butt because we did things differently. And then when we launched -- moved into the digital space, people just came to expect that same level of authenticity, respect for the customer, just give them what they want. And we joke about it in the states, we're the most-used, least-known brand in the sports business. And we're kind of like the New York Rangers in New York, right? Everybody who loves the Rangers goes to the game, right? And we joke about that with respect to theScore, right? Because people who are on our app in the U.S. and who are betting through Score Bet into the Score Media app love that as well. So I think you're going to see an elevation.
I've always said, when we get into betting, and this is even before the Penn deal and the sort of arrangement that we -- and this collaboration that we're going to have all the time with Barstool is that sort of the rising tide will raise boats. Bedding will influence our ability to extend the brand in the U.S. and as we grow the brand in the U.S. betting will take off. And now we're supercharging this with everything that Penn brings to the table and Barstool. And in Canada, we're already there. I mean, in Canada, we just can't wait to unleash the power of our integrated betting operation, which will be, as Jay mentioned, under the same brand because that's what makes sense. And in the U.S., we're going to figure it out. And then we have the luxury of being able to figure it out because we're up and operating in the 4 states currently with Score Bet. And over the course of the next 12 months, we're -- I'm fully confident, we're going to be able to decide what's the best path and really decide that, not from me, Score or a Barstool, Penn, but focusing on the consumer and saying, how do we do that best?"

Jay, how are you thinking about the ever-changing lifetime value of customers, particularly now that you have a compelling iGaming product in studio with HitPoint? I know that's changed over the past couple of months.

And I think that there's a lot of different approaches to calculating LTV. We have -- let's just talk about with regard to Barstool. That brand is the most relevant sports media and entertainment brand for anyone aged late teens, early 20s through mid-30s. And when you think about the average age of who's on the Barstool Sportsbook today, the average age for us is late 20s. No one can touch that. I don't need to know what everyone else's database looks like. I just know they can't touch that. And we also know that the loyalty to Barstool is very, very high. And I think that LTV is too easily calculated today. If you win a customer over by spending on linear TV, and you get a customer on a rich promotion, and you're assuming you're going to keep that customer forever on an LTV basis, I think that's flawed, and I think that our ability to calculate LTV is much stronger because of the retention value and the fact that the average age is so much younger. 
And I think that theScore, not to overuse the term amplify, but it really does amplify that because of how strong they are on engagement and retention that you heard all of us talk about so far the live media, live betting experiences, the customized, personalized offerings and engagement. So LTV, we just -- I think as wide as the funnel has been, now we're going to be able to do a much better job. I think Erika articulates this very well of keeping people in the ecosystem once they're there. And theScore takes all of that to the next level, and I think LTV for us is going to be a real number, and we'll see how it plays out over time for everyone else. 
And Rita, I think that's it for the call. I really appreciate everybody joining us today. Excited to share with you the news. Erika, Dave, John, thank you for joining and just great to hear everybody's perspective. We're obviously really excited about this, and we're just getting started.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. As usual, I have here with me in Wyomissing, our CFO, Felicia Hendricks, our Head of Operations, Todd George and other members of my executive team who can help answer your questions during the Q&A session. 
As you can see from our earnings release and corresponding investor presentation, we achieved many significant milestones during the third quarter. We successfully launched the Barstool Sportsbook mobile apps in 5 new states, which more than doubled the size of our footprint. And just this week, we launched in Iowa, bringing our total to 10 live states. We also continue to grow and evolve our brick-and-mortar footprint. During the quarter, we opened Hollywood Casino York and Pennsylvania to strong initial results began to roll out our market-leading cashless, cardless and contactless 3Cs technology across the portfolio and have continued to see tangible benefits of our highly differentiated omnichannel strategy. 
On the core business side, the order was really a tale of 2 halves for us. July started off with the same positive momentum we saw in the second quarter with revenues up 10% over 2019 and adjusted EBITDAR up 40%. That momentum slowed beginning in the second half of August and into September due to Hurricane Ida, which affected us significantly in the South region and the regional flare-ups of the Delta variant, which combined impacted property adjusted EBITDAR and adjusted [ EBITDAR ] margins by an estimated $30 million and 85 basis points, respectively. 
Additionally, the other segment results reflect $7.5 million of expenses related to new state launches of the Barstool Sportsbook app that I mentioned earlier this quarter as well as $12.5 million for our share of the initial campaign expenses for the sports betting ballot initiative in California. Looking ahead, October reflects more of what we saw in the first half of the third quarter with strong property level performance across our segments with a few notable exceptions due to new competition in Colorado and Indiana and the residual effects of Pennsylvania's continued gaming expansion. 
Engagement among our younger demographic continues to be strong and is more than offsetting the decline we saw in our older demos in the quarter due to delta. Further, our VIP segment, which grew 33% year-over-year in the third quarter continues to outperform. Notably, our retail Barstool Sportsbook concepts are continuing to stimulate database growth and increase frequency of visitation in the younger segments while also boosting gaming and food and beverage spend. 
Our retail sports books are now #1 in handle market share in the states of Indiana, Iowa, West Virginia and Michigan and we're excited to announce the recent opening of 2 new retail sports books this week in Louisiana at LaBarge Baton Rouge and Boomtown New Orleans with more to come in the coming weeks. We cannot be more pleased with the momentum we are seeing in our Interactive business with monthly active users for the Barstool Sportsbook and casino growing over 6x what they were in September of last year. We have been able to achieve this growth while maintaining our disciplined approach to marketing, which has resulted in blended customer acquisition costs of under $100 for the year. 
In addition to our increased footprint, new features to the Barstool Sportsbook app, including Parlay Plus, which is same game Parlay and shareable bet slips have also driven performance. We are now seeing well over 100,000 bets per week on Parlay Plus, which is leading to higher engagement and higher hold rates and the shareable bet feature is really helping to leverage our strength in social media with over 140,000 bets shared last week alone. 
I'm pleased to say that the Barstool Sportsbook is now tied also for first among all mobile sports betting apps in the Apple Store -- Apple App store, excuse me, with a user rating of 4.8 on a scale of 5.0. 
With the return of football, we have successfully developed top 3 to top 5 handle market share positions in every state that has reported so far in September, while continuing our disciplined approach to marketing that I referenced earlier. In September, we proved the strength of our approach as 1 of only 3 operators in both Michigan and Pennsylvania to generate positive net gaming revenue despite a relatively unfavorable hold percentage versus the competition. Our Penn Interactive team, which has obviously been very busy this quarter, also rolled out a Barstool-branded live dealer studio in New Jersey, which for those of you that caught it was being played and live stream last night by Big Cat and Logan Paul for some pretty amazing content. And also last week, launched our first in-house developed digital eye casino game from our Hit Point acquisition called Barstool Blackjack. 
We expect these products to drive additional cross-sell from the Barstool audience with further iCasino upgrades on the horizon. All of this positive momentum will be greatly enhanced by our acquisition of the score, which officially closed on October 19. With Barstool's wide audience reach at the top of the customer acquisition funnel and the Score's ability to engage and retain sports fans with its highly complementary content, we're creating a one-stop destination for the consumer that simply doesn't exist today. 
In addition, as the #1 sports media app in Canada, the score is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the legalization of single event sports wagering in Ontario with the launch of the Score Bet when the market opens, which now looks likely to occur in Q1 of 2022. We anticipate the Score Bet app will be the brand we lead with in Canada, while we continue to lead with our Barstool Sportsbook app in the U.S. But both brands will mutually benefit from the marketing support of Barstool Sports and the integration with the Scores media app. 
Looking forward, we are focused on building a highly differentiated and fully integrated media and sports betting tech solutions with our partners at the score while opportunistically pursuing revenue growth, including new markets such as Ontario. Despite these significant planned investments in product and marketing and the delayed launch from what we initially anticipated in Ontario, we expect our Interactive business to generate a loss of only approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter. 
As I hope you've come to learn what really sets Penn apart from the competition is our strategy to buy and build, whether it's brands, experiences, loyal customers, products, tech stack, versus the renting of eyeballs via aggressive traditional marketing tactics. Our goal continues to be developing bespoke products and features with features and promos that are experiential, fun and differentiated, rather than relying primarily on paid advertising, our promos often include unique bets, branded merchandise and VIP Barstool experiences that simply can't be found elsewhere. We expect that this approach is the right long-term strategy and will result in a best-in-class margin profile and loyalty and retention. 
The power of our fully integrated omnichannel and media strategy was on full display during our successful promotion and event held in late August at our Hollywood Casino Aurora property. As you know, Illinois currently requires in-person registration for new mobile sports wagering player accounts at a casino. By featuring a special promotion on the Chicago Bears game, which culminated in a block party in the parking lot of our casino attended by key Barstool talent, we were able to drive nearly 10,000 first-time depositors over a 5-day period with minimal paid media expense. That 10,000 for context, compares to we were averaging about 25 to 30 per day up until that point. 
Finally, before turning it over to Felicia for a brief overview of our financials, I wanted to know how impressed we continue to be with the ability of our partners at Barstool Sports to leverage their growing and loyal audience by pursuing opportunities outside of traditional sports media or betting, starts unlocking huge new channels of future growth. One Bite Pizza is 1 of the highest selling products in the frozen food section at Walmart stores across the country. Incredibly, Barstool is now also representing over 135,000 collegiate athletes under the NCAAs new name image and likeness rules, and they're continuing to extend their established media footprint by securing the broadcast rights to the Arizona Bull as well as playing a prominent role in the recent Jake Paul versus Tyron Woodley fight on Showtime, which featured commentary from Dave and Big Cat during the broadcast. 
Now I'll turn it over to Felicia."

Revenues were 10% above the 3Q '19 levels and adjusted EBITDAR was 17% higher. There were a number of onetime items that affected results in the quarter, which Jay discussed earlier. A detailed breakout of these items can be found on Slide 5 of our earnings deck, which was posted on our website this morning. 
As Jay mentioned, we achieved a major milestone last month as we closed on our almost $2 billion acquisition of Score Media and Gaming and proudly welcome the Score team into our Penn family. We are excited about what lies ahead, and we continue our evolution into being North America's leading digital sports content and entertainment company. As for several housekeeping items, corporate expense which is reported in our other segment was $27.8 million in the quarter. Our cash rent payments were $228.5 million, cash taxes were $47.9 million and cash interest was $21.7 million. Maintenance CapEx was $52.3 million. And we remain on track and on budget for the opening of our second category for casino in Pennsylvania later this year, Hollywood Casino Morgantown. 
Our balance sheet continues to be a key asset for us as we remain focused on growth even following our acquisition of the Score. Total liquidity as of September 30, 2021, was $3.4 billion, consisting of $2.7 billion in cash and our $700 million undrawn revolver. Traditional net debt was $45 million, a decrease of $71 million during the quarter, principally due to repayments under our senior secured credit facilities. Our lease adjusted net leverage was 3.9x based on trailing 12-month EBITDAR. As a reminder of our roughly $2 billion purchase of the score, approximately $923 million was paid in cash, and we estimate the transaction was levering by 0.5 turn. As the delta outbreak reminded us in the third quarter, the environment remains uncertain while the future looks bright, and we believe we can continue to generate revenues and adjusted EBITDAR above 2019 levels, we continue to maintain our current policy of not providing guidance, and we will reevaluate quarter-to-quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jay."

With limited supplies available in New Orleans and basic utilities completely disabled our sister properties quickly helps to provide temporary housing and much needed provisions. 
In addition, our Penn National Gaming Foundation established the Hurricane Ida Emergency Relief Fund for team members to apply for financial assistance for immediate needs. Meanwhile, we continue to expand our support for our nation's heroes. One of our newest partner organizations is the Concussion Legacy Foundation, which launched a special project focused on CTE and PTSD research on veterans. In addition, in the wake of our country's withdrawal from Afghanistan, we are offering financial support to the no 1 left behind organization to provide funds to help Afghan special immigration Visa recipients with food, housing, clothing and a no-interest loan program, which helps immigrant families become self-sufficient. One of our fellows from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is hiring our Heroes program, which helps active military personnel transition back into civilian life, recently volunteered at Fort Pickett to help some of the 6,000 temporary refugees there learn new job search skills to help acclimate life in America. 
Also during the quarter, with female members comprising 44% of our corporate Board of Directors, Penn has been recognized by 2 separate organizations for its Board diversity efforts. We were named a champion of Board diversity by the form of executive women, the greater Philadelphia Ren's premier women's organization, and we will also be honored on November 10 at the women's Form of New York's annual breakfast of champions for leading the way of gender balance on corporate boards.

And the additional information we have at this point, looks like it's probably going to be more sometime in Q1, just call it, mid-Q1 is probably the best most updated information we have at this point. 
So that's that's that from a time line perspective. I think from an overall market perspective, we're obviously really excited. We're leading in Ontario with the preeminent sports digital media brands across Canada. We feel really good about that. And we're going to be launching aggressively there. We want to make sure that we really start at the starting line with everybody else, and we have a really big splash. We've got a great marketing launch plan in the works with the Levy family and our partners at the Score. 
I think, Joe, 1 of the things that really stands to benefit us is that there are some advertising restrictions in Ontario. So there will be a bit of a different market there. you can advertise your brands, but you can't lead with big discounting type promotions. We welcome that environment. We have a very loyal audience in Canada to the Score and what will be a Score bet similar to the loyalty we have with the brand that we lead with here in the U.S. with Barstool. 
So we expect to be a major player in Ontario when they're ready for us to go live. And we have a great plan in place. And honestly, if anything, the slight delay in launch allows us to launch with a product that we feel even better about and hopefully get even more content ready to go on the eye casino side in Ontario, assuming that they're ready to go live with sports and online casino at the same time."

It's been pretty public, and we've confirmed that we were definitely involved in the bidding process for Cosmopolitan. I think Cosmo really stands in a class of its own. That's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to potentially get your hands on 1 of the best-in-class assets really around the globe. And so that was imperative for us because we felt as though it checked several strategic boxes for us. Generally speaking, I don't think it's imperative that we have a Las Vegas strip asset given the differentiated approach that we have around omnichannel. 
I think that having representation across states throughout the U.S., it is absolutely a strategic imperative for us, and we've largely accomplished that goal. If we were to find the right asset at the right location in the right price, then, of course, we would be interested. We know that we have a very valuable regional database. We know with the right asset in Las Vegas that we could activate and really drive more of that visitation that's already organically finding its way to Vegas because people like to gamble, like to gamble and Vegas is the mecca. And so they're already going. It would be great if we had an asset where we could create some retention value when they're in Vegas. But we don't think that's such a strategic imperative that we would chase an asset or overpay. And that's how I feel currently. So we'll kick the tires, if there's something out there, we're going to be disciplined in our approach. And yes, I think you're going to have to pay a higher multiple for a Las Vegas Strip Opco than you would in most or all regional markets. 
But I think you have to be thoughtful and careful about that because as we all know, there's a lot more maintenance capital requirements and intensity for Las Vegas assets. And typically, when you are an Opco, your rent, your lease is largely fixed, not entirely, but largely fixed. And so if you're the 1 that's continuing to invest in the property, it takes away from the free cash flow and -- well, EBITDA and eventually free cash flow generation for the opportunity. So I just think there's a lot of variables. I think you have to look at it asset by asset, as they become available, if they become available. But you should assume that we are not going to be chasing anything that we don't believe we can get a good return on."

I think we're averaging 9% handle growth week over week from week 1 to week 9. So we're very happy with what we're seeing. 
I would also say that when you launch 5 states, which we did, and I don't think anybody else came close to that many launches for the start of football season this year because we were a bit late to the game in some of these states that you have deposit and match that bonuses that have to kind of work their way through the system. And so we have a $1,000 deposit and Betmatch that was offered in those 5 states for September, which obviously lowers your NGR after promotion. Your NGR, it takes about 4 to 5, maybe 6 weeks for that initial offer to kind of work its way through. 
What we're seeing in October, what we saw in October and are seeing in early November, is that obviously, there's a lot less promotional dollar flowing through, which means assuming that you have a more normal hold rates. And I think you probably heard Sean and we, like everybody else, definitely had a softer hold percentage in October. Favorites covered significantly the first 4 weeks that reversed itself. We had a very good final weekend, but the first 4 weekends hold rate was lower than normal. But if you sort of just look at an average hold and you look at what we were able to do in October and converting handle to GGR based on hold and then GGR to NGR, we feel really good about not only continuing to grow our handle market share but being able to grow our NGR market share. 
Now NGR, unfortunately, we would welcome this, but it's only reported in 2 states. So Michigan and Pennsylvania, you actually get a really good look as to how operators are running the business in terms of what's driving handle, what is GGR and ultimately in addition to paid media where we play a very different game than most everybody else. Also, how much of that handle is being driven by promotions. And so you can actually see what NGR looks like. 
Every other state, it's either just handle or a handle in GGR and you don't really have the visibility to NGR. So we feel, as you see that slide that shows the momentum we have on handle from week 1 through week 9, you should assume that we feel just as good and in some cases, even better of what the NGR trending looks like from week 1 to week 9, assuming a normal hold rate. 
Now Arizona to your last question. I have 0 visibility at this point into what the market looked like that has not been reported unless it came out this morning, but I have not seen that yet. As we compare Arizona to other state launches, I would say it's sort of for us, it's in the middle of the pack. It's better than some states, and it's not quite as good as some larger -- of the larger population states like Illinois and Pennsylvania for us."

We -- I feel as though our product offering currently is significantly better than it was when we launched in Pennsylvania and when we launched in Michigan. So we did have a little bit of paid media and promotion in Michigan around iC",558,"Yes. Great question. We -- I feel as though our product offering currently is significantly better than it was when we launched in Pennsylvania and when we launched in Michigan. So we did have a little bit of paid media and promotion in Michigan around iCasino because we know that the product is so much better than it was when we launched there in early 2021. So that tells you something, obviously, we feel from a product offering perspective. If you look at the library of flat content, the library of manufacture different manufacturer content, we have a much better offering today than we did. I still don't think our iCasino offering is where it needs to be. And I don't think it's ultimately as competitive with best-in-class product offerings in the states where we're live but it's getting a lot better. 
So we're going to continue to think about reinvesting and driving acquisition to online casino as we feel better and better about the product. We -- as I mentioned earlier, we just went live with live dealer in New Jersey that's actually Barstool themed and last night was amazing content watching Den Cat, Big Cat and Logan Paul and several others at Barstool were playing, live Blackjack all in the same room. And as a fan, you can watch them on the live stream, you can download the app if you're in a state where we're live like New Jersey where they were last night, and you can bet behind them, which is what a lot of people were doing behind Logan Paul and Big Cat and some of the other personalities at Barstool. 
So we can do things that others just simply can't do or don't have the personalities or content creators that anybody would care to bet behind. So I think from an online casino perspective, as we continue to develop and launch new products and the overall offering is more competitive. You're going to see us continue to ramp up how much we support that from a marketing standpoint. And I think you'll see our market share reflective of growth as we make those investments all around. We're already seeing momentum. And again, we are not where we ultimately want to be an online casino. 
But truth be told, and I think I've said this before, we had to prioritize. We relate to the online game in terms of launching products. We prioritize having a great and we've delivered on that a great sports betting products, 4.8 on a scale of 5.0 on the Apple App Store. We wanted to get live in as many states as possible. We have a great sports betting brand to lead with an amazing audience that we can activate and have done that. And ultimately, that ends up being the best acquisition tool you have for conversion from online sports to online casino. And so we've got a lot of runway in front of us. 
I would say, from a online sports betting perspective in terms of product and capability, we're probably third or fourth inning and still have lots of improvement in front of us that we're pursuing from an all-line casino standpoint, we're in the top of the first. We're nowhere near where we know we'll be and need to be, but we're making progress."

Here's the way that I would sort of describe 2022 and 2023 at a high level. I've said before that this is pre-acquisition of the score that we thought we would be breakeven or better from a Penn Interactive standpoint in 2022. I absolutely still stand by that. We have, however, acquired the score, and we're making real significant investments in the score around technology. And the score is already currently live on their own PAM in the U.S. and their own promotional engine. So far, so great. I mean, the results that they're seeing around not just stability and feedback and ratings are all good. But I think importantly, what they're finding already is that when you -- and this is why obviously, we're pursuing our own tech stack, but when you have your own PAM, you can really create personalization and customization. 
So it's almost as though, if you have 1 million customers in your ecosystem, you have 1 million sportsbooks, right? Everybody's experience is a bit different. And what they've been able to do already with their promotional engine and what they're seeing around retention value and people coming back to bet more often is pretty significant. Now it's early innings, but we're just encouraged by what we're seeing because we know that's just the tip for us in terms of what can be done. 
And so from a 2022 standpoint, we will not be profitable I'll wait to give a number on that until when we're providing maybe guidance for 2022. It won't be in the hundreds of millions negative. It will be under $100 million. I just don't have an exact number for you now. but it's going to be all around investing in product and technology stack. I think it also will depend on when we go live in Ontario because that's a huge revenue driver for us to offset some of those expenses that we're not able to offset yet as it relates to the score. 
So $20 million loss for Q4, more to come on 2022, you could probably annualize that 20% per quarter for 2022 to be safe for now. And I think we'll be there or better for 2022 even when you include the investments in tech stack, 2023 is going to be the year of hockey stick growth for us because everything comes together. The score is going to be live, completely vertical on their own tech stack, before football season '22. And then we have the whole football season and March Madness to make sure everything is as we want it to be, including managed trading services and risk management completely vertical and then we bring that tech stack back to the U.S., and we will convert over in the U.S. before football season in 2023. 
So profitability is definitely going to be there in 2023, and it would be there in '22 if we weren't also going vertical on tech stack, but we're happy to be doing that."

The breakdown between IDA and the Delta Varian, I'd say that we have a material amount of our EBITDAR generated from the Southern region.

Delta was kind of spread out, and there were pockets around the U.S. But we generate quite a bit from both Louisiana and Mississippi. So focus more of the IDA impact there. From 3Cs, so very early innings, you heard Jay used the analogy before, but we are so pleased with what we're seeing with each launch. 
So now we're 3 properties in Pennsylvania and to casinos and 2 racinos in Ohio. And with each launch, we're getting greater adoption. Initially, we thought we would see greater adoption from the younger demographics. But we're pleasantly surprised that it's actually going across all demographics. What we're seeing is that if you look at a normal guest to a casino, take that as your baseline, we're seeing great growth from people that are app users as well as even greater growth for people that are downloading the wallet and playing with wallet, a lot of that just comes from removing friction as well as increased time on device, not standing in line. So very early, and I think we'll have more to report in future quarters after we roll this out at other properties."

Great question, Barry. I would say a little bit of both. It really depends on which of those opportunities that you're talking about take the 1 bite frozen pizza as an example, and I'll only share of course, whatever Erika and Dave Portnoy have shared publicly. But they've sold hundreds of thousands of frozen pizzas just in the first few weeks of offering those in Walmarts across the country. I know it has blown away expectations and that Walmart, they know how to handle demand, but it's been overwhelming for them and a lot of the different geographies around the country. So that's probably an opportunity to do both. It's going to be good financially, but it also, importantly, is going to be great for just continuing to build out the brand in the top of funnel. Not everybody who's shopping for frozen pizza is already a Barstool fan or maybe in some cases, has even heard of Barstool. But there's a lot of social media buzz around frozen pizza and a lot of people sharing their purchases and ratings of the pizza. 
And so it's just a great brand builder. And I sort of put the other ones that we've talked about in the similar category, the stand-alone Barstool sports bars, which will essentially serve as because they'll be in markets where mobile sports betting is live and legal, they'll essentially serve as satellite sports books because we can make sure that it's a great digital experience inside of those sports bars and some people are going to go there to socialize. Some people are going to go there to meet up with friends, someone are going to go there to watch games and some people are going to go there to bet on games. 
So it really allows us to continue to build the brands, introduce new people to the brand. We're picking high-density population areas for these sports bars. We'll give exact locations later when Erika and Dave are ready to announce that. But the first 2 are going to be in the Philly area as well as in Chicago, and we anticipate both of those opening up in the next couple of months, unless something changes. And we've got several more in the queue. We'll share more details around current performance of the existing ones that open as well as our plans for building out new ones probably on our next call. But we're very excited about it. It's obviously a great opportunity. And again, it's something that we can do that really no 1 else in the space can because the Barstool brand has a different affiliation and base of loyal fans, who really care about the brands and feel like they're a part of the brand. And so whether you're talking about those 2 examples or NCAA collegiate athletes, where we're obviously building relationships with college athletes when they're relatively early in life and pre professional career. And I think that's great. 
Right now, it's all about Barstool and how Barstool can help them as a meat company and a lifestyle company. and down the road, maybe that evolves into a relationship around sports betting for those that are interested in betting on sports. So I think that it's probably for us primarily brand building but there's definitely going to be financial components to it as well, especially when you consider the average age of the sports app user with us is late 20s, I think 28.5 years old. I don't know whatever everyone else is. I know it's a lot older than that. And so as you think about lifetime value, we just want to continue to feed the funnel and 28.5 years old average age on the sports betting app is terrific when you think about what those spend levels may be when they're in their 30s and 40s."

We've been at this now for a while in Pennsylvania and actually in Michigan, close to a year. There's some really interesting facts that were sort of uncovering in the states where we're live with brick-and-mortar casinos as well as online casino, so call it, Pennsylvania and Michigan. One of the things that we're finding, which I find fascinating is that when you look at the online casino VIP business, roughly of that online casino VIP business were customers that we knew, we had a relationship with previously. But of that 50%, 60% of them had gone dormant, okay? So we've reactivated. This has been such an amazing reactivation tool for us. For whatever reason, they had gone dormant in our database, whether that was because they moved elsewhere in the state, or whatever reason it might be. They decided they didn't want to visit the casino anymore, but 60% of those that were reactivated or excuse me, 60% of them of the VIPs were reactivated who are no longer visiting our casinos as a regular customer. 
And 10% of those also started coming back to our brick-and-mortar casinos after they were reactivated with online casino. So that's really powerful as I take a step back and think about it. And you're definitely seeing I think it's been well reported that in the states that are live with online casino, you haven't seen the brick-and-mortar casinos in those states bounce back the same way versus 2019, as you have seen in states that don't have online casino offerings, I think that's to be expected. There's no doubt you get some people that are spending up, some are splitting wallet, some have moved over entirely to online casino. And I think that's why it's really important to run a profitable online business because if you're moving people and their spend around, you want to make sure, I mean, from our perspective, we're indifferent. You want to play online with us, great. You want to play in the brick-and-mortar. That's also great because we know we have best-in-class margin profile long term that we just want to develop the relationship and make sure we have best-in-class products.

Again, an opportunity to grow the database that can then be shared across our properties around the U.S. 
And similar with Detroit in the Michigan area. The Detroit area, we have a large amount of our database that 30- to 50-minute drive. So as we're growing that business, it's coming from outside of that zone as well."

And you don't know at the time you do the event, what is the motivator, is it to be in person with Dave and Dian and crew on property? Is it to just take advantage of the promotional offer and the bet on the bars. So we really -- we didn't know going in. We were expecting about 1,000 to 1,500 people to come in and visit us and deposit. So it obviously blew away our expectations I've been very pleased with the retention that we've seen from the 10,000. We saw a noticeable uptick from a handle perspective relative to the first few weeks of the football season. I think we ran this in week 4, if I'm not mistaken. And if you look at our Illinois handle in week 4, it was the best week we had, but week 5 through week 9 were all better than weeks 1 through 3 by a pretty good variant. 
So it's turned out to be, in hindsight, a great event. And we learned a lot from it. And I think it really shows the power of omnichannel when we do something that is maybe initially digitally focused, but you have an on-premise experiential event component to it, you can really put these opportunities on steroids and get more out of the events than you anticipated. So I think you can expect us to take the learnings and do more around that, not necessarily just aurora but other parts of the country, other states. 
And I think we've been -- it's been interesting, too. I think a big part of the reason why you're seeing this week over week over week handle growth for us from week 1 to week 9 is that we've been able to -- well, one, we're in more space, obviously. But number two, we've been able to get out, right? A year ago, we were live in 1 state and COVID was still keeping people mostly inside whereas right now, the bar store crew every week, we hit 1 of the 9 states that we're in, sometimes multiple times a week, and we're doing on-prem events. 
And if you looked at, I don't know how many of you saw it, but it'd be worth going back and looking at the game day events that the Barstool crude did last weekend at Michigan State and East Lansing. And if you look at the crowd that was at the Barstool event in apartment complex next door, the stadium versus the ESPN event, it wasn't even close. And that's exciting, but we weren't able to do that last year. And every week when we do these on-prem events, you see the states we're in, see a significant pop in first-time deposit -- registrations, first-time deposits, handle, and we're doing a much better job after the fact around retention because we've learned a lot around what works and what doesn't from last year being in 1 state to now having scale in 9 states. So feeling really good about that overall and lots more to come."

We're 1 of, I believe, it's 7 operators that are working on this ballot initiative together and everybody wrote the check. We'll have to see. I mean, it's California is, I think, the ballot initiative, I think the fact that upfront the way that the bill is constructed as well as a large portion of the taxes go back to really 2 areas: one, homelessness and mental health support, which is a big issue in a lot of states, California, in particular, as well as some of the dollars channel back to the tribal entities in California. So I think that it's been constructed in a way that is good for the state and good for those that operate casinos in the state today. It's going to take a little bit of time to play out. Obviously, we're going to be pretty deep into signature gathering mode here in the coming weeks and months. And there's been a little bit of opposition. So we're trying to understand that and we actually want to do this in a way where it's completely complementary to the ballot initiative that the this already had out there before we announced this valid initiative and the language around the valid initiative. So we're trying to make sure that we're doing this in a complementary way, and that we're including all of the right parties as we think about the California opportunities. 
So more to come. Obviously, very early, and I'll have more updates. I think quarter-to-quarter, we have a better feel for the polling already looks good, polling can change over time and signature-gathering effort. It's just going to take us a little bit of time to see where we are, but I feel good about the team, the dollars that we've put forth the campaign initiative. 
New York. So New York is an interesting one. I have discussed New York with my team at nauseam, and I've I feel the same way today that I felt day 1, which is I feel really mixed about New York because of the way that the gaming law is structured and the fact that the tax rate is being self-imposed with a minimum of 50%. And when you keep in mind that, that 50% tax is in addition to a really high license fee as well as that 50% tax is on gross pre promo spend, not net. I don't think anybody is going to make money operator. The state is going to make money. I don't think a single operator will make money in New York. So I've always struggled with the -- would you rather be in or not? 
I think objectively speaking, you'd probably rather be in than not be in, but it's 1 of those states where you're not in you're not crushed by that either maybe from a TAM perspective and from a revenue perspective, but I think it's just it's going to be a margin killer. I think it's going to be an EBITDA detractor. And New Jersey, we're live in and a lot of the New York residents live in North Jersey and Manhattan, which is easy to get over. And I think that competitively, New Jersey is just going to be able to do things and offer things that New York can't. 
I'm not saying anything that is -- I don't think -- I mean New York has their own progative in terms of how they want to structure the law, and they're pursuing that. And if we're in and we'll play by the rules, I think that if we end up as 1 of the operators in New York, that if nobody can make money, we'll lose the least because we can rely on the Barstool audience organically and turn that on and activate it in ways that we've done in other states without having to get into the paid media shotgun approach. I don't know who's going to be able to afford doing really any of that given the tax rate would be the highest in the country or at least tied with New Hampshire, and we know drafting has been clear. 
It's very difficult to make money in New Hampshire. So it's a long answer because it's a pretty complicated issue. That's our position on New York."

I think that it's very early to be declaring what's going to be in the next 5 years on either side, sports betting or online casino. I do think that companies that have built-in structural advantages. I think on the online casino side, that would be your existing casino operators. So obviously, in the states where iCasino is legal, have a built-in advantage of a database that they can market to. Just like the sports betting operators, the DFS companies and us with Barstool have a built-in advantage because you have a database you can market to organically. So market share, I think, is going to continue to shift around. It's obviously competitive. There will likely be some consolidation in the mix as well. So I don't have any reason to believe that the ultimate market share results in terms of fragmentation are going to look a whole lot different than over in Europe or parts of Europe. 
I don't know if there will be 30% or 40% operator, single operator market share sort of ""winter"" if it's going to be more lots that are in that sort of 10% to 20% market share. We'll have to see how it plays out, but I think that some companies have built-in advantages. The thing that's always tough also to peg Thomas around questions on all my casino is that there's really only 3 states of any real population that are live today. And those are continuing to, I think, evolve, and we'll see what market share looks like. I think even in those states that will look different in 2 years and 3 years than it does today, certainly from our perspective, we know because our product is only going to get better, and we can really take advantage of converting sports betters in those states as well as our database because in Michigan and Pennsylvania, we have casinos there. 
But I don't know what states are going to be live and legal. And obviously, there are some states where we are super well positioned. If it comes, we have 4 casinos in major markets in Ohio. We have the top-of-class assets in Louisiana in all of the major population centers in that state Missouri, we're very well positioned in Kansas City and St. Louis. The list goes on, Illinois, Indiana, we've got property -- multiple properties in so many of these states. So I think we're really well positioned but I think it's going to take a little bit of time to play out."

Thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. As usual, I have here with me in Wyomissing, our CFO, Felicia Hendrix, our Head of Operations, Todd George and other members of my executive team who can help answer your questions during the Q&A session. 
As you can see from our earnings release and corresponding investor presentation, we achieved many significant milestones during the third quarter. We successfully launched the Barstool Sportsbook mobile app in five new states, which more than doubled the size of our footprint. And just this week, we launched in Iowa, bringing our total to 10 live states. We also continue to grow and evolve our brick-and-mortar footprint. During the quarter, we opened Hollywood Casino, York and Pennsylvania. The strong initial results began to roll out our market-leading cashless, cardless and contactless 3Cs technology across the portfolio and have continued to see tangible benefits of our highly differentiated omnichannel strategy. 
On the core business side, the third quarter was really a tale of two halves for us. July started off with the same positive momentum we saw in the second quarter with revenues up 10% over 2019 and adjusted EBITDAR up 40%. That momentum slowed beginning in the second half of August and into September due to Hurricane Ida, which affected us significantly in the South region and the regional flare-ups of the Delta variant, which combined impacted property adjusted EBITDAR and adjusted EBITDAR margins by an estimated $30 million and 85 basis points, respectively. 
Additionally, the other segment results reflect $7.5 million of expenses related to new state launches of the Barstool Sportsbook app that I mentioned earlier this quarter as well as $12.5 million for our share of the initial campaign expenses for the sports betting ballot initiative in California. Looking ahead, October reflects more of what we saw in the first half of the third quarter with strong property level performance across our segments with a few notable exceptions due to new competition in Colorado and Indiana and the residual effects of Pennsylvania's continued gaming expansion. 
Engagement among our younger demographic continues to be strong and is more than offsetting the decline we saw in our older demos in the quarter due to delta. Further, our VIP segment, which grew 33% year-over-year in the third quarter continues to outperform. Notably, our retail Barstool Sportsbook concepts are continuing to stimulate database growth and increase frequency of visitation in the younger segments while also boosting gaming and food and beverage spend. 
Our retail sports books are now #1 in handle market share in the states of Indiana, Iowa, West Virginia and Michigan and we're excited to announce the recent opening of two new retail sports books this week in Louisiana at L’Auberge Baton Rouge and Boomtown New Orleans with more to come in the coming weeks. We cannot be more pleased with the momentum we are seeing in our Interactive business with monthly active users for the Barstool Sportsbook and casino growing over 6x what they were in September of last year. We have been able to achieve this growth while maintaining our disciplined approach to marketing, which has resulted in blended customer acquisition costs of under $100 for the year. 
In addition to our increased footprint, new features to the Barstool Sportsbook app, including Parlay+, which is same game Parlay and Shareable Bet Slips have also driven performance. We are now seeing well over 100,000 bets per week on Parlay+, which is leading to higher engagement and higher hold rates and the shareable bet feature is really helping to leverage our strength in social media with over 140,000 bets shared last week alone. 
I'm pleased to say that the Barstool Sportsbook is now tied also for first among all mobile sports betting apps in the Apple Store -- Apple App store, excuse me, with a user rating of 4.8 on a scale of 5.0. 
With the return of football, we have successfully developed top 3 to top 5 handle market share positions in every state that has reported so far in September, while continuing our disciplined approach to marketing that I referenced earlier. In September, we proved the strength of our approach as 1 of only 3 operators in both Michigan and Pennsylvania to generate positive net gaming revenue despite a relatively unfavorable hold percentage versus the competition. Our Penn Interactive team, which has obviously been very busy this quarter, also rolled out a Barstool-branded live dealer studio in New Jersey, which for those of you that caught it was being played and live streamed last night by Big Cat and Logan Paul for some pretty amazing content. And also last week, launched our first in-house developed digital iCasino game from our Hit Point acquisition called Barstool Blackjack. 
We expect these products to drive additional cross-sell from the Barstool audience with further iCasino upgrades on the horizon. All of this positive momentum will be greatly enhanced by our acquisition of theScore, which officially closed on October 19. With Barstool's wide audience reach at the top of the customer acquisition funnel and theScore's ability to engage and retain sports fans with its highly complementary content, we're creating a one-stop destination for the consumer that simply doesn't exist today. 
In addition, as the #1 sports media app in Canada, theScore is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the legalization of single event sports wagering in Ontario with the launch of theScore Bet when the market opens, which now looks likely to occur in Q1 of 2022. We anticipate theScore Bet app will be the brand we lead with in Canada, while we continue to lead with our Barstool Sportsbook app in the U.S. But both brands will mutually benefit from the marketing support of Barstool Sports and the integration with theScore's media app. 
Looking forward, we are focused on building a highly differentiated and fully integrated media and sports betting tech solutions with our partners at theScore while opportunistically pursuing revenue growth, including new markets such as Ontario. Despite these significant planned investments in product and marketing and the delayed launch from what we initially anticipated in Ontario, we expect our Interactive business to generate a loss of only approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter. 
As I hope you've come to learn what really sets Penn apart from the competition is our strategy to buy and build, whether it's brands, experiences, loyal customers, products, tech stack, versus the renting of [ eyeballs ] via aggressive traditional marketing tactics. Our goal continues to be developing bespoke products and features with features and promos that are experiential, fun and differentiated, rather than relying primarily on paid advertising, our promos often include unique bets, branded merchandise and VIP Barstool experiences that simply can't be found elsewhere. We expect that this approach is the right long-term strategy and will result in a best-in-class margin profile and loyalty and retention. 
The power of our fully integrated omnichannel and media strategy was on full display during our successful promotion and event held in late August at our Hollywood Casino, Aurora property. As you know, Illinois currently requires in-person registration for new mobile sports wagering player accounts at a casino. By featuring a special promotion on the Chicago Bears game, which culminated in a block party in the parking lot of our casino attended by key Barstool talent, we were able to drive nearly 10,000 first-time depositors over a 5-day period with minimal paid media expense. That 10,000 for context, compares to we were averaging about 25 to 30 per day up until that point. 
Finally, before turning it over to Felicia for a brief overview of our financials, I wanted to know how impressed we continue to be with the ability of our partners at Barstool Sports to leverage their growing and loyal audience by pursuing opportunities outside of traditional sports media or betting, starts unlocking huge new channels of future growth. One Bite Pizza is one of the highest selling products in the frozen food section at Walmart stores across the country. Incredibly, Barstool is now also representing over 135,000 collegiate athletes under the NCAAs new name, image and likeness rules, and they're continuing to extend their established media footprint by securing the broadcast rights to the Arizona Bull as well as playing a prominent role in the recent Jake Paul versus Tyron Woodley fight on Showtime, which featured commentary from Dave and Big Cat during the broadcast. 
Now I'll turn it over to Felicia."

Revenues were 10% above the 3Q '19 levels and adjusted EBITDAR was 17% higher. There were a number of onetime items that affected results in the quarter, which Jay discussed earlier. A detailed breakout of these items can be found on Slide 5 of our earnings deck, which was posted on our website this morning. 
As Jay mentioned, we achieved a major milestone last month as we closed on our almost $2 billion acquisition of Score Media and Gaming and proudly welcome theScore team into our Penn family. We are excited about what lies ahead, and we continue our evolution into being North America's leading digital sports content and entertainment company. As for several housekeeping items, corporate expense which is reported in our other segment was $27.8 million in the quarter. Our cash rent payments were $228.5 million, cash taxes were $47.9 million and cash interest was $21.7 million. Maintenance CapEx was $52.3 million. And we remain on track and on budget for the opening of our second category for casino in Pennsylvania later this year, Hollywood Casino Morgantown. 
Our balance sheet continues to be a key asset for us as we remain focused on growth even following our acquisition of theScore. Total liquidity as of September 30, 2021, was $3.4 billion, consisting of $2.7 billion in cash and our $700 million undrawn revolver. Traditional net debt was $45 million, a decrease of $71 million during the quarter, principally due to repayments under our senior secured credit facilities. Our lease adjusted net leverage was 3.9x based on trailing 12-month EBITDAR. As a reminder of our roughly $2 billion purchase of theScore, approximately $923 million was paid in cash, and we estimate the transaction was levering by 0.5 turn. As the delta outbreak reminded us in the third quarter, the environment remains uncertain while the future looks bright, and we believe we can continue to generate revenues and adjusted EBITDAR above 2019 levels, we continue to maintain our current policy of not providing guidance, and we will reevaluate quarter-to-quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jay."

Meanwhile, we continue to expand our support for our nation's heroes. One of our newest partner organizations is the Concussion Legacy Foundation, which launched a special project focused on CTE and PTSD research on veterans.

I think, first off, worth noting that we initially thought Ontario was going to be ready to go live probably in December.

I think, first off, worth noting that we initially thought Ontario was going to be ready to go live probably in December. And the additional information we have at this point, looks like it's probably going to be more sometime in Q1, just call it, mid-Q1 is probably the best most updated information we have at this point. 
So that's that from a time line perspective. I think from an overall market perspective, we're obviously really excited. We're leading in Ontario with the preeminent sports digital media brands across Canada. We feel really good about that. And we're going to be launching aggressively there. We want to make sure that we really start at the starting line with everybody else, and we have a really big splash. We've got a great marketing launch plan in the works with the Levy family and our partners at theScore. 
I think, Joe, one of the things that really stands to benefit us is that there are some advertising restrictions in Ontario. So there will be a bit of a different market there. you can advertise your brands, but you can't lead with big discounting type promotions. We welcome that environment. We have a very loyal audience in Canada to theScore and what will be Score Bet similar to the loyalty we have with the brand that we lead with here in the U.S. with Barstool. 
So we expect to be a major player in Ontario when they're ready for us to go live. And we have a great plan in place. And honestly, if anything, the slight delay in launch allows us to launch with a product that we feel even better about and hopefully get even more content ready to go on the iCasino side in Ontario, assuming that they're ready to go live with sports and online casino at the same time."

It's been pretty public, and we've confirmed that we were definitely involved in the bidding process for Cosmopolitan. I think Cosmo really stands in a class of its own. That's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to potentially get your hands on one of the best-in-class assets really around the globe. And so that was imperative for us because we felt as though it checked several strategic boxes for us. Generally speaking, I don't think it's imperative that we have a Las Vegas strip asset given the differentiated approach that we have around omnichannel. 
I think that having representation across states throughout the U.S., it is absolutely a strategic imperative for us, and we've largely accomplished that goal. If we were to find the right asset at the right location in the right price, then, of course, we would be interested. We know that we have a very valuable regional database. We know with the right asset in Las Vegas that we could activate and really drive more of that visitation that's already organically finding its way to Vegas because people who like to gamble, like to gamble and Vegas is the Mecca. And so they're already going. It would be great if we had an asset where we could create some retention value when they're in Vegas. But we don't think that's such a strategic imperative that we would chase an asset or overpay. And that's how I feel currently. So we'll kick the tires, if there's something out there, we're going to be disciplined in our approach. And yes, I think you're going to have to pay a higher multiple for a Las Vegas Strip OpCo than you would in most or all regional markets. 
But I think you have to be thoughtful and careful about that because as we all know, there's a lot more maintenance capital requirements and intensity for Las Vegas assets. And typically, when you are an OpCo, your rent, your lease is largely fixed, not entirely, but largely fixed. And so if you're the one that's continuing to invest in the property, it takes away from the free cash flow and -- well, EBITDA and eventually free cash flow generation for the opportunity. So I just think there's a lot of variables. I think you have to look at it asset by asset, as they become available, if they become available. But you should assume that we are not going to be chasing anything that we don't believe we can get a good return on."

Well, let me -- maybe I'll hit Arizona at the end, but I'll talk sort of at a high level. As you think about the launch of -- or the start of football season this year on September 9, as I mentioned earlier, we were live in nine states versus a year",641,"Yes. Well, let me -- maybe I'll hit Arizona at the end, but I'll talk sort of at a high level. As you think about the launch of -- or the start of football season this year on September 9, as I mentioned earlier, we were live in nine states versus a year prior zero. We went live in week 2 actually in Pennsylvania last year. So if you look at sort of revenue environment from week 1 of NFL and then all the way through to week 9 last week, and we have a slide on this in the investor presentation, we really have shown tremendous handle growth week over week over week. I think we're averaging 9% handle growth week over week from week 1 to week 9. So we're very happy with what we're seeing. 
I would also say that when you launch five states, which we did, and I don't think anybody else came close to that many launches for the start of football season this year because we were a bit late to the game in some of these states that you have deposit and match that bonuses that have to kind of work their way through the system. And so we have a $1,000 deposit in [ Betmatch ] that was offered in those 5 states for September, which obviously lowers your NGR after promotion. Your NGR, it takes about 4 to 5, maybe 6 weeks for that initial offer to kind of work its way through. 
What we're seeing in October, what we saw in October and are seeing in early November, is that obviously, there's a lot less promotional dollar flowing through, which means assuming that you have a more normal hold rates. And I think you probably heard Sean and we, like everybody else, definitely had a softer hold percentage in October. Favorites covered significantly the first 4 weeks that reversed itself. We had a very good final weekend, but the first 4 weekends hold rate was lower than normal. But if you sort of just look at an average hold and you look at what we were able to do in October and converting handle to GGR based on hold and then GGR to NGR, we feel really good about not only continuing to grow our handle market share but being able to grow our NGR market share. 
Now NGR, unfortunately, we would welcome this, but it's only reported in two states. So Michigan and Pennsylvania, you actually get a really good look as to how operators are running the business in terms of what's driving handle, what is GGR and ultimately in addition to paid media where we play a very different game than most everybody else. Also, how much of that handle is being driven by promotions. And so you can actually see what NGR looks like. 
Every other state, it's either just handle or it's handle in GGR and you don't really have the visibility to NGR. So we feel, as you see that slide that shows the momentum we have on handle from week 1 through week 9, you should assume that we feel just as good and in some cases, even better of what the NGR trending looks like from week 1 to week 9, assuming a normal hold rate. 
Now Arizona to your last question. I have zero visibility at this point into what the market looked like that has not been reported unless it came out this morning, but I have not seen that yet. As we compare Arizona to other state launches, I would say it's sort of for us, it's in the middle of the pack. It's better than some states, and it's not quite as good as some larger -- of the larger population states like Illinois and Pennsylvania for us."

We -- I feel as though our product offering currently is significantly better than it was when we launched in Pennsylvania and when we launched in Michigan. So we did have a little bit of paid media and promotion in Michigan around iCasino because we know that the product is so much better than it was when we launched there in early 2021. So that tells you something, obviously, we feel from a product offering perspective. If you look at the library of flat content, the library of manufacture different manufacturer content, we have a much better offering today than we did. I still don't think our iCasino offering is where it needs to be. And I don't think it's ultimately as competitive with best-in-class product offerings in the states where we're live but it's getting a lot better. 
So we're going to continue to think about reinvesting and driving acquisition to online casino as we feel better and better about the product. We -- as I mentioned earlier, we just went live with live dealer in New Jersey that's actually Barstool themed and last night was amazing content watching Den Cat's, Big Cat and Logan Paul and several others at Barstool were playing, live Blackjack all in the same room. And as a fan, you can watch them on the live stream, you can download the app if you're in a state where we're live like New Jersey where they were last night, and you can bet behind them, which is what a lot of people were doing behind Logan Paul and Big Cat and some of the other personalities at Barstool. 
So we can do things that others just simply can't do or don't have the personalities or content creators that anybody would care to bet behind. So I think from an online casino perspective, as we continue to develop and launch new products and the overall offering is more competitive. You're going to see us continue to ramp up how much we support that from a marketing standpoint. And I think you'll see our market share reflective of growth as we make those investments all around. We're already seeing momentum. And again, we are not where we ultimately want to be an online casino. 
But truth be told, and I think I've said this before, we had to prioritize. We were late to the online game in terms of launching products. We prioritize having a great and we've delivered on that a great sports betting product, 4.8 on a scale of 5.0 on the Apple App Store. We wanted to get live in as many states as possible. We have a great sports betting brand to lead with an amazing audience that we can activate and have done that. And ultimately, that ends up being the best acquisition tool you have for conversion from online sports to online casino. And so we've got a lot of runway in front of us. 
I would say, from a online sports betting perspective in terms of product and capability, we're probably third or fourth inning and still have lots of improvement in front of us that we're pursuing from an online casino standpoint, we're in the top of the first. We're nowhere near where we know we'll be and need to be, but we're making progress."

Here's the way that I would sort of describe 2022 and 2023 at a high level. I've said before that this is pre-acquisition of theScore that we thought we would be breakeven or better from a Penn Interactive standpoint in 2022. I absolutely still stand by that. We have, however, acquired theScore, and we're making real significant investments in theScore around technology. And theScore is already currently live on their own PAM in the U.S. and their own promotional engine. So far, so great. I mean, the results that they're seeing around not just stability and feedback and ratings are all good. But I think importantly, what they're finding already is that when you -- and this is why obviously, we're pursuing our own tech stack, but when you have your own PAM, you can really create personalization and customization. 
So it's almost as though, if you have 1 million customers in your ecosystem, you have 1 million sportsbooks, right? Everybody's experience is a bit different. And what they've been able to do already with their promotional engine and what they're seeing around retention value and people coming back to bet more often is pretty significant. Now it's early innings, but we're just encouraged by what we're seeing because we know that's just the tip for us in terms of what can be done. 
And so from a 2022 standpoint, we will not be profitable I'll wait to give a number on that until when we're providing maybe guidance for 2022. It won't be in the hundreds of millions negative. It will be under $100 million. I just don't have an exact number for you now. but it's going to be all around investing in product and technology stack. I think it also will depend on when we go live in Ontario because that's a huge revenue driver for us to offset some of those expenses that we're not able to offset yet as it relates to theScore. 
So $20 million loss for Q4, more to come on 2022, you could probably annualize that 20% per quarter for 2022 to be safe for now. And I think we'll be there or better for 2022 even when you include the investments in tech stack, 2023 is going to be the year of hockey stick growth for us because everything comes together. TheScore is going to be live, completely vertical on their own tech stack, before football season '22. And then we have the whole football season and March Madness to make sure everything is as we want it to be, including managed trading services and risk management completely vertical and then we bring that tech stack back to the U.S., and we will convert over in the U.S. before football season in 2023. 
So profitability is definitely going to be there in 2023, and it would be there in '22 if we weren't also going vertical on tech stack, but we're happy to be doing that."

From 3Cs, so very early innings, you heard Jay used the analogy before, but we are so pleased with what we're seeing with each launch. 
So now we're three properties in Pennsylvania and two casinos and two racinos in Ohio. And with each launch, we're getting greater adoption. Initially, we thought we would see greater adoption from the younger demographics. But we're pleasantly surprised that it's actually going across all demographics. What we're seeing is that if you look at a normal guest to a casino, take that as your baseline, we're seeing great growth from people that are app users as well as even greater growth for people that are downloading the wallet and playing with wallet, a lot of that just comes from removing friction as well as increased time on device, not standing in line. So very early, and I think we'll have more to report in future quarters after we roll this out at other properties."

It really depends on which of those opportunities that you're talking about. Take the one bite frozen pizza as an example, and I'll only share of course, whatever Erika and Dave Portnoy have shared publicly. But they've sold hundreds of thousands of frozen pizzas just in the first few weeks of offering those in Walmarts across the country. I know it has blown away expectations and that Walmart, they know how to handle demand, but it's been overwhelming for them and a lot of the different geographies around the country. So that's probably an opportunity to do both. It's going to be good financially, but it also, importantly, is going to be great for just continuing to build out the brand in the top of funnel. Not everybody who's shopping for frozen pizza is already a Barstool fan or maybe in some cases, has even heard of Barstool. But there's a lot of social media buzz around frozen pizza and a lot of people sharing their purchases and ratings of the pizza. 
And so it's just a great brand builder. And I sort of put the other ones that we've talked about in the similar category, the stand-alone Barstool sports bars, which will essentially serve as -- because they'll be in markets where mobile sports betting is live and legal, they'll essentially serve as satellite sports books because we can make sure that it's a great digital experience inside of those sports bars and some people are going to go there to socialize. Some people are going to go there to meet up with friends, someone are going to go there to watch games and some people are going to go there to bet on games. 
So it really allows us to continue to build the brands, introduce new people to the brand. We're picking high-density population areas for these sports bars. We'll give exact locations later when Erika and Dave are ready to announce that. But the first two are going to be in the Philly area as well as in Chicago, and we anticipate both of those opening up in the next couple of months, unless something changes. And we've got several more in the queue. We'll share more details around current performance of the existing ones that open as well as our plans for building out new ones probably on our next call. But we're very excited about it. 
It's obviously a great opportunity. And again, it's something that we can do that really no one else in the space can because the Barstool brand has a different affiliation and base of loyal fans, who really care about the brand and feel like they're a part of the brand. And so whether you're talking about those two examples or NCAA collegiate athletes, where we're obviously building relationships with college athletes when they're relatively early in life and pre professional career. And I think that's great. 
Right now, it's all about Barstool and how Barstool can help them as a media company and a lifestyle company. and down the road, maybe that evolves into a relationship around sports betting for those that are interested in betting on sports. So I think that it's probably for us primarily brand building but there's definitely going to be financial components to it as well, especially when you consider the average age of the sports app user with us is late 20s, I think 28.5 years old. I don't know whatever everyone else is. I know it's a lot older than that. And so as you think about lifetime value, we just want to continue to feed the funnel and 28.5 years old average age on the sports betting app is terrific when you think about what those spend levels may be when they're in their 30s and 40s."

We've been at this now for a while in Pennsylvania and actually in Michigan, close to a year. There's some really interesting facts that were sort of uncovering in the states where we're live with brick-and-mortar casinos as well as online casino, so call it, Pennsylvania and Michigan. One of the things that we're finding, which I find fascinating is that when you look at the online casino VIP business, roughly half of that online casino VIP business were customers that we knew, we had a relationship with previously. But of that 50%, 60% of them had gone dormant, okay? So we've reactivated. This has been such an amazing reactivation tool for us. For whatever reason, they had gone dormant in our database, whether that was because they moved elsewhere in the state, or whatever reason it might be. They decided they didn't want to visit the casino anymore, but 60% of those that were reactivated or excuse me, 60% of them of the VIPs were reactivated who are no longer visiting our casinos as a regular customer. 
And 10% of those also started coming back to our brick-and-mortar casinos after they were reactivated with online casino. So that's really powerful as I take a step back and think about it. And you're definitely seeing I think it's been well reported that in the states that are live with online casino, you haven't seen the brick-and-mortar casinos in those states bounce back the same way versus 2019, as you have seen in states that don't have online casino offerings, I think that's to be expected. There's no doubt you get some people that are spending up, some are splitting wallet, some have moved over entirely to online casino. 
And I think that's why it's really important to run a profitable online business because if you're moving people and their spend around, you want to make sure, I mean, from our perspective, we're indifferent. You want to play online with us, great. You want to play in the brick-and-mortar. That's also great because we know we have best-in-class margin profile long term that we just want to develop the relationship and make sure we have best-in-class products. But I'll pause there and see if Todd has anything he wants to add to that."

The other thing we're very uniquely positioned in the states that are offering online gaming because we don't have a brick-and-mortar presence in New Jersey. So a lot of this is really a brand-new business to us. A lot of it drives the database and then we can mobilize those people around the country to our operations. And then in Pennsylvania, the bulk of the population residing in and around Philadelphia our properties are not located close to Philadelphia. So a lot of that represents brand-new play as well. Again, an opportunity to grow the database that can then be shared across our properties around the U.S. 
And similar with Detroit in the Michigan area. The Detroit area, we have a large amount of our databases within that 30- to 50-minute drive. So as we're growing that business, it's coming from outside of that zone as well."

We were we were very curious to see what kind of retention value we would have with the 10,000 given that it was driven around an event. And you don't know at the time you do the event, what is the motivator, is it to be in person with Dave and Diane",542,"Yes. We were we were very curious to see what kind of retention value we would have with the 10,000 given that it was driven around an event. And you don't know at the time you do the event, what is the motivator, is it to be in person with Dave and Diane and crew on property? Is it to just take advantage of the promotional offer and the bet on the Bears. So we really -- we didn't know going in. We were expecting about 1,000 to 1,500 people to come in and visit us and deposit. So it obviously blew away our expectations I've been very pleased with the retention that we've seen from the 10,000. We saw a noticeable uptick from a handle perspective relative to the first few weeks of the football season. I think we ran this in week 4, if I'm not mistaken. And if you look at our Illinois handle in week 4, it was the best week we had, but week 5 through week 9 were all better than weeks 1 through 3 by a pretty good variance. 
So it's turned out to be, in hindsight, a great event. And we learned a lot from it. And I think it really shows the power of omnichannel when we do something that is maybe initially digitally focused, but you have an on-premise experiential event component to it, you can really put these opportunities on steroids and get more out of the events than you anticipated. So I think you can expect us to take the learnings and do more around that, not necessarily just Aurora but other parts of the country, other states. 
And I think we've been -- it's been interesting, too. I think a big part of the reason why you're seeing this week over week over week handle growth for us from week 1 to week 9 is that we've been able to -- well, one, we're in more space, obviously. But number two, we've been able to get out, right? A year ago, we were live in one state and COVID was still keeping people mostly inside whereas right now, the Barstool crew every week, we hit one of the nine states that we're in, sometimes multiple times a week, and we're doing on-prem events. 
And if you looked at, I don't know how many of you saw it, but it'd be worth going back and looking at the game day events that the Barstool crude did last weekend at Michigan State and East Lansing. And if you look at the crowd that was at the Barstool event in apartment complex next door, the stadium versus the ESPN event, it wasn't even close. And that's exciting, but we weren't able to do that last year. And every week when we do these on-prem events, you see the states we're in, see a significant pop in first-time deposit -- registrations, first-time deposits, handle, and we're doing a much better job after the fact around retention because we've learned a lot around what works and what doesn't from last year being in one state to now having scaled in nine states. So feeling really good about that overall and lots more to come."

We're one of, I believe, it's seven operators that are working on this ballot initiative together and everybody wrote the check. We'll have to see. I mean, it's California is, I think, the ballot initiative, I think the fact that there's significant license fees upfront the way that the bill is constructed as well as a large portion of the taxes go back to really two areas: one, homelessness and mental health support, which is a big issue in a lot of states, California, in particular, as well as some of the dollars channel back to the tribal entities in California. 
So I think that it's been constructed in a way that is good for the state and good for those that operate casinos in the state today. It's going to take a little bit of time to play out. Obviously, we're going to be pretty deep into signature gathering mode here in the coming weeks and months. And there's been a little bit of opposition. So we're trying to understand that and we actually want to do this in a way where it's completely complementary to the ballot initiative that the tribe's already had out there before we announced this ballot initiative and the language around the ballot initiative. So we're trying to make sure that we're doing this in a complementary way, and that we're including all of the right parties as we think about the California opportunities. 
So more to come. Obviously, very early, and I'll have more updates. I think quarter-to-quarter, we have a better feel for the polling already looks good, polling can change over time and signature-gathering effort. It's just going to take us a little bit of time to see where we are, but I feel good about the team, the dollars that we've put forth the campaign initiative. 
New York. So New York is an interesting one. I have discussed New York with my team at [ nauseam ], and I've -- I feel the same way today that I felt day one, which is I feel really mixed about New York because of the way that the gaming law is structured and the fact that the tax rate is being self-imposed with a minimum of 50%. And when you keep in mind that, that 50% tax is in addition to a really high license fee as well as that 50% tax is on gross pre promo spend, not net. I don't think anybody is going to make money operator wise. The state couldn't make money. I don't think a single operator will make money in New York. So I've always struggled with the -- would you rather be in or not? 
I think objectively speaking, you'd probably rather be in than not be in, but it's one of those states where you're not in you're not crushed by that either maybe from a TAM perspective and from a revenue perspective, but I think it's just it's going to be a margin killer. I think it's going to be an EBITDA detractor. And New Jersey, we're live in and a lot of the New York residents live in North Jersey and Manhattan, which is easy to get over. And I think that competitively, New Jersey is just going to be able to do things and offer things that New York can't. 
I'm not saying anything that is -- I don't think -- I mean New York has their own prerogative in terms of how they want to structure the law, and they're pursuing that. And if we're in and we'll play by the rules, I think that if we end up as one of the operators in New York, that if nobody can make money, we'll lose the least because we can rely on the Barstool audience organically and turn that on and activate it in ways that we've done in other states without having to get into the paid media shotgun approach. I don't know who's going to be able to afford doing really any of that given the tax rate would be the highest in the country or at least tied with New Hampshire, and we know drafting has been clear. 
It's very difficult to make money in New Hampshire. So it's a long answer because it's a pretty complicated issue. That's our position on New York."

I think that it's very early to be declaring what's going to be in the next five years on either side, sports betting or online casino. I do think that companies that have built-in structural advantages. I think on the online casino side, that would be your existing casino operators. So obviously, in the states where iCasino is legal, have a built-in advantage of a database that they can market to. Just like the sports betting operators, the DFS companies and us with Barstool have a built-in advantage because you have a database you can market to organically. So market share, I think, is going to continue to shift around. It's obviously competitive. There will likely be some consolidation in the mix as well. So I don't have any reason to believe that the ultimate market share results in terms of fragmentation are going to look a whole lot different than over in Europe or parts of Europe. 
I don't know if there will be 30% or 40% operator, single operator market share sort of ""winner"" if it's going to be more lots that are in that sort of 10% to 20% market share. We'll have to see how it plays out, but I think that some companies have built-in advantages. The thing that's always tough also to peg Thomas around questions on all my casino is that there's really only three states of any real population that are live today. And those are continuing to, I think, evolve, and we'll see what market share looks like. I think even in those states that will look different in two years and three years than it does today, certainly from our perspective, we know because our product is only going to get better, and we can really take advantage of converting sports betters in those states as well as our database because in Michigan and Pennsylvania, we have casinos there. 
But I don't know what states are going to be live and legal. And obviously, there are some states where we are super well positioned. If it comes, we have four casinos in major markets in Ohio. We have the top-of-class assets in Louisiana in all of the major population centers in that state Missouri, we're very well positioned in Kansas City and St. Louis. The list goes on, Illinois, Indiana, we've got property -- multiple properties in so many of these states.
