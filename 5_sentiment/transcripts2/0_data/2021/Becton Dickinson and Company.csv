We are very pleased with our Q1 results, which were ahead of our expectations, reflecting the tremendous efforts and execution of BD's 70,000 associates, the essential role of our products and solutions in health care and the greater resiliency of the health care system in treating both COVID and non-COVID patients.
While our fiscal year has just started, I'm proud of the team for the momentum we are building and their dedication to our purpose of advancing the world of health.
Revenues increased 25.8% on a reported basis or 24.3% on an FX-neutral basis, with 20.3 percentage points of growth coming from our COVID-19 diagnostic revenues. While we did see some benefits from timing in the quarter, we are very pleased with the performance of the base business, which was up 4% against the backdrop of COVID resurgences around the world. We are seeing the early benefits of some of the actions we have taken to drive our base performance.
Our adjusted EPS were $4.55 or up 72% versus the prior year. This was also well above our expectations as a result of 3 factors. First, our revenues came in above our plan, driven by higher acuity driving increased demand, greater resiliency and procedural volumes and exceptional execution in COVID diagnostics. Second, we benefited from favorable product mix, like Veritor, but also from our higher-acuity products. Third, our investment spending, such as in R&D, was lighter and earlier in ramping. So as you can see, we started this year with strong momentum, and that is despite the COVID resurgence. We did start to see some impact of the resurgence on our more elective procedure-related businesses late in December, and that continued into January. However, we are feeling more confident in the resiliency of our base business relative to what we saw early on in the pandemic. While the health care markets continue to be dynamic with COVID-19, and there are a number of moving parts, the momentum within BD and our conviction in our strategy lead us to raise our financial guidance for fiscal 2021. Our focus is not only on fulfilling our near-term commitments, but also on advancing our strategy and creating value for our shareholders over the longer term. And I'm feeling even greater confidence with the progress the BD team is making in advancing the BD 2025 Grow, Simplify and Empower initiatives and our ability to create substantial shareholder value. 
Today, I want to focus my remarks on 3 key topics, and then I'll turn it over to Chris, who will provide additional remarks on our quarter's performance and comment on our outlook, then we'll take your questions. So let's jump right in.
First, let me start with the Alaris remediation and our overall quality and compliance initiatives. Alaris remediation has and continues to be my #1 priority, and the team is making strong progress. Our focus remains on submitting a comprehensive 510(k) filing for the Alaris system, and we remain on track to submit it in late fiscal Q2 or early fiscal Q3 2021. We also continue to make progress on executing our holistic Inspire Quality initiatives throughout the organization. Second, as you know, we have a very strong focus on growth and ensuring a durable mid-single-digit revenue growth profile, so let me share some of the exciting highlights in our pipeline and other growth initiatives.
We continue to increase our investments and strengthen our pipeline across 3 innovation themes that leverage our core strengths. First, we're applying smart devices, robotics, analytics and AI to improve care processes. Second, we're enabling new care settings to enhance patient experience and lower costs. This includes investing in products designed for use in the home markets and in sales channels to support these patients. And third, we're investing to improve diagnosis and treatment of chronic disease.
So in line with these innovation and investment priorities, in Q1, we acquired the medical assets of CUBEX, which expands our medication management offering by combining a cloud-based, easy-to-deploy analytics platform with a smart tabletop dispensing device to create solutions for the fast-growing non-acute care market. This extends our medication management solution from the hospital into the long-term care surgery centers and other non-acute locations. Another smart device we plan on launching this quarter is the Sensica automated urine output system, which leverages BD's leading position in acute urology, along with BD's broad EMR interoperability capabilities and installed base. 
Also within BD Interventional, the BD PureWick urine collection system and catheter continues to be a significant driver of growth for our urology and critical care business. PureWick is a female external urinary catheter and urine collection system that we sell into the acute care and long-term care settings, but we're now actively extending that directly to patients with our new PureWick dry dock system for the home. And this launch is exceeding our expectations. And in fact, PureWick revenues now exceeds Lutonix.
An exciting launch later this year, designed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer, is the U.S. launch of our new BD COR with our BD Onclarity HPV assay with extended genotyping. With BD COR, BD is going to enter the high-throughput molecular testing market with a very unique, fully automated sample-to-answer platform in a highly differentiated assay with unique claims that can improve risk stratification and support risk-based patient management. The system has been CE Mark-ed and has been very well received by our customers during our launch in Europe.
These are just a few of the many products in our pipeline, and you can find further details on our new innovations in the supplemental earnings presentation posted to our website.
As we've previously shared, we're investing a portion of our Veritor profits to advance our BD 2025 strategy. We expanded the size of the BD Innovation and Growth Fund, and additional innovation projects are being initiated on a rolling basis. We are investing to accelerate our simplification initiatives, including recode and enhancing our quality and compliance programs. We're also increasing funding in our BD University to support advanced employee education and leadership development as part of our strategy. As we always do with our spending, we're taking a disciplined approach, and the timing of the spending was lighter in Q1, and we expect it to step up in Q2 and remain higher for the balance of the fiscal year.
As we've mentioned before, we continue to actively evaluate tuck-in acquisitions to supplement our growth strategy. And we executed on 3 strategic tuck-in transactions so far this year, including CUBEX' medical assets that I mentioned earlier. We continue to apply a disciplined financial and strategic evaluation process to these transactions and have a robust funnel up.
Lastly, I'd like to update you on our COVID diagnostics outlook and specifically Veritor. Antigen testing continues to become more widely used in both traditional and nontraditional settings. We have been highly successful with our BD Veritor Plus COVID-19 launch. Veritor has been well received for the ease of use, performance and automated digital data and informatics capabilities that are provided with our handheld platform. We've nearly tripled our active reader base since the pandemic and now have more than 70,000 BD Veritor analyzers globally, which we intend to leverage in the future with planned non-COVID menu expansion, which we've already begun investing behind. As previously shared, we continue to make good progress on advancing new COVID diagnostics in our pipeline, including combination flu A/B and COVID-19 assays on both BD MAX and Veritor. We also continue to explore home testing on BD Veritor. It has been our practice we'll provide updates to these programs upon launch.
Turning to the quarter's performance. Our Q1 COVID-19 diagnostics revenues were higher than we expected at $867 million, which included better-than-expected BD Veritor rapid point-of-care antigen test revenues of $688 million and higher BD MAX COVID assays and collection swabs and transport devices. The higher-than-expected Veritor revenues were the result of our ability to scale our manufacturing faster, which is a testament to our manufacturing excellence, as well as realizing higher pricing than we anticipated.
However, since we've been saying since last fall, we do expect pricing to move lower as capacity came online, and this is what's playing out. We recently lowered our pricing to allow the broadest patient access to our best-in-class BD Veritor Plus System. We believe this price adjustment is in the best interest of our customers and patients around the world as we've now ramped our manufacturing capacity and there are emerging mutations that are making it more transmissible. We also believe this is in the best interest of our shareholders as we believe this move allows us to maintain a leadership position in the point-of-care market.
With respect to our fiscal 2021 Veritor revenue guidance, as we've been discussing, there continues to be many variables at play besides the evolving pricing environment, including the rollout and adoption of vaccines and the circulation of new COVID variants. It's also difficult to pinpoint when the market supply for antigen tests will exceed market demand. For modeling purposes, we would suggest using an ASP in the low to mid-teens. Given all this, we expect Veritor revenues to be toward the high end of our previous range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. We continue to expect Veritor revenues to be more weighted to the first half of our fiscal year. And given the evolving pricing and capacity environment, we would expect our fiscal Q2 revenues to be lower than our just reported Q1 results.
Before turning it over to Chris to review the financials, I want to close with a few thoughts. While we were very pleased with the performance of Veritor and other COVID diagnostic revenues in the quarter, what excites us more was the improving momentum and resiliency of the base business. While we saw some headwinds in our procedure-based businesses from the resurgence late in December and that continued into January, the impact was much more limited than at the start of the pandemic. Moreover, given the momentum in our base business, the investments we are making in our BD 2025 strategy, we believe we are positioned to emerge strong. We remain on track to submit our Alaris 510(k) filing in late fiscal Q2 or early Q3, and we're making great progress in advancing our BD 2025 strategy. And I'm particularly pleased with the investment programs we've identified and initiated. These investments allow us to further fulfill our purpose of advancing the world of health, bringing new innovations to patients and expand access. Increased spending will be more evident in our P&L later in this fiscal year, but we believe these initiatives will translate into revenue accretion beginning in late FY '22 and beyond.
The investments we are making are also towards simplification initiatives, which reduce complexities, drive cost efficiencies, enhance our quality programs and improve cash flows. This quarter, we made several advancements on this front, including inventory reductions that we absorbed in our gross margin in the quarter that helped us strengthen our cash flows. Our ReCoDe efforts are on track to achieve our targeted $300 million in cost savings by the end of fiscal 2024.
We're also advancing our sustainability initiatives because we view sustainability as a strategic imperative. And we recently announced the first of our 2030 and beyond goals, our climate change targets. We're committed to reducing Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 46% by 2030 and to be carbon-neutral across direct operations by 2040. The science-based target is aligned with the 1.5-degree C global emissions reduction pathway. And we look forward to sharing more detail behind our 2030 sustainability plan with you in future engagements. 
And finally, I'm very proud of the organization for being named for 4 consecutive years to the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality list and for the second straight year to the Gender Quality Index. Inclusion and diversity is an important focus for BD as we continue to attract, develop and retain the best talent as well as benefit from diversity of background and thought.
I look forward to answering your questions during the Q&A portion of this call, and I'll turn it over to Chris now."

We are very pleased with our fiscal first quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share performance, both of which exceeded our expectations. Total revenues were over $5.3 billion",1795,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are very pleased with our fiscal first quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share performance, both of which exceeded our expectations. Total revenues were over $5.3 billion, in line with our January 12 pre-announcement. Revenues increased 25.8% on a reported basis and 24.3% on an FX-neutral basis. COVID-19 diagnostic revenues accounted for 20.3 percentage points of growth.
The better-than-expected performance came from 3 areas: first, our base business performed better than expected. This was a result of stronger execution from our associates, greater resiliency and procedure volumes as health care facilities manage both COVID and non-COVID patients, and higher acuity resulted in both favorable product mix and increased demand for several product lines. Keep in mind, though, that some of our business segments are still operating below pre-COVID volume levels. Second, our COVID diagnostic revenues were higher than expected. This included not only Veritor revenues but also MAX and swab and transport revenues. Lastly, we estimated about $100 million in revenues were attributable to stocking and timing. As COVID-19 surges were occurring, we observed some of our customers moving to more of a just-in-case level of inventory and maintaining higher levels of our critical-need products on hand. We also saw some of our U.K. customers buying more ahead of Brexit. The $100 million includes higher-than-expected revenues in our MMS Infusion Systems business due to COVID-19.
BD Medical revenues totaled nearly $2.3 billion and grew 6.9% on an FX-neutral basis. Our outperformance was primarily in Medication Delivery Solutions as well as in Medication Management Solutions. MDS revenues were up 5.6%. While hospital utilization remains below pre-COVID levels and has been an ongoing headwind, we benefited from the acuity of care associated with the treatment of COVID patients. We saw increased demand for Pyxis vascular prep and maintenance. As I mentioned, we believe stocking of critical-need products helped the quarter. Finally, as expected, there was $37 million in revenues associated with COVID vaccination syringes and needles.
Now turning to our MMS business. Revenues grew 8.4%, with growth in both Medication Dispensing and Infusion Systems. In dispensing, we had strong growth internationally and once again exited the quarter with strong committed contracts in the U.S. in Infusion Systems, we continue to support U.S. customers' response during the pandemic on the medical necessity and experienced another quarter of strong demand in Europe. In Diabetes Care, revenue growth of 5.4% was above our expectations, reflecting distributor inventory stocking in addition to an easy comparison to last year. We still view this business to be more of a flattish business on a normalized basis. Pharm systems sales remained strong, growing 9.5%, driven by ongoing demand for our market-leading prefilled syringe portfolio.
BD Life Science revenues totaled nearly $2 billion and were up 74.1% on an FX-neutral basis. As I mentioned previously, COVID diagnostic revenues were $867 million in the quarter. Excluding COVID diagnostic revenues, BD Life Sciences revenues were down 2.4%, which was better than we expected. 
Integrated Diagnostic Solution revenues increased by 106% due to COVID-19 diagnostic testing revenues. Excluding these COVID diagnostic testing revenues, IDS revenues were down just 1.2%. There were several puts and takes in the base business. We saw a stronger-than-expected performance in our specimen management, blood culture and women's health and cancer product lines. We also saw some element of distributor stocking that's critical to health care testing. However, while we have seen improvements, routine diagnostic testing activities are not fully back to pre COVID-19 levels and a significantly lighter flu season negatively impacted the base revenue growth in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.
Now turning to Biosciences. Revenue declined by 5.2% due to a difficult comparison as a result of prior year licensing revenue. In addition, clinical and research activities are not yet fully back to pre COVID-19 levels. Overall, operational performance in Biosciences was better than expected. 
BD interventional revenues totaled nearly $1.1 billion and were up 5% on an FX-neutral basis, with all business units posting growth. We observed that elective procedures, particularly those conducted in an outpatient setting, had greater resiliency in Q1 compared to the initial wave of COVID. This was likely driven by processes and care settings that enable elective procedures to continue despite the resurgence and a greater willingness on the part of patients to attend to their scheduled elective procedures.
Surgery sales were up 1.3% as strong sales growth in our Infection Prevention business was offset by the ongoing headwinds related to lower procedures due to the pandemic.
Peripheral Intervention sales were up 5.9%. Growth was driven by strong performance across our peripheral arterial disease platforms.
Urology and Critical Care turned in another quarter of strong growth, with revenues up 8%. PureWick continues to fuel the growth in our acute urology franchise while our new connected Arctic Sun System is driving double-digit growth in our targeted temperature management business. This is another example of BD leveraging our digital capabilities and broad EMR interoperability footprint to bring new innovations to market.
Now turning to the P&L. We were really pleased with our gross margin performance in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margins were 58.2%, which expanded 170 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. On an FX-neutral basis, our gross margin expanded 250 basis points, which was primarily driven by COVID diagnostics and higher-acuity products.
While SSG&A and R&D spending were both higher on a year-over-year basis, the level of spending was lower than we anticipated, particularly R&D, reflecting mainly timing. Operating margins were 31.6%, up 830 basis points on an FX-neutral basis, which was driven by higher gross margins and reduced SG&A and R&D spending.
Net interest expense was $118 million, down slightly on a sequential basis. Other income was $30 million versus $27 million a year ago, and the adjusted tax rate came in at 14.6%, which was in line with our expectations. Our adjusted non-GAAP EPS were $4.55. 
In fiscal Q1, the preferred shares are dilutive. Therefore, in calculating the adjusted non-GAAP EPS, preferred dividends amount of $23 million was excluded from the numerator, while the diluted share count would be adjusted to include the dilutive impact of the convertible preferred shares and would be 299.1 million.
As we've been discussing, our BD 2025 strategy includes a focus on driving cash flow, and we were really pleased with the continued progress of these initiatives and our cash flow performance. We generated $1.5 billion in cash flow from operations in the quarter and $1.3 billion in free cash flows. We have also been focused on strengthening our balance sheet. As we previously communicated, we paid down $265 million of debt in the first fiscal quarter. Our net leverage ratio declined to 2.5x as of December 31, 2020, from 3.0x at the end of September 2020. A few weeks ago, Moody's upgraded our credit to an investment-grade rating, and we are committed to maintaining a full investment-grade credit rating across the major credit rating agencies.
We believe we are approaching a turning point in our capital allocation. In the past, a significant amount of our cash was dedicated to repaying the debt. But looking ahead, we expect to have greater flexibility to refocus our cash deployment on growth opportunities, including tuck-in M&A and other capital deployment options.
Next, I want to address fiscal 2021 guidance. While we observed greater resiliency in Q1 as it relates to procedure volumes, we still view COVID-19 resurgences to be a significant risk factor to our forward outlook as it could impact general health care utilization, procedure volumes and diagnostic testing, including COVID testing. In the latter weeks of December, as the resurgence has picked up, we started to see pressure on some of our procedure-based products. This trend continued into January. We have updated our guidance to incorporate some impact from the resurgence into our forecast for fiscal Q2, and we continue to monitor the trends.
Our guidance continues to assume no major system-wide shutdowns of elective procedures. Now given the strength of our Q1 performance, along with our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are comfortable forecasting FX-neutral revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12% compared to our prior range of high single to low double digits. This would include our assumption of Veritor revenues being towards the high end of our original guidance range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
Using current exchange rates, we expect FX to add approximately 200 basis points to revenue growth versus our prior year guidance of about 100 basis points. We expect our non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2021 to be in the range of $12.75 to $12.85, which is above our prior guidance range of $12.40 to $12.60, a raise of $0.30 at the midpoint of the range. So for these reasons, while we are extremely pleased with our strong execution in fiscal Q1, we want to caution against extrapolating our fiscal Q1 revenue, margin and EPS performance going forward. While we are not giving quarterly guidance, we thought it might be helpful to provide some context on this quarter's strength as you contemplate phasing for the rest of the year.
Our Q1 revenues, operating margins and adjusted EPS are likely to be the highest absolute levels for the year due to 2 factors: Veritor pricing and the ramp of our planned investment spending. In addition, the stocking of $100 million will unwind in the remainder of the year. As Tom mentioned, we expect Veritor revenues in fiscal Q2 to be lower than Q1. As we have discussed in the past, we expected our COVID test pricing to decline, and this is playing out. We expect Veritor to be well positioned for broad access as we look ahead.
Regarding our operating margins, our fiscal Q1 EPS benefited from the higher Veritor revenues and margin profile as well as the timing of investment spending. We expect investment spending, particularly in R&D, to be meaningfully stepped up in Q2. The combination of these 2 factors will result in our operating margins moving into the low to mid-20s in our fiscal Q2.
In the second half of the year, given our expectations for lower Veritor revenues and for investment spending to continue to ramp at a similar rate to fiscal Q2, we would expect operating margins in the low 20s. We're also seeing some impact from the resurgence in January. And like many others, we are also continuing to see pressure from higher shipping costs as well as some other headwinds. However, due to the strength of our Q1 results, we're able to offset these headwinds and raise our full year EPS guidance.
With that, I'll turn it back to Kristen, who will help moderate our Q&A."

We had 20% reinvestment of that upside in the model, even when you make those kind of adjustments as well as stocking, it's still a little hard to reconcile the upside in the quarter relative to the guide. So I appreciate it's a less visible environment. But is there anything else? Is that investment going higher? Or anything else we may not be thinking about that would explain why we're not getting this sort of that pull-through in the second, third quarter?

We watch those -- that spending with some prudence as we looked at the pandemic playing out. And so we got started, but the ramp really comes in the second, third and fourth quarter.
And so when you put all of that into context, you also have to take into consideration a little bit of impact from the resurgence that we saw that we mentioned we have playing out in Q2.

I know it's a challenging question. And then the ability to sort of manage through what's likely going to be sort of a volatile or void-driven earnings period as you head into '22? How are you thinking about sort of '22 and beyond COVID-wise and sort of managing the earnings process?"

Let me maybe focus on specifically COVID testing, and then Chris can make some broader comments on the broader business. And we've shared, by the way, in the past, we still remain very confident and expect our revenues, excluding COVID diagnostic testing, and Alaris pump revenues to grow in those mid-single digits on an FX-neutral basis for '22, and that remains our aim and our expectation.
In terms of COVID testing as we go into '22, certainly, as I'd shared before, as we got into COVID rapid testing in last July, obviously, we didn't have a high expectation that there would be much testing in '22. And as kind of each quarter has gone -- has passed since that launch in July, we've said we're feeling more confident there's going to be some level of testing in FY '22, and that certainly remains the case.
I think what -- one of the ways to think about, as our capacity has gone up in the space, as we recognize the new strains coming in the market, as antigen testing continues to increase in its receptivity and people understand now the value in increasing ways of getting a test result in 15 minutes, you saw us take some actions this quarter to get pricing in that low to mid-teen level, which we think will be more actually position us well to, as I said, to maintain a leadership position for whatever market continues to evolve going into FY '22, right? That's part of the thinking. Where the actual market ends up in '22? I don't know at this point in time. I think there definitely should be some level of testing. And our aim is to make sure that we're positioned to be a leader in however that testing evolves. And other things that we're investing in as well, be it our combination assay, which is progressing well in our pipeline, the flu COVID assay for our exploration of home testing are all aimed with that thought in mind as well. So maybe, Chris, just maybe some broader comments on FY '22."

We do",372,"So yes, obviously, we're not going to go through '22 with any level of precision, but I think it is important to give some high-level comments on it. And as Tom mentioned, the level of COVID testing is a variable that will have a big impact on '22. We do see the sustainability of testing, but at what level, it's really hard to guess at this point. In addition, there's a lot of other uncertainty around COVID in general, the resurgences, mutations, the uptake of the vaccines. And in our business, obviously, Alaris and when that comes back in '22 will have an impact.
I would remind you that on our November call we said we expected our revenues, excluding COVID diagnostic testing and the Alaris pump revenues, to grow in mid-single digits on an FX-neutral basis. And we continue to see that as a reasonable assumption. We can't predict when the FDA clearance for Alaris and our focus on making a comprehensive filing to support a timely approval is there, but we would expect some clearance sometime in fiscal '22.
We'd also not look at the second half of '21 as a proxy of what to expect in '22 because both the gross and operating margins are impacted by several factors. Our operating margin in fiscal '21 reflects these incremental investments we're making as part of the investment program of Veritor that really helps drive durable growth aligned with our 2025 strategy. And we don't expect those investments to continue into '22, so they'll exit -- exiting '21, they'll roll off and that should help margins going into '22.
The other thing I'd point out is that Q1 fiscal '22 will obviously be the most difficult comp from a margin perspective, given the very strong quarter we just reported. For example, most likely face the most difficult comparison with COVID revenues as well as from the impact of the timing and stocking that we talked about. So we would expect our operating margin to compress year-over-year from the 31.6% that we just achieved. So we'll update you more on our thoughts on '22 as we progress through the year, but we just thought it's important to provide some of those highlights."

I think one way to think about that is what I mentioned about '22 is that we expect the base business to be ramping at a mid-single digits. So that's consistent with that. So I think that we feel the underlying business is solidly in that kind of perspective. And as we talked about the base business, we expect to be kind of in that low to mid-single-digit level for the full year. And so there is some pressures in the second half of the year on a business-by-business basis. As you think about MMS, there will be some issues. It's going to be lumpy in the remaining quarters. MMS had a significant amount of revenue in the third quarter during the pandemic last year. Other parts of the business will ramp nicely. China, for example, as we lap the COVID impact that really was in Q2 there in China, so we'll start seeing some revenue growth from that. But again, that's more of a compare. It's not an indication of the underlying business. But the underlying business really is in that low to mid-single-digit basis. We have some general issues with -- compare to the -- based on the Alaris ship hold. Some of that's been negated by medical necessity. So there's a number of factors going on. But the bottom line of it all is think about the base business, for the remainder of this year in that low to mid-single digits and exiting into '22 in the mid-single-digit basis."

We were very proud of the fact that we really focused on cash during the pandemic. And if you look back, in fact, at the third quarter of last year, our cash flow actually increased year-over-year despite the fact that the revenues were suppressed from COVID. And that was the result of a number of actions that we took in the business around inventories, receivables, payables. And so we're very proud of that. We're really focused on cash.
As we mentioned at your conference last month, Robbie, we paid down $265 million of debt. That kind of gets us down to the target. So we see the leverage ratio floating down naturally without the need to pay down debt, which really says that the $5 billion-ish that we've paid down debt over the last couple of years, that strong cash flow that we're generating will be available to allocate to other value enhancements. So we've talked about primarily the tuck-in M&A and share repurchase. And as we get through this pandemic and as that safety net of cash that we've had to ride out the pandemic isn't as necessary, we'll have the ability towards the end of this year. And you've seen our tuck-in M&A ramping up, the pipeline is good. We continue to look at a number of opportunities. And by the end of this year, I think we'll be also talking about giving that cash back to shareholders. Because once we get through this period, we don't see the need to build up cash on the balance sheet. And so we would be returning that to shareholders after a certain amount of tuck-in M&As. So this puts us in a very good position. We've got great cash flow generation and better than ever, and that puts us in a great position to allocate that appropriately."

So on the revenue side on Veritor, so I think the key thing to talk about there is the pricing comment that I made is one big piece that drives that, right? We said we were above 20% in the last quarter. And as we think about looking forward, we talked about modeling low to mid-teens. So that's the #1 adjustment there. And again, we've been -- that's not new news at all the fact that we've been talking about that we expect pricing to head in that level as our capacity comes online and we're in a better cost position, et cetera. And as more capacity is coming into the marketplace, and so we've taken actions as planned. And that is why we gave guidance. It said expect the revenues to be highly weighted to the first half of the year, and we've said that from day 1. I think there remains uncertainty around the effectiveness and timing of the vaccines, especially with additional variants that are out there, et cetera. But we can't predict what's going to happen there on the second half of the year. And so we remain projecting that there will be very strong demand for antigen testing in the first half of the year and that the second half of the year is less certain. Obviously, if demand stays very high and depending on the dynamics with capacity and demand and how those curves cross over, maybe there could be an opportunity in the back half of the year, but it's way too early for us to think about that as -- because it's far from certain or able to be confirmed. So our aim is to position ourselves to be a leader in the space however it ends up evolving. And as we go forward, there'll be more clarity there, but certainly a very dynamic environment.

As we think about the rest of the year, you would expect that COVID testing to moderate as you model that out, obviously. And then don't forget you also have the unwind of the timing that we saw of the $100 million in Q1. That unwinds in the remainder of the year. But the most important thing is the ramping of investments that we have discussed. So we're investing in R&D. We're investing in quality. We're investing in the Veritor reinvestment program. And all of those things kind of ramp in Q2, Q3 and Q4. And so don't think about that as an indication of our pre-pandemic margins. It's just completely different. And then those investments go away into '22. The beauty of it is they begin to drive improvements in growth, in revenue generation, in margin expansion, and those things will kick in towards the latter half of FY '22. So you get the pickup in margins by them going away and then the benefit of those investments in driving revenue growth and margin improvement going forward.

As we think about opening up businesses and schools and other things, people are going to look at what different types of testing technology they can use, and our aim is to make sure that things are available to health care systems as needed. So we're doing that. And we've also shared, right, we're actually depreciating those assets within the year. So that as things unfold in '22 and '23, those assets won't be burdened on our P&L because we're able to fund that within the profits that are generated within this fiscal year. So that's our approach. Nothing more than that. We -- at this point, we probably don't want to comment more on the home space other than to mention that we are actively exploring that, has been our practice as we advance our work in that and the combination assays that we've shared that are in development. We'll really end up sharing more about those as we actually gain EUA and head towards launch if those occur. So I think that's it. Maybe we do have Dave Hickey on the phone. I can pause. And Dave, I don't know if there's any other comments to add from you."

So first off, just as a reminder, we have nothing in our forward-looking plan for BTK approval, right? It's not in our '21 plan. It's in no forward-looking outlook that we have as we think about how we model things within the company. Today, Lutonix revenues are less than 1% of our overall BD revenue. And this indication, specifically, again, is not included in our forecast.
As we go into the panel, and Simon will share more detail on this, the one thing that we have is we know this is a highly underserved market, and we know that our clinical trial data shows very strongly that it's safe, that Lutonix is safe in this patient population. I think it's the first product that's gone through a trial in the U.S. that has the ability to do that. Now the question is, are the clinical outcomes that were shown in our trial sufficient enough for it to be warranted for an approval? And so Simon, let me turn it over to you to talk a little bit more about that."

And the data that we're providing is demonstrating continued safety of the Lutonix product.
In relation to -- we did request the panel meeting, as you know, below-the-knee patients with critical limb ischemia are in a very bad way. It's the most serious form of peripheral arterial disease. They have multiple comorbidities. And some of the most important things for this patient population are: a, options; and b, an opportunity to expand the gap between these frequent interventions that they will have. So as we move into panel, certainly, there will be a debate around the clinical data that we've acquired. But I think, more importantly, this is another tool in [indiscernible] of tools that clinicians have for BTK intervention. If you think back 20 years ago, an SFA or intervention, there were PTA balloons and off-label stents. And today, there's a wide range of technology available to them all the way up to balloons and drug-eluting stent. But in BTK today, as I said, the most serious form of peripheral arterial disease, there is 1 product available, and that's PTA. So we're not suggesting this is the silver bullet for all BTK patients. We're suggesting that this is another tool that can enhance the outcomes for different patients and equip physicians to assess each and every patient and have yet another tool to treat them with. So the panel is on February 17. We've gone through a comprehensive preparation for it, and we'll absolutely put our best foot forward on that day to [indiscernible] of our application."

So a couple -- let me start with just overall R&D effectiveness, and I can get a little bit of color on the types of initiatives that we're investing in here and also how we think about our overall innovation system. So",659,"Truly. Yes. Good and fair question. So a couple -- let me start with just overall R&D effectiveness, and I can get a little bit of color on the types of initiatives that we're investing in here and also how we think about our overall innovation system. So as you know, John DeFord joined us as our Chief Technology Officer about 3 years ago. And really, under his leadership, there's been tremendous progress within the organization and with the segment teams, the business teams in advancing our ability to drive innovation. Actually, over that time period, we've gone from kind of the midpoint of not being where we wanted in terms of on-time milestone delivery or on-time launches to being as we benchmark ourselves to being in the top quartile within the industry of hitting our milestones and, most importantly, hitting our launches, right? Our launches are now about 80-plus percent of our launches are on time, which is up very notably over the last 3 years, up over 30 percentage points or around 30 percentage points, in fact.
So we see the progress being made. And that's the result of a lot of system improvements, new capabilities brought in, taking some of the best practices actually from Bard and the acquisition and applying those across the company. So that's something we're going to continue to build upon. As we think about the innovations that we're investing in, as we look at those, there's not -- there's a few, as I think about them, kind of new to world innovations that are in our pipeline. I mean, one is some of the ones we've already talked about, right, non-COVID menu expansion on Veritor and MAX to take -- to capitalize on our expanded footprint. We have a strong track record of developing new assays on MAX and Veritor, right? It's just examples of that.
Other initiatives are accelerating programs that we already had in our pipeline and allowing them to come to market a year or 2 earlier than we originally projected. That's an area of investment that we're making, and there are a number of areas in each of the segments which we're accelerating new products into the pipeline, but they're all very much in line with our strategy and areas that we're confident that we have internal capabilities in. Of course, what we are also doing that's complementing that is that tuck-in M&A strategy that I mentioned before. And we do think about often, and we'll have those discussions internally, if technologies are better developed in-house or that we should be going outside because we have -- we don't have those capabilities in-house. And we'll either look at do they exist today in someone else's pipeline and is that an opportunity for tuck-in M&A? Or do we need to be doing collaborations with outside groups. And many of -- there's many R&D programs that we have today, I think probably a record level of R&D programs where we have external partnerships in place. Actually, the BD COR would be one that I mentioned before. We have very strong external partnerships with the robotics because that's a very advanced automation system. And so we brought in robotic experts that helped us with that launch, and it's going really well in Europe. And we'll bring it to the U.S. here, but that's one that we probably wouldn't have been able to develop in the same way if we had tried to do it on our own, but we're seeing successes with that approach, and we're seeing it in many other areas as well. So that's kind of maybe just a little bit of color, Larry, in how we think about it overall. But with that progress that we've made and the way that we've thought through making these investments and how we also think about where it's smarter for us to do tuck-in M&A, we're confident in those investments."

And so we think about that holistically and where pricing as a result of that is going today and where we best position our products to remain a leader in that, and that's how we develop it, and we spend a lot of time thinking those things through as to when and how we optimize our pricing, again, to also serve what is a continued evolving customer base as more nontraditional areas of health care getting to -- wanting to do antigen testing and making sure that it's appropriately priced to enable the broadest access to the product while we're still in the middle of a pandemic.

So to your point, there have been obviously several newly identified variants reported recently, and there could well be others, right, recognizing that this is an RNA virus, very much like influenza and HIV that are known to mutate. And for us, we've got 2 different types of platforms, right? So we've obviously got the BD Veritor antigen test. We've got the BD MAX and molecular PC assays.
So let me take MAX first. So for BD MAX and for the assays that we have on the MAX, we've already completed an in-silico analysis, which is a computer model based on sequencing and to look at those mutations. And from everything that we can see around those mutations and the lineage of the sequence, we have no impact on the BD MAX assays.
For BD Veritor, which is obviously more a minor assay based on the top of the protein, based on early analysis again there, we have no evidence to show that the U.K., South African and, indeed, Brazilian variant will have an impact on the test. But we continue to take actions to look at that, further confirm and monitor the performance. And again, we've done that for the ones that are already out there and any potential new emerging strains. And this is a critical topic for us because I think the thing to remember here is as these variants come online and come out, which are reportedly more transmissible, it makes the importance of rapid testing and access to testing as important, if not more important, than ever."

We are very pleased with our Q1 results, which were ahead of our expectations, reflecting the tremendous efforts and execution of BD's 70,000 associates. The essential role of our products and solutions in health care and the greater resiliency of the health care system in treating both COVID and non-COVID patients. 
While our fiscal year has just started, I'm proud of the team for the momentum we are building and their dedication to our purpose of advancing the world of health. 
Revenues increased 25.8% on a reported basis or 24.3% on an FX-neutral basis, with 20.3 percentage points of growth coming from our COVID-19 diagnostic revenues. While we did see some benefits from timing in the quarter, we are very pleased with the performance of the base business, which was up 4% against the backdrop of COVID resurgences around the world. We are seeing the early benefits of some of the actions we have taken to drive our base performance. 
Our adjusted EPS were $4.55 or up 72% versus the prior year. This was also well above our expectations as a result of 3 factors. First, our revenues came in above our plan, driven by higher acuity driving increased demand, greater resiliency and procedural volumes and exceptional execution in COVID diagnostics. Second, we benefited from favorable product mix, like Veritor, but also from our higher-acuity products. Third, our investment spending, such as in R&D, was lighter and earlier in ramping. 
So as you can see, we started this year with strong momentum, and that is despite the COVID resurgence. We did start to see some impact of the resurgence on our more elective procedure-related businesses late in December, and that continued into January. However, we are feeling more confident in the resiliency of our base business relative to what we saw early on in the pandemic. While the health care markets continue to be dynamic with COVID-19, and there are a number of moving parts, the momentum within BD and our conviction in our strategy lead us to raise our financial guidance for fiscal 2021. Our focus is not only on fulfilling our near-term commitments, but also on advancing our strategy and creating value for our shareholders over the longer term. And I'm feeling even greater confidence with the progress the BD team is making in advancing the BD 2025 Grow, Simplify and Empower initiatives and our ability to create substantial shareholder value.  
Today, I want to focus my remarks on 3 key topics, and then I'll turn it over to Chris, who will provide additional remarks on our quarter's performance and comment on our outlook, then we'll take your questions. So let's jump right in. 
First, let me start with the Alaris remediation and our overall quality and compliance initiatives. Alaris remediation has and continues to be my #1 priority, and the team is making strong progress. Our focus remains on submitting a comprehensive 510(k) filing for the Alaris system, and we remain on track to submit it in late fiscal Q2 or early fiscal Q3 2021. We also continue to make progress on executing our holistic Inspire Quality initiatives throughout the organization. Second, as you know, we have a very strong focus on growth and ensuring a durable mid-single-digit revenue growth profile, so let me share some of the exciting highlights in our pipeline and other growth initiatives. 
We continue to increase our investments and strengthen our pipeline across 3 innovation themes that leverage our core strengths. First, we're applying smart devices, robotics, analytics and AI to improve care processes. Second, we're enabling new care settings to enhance patient experience and lower costs. This includes investing in products designed for use in the home markets and in sales channels to support these patients. And third, we're investing to improve diagnosis and treatment of chronic disease. 
So in line with these innovation and investment priorities, in Q1, we acquired the medical assets of CUBEX, which expands our medication management offering by combining a cloud-based, easy-to-deploy analytics platform with a smart tabletop dispensing device to create solutions for the fast-growing non-acute care market. This extends our medication management solution from the hospital into the long-term care surgery centers and other non-acute locations. Another smart device we plan on launching this quarter is the Sensica automated urine output system, which leverages BD's leading position in acute urology, along with BD's broad EMR interoperability capabilities and installed base.  
Also within BD Interventional, the BD PureWick urine collection system and catheter continues to be a significant driver of growth for our urology and critical care business. PureWick is a female external urinary catheter and urine collection system that we sell into the acute care and long-term care settings, but we're now actively extending that directly to patients with our new PureWick dry dock system for the home. And this launch is exceeding our expectations, and in fact, PureWick revenues now exceeds Lutonix. 
An exciting launch later this year, designed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer, is the U.S. launch of our new BD COR with our BD Onclarity HPV assay with extended genotyping. With BD COR, BD is going to enter the high-throughput molecular testing market with a very unique, fully automated sample-to-answer platform in a highly differentiated assay with unique claims that can improve risk stratification and support risk-based patient management.The system has been CE Mark-ed and has been very well received by our customers during our launch in Europe. 
These are just a few of the many products in our pipeline, and you can find further details on our new innovations in the supplemental earnings presentation posted to our website. 
As we've previously shared, we're investing a portion of our Veritor profits to advance our BD 2025 strategy. We expanded the size of the BD Innovation and Growth Fund and additional innovation projects are being initiated on a rolling basis. We are investing to accelerate our simplification initiatives, including ReCoDe and enhancing our quality and compliance programs. We're also increasing funding in our BD University to support advanced employee education and leadership development as part of our strategy. As we always do with our spending, we're taking a disciplined approach, and the timing of the spending was lighter in Q1, and we expect it to step up in Q2 and remain higher for the balance of the fiscal year. 
As we've mentioned before, we continue to actively evaluate tuck-in acquisitions to supplement our growth strategy. And we executed on 3 strategic tuck-in transactions so far this year, including CUBEX's medical assets that I mentioned earlier. We continue to apply a disciplined financial and strategic evaluation process to these transactions and have a robust funnel. 
Lastly, I'd like to update you on our COVID diagnostics outlook and specifically Veritor. Antigen testing continues to become more widely used in both traditional and nontraditional settings. We have been highly successful with our BD Veritor Plus COVID-19 launch. Veritor has been well received for the ease of use, performance and automated digital data and informatics capabilities that are provided with our handheld platform. We've nearly tripled our active reader base since the pandemic and now have more than 70,000 BD Veritor analyzers globally, which we intend to leverage in the future with planned non-COVID menu expansion, which we've already begun investing behind. As previously shared, we continue to make good progress on advancing new COVID diagnostics in our pipeline, including combination flu A/B and COVID-19 assays on both BD MAX and Veritor. We also continue to explore home testing on BD Veritor. And has been our practice, we'll provide updates to these programs upon launch. 
Turning to the quarter's performance. Our Q1 COVID-19 diagnostics revenues were higher than we expected at $867 million, which included better-than-expected BD Veritor rapid point-of-care antigen test revenues of $688 million and higher BD MAX COVID assays and collection swabs and transport devices. The higher-than-expected Veritor revenues were the result of our ability to scale our manufacturing faster, which is a testament to our manufacturing excellence, as well as realizing higher pricing than we anticipated. 
However, since we've been saying since last fall, we do expect pricing to move lower as capacity came online, and this is what's playing out. We recently lowered our pricing to allow the broadest patient access to our best-in-class BD Veritor Plus System. We believe this price adjustment is in the best interest of our customers and patients around the world as we've now ramped our manufacturing capacity, and there are emerging mutations that are making it more transmissible. We also believe this is in the best interest of our shareholders as we believe this move allows us to maintain a leadership position in the point-of-care market. 
With respect to our fiscal 2021 Veritor revenue guidance, as we've been discussing, there continues to be many variables at play besides the evolving pricing environment, including the rollout and adoption of vaccines and the circulation of new COVID variants. It's also difficult to pinpoint when the market supply for antigen tests will exceed market demand. For modeling purposes, we would suggest using an ASP in the low to mid-teens. Given all this, we expect Veritor revenues to be toward the high end of our previous range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. We continue to expect Veritor revenues to be more weighted to the first half of our fiscal year. And given the evolving pricing and capacity environment, we would expect our fiscal Q2 revenues to be lower than our just reported Q1 results.
Before turning it over to Chris to review the financials, I want to close with a few thoughts. While we were very pleased with the performance of Veritor and other COVID diagnostic revenues in the quarter, what excites us more was the improving momentum and resiliency of the base business. While we saw some headwinds in our procedure-based businesses from the resurgence late in December and that continued into January, the impact was much more limited than at the start of the pandemic. Moreover, given the momentum in our base business, the investments we are making in our BD 2025 strategy, we believe we are positioned to emerge strong. We remain on track to submit our Alaris 510(k) filing in late fiscal Q2 or early Q3, and we're making great progress in advancing our BD 2025 strategy. And I'm particularly pleased with the investment programs we've identified and initiated. These investments allow us to further fulfill our purpose of advancing the world of health, bringing new innovations to patients and expand access. Increased spending will be more evident in our P&L later in this fiscal year, but we believe these initiatives will translate into revenue accretion beginning in late FY '22 and beyond.
The investments we are making are also towards simplification initiatives, which reduce complexities, drive cost efficiencies, enhance our quality programs and improve cash flows. This quarter, we made several advancements on this front, including inventory reductions that we absorbed in our gross margin in the quarter that helped us strengthen our cash flows. Our ReCoDe efforts are on track to achieve our targeted $300 million in cost savings by the end of fiscal 2024.
We're also advancing our sustainability initiatives because we view sustainability as a strategic imperative. And we recently announced the first of our 2030 and beyond goals, our climate change targets. We're committed to reducing Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 46% by 2030 and to be carbon-neutral across direct operations by 2040. The science-based target is aligned with the 1.5-degree C global emissions reduction pathway. And we look forward to sharing more detail behind our 2030 sustainability plan with you in future engagements. 
And finally, I'm very proud of the organization for being named for 4 consecutive years to The Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality list and for the second straight year to the Gender-Equality Index. Inclusion and diversity is an important focus for BD as we continue to attract, develop and retain the best talent as well as benefit from diversity of background and thought.
I look forward to answering your questions during the Q&A portion of this call, and I'll turn it over to Chris now."

We are very pleased with our fiscal first quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share performance, both of which exceeded our expectations. Total revenues were over $5.3 billion",1794,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are very pleased with our fiscal first quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share performance, both of which exceeded our expectations. Total revenues were over $5.3 billion, in line with our January 12 pre-announcement. Revenues increased 25.8% on a reported basis and 24.3% on an FX-neutral basis. COVID-19 diagnostic revenues accounted for 20.3 percentage points of growth.
The better-than-expected performance came from 3 areas: first, our base business performed better than expected. This was a result of stronger execution from our associates, greater resiliency and procedure volumes as health care facilities manage both COVID and non-COVID patients, and higher acuity resulted in both favorable product mix and increased demand for several product lines. Keep in mind, though, that some of our business segments are still operating below pre-COVID volume levels. Second, our COVID diagnostic revenues were higher than expected. This included not only Veritor revenues but also MAX and swab and transport revenues. Lastly, we estimated about $100 million in revenues were attributable to stocking and timing. As COVID-19 surges were occurring, we observed some of our customers moving to more of a just-in-case level of inventory and maintaining higher levels of our critical-need products on hand. We also saw some of our U.K. customers buying more ahead of Brexit. The $100 million includes higher-than-expected revenues in our MMS Infusion Systems business due to COVID-19.
BD Medical revenues totaled nearly $2.3 billion and grew 6.9% on an FX-neutral basis. Our outperformance was primarily in Medication Delivery Solutions as well as in Medication Management Solutions. MDS revenues were up 5.6%. While hospital utilization remains below pre-COVID levels and has been an ongoing headwind, we benefited from the acuity of care associated with the treatment of COVID patients. We saw increased demand for PICC's vascular prep and maintenance. As I mentioned, we believe stocking of critical-need products helped the quarter. Finally, as expected, there was $37 million in revenues associated with COVID vaccination syringes and needles.
Now turning to our MMS business. Revenues grew 8.4%, with growth in both medication dispensing and infusion systems. In dispensing, we had strong growth internationally and once again exited the quarter with strong committed contracts in the U.S. in infusion systems, we continue to support U.S. customers' response during the pandemic on the medical necessity and experienced another quarter of strong demand in Europe. In Diabetes Care, revenue growth of 5.4% was above our expectations, reflecting distributor inventory stocking in addition to an easy comparison to last year. We still view this business to be more of a flattish business on a normalized basis. Pharm systems sales remained strong, growing 9.5%, driven by ongoing demand for our market-leading prefilled syringe portfolio.
BD Life Science revenues totaled nearly $2 billion and were up 74.1% on an FX-neutral basis. As I mentioned previously, COVID diagnostic revenues were $867 million in the quarter. Excluding COVID diagnostic revenues, BD Life Sciences revenues were down 2.4%, which was better than we expected. 
Integrated Diagnostic Solution revenues increased by 106% due to COVID-19 diagnostic testing revenues. Excluding these COVID diagnostic testing revenues, IDS revenues were down just 1.2%. There were several puts and takes in the base business. We saw a stronger-than-expected performance in our specimen management, blood culture and women's health and cancer product lines. We also saw some element of distributor stocking that's critical to health care testing. However, while we have seen improvements, routine diagnostic testing activities are not fully back to pre-COVID-19 levels and a significantly lighter flu season negatively impacted the base revenue growth in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.
Now turning to Biosciences. Revenue declined by 5.2% due to a difficult comparison as a result of prior year licensing revenue. In addition, clinical and research activities are not yet fully back to pre COVID-19 levels. Overall, operational performance in Biosciences was better than expected. 
BD interventional revenues totaled nearly $1.1 billion and were up 5% on an FX-neutral basis, with all business units posting growth. We observed that elective procedures, particularly those conducted in an outpatient setting, had greater resiliency in Q1 compared to the initial wave of COVID. This was likely driven by processes and care settings that enable elective procedures to continue despite the resurgence and a greater willingness on the part of patients to attend to their scheduled elective procedures.
Surgery sales were up 1.3% as strong sales growth in our infection prevention business was offset by the ongoing headwinds related to lower procedures due to the pandemic.
Peripheral Intervention sales were up 5.9%. Growth was driven by strong performance across our peripheral arterial disease platforms.
Urology and Critical Care turned in another quarter of strong growth, with revenues up 8%. PureWick continues to fuel the growth in our acute urology franchise while our new connected Arctic Sun System is driving double-digit growth in our targeted temperature management business. This is another example of BD leveraging our digital capabilities and broad EMR interoperability footprint to bring new innovations to market.
Now turning to the P&L. We were really pleased with our gross margin performance in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margins were 58.2%, which expanded 170 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. On an FX-neutral basis, our gross margin expanded 250 basis points, which was primarily driven by COVID diagnostics and higher-acuity products.
While SSG&A and R&D spending were both higher on a year-over-year basis, the level of spending was lower than we anticipated, particularly R&D, reflecting mainly timing. Operating margins were 31.6%, up 830 basis points on an FX-neutral basis, which was driven by higher gross margins and reduced SG&A and R&D spending.
Net interest expense was $118 million, down slightly on a sequential basis. Other income was $30 million versus $27 million a year ago, and the adjusted tax rate came in at 14.6%, which was in line with our expectations. Our adjusted non-GAAP EPS were $4.55. 
In fiscal Q1, the preferred shares are dilutive. Therefore, in calculating the adjusted non-GAAP EPS, preferred dividends amount of $23 million was excluded from the numerator, while the diluted share count would be adjusted to include the dilutive impact of the convertible preferred shares and would be 299.1 million.
As we've been discussing, our BD 2025 strategy includes a focus on driving cash flow, and we were really pleased with the continued progress of these initiatives and our cash flow performance. We generated $1.5 billion in cash flow from operations in the quarter and $1.3 billion in free cash flows. We have also been focused on strengthening our balance sheet. As we previously communicated, we paid down $265 million of debt in the first fiscal quarter. Our net leverage ratio declined to 2.5x as of December 31, 2020, from 3.0x at the end of September 2020. A few weeks ago, Moody's upgraded our credit to an investment-grade rating, and we are committed to maintaining a full investment-grade credit rating across the major credit rating agencies.
We believe we are approaching a turning point in our capital allocation. In the past, a significant amount of our cash was dedicated to repaying the debt. But looking ahead, we expect to have greater flexibility to refocus our cash deployment on growth opportunities, including tuck-in M&A and other capital deployment options.
Next, I want to address fiscal 2021 guidance. While we observed greater resiliency in Q1 as it relates to procedure volumes, we still view COVID-19 resurgences to be a significant risk factor to our forward outlook as it could impact general health care utilization, procedure volumes and diagnostic testing, including COVID testing. In the latter weeks of December, as the resurgence has picked up, we started to see pressure on some of our procedure-based products. This trend continued into January. We have updated our guidance to incorporate some impact from the resurgence into our forecast for fiscal Q2, and we continue to monitor the trends.
Our guidance continues to assume no major system-wide shutdowns of elective procedures. Now given the strength of our Q1 performance, along with our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are comfortable forecasting FX-neutral revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12% compared to our prior range of high single to low double digits. This would include our assumption of Veritor revenues being towards the high end of our original guidance range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
Using current exchange rates, we expect FX to add approximately 200 basis points to revenue growth versus our prior year guidance of about 100 basis points. We expect our non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2021 to be in the range of $12.75 to $12.85, which is above our prior guidance range of $12.40 to $12.60, a raise of $0.30 at the midpoint of the range. So for these reasons, while we are extremely pleased with our strong execution in fiscal Q1, we want to caution against extrapolating our fiscal Q1 revenue, margin and EPS performance going forward. While we are not giving quarterly guidance, we thought it might be helpful to provide some context on this quarter's strength as you contemplate phasing for the rest of the year.
Our Q1 revenues, operating margins and adjusted EPS are likely to be the highest absolute levels for the year due to 2 factors: Veritor pricing and the ramp of our planned investment spending. In addition, the stocking of $100 million will unwind in the remainder of the year. As Tom mentioned, we expect Veritor revenues in fiscal Q2 to be lower than Q1. As we have discussed in the past, we expected our COVID test pricing to decline, and this is playing out. We expect Veritor to be well positioned for broad access as we look ahead.
Regarding our operating margins, our fiscal Q1 EPS benefited from the higher Veritor revenues and margin profile as well as the timing of investment spending. We expect investment spending, particularly in R&D, to be meaningfully stepped up in Q2. The combination of these 2 factors will result in our operating margins moving into the low to mid-20s in our fiscal Q2.
In the second half of the year, given our expectations for lower Veritor revenues and for investment spending to continue to ramp at a similar rate to fiscal Q2, we would expect operating margins in the low 20s. We're also seeing some impact from the resurgence in January. And like many others, we are also continuing to see pressure from higher shipping costs as well as some other headwinds. However, due to the strength of our Q1 results, we're able to offset these headwinds and raise our full year EPS guidance.
With that, I'll turn it back to Kristen, who will help moderate our Q&A."

We had 20% reinvestment of that upside in the model. Even when you make those kind of adjustments as well as stocking, it's still a little hard to reconcile the upside in the quarter relative to the guide. So I appreciate it's a less visible environment. But is there anything else? Is that investment going higher? Or anything else we may not be thinking about that would explain why we're not getting this sort of that pull-through in the second, third quarter? Because I think that's going to be the key question this morning of the call."

We also had timing in the base business that we would expect to moderate. And to your point, we do expect the investment spending both in the Veritor reinvestment program that we've discussed as well as R&D and quality to ramp. So we started those programs in Q1. We watch those -- that spending with some prudence as we looked at the pandemic playing out. And so we got started, but the ramp really comes in the second, third and fourth quarter.
And so when you put all of that into context, you also have to take into consideration a little bit of impact from the resurgence that we saw that we mentioned we have playing out in Q2. So with all of those factors coming into play, we felt that the -- it was prudent to think about the guidance that we gave as appropriate at this point."

But there are new strains underway, et cetera. And when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, we said it excluded, right, the impact of a resurgence. Well, there's been a resurgence. And we've been navigating that very well and actually are raising our outlook in the middle of a resurgence. So we'll continue to evaluate as things go forward, but we're certainly pleased with how we started the year."

Let me maybe focus on specifically COVID testing, and then Chris can make some broader comments on the broader business. And we've shared, by the way, in the past, we still remain very confident and expect our revenues, excluding COVID diagnostic testing, and Alaris pump revenues to grow in those mid-single digits on an FX-neutral basis for '22, and that remains our aim and our expectation.
In terms of COVID testing as we go into '22, certainly, as I'd shared before, as we got into COVID rapid testing last July, obviously, we didn't have a high expectation that there would be much testing in '22. And as kind of each quarter has gone -- has passed since that launch in July, we've said we're feeling more confident there's going to be some level of testing in FY '22, and that certainly remains the case.
I think what -- one of the ways to think about, as our capacity has gone up in the space, as we recognize the new strains coming in the market, as antigen testing continues to increase in its receptivity and people understand now the value in increasing ways of getting a test result in 15 minutes, you saw us take some actions this quarter to get pricing in that low to mid-teen level, which we think will be more actually position us well to, as I said, maintain a leadership position for whatever market continues to evolve going into FY '22, right? That's part of the thinking. Where the actual market ends up in '22? I don't know at this point in time. I -- there definitely should be some level of testing. And our aim is to make sure that we're positioned to be a leader in however that testing evolves. And other things that we're investing in as well, be it our combination assay, which is progressing well in our pipeline, the flu COVID assay for our exploration of home testing are all aimed with that thought in mind as well. So maybe, Chris, just maybe some broader comments on FY '22."

We do",372,"So yes, obviously, we're not going to go through '22 with any level of precision, but I think it is important to give some high-level comments on it. And as Tom mentioned, the level of COVID testing is a variable that will have a big impact on '22. We do see the sustainability of testing, but at what level, it's really hard to guess at this point. In addition, there's a lot of other uncertainty around COVID in general, the resurgences, mutations, the uptake of the vaccines. And in our business, obviously, Alaris and when that comes back in '22, will have an impact.
I would remind you that on our November call we said we expected our revenues, excluding COVID diagnostic testing and the Alaris pump revenues, to grow in mid-single digits on an FX-neutral basis. And we continue to see that as a reasonable assumption. We can't predict when the FDA clearance for Alaris and our focus on making a comprehensive filing to support a timely approval is there, but we would expect some clearance sometime in fiscal '22.
We'd also not look at the second half of '21 as a proxy of what to expect in '22 because both the gross and operating margins are impacted by several factors. Our operating margin in fiscal '21 reflects these incremental investments we're making as part of the investment program of Veritor that really helps drive durable growth aligned with our 2025 strategy. And we don't expect those investments to continue into '22, so they'll exit -- exiting '21, they'll roll off and that should help margins going into '22.
The other thing I'd point out is that Q1 fiscal '22 will obviously be the most difficult comp from a margin perspective, given the very strong quarter we just reported. For example, most likely face the most difficult comparison with COVID revenues as well as from the impact of the timing and stocking that we talked about. So we would expect our operating margin to compress year-over-year from the 31.6% that we just achieved. So we'll update you more on our thoughts on '22 as we progress through the year, but we just thought it's important to provide some of those highlights."

How are you thinking about that base business ex COVID growth through the cadence of the year here? That's a pretty healthy start in what was a tough quarter. How should we think about that component of the business throughout fiscal '21?"

I think one way to think about that is what I mentioned about '22 is that we expect the base business to be ramping at a mid-single digits. So that's consistent with that. So I think that we feel the underlying business is solidly in that kind of perspective. And as we talked about the base business, we expect to be kind of in that low to mid-single-digit level for the full year. And so there is some pressures in the second half of the year on a business-by-business basis. As you think about MMS, there will be some issues. It's going to be lumpy in the remaining quarters. MMS had a significant amount of revenue in the third quarter during the pandemic last year. Other parts of the business will ramp nicely. China, for example, as we lap the COVID impact that really was in Q2 there in China, so we'll start seeing some revenue growth from that. But again, that's more of a compare. It's not an indication of the underlying business. But the underlying business really is in that low to mid-single-digit basis. We have some general issues with -- compare to the -- based on the Alaris ship hold. Some of that's been negated by medical necessity. So there's a number of factors going on. But the bottom line of it all is think about the base business, for the remainder of this year in that low to mid-single digits and exiting into '22 in the mid-single-digit basis."

We're going to continue to invest in growth. Part of that investing for growth is also our tuck-in M&A strategy, and you saw us begin to accelerate our efforts in that. Last quarter, you're seeing that continue into this fiscal year. And you heard me mention we have a robust funnel to continue that.

We were very proud of the fact that we really focused on cash during the pandemic. And if you look back, in fact, at the third quarter of last year, our cash flow actually increased year-over-year despite the fact that the revenues were suppressed from COVID. And that was the result of a number of actions that we took in the business around inventories, receivables, payables. And so we're very proud of that. We're really focused on cash.
As we mentioned at your conference last month, Robbie, we paid down $265 million of debt. That kind of gets us down to the target. So we see the leverage ratio floating down naturally without the need to pay down debt, which really says that the $5 billion-ish that we've paid down debt over the last couple of years, that strong cash flow that we're generating will be available to allocate to other value enhancements. So we've talked about primarily the tuck-in M&A and share repurchase. And as we get through this pandemic and as that safety net of cash that we've had to ride out the pandemic isn't as necessary, we'll have the ability towards the end of this year. And you've seen our tuck-in M&A ramping up, the pipeline is good. We continue to look at a number of opportunities. And by the end of this year, I think we'll be also talking about giving that cash back to shareholders. Because once we get through this period, we don't see the need to build up cash on the balance sheet. And so we would be returning that to shareholders after a certain amount of tuck-in M&As. So this puts us in a very good position. We've got great cash flow generation and better than ever and that puts us in a great position to allocate that appropriately."

So on the revenue side on Veritor, so I think the key thing to talk about there is the pricing comment that I made is one big piece that drives that, right? We said we were above 20% in the last quarter. And as we think about looking forward, we talked about modeling low to mid-teens. So that's the #1 adjustment there. And again, we've been -- that's not new news at all and in fact that we've been talking about that we expect pricing to head in that level as our capacity comes online and we're in a better cost position, et cetera and as more capacity is coming into the marketplace. And so we've taken actions as planned and that is why we gave guidance. It said expect the revenues to be highly weighted to the first half of the year, and we've said that from day 1. I think there remains uncertainty around the effectiveness and timing of the vaccines, especially with additional variants that are out there, et cetera. But we can't predict what's going to happen there on the second half of the year. And so we remain projecting that there will be very strong demand for antigen testing in the first half of the year and that the second half of the year is less certain. Obviously, if demand stays very high and depending on the dynamics with capacity and demand and how those curves cross over, maybe there could be an opportunity in the back half of the year, but it's way too early for us to think about that as -- because it's far from certain or able to be confirmed. So our aim is to position ourselves to be a leader in the space however it ends up evolving. And as we go forward, there'll be more clarity there, but certainly a very dynamic environment.

And that was a function of a number of things. First, the COVID testing, obviously. But the base business was very, very strong as well. And we drove some synergy and continuous improvement kind of margin improvements as well. So all things were positive in Q1.
As we think about the rest of the year, you would expect that COVID testing to moderate as you model that out, obviously. And then don't forget you also have the unwind of the timing that we saw of the $100 million in Q1. That unwinds in the remainder of the year. But the most important thing is the ramping of investments that we have discussed. So we're investing in R&D. We're investing in quality. We're investing in the Veritor reinvestment program. And all of those things kind of ramp in Q2, Q3 and Q4. And so don't think about that as an indication of our pre-pandemic margins. It's just completely different. And then those investments go away into '22. The beauty of it is they begin to drive improvements in growth, in revenue generation, in margin expansion, and those things will kick in towards the latter half of FY '22. So you get the pickup in margins by them going away and then the benefit of those investments in driving revenue growth and margin improvement going forward. So you can't look at that as -- well, those are different than pre-pandemic margins. So that's the way to think about '21 as it plays out."

And some of the most important things for this patient population are: a, options; and b, an opportunity to expand the gap between these frequent interventions that they will have. So as we move into panel, certainly, there will be a debate around the clinical data that we've acquired. But I think, more importantly, this is another tool in armamentarium of tools that clinicians have for BTK intervention. If you think back 20 years ago, an SFA or popliteal intervention, there were PTA balloons and off-label stents. And today, there's a wide range of technology available to them all the way up to drug-coated balloons and drug-eluting stents. But in BTK today, as I said, the most serious form of peripheral arterial disease, there is one product available, and that's PTA. So we're not suggesting this is the silver bullet for all BTK patients. We're suggesting that this is another tool that can enhance the outcomes for different patients and equip physicians to assess each and every patient and have yet another tool to treat them with. So the panel is on February 17. We've gone through a comprehensive preparation for it, and we'll absolutely put our best foot forward on that day to commence panel in the merits of our application."

So as y",658,"Truly. Good and fair question. So a couple -- let me start with just overall R&D effectiveness, and I can get a little bit of color on the types of initiatives that we're investing in here and also how we think about our overall innovation system. So as you know, John DeFord joined us as our Chief Technology Officer about 3 years ago. And really, under his leadership, there's been tremendous progress within the organization and with the segment teams, the business teams in advancing our ability to drive innovation. Actually, over that time period, we've gone from kind of the midpoint of not being where we wanted in terms of on-time milestone delivery or on-time launches to being as we benchmark ourselves to being in a top quartile within the industry of hitting our milestones and, most importantly, hitting our launches, right? Our launches are now about 80-plus percent of our launches are on time, which is up very notably over the last 3 years, up over 30 percentage points or around 30 percentage points, in fact.
So we see the progress being made. And that's the result of a lot of system improvements, new capabilities brought in, taking some of the best practices actually from Bard and the acquisition and applying those across the company. So that's something we're going to continue to build upon. As we think about the innovations that we're investing in, as we look at those, there's not -- there's a few, as I think about them, kind of new to world innovations that are in our pipeline. I mean, one is some of the ones we've already talked about, right, non-COVID menu expansion on Veritor and MAX to take -- to capitalize on our expanded footprint. We have a strong track record of developing new assays on MAX and Veritor, right? It's just examples of that.
Other initiatives are accelerating programs that we already had in our pipeline and allowing them to come to market a year or 2 earlier than we originally projected. That's an area of investment that we're making, and there are a number of areas in each of the segments which we're accelerating new products into the pipeline, but they're all very much in line with our strategy and areas that we're confident that we have internal capabilities in. Of course, what we are also doing that's complementing that is that tuck-in M&A strategy that I mentioned before. And we do think about often, and we'll have those discussions internally, if technologies are better developed in-house or that we should be going outside because we have -- we don't have those capabilities in-house. And we'll either look at do they exist today in someone else's pipeline and is that an opportunity for tuck-in M&A? Or do we need to be doing collaborations with outside groups. And many of -- there's many R&D programs that we have today, I think probably a record level of R&D programs where we have external partnerships in place. Actually, the BD COR would be one that I mentioned before. We have very strong external partnerships with the robotics because that's a very advanced automation system. And so we brought in robotic experts that helped us with that launch, and it's going really well in Europe. And we'll bring it to the U.S. here, but that's one that we probably wouldn't have been able to develop in the same way if we had tried to do it on our own. But we're seeing successes with that approach, and we're seeing it in many other areas as well. 
So that's kind of maybe just a little bit of color, Larry, in how we think about it overall. But with that progress that we've made and the way that we've thought through making these investments and how we also think about where it's smarter for us to do tuck-in M&A, we're confident in those investments."

And there will be further capacity coming in. We're not the only company who's adding in capacity. And so we think about that holistically and where pricing as a result of that is going today and where we best position our products to remain a leader in that, and that's how we develop it, and we spend a lot of time thinking those things through as to when and how we optimize our pricing, again, to also serve what is a continued evolving customer base as more nontraditional areas of health care getting to -- wanting to do antigen testing and making sure that it's appropriately priced to enable the broadest access to the product while we're still in the middle of a pandemic.

Thank you, Tom. And Josh, great question. So to your point, there have been obviously several newly identified variants reported recently, and there could well be others, right, recognizing that this is an RNA virus, very much like influenza and HIV that are known to mutate. And for us, we've got 2 different types of platforms, right? So we've obviously got the BD Veritor antigen test. We've got the BD MAX and molecular PC assays.
So let me take MAX first. So for BD MAX and for the assays that we have on the MAX, we've already completed an in silico analysis, which is a computer model based on sequencing and to look at those mutations. And from everything that we can see around those mutations and the lineage of the sequence, we have no impact on the BD MAX assays.
For BD Veritor, which is obviously more a minor assay based on the top of the protein, based on early analysis again there, we have no evidence to show that the U.K., South African and, indeed, Brazilian variant will have an impact on the test. But we continue to take actions to look at that, further confirm and monitor the performance. And again, we've done that for the ones that are already out there and any potential new emerging strains. And this is a critical topic for us because I think the thing to remember here is as these variants come online and come out, which are reportedly more transmissible, it makes the importance of rapid testing and access to testing as important, if not more important, than ever."

Today, we will provide an update on how we are executing on creating value for our stakeholders through our BD 2025 strategy. We have a lot of exciting updates for you, so let's jump right in. 
Our second quarter results came in better than expected, and we delivered strong revenue and EPS growth. We are very pleased with the continued momentum in our core business, and therefore, based on our first half results and our projections for the second half, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2021 guidance. We are making steady progress on each of our growth initiatives. Which include very purposely shifting our investments and portfolio into higher growth categories and shifting our weighted average market growth rate over time. 
We are advancing our product pipeline as well as our tuck-in M&A strategy, which now includes making selective investments in earlier stage and potentially disruptive technologies. And this morning, we announced our intention to spin-off our Diabetes Care businesses into a separate public company. We see this planned spin as a significant value-creating opportunity for all stakeholders, for our patients, customers, associates and shareholders. 
As an independent public company, we believe the diabetes business can leverage its global leadership position and unleash its growth potential in this attractive market category through the more efficient allocation of its own capital. For RemainCo BD, this transaction allows us to focus on our prioritized core businesses. We expect this transaction to strengthen our mid- single-digit revenue and double-digit total return growth profile. We expect the spin to be completed in the first half of calendar year 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, including final approval by the BD Board of Directors and the SEC declaring our registration statement effective. 
We are progressing well against our simplification initiatives, which are focused on reducing complexity, enhancing our product quality, refining our customer experience and improving cost efficiencies. Our recode initiatives are progressing on track to generate savings of $300 million by the end of FY '24. And these initiatives help unlock value and allow us the flexibility to reinvest back into our business to fuel future growth. Chris will talk more about our capital allocation strategy later in the call, but we expect share repurchases to return as part of a more balanced capital allocation strategy as our balance sheet position and cash flows have strengthened over the past year. We also continue to be guided by our purpose of advancing the world of health and continue to make great progress on our ESG initiatives. On Earth Day, we reaffirmed our climate change targets, which includes our pledge to be carbon neutral by 2040 across our direct operations. 
Last week, as I was preparing for our Board meeting, I reflected on where we were a year ago, where we are today and the progress we've made. First, we achieved my #1 priority since taking over as CEO. Last week, we announced that we submitted our Alaris 510(k) premarket notification. This is an important milestone in our commitment to our customers and our patients. The Alaris pump is the leading infusion pump in the U.S. market, administering more than 1 million infusions each day. Second, we've significantly strengthened our balance sheet and cash flows. Over the past year, we've improved our net leverage ratio by a full turn from 3.4x to 2.4x and taken actions to meaningfully strengthen our cash flows. Third, we answered the call to action with COVID. We developed a series of innovative COVID diagnostic tests and scale these to diagnose patients and help control the spread. 
We secured our global supply chain to ensure that our essential medical devices were available to treat COVID patients in ICUs around the world, including BD devices used in the treatment of an estimated 90% of U.S. ICU patients. And today, we continue to add capacity and enable over 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to be delivered using our injection devices. I am very proud of our team's impact when it matters most. 
Fourth, we reinvested in growth. We set up the BD Innovation and Growth Fund. And advanced impactful new innovation programs in each of our businesses. We acquired 11 tuck-in acquisitions since the beginning of 2020, along with early-stage investments. And we're reinvesting some of BD Veritor profits back into the business and behind our BD 2025 strategy. 
Fifth, we started to shift the BD culture to one of a growth mindset. We've been systematically advancing our leadership capabilities and culture in this area, which includes partnering with the Neuro Leadership Institute to embed an enhanced focus on innovation and growth across our culture and mindset, and the progress we're making with shifting the culture is very real and tangible. And today, we are announcing our intention to spin-off the diabetes business. We believe this spin-off will be another value-creating opportunity for our shareholders. 
But what excites me most is now what we've done, it's where we're going and what's to come. Over the next several years, all of our future successes and milestones to come. The BD 2025 value creation story has only just begun. And later this year, we are planning to host an Investor Day, and we'll look forward to sharing greater insights into our 2025 strategy and pipeline. 
So with that, let's turn to Slide 8 and our second quarter results. Chris is going to run through our financial results in greater detail later on. But just to highlight, we are very pleased with our second quarter results as the BD team continued to execute well. Our second quarter revenues totaled $4.9 billion, up 15.4% on a reported basis and up 12.2% on an FX-neutral basis. I was particularly pleased with the continued momentum of our core businesses, which were above our expectations in all 3 business segments. 
To call out a few, our market-leading BD Pharmaceutical Systems business continues to deliver robust revenue growth of nearly 10%. Medication Delivery Solutions business was up over 8% as we continue to deliver on our COVID vaccine injection devices commitments, and our results were also driven by higher patient acuity. Our Bioscience business turned in double-digit growth as research activity has rebounded and urology and critical care continued to perform well, driven by PureWick and targeted temperature management. 
In China, where we began to anniversary the impact of COVID-19, we saw a strong revenue growth of 62%, and we continue to invest to support our future growth, including reinvesting some of the profits from our COVID diagnostics. Our R&D spending was up 18.7% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. Adjusted EPS were $3.19, representing year-over-year growth of 25.1% on a reported and 22.7% on a currency-neutral basis. 
The performance of our business, particularly our core, gives us comfort to reaffirm our fiscal 2021 guidance ranges, which include currency-neutral revenue growth of 10% to 12% and adjusted EPS guidance of $12.75 to $12.85, up 25% to 26% on a year-over-year basis. 
Turning to Slide 9. As I discussed before, we are proud to play such an important role in the COVID-19 pandemic response across the continuum of care from diagnostics to treatment and now prevention. As vaccination campaigns continue to progress, I am pleased to announce that we now have cumulative commitments for over 1.7 billion injection devices to administer COVID vaccines globally. These commitments will stretch through our fiscal 2022 period. And therefore, we now see higher demand in our MDS hypodermic business as being durable into next year. We also see potential opportunity for our prefilled business in the future and are now working with several partners at various stages of formulation testing on possible pre-filled COVID-19 vaccines. 
Turning to Slide 10. I will provide an update on our COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing business. We recently announced several emergency use authorizations or EUAs from the FDA. We received EUAs for our combination COVID flu assays for both BD Veritor and BD MAX, and we believe combination tests are going to be important in the next flu season. Next, we extended our EUA for the BD Veritor COVID-19 test to include a claim for screening asymptomatic individuals by serial testing. Several peer-reviewed publications have supported the benefits of serial rapid antigen testing. And we are continuing to develop our BD Veritor at-home test. Our test is designed to deliver a clear, digitally displayed record of test results on a smartphone to eliminate the reading guess work, and we also designed it to allow the data to be digitally shared by the user to eliminate errors and report sharing. Our BD Veritor at-home antigen test is also expected to have some other features that we believe will further differentiate it versus others on the market. Our antigen tests will all be manufactured on the same production lines to leverage economies of scale and our capital investments. 
Turning to Slide 11. Growth through innovation is central to our BD 2025 strategy. We are advancing our R&D pipeline across all 3 of our segments. And as you can see on this slide, identified by the green circles, several products have launched or achieved clearance since the beginning of the year. I've already covered our regulatory clearances related to COVID Diagnostics. And I'm happy to share that we've made steady progress in our medical segment with a healthy cadence of relevant portfolio expansions and extensions across the MDS portfolio such as the broadening of our leading peripheral IV catheter position with the introduction of our first passive safety catheter in the United States, the BD Cathena IV safety catheter. We launched a new catheter stabilization solution for peripheral in catheters with the BD Secura stabilization device and further advanced the safety of the BD PhaSeal optimal product family with a locking injector. In interventional, we're launching Sensica, a smart connected folly catheter, which can be an important tool for the ICU. It provides weight normalized urine output data that is one of the early parameters used by clinicians to help identify acute kidney injury. BD Sensica can wirelessly transmit this data to the hospital's electronic medical record. 
We're also looking forward to launching Pristine later this quarter. Pristine is our new long-term hemodialysis catheter with unique side hole free symmetric wide tip distal lumen design. The design of the product is intended to help minimize thrombus adhesion, facilitate blood clot aspiration prior to hemodialysis treatment and help minimize recirculation rates in both forward and reverse. 
Turning to Slide 12. As I have often said over the last year, Alaris was my #1 priority. And last week, we announced a very important milestone. We submitted our 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA for our BD Alaris system. I am extremely proud of our MMS, regulatory affairs, quality and R&D teams for their dedication and hard work to ensure a comprehensive submission. We're also very appreciative of the FDA's collaboration. We recognize this is one important step, and we look forward to working with them through the FDA review process to obtain clearance for the updated BD Alaris system. 
Just to give a sense of what is included in the submission and how comprehensive it is. The 510(k) submission is intended to bring our file up to date for all changes to the pump since the last 510(k) was cleared. We are also implementing updated features and addressing open recall issues, including through a new version of the BD Alaris system software that will provide clinical, operational and cybersecurity updates. These updates are part of our overall commitment to safeguard infusion programming. And included in the software will be updates to our BD Alaris Guardrail Suite and BD Alaris EMR interoperability, including cybersecurity updates, network security and advanced data encryption. From a hardware perspective, our submission includes updated PCU, LVP, syringe and ETCO2 modules as well as our existing PCA module. We plan to continue to advance the BD Alaris system with future updates and subsequent submissions. 
We filed a substantial amount of data to support the filing. This is a complex and comprehensive submission. Therefore, we would expect that the FDA review process will take some time to complete. And while we're not intending to predict the FDA specific time line, we certainly recognize that our stakeholders would like to have some input for modeling purposes. And we believe it would be prudent to think about Alaris' clearance sometime during the second half of our fiscal year 2022. We plan to update you if there are any significant developments. And for now, we expect to continue to ship to our customers who qualify under medical necessity. We've learned a lot of valuable lessons and gained insights during this journey that we're applying to our ongoing next-generation pump platform programs as well as our quality and risk management systems. 
Turning to Slide 13. We are making significant progress with our tuck-in M&A strategy. Year-to-date, we've closed 5 acquisitions, and we have a robust funnel of opportunities at various stages. We continue to exercise financial discipline in addition to ensuring deals meet our strategic and operational criteria. This includes them being accretive to our growth profile, supporting our key innovation themes, advancing our strategic positions, meeting our financial hurdles and creating shareholder value. As part of building a more holistic approach to expanding our inorganic growth funnel, we also expanded our evaluation and selective investment in early-stage strategic opportunities. 
On Slide 14, we highlight our key innovation themes and with some of our tuck-in acquisitions and R&D products across our 3 business segments that align to these themes, some of which I've already highlighted. So within this theme of applying smart devices, robotics, analytics and artificial intelligence to improve care processes, I've already discussed our Smart Foley catheter, Sensica. We also continue to develop new modules of Kiestra, our total lab automation system. Kiestra, as you know, can improve standardization, significantly enhance lab efficiencies and staff productivity. Within Medical, our health site platform is designed to continue to support enterprise-wide medication management. We continue to evolve our capabilities with health site diversions, which was originally launched in fiscal 2019 for Pyxis. 
We have scaled tremendously over the last year in terms of our commercial sites, and we have plans to expand into the OR, followed by integration of infusion data and central pharmacy. Within this theme of enabling new care settings, you've seen us acquire Med Bank and GSL Solutions to expand our medication management offering into the faster growth non-acute settings and strengthen our existing dispensing leadership position. 
Our PureWick dry dock urine collection system has been helping women with urinary incontinence outside of the acute setting and contributing to the strong growth in our UCC franchise. And I've already talked about how we're excited about the upcoming launch of our BD veritor at-home COVID-19 test that enables the expansion of testing into everyday settings. 
Lastly, our third theme is improving diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases. I already mentioned Pristine, and I've talked about in the past, our BD Oncology, HPV assay, which offers extended genotyping that supports risk stratification. And we look forward to launching this assay on our BD core system in the United States later this year. 
One other product that we haven't talked a lot about is our BD Libertas subcutaneous drug delivery system for the administration of viscous biologics. Our Pharmaceutical Systems business is excited to offer this option to our biopharmaceutical partners as a combination product. These products not only add value to our customers, patients and health care system but they add to our confidence in a sustainable, durable, mid single-digit growth profile. 
Now turning to Slide 15. As I've described so far on this call, we are making substantial progress in advancing our BD 2025 strategy, which is about unleashing the growth potential of BD, delivering innovation to our customers, empowering our associates and creating value for our shareholders. And I'm really excited today to announce a bold step in our BD 2025 strategy. Our intention to spin-off our diabetes business to our shareholders, which we believe is a value-creating transaction. 
Our Diabetes Care business generated $1.1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2020, is a global leader in insulin injection devices. Consistent with our continuing focus on delivering shareholder value, we undergo strategic reviews to identify ways to create value and determine that the strategic priorities of BD have diverged from those of our diabetes care business. We believe a spin-off will position both companies for long-term growth and success by allowing both to focus on their respective core markets, innovations and customer outcomes. Each company will be able to more efficiently allocate its resources and capital, best positioning the respective companies for their success and value creation. We see tremendous potential to create value for our Diabetes Care business ahead. 
And let's turn to Slide 16 to dive into some of the benefits in greater detail. We see the spin-off as an operating catalyst for our Diabetes Care business. As an independent public company, NewCo will be able to more effectively allocate its human, operational and financial resources to implement a refined growth strategy that will allow it to focus on innovation and improving the care of patients living with diabetes. Being a separate entity will also better enable NewCo to attract and retain talent, align management and employee incentives and have a stock currency that it can use for future acquisitions. 
For RemainCo BD, we expect the spin-off to strengthen our mid-single-digit FX-neutral revenue growth. We estimate the uplift to our revenue growth rate to be about 30 basis points and see this as strengthening our double-digit total return growth profile. The spin-off will allow RemainCo to focus on our R&D, tuck-in M&A and customer growth strategies, simplify our overall focus and maintain financial flexibility. Considering all of these benefits, we believe this transaction has the potential to create value for our shareholders, which will be owners of both companies. 
Slide 17 provides an overview of the relevant transaction details, and I've already covered many of these topics. The spin-off is expected to be implemented by a means of a distribution of 100% of the shares of a newly traded -- publicly traded entity to BD shareholders and is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Over the next several months, we will be filing our Form 10, which will include the carve-out financial statements. Again, we expect the spin-off to be completed in the first half of fiscal year 2022, subject to market, regulatory and other conditions, including final approval by the Board of Directors and the effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement that will be filed with the SEC. 
Turning to Slide 18. NewCo will be led by an experienced management team, and I am very pleased to share that Dev Kurdikar, who joined us earlier this year as the worldwide President of Diabetes Care, will be the CEO of NewCo. Dev has a long history in the medtech sector, most recently serving as the CEO of Cardiac Science. Dev has been engaged with the business now for the last few months and will share some of his preliminary thoughts in a moment. 
I'm also very happy to announce that Jake Elguicze, the former Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations of Teleflex has joined BD and will be the CFO of NewCo upon spin. Jake brings extensive experience in treasury, financial planning, reporting and analysis and Investor Relations. We're confident that Dev and Jake are the right team to lead NewCo as they embark on this journey that we believe will create value for all stakeholders. 
So with that, I want to turn it over to Dev to provide his perspectives on today's announcement. Dev?"
103678,710378802,2272406,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and hello to everyone listening to today's call. I'm incredibly excited to embark on this journey. I see a tremendous opportunity to build shareholder value and advance care for patients who suffer from diabetes. I'm also very humbled to be l",508,"Thanks, Tom, and hello to everyone listening to today's call. I'm incredibly excited to embark on this journey. I see a tremendous opportunity to build shareholder value and advance care for patients who suffer from diabetes. I'm also very humbled to be leading this amazing organization. The Diabetes Care business has a long history of caring for patients living with the disease, dating back to BD's introduction of the world's first specialized insulin syringe, almost 100 years ago in 1924. Since then, BD has played a leading role in the delivery of insulin, including helping to drive the adoption of insulin pens, which utilize our pen needle technology, as a leading modality for insulin injection. Our Diabetes Care business now reaches more diabetic patients than any other medical device company in the world today. We manufacture 8 billion devices per year and are the global leader in insulin injection devices. 
As Tom mentioned earlier, the business generated nearly $1.1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2020, derived from the sale of insulin injection devices such as pen needles and insulin syringes as well as other accessories. One factor that attracted me to this opportunity was the global breadth of the business, with 48% of the revenues generated outside the United States, including 17% in emerging markets. 
And why is this important? As you can see on Slide 21, a diabetes is a growing chronic condition across the globe, with some of the higher prevalence rates expected to be in the emerging market regions. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that the number of adults living with diabetes is expected to grow from 463 million in 2019 to 578 million in 2030 and 700 million by 2045. Most of these patients will likely continue to rely on traditional injection devices for their insulin needs. The rapid growth of the disease will likely place a significant burden on health care systems around the world as patients with diabetes are often afflicted with multiple comorbidities, like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetic retinopathy and lower limb complications. 
While I've only been with the company for a few months now, I can assure you that my passion and vision for NewCo is one of growth. Injection devices like pen needle and syringes are likely to remain a key part of their treatment paradigm for people with diabetes on a global basis for the foreseeable future. We will look to leverage our global footprint to capitalize on these demographic trends. However, we'll also look to invest in novel insulin delivery technologies, including our internal type 2 patch technologies. We also plan to supplement our internal R&D product development efforts more broadly and accelerate our growth profile through strategic M&A to broaden our product offerings and enter adjacencies on new growth categories. 
Let me end by saying how excited and humbled I am to have this opportunity to lead newco. I am confident that our team will work tirelessly to advance care for our patients while building shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn it over back to Tom."

We see this as a great opportunity for those BD associates that will be part of NewCo, and we're happy to have you and Jake on board. 
Turning to Slide 25. I'd like to provide an update on our ESG initiatives across BD. Over the past quarter, we continued to advance our company-wide ESG initiatives. Including our recent commitment to be carbon neutral across direct operations by 2040. We also continue to make progress towards identifying our 2030 goals, and we look forward to sharing more details behind our 2030 sustainability plan with you in future engagements. 
Before turning it over to Chris, I want to say again how proud I am of the organization for the progress we've made in advancing the BD 2025 strategy. We are purposely shifting our focus to growth opportunities, simplifying the organization to remove complexity as I firmly believe complexity gets in the way of growth, and we're empowering our associates with a growth mindset. We are committed to doing the right things the right way and fulfilling our purpose of advancing the world of health. I also want to reiterate how excited I am for what's ahead for both RemainCo BD and NewCo. BD's Board of Directors and management team believe our plans to spin-off the Diabetes Care business will create value for all stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Chris."

And before I turn to the results, let me also share my enthusiasm for the spin-off of our Diabetes Care business. I see the transaction is a win-win for all stakeholders, our shareholders, our employees, our customers and our patients. I'm confident that we have the right leadership to navigate newco on this exciting journey ahead. 
Now let me turn to the second quarter financial results. Slide 27 summarizes our high level revenue performance. Our revenues came in just over $4.9 billion, up 15.4% on a reported basis and up 12.2% on an FX-neutral basis. As Tom mentioned, we were very pleased with our results. Our core segment results, excluding COVID-19 diagnostic testings, were ahead of our expectations across all segments. 
Now turning to Slide 28. Our Medical segment delivered 4.7% FX-neutral revenue growth, led by our market-leading BD Pharmaceutical Solutions Systems business, which continues to deliver robust revenue growth of nearly 10%. We are proceeding with our capacity expansion to support the future growth of this business unit. 
MDS grew a solid 8.1%, which included $43 million from COVID-19 vaccination injection device revenues. We also benefited from higher patient acuity and higher utilization internationally, particularly in China where we anniversaried the impact of COVID-19. 
Now turning to Slide 29. Our Life Science segment delivered revenue growth of nearly 38% on an FX-neutral basis. Our COVID-19 diagnostic testing revenues totaled $480 million that are included in our integrated Diagnostics Solutions business. While BD Veritor ASPs were as expected in the low to mid-teens, the market's overall demand for symptomatic COVID diagnostic testing was lower. 
Looking at our IDS business, excluding COVID testing, our routine diagnostic testing has not yet fully recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels. There was virtually no traditional flu this year, so we did not have our usual flu test revenues, and this impacted our IDS growth rate by 540 basis points and our BD Life Sciences growth rate but 410 basis points. The impact to our overall BD growth rate was 110 basis points. 
Our Biosciences business unit delivered strong growth of over 12% as research lab activity has recovered nicely. We are seeing strong demand for research instruments and reagents as well as from biopharmaceutical companies for vaccine research and development. 
As shown on Slide 30, the BD Interventional segment was flat this quarter, which was better-than-expected given the COVID-19 resurgences. The performance in surgery and PI reflected the early impact from the covered resurgence. However, we did see recovery in elective procedures as the quarter progressed, and this trend has continued into April. Our urology and critical care franchise continues to deliver solid growth, led by our PureWick and targeted temperature management product lines. 
Turning to our results by geographic regions on Slide 31. In the United States, revenues were up 1.9%. As we had discussed on our February earnings call, we did see some early impact from COVID-19 resurgence, which waned as the quarter progressed. And we exited March with improved momentum, and this continued in April. 
International revenues were up 25.7% on a currency-neutral basis as we begin to anniversary the initial impact of COVID-19, particularly in China, where our revenues were up 62%. We also benefited from our COVID-19 responses our diagnostic testing and vaccine injection delivery device revenues. 
Now turning to the P&L on Slide 32. As expected, our gross margin was sequentially lower as compared to our first quarter. Our gross margin was 53.8%, driven mostly by the lower COVID diagnostic testing revenues. On a year-over-year basis, the gross margin included a 70 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange and 70 basis points from reinvestment initiatives. Favorable impacts from our continuous improvement initiatives were offset by product quality-related expenses. 
Our SSG&A spending rose 9% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis, including a 380 basis point impact from deferred compensation, which, as you know, is fully offset in other income expense. The remaining increase in SSG&A is primarily related to higher shipping costs and investment spending as part of our BD Veritor profit reinvestments. 
Our R&D spending ramped sequentially as planned as we reinvested some of the BD Veritor profits behind new pipeline innovations. R&D increased 18.7% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis to $295 million, representing 6% of our revenues. 
Our operating income grew 14.3% on a year-over-year reported basis and 13% on an FX-neutral basis. Our operating margin was 24.5%, up 8 basis points on an FX-neutral basis. Deferred compensation was an 80 basis point headwind. Our interest and other expenses totaled $111 million versus $170 million in the year ago period. The reduction of interest other net on a year-over-year basis primarily reflects a decrease in deferred compensation, offsetting increases in SSG&A, as previously mentioned. It also reflects reduced interest expense due to debt repayment and refinancing activities and lower interest rates. 
Our tax rate was 12%, lower than expected due to discrete tax items that occurred this quarter. Our adjusted EPS increased 25.1% over the prior year to $3.19 on a reported basis and were up 22.7% on an FX-neutral basis. The average diluted share count used to calculate our EPS in the quarter was $293.6 million. 
Now turning to Slide 33, I'd like to provide an update on our capital allocation priorities, but first, I want to update you on the great progress we made with our cash flows and balance sheet on a year-to-date basis. For the first half of the year, our cash flows from operations have more than doubled, growing from $1.2 billion to $2.8 billion, driven by the improvement in our net income as well as working capital. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in cash and equivalents, and our net leverage ratio was 2.4x, a full turn lower than a year ago. Going forward, our capital allocation strategy will be more balanced than it had been in the past as we were paying down our debt. Now more of our cash can be deployed to support our growth strategy, tuck-in M&A, maintaining a competitive dividend and returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases. 
As a reminder, under the existing share repurchase authorization plan, we have just under 7.9 million shares or roughly $2 billion remaining. Also note that we would expect BD's dividend to be unaffected by the diabetes spin-off and therefore, would increase BD's payout ratio. 
Next, I want to address our fiscal 2021 guidance and provide some general commentary on our overall outlook, which you can see on Slide 34. From a reporting perspective, we will continue to report our diabetes business with our BD results until the spin-off of the diabetes business is complete. We're very pleased with the results for the quarter, how we are building momentum in our core, advancing our pipeline and achieving critical milestones. We are also pleased with the early progress we see from BD Veritor profit reinvestments. We believe these projects should begin to provide incremental growth beginning in late 2022. 
We are reaffirming our fiscal 2021 financial guidance ranges. We continue to expect reported revenue growth of 12% to 14% for the full year 2021. The this reflects FX-neutral revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12%, BD Veritor revenues towards the higher end of the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range, and foreign currency adding approximately 200 basis points. We also continue to expect adjusted EPS in the range of $12.75 to $12.85, which represents growth of 25% to 26% year-over-year. 
Now we wanted to give you some color as you consider your models for the back half of the year. We continue to reinvest some of the Veritor profits to fund projects in line with our BD 2025 strategic pillars of growth simplify and power. Our investments continue to put temporary pressure on both our gross and operating margins in 2021. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect our operating margins in the second half of the year to be in the low 20s, reflecting our reinvestment initiatives as well as higher raw material costs. As a reminder, we expect the reinvestment pressures that you're seeing on our margins to lift next year. 
As you've seen in the past, from time to time, there can be some volatility in our tax rate. We now expect our FY '21 tax rate to be slightly lower than FY '20's tax rate. This helps to offset some gross margin pressure from the lower ASPs from veritor as pricing is now approaching over to our flu test price a bit faster than we originally anticipated. 
Regarding 2022, given the momentum we are seeing, our progress with our R&D pipeline, the reinvestments of our BD Veritor proceeds and our tuck-in acquisition strategy, we have increased confidence in our core outlook. In fiscal 22, excluding COVID-19 testing and Alaris 510(k) clearance, we expect our revenues to grow solidly in the mid-single digits. 
As you heard Tom mention, while we're not intending to predict the FDA's time line, we recognize the desire to have some input for modeling purposes. We believe it would be prudent to think about Alaris' 510(k) clearance sometime during the second half of our fiscal 2022. We believe it would also be prudent to model both our revenues and our margins gradually ramping as we scale our selling and manufacturing efforts. 
In conclusion, we are really pleased with our second quarter results and the momentum across our businesses. We are excited about our plans to spin-off of the diabetes business and see this as an important opportunity to create value for our shareholders. 
With that, Tom, Alberto, Simon, Dave and I are happy to take any questions you have. Operator, please open up the line for Q&A."

Maybe I could ask about some of the base businesses here, particularly maybe the Interventional business seems a bit weaker than expected, and the Medical business continues to benefit from COVID. So I was wondering if you could tease out some of what's impacting interventional? And how do you expect that to recover? 
And then on the flip side, within Medical, how much of that is benefiting from COVID here and should start to come out over the balance of the year?"

One is we see continued durable growth you saw it last year in Pharmaceutical Systems. You saw it again in the quarter that they were in 8% plus, I think, last year, growth, and we see that durably, higher-than-average company growth is my intention there. And you saw us obviously communicate, I think it was last quarter, the quarter before, over $1 billion, $1.2 billion of incremental investment, capital investment in that business to support the long-term growth outlook. So that's number one. 
We also reaffirm that we expect -- we are in discussions, and we have collaborations going on with several pharma companies about putting COVID vaccines in prefilled syringes. So again, another opportunity as we think about that business long term. 
In MDS, we also commented that I remember a year ago or less than a year ago, we were talking about that we could do up to 1 billion syringes to help in the COVID vaccination. We now -- today announced we have orders -- commitments in hand for 1.7 billion syringes that spans well into FY '22. And so we see while we were wondering was there going to be a cliff of syringes into '22, we see that demand in our MDS business as being durable into '22. And certainly, as we think about potential even further demand, from things like booster shots, that would just make that demand even more durable. Overall, that business continues to do well in terms of taking share in the catheter space as well as a series of new innovations. They obviously have had some benefits from higher acuity patients in the ICU, which are maybe using products like midlines or PICCs. Which have higher ASPs than peripheral catheters for shorter time stays, but there's strong durable trends there, I think, in MDS. And obviously, MMS, we look forward with the submission of the 510(k) to have bigger growth opportunities as we look ahead to '22. 
I think I'll turn it over to Simon on BDI. But I would say what you saw is that the impact from the pandemic was very minimal in the first 2 months of the quarter last year for BDI. And so I think you see just that comparable happening given our product mix. And then we did see strong trajectory an uptake in March, and we saw that continue into April.

So let me just add at the bottom here with UCC, a really pstrong quarter, as you see, driven by double-digit growth in PureWick and TTM. So continues to be a mid- to high single-digit performer for us this quarter. 
Peripheral, as Thomas mentioned, peripheral, we did see impacts early in the quarter in this space and particularly in the ESKD business, and that is -- that should not be a surprise to you based on what you've probably heard from others involved in that space, but a sequential improvement through the end of March and into April, and the outlook remains positive there. 
And then with surgery, no great surprise to us. 2 factors driving that. Number one, hernia is not an emergent procedure. So patients have had hernias for several years. So that is typically impacted first when a resurgence happens and are treated later when the recovery is initiated. And secondly, the Q2 of last year for us had a particularly high-growth in ChloraPrep. I would say, higher than normal. So that's a bit of an offset as we move into this quarter. But the sustainability of our business, I think, is demonstrated in China, for example, this past quarter, we were very significantly impacted in Q2 last year in China, and it has rebounded really strongly in Q2 of this year. So we remain confident in our ability to recover our business as the resurgent debates here."

And as you said, it's maybe a little bit less than what you indicated would be split by quarter there. 
On the Alaris, we do have a backlog of orders that we would be able to ship initially. And then as we think about upgrades, those are shorter install times than, let's say, Pyxis so it would be a couple of months typically in that space from an order to implementation for Alaris."

So that's a positive. We haven't addressed the growth rate of SpinCo going forward. You heard Dev say that his emphasis is on growth. And we think that being a separate public company, it unleashes that growth potential because right now, that SpinCo would be fighting or diabetes care within BD is fighting for investment against other items that we are -- feel more strategic. So as a separate company, it can invest whether that is internally more investment in R&D or through M&A, it can do that.

We see very attractive opportunities in those areas that also, of course, diabetes business, as we look at it, it has a more unique business profile relative to our other franchises. So for example, they have very distinct patients, physician and distribution channel dynamics as compared to our other businesses. 
As you think about our BD Medical, excluding Diabetes, our Interventional and our Life Science franchise, they have very significant overlap in call points, right? They all call on health care systems. It's where we sell the majority of our life science products, our interventional products and our beating MMS and MDS products into that channel. That's very different than diabetes. And as we think about that digital footprint that we've been building out, how we're leveraging data and connectivity connected into electronic medical records across the segments that's also a different dynamic than what we see in the diabetes care business, which is, again, it's not connecting into EMRs in the same way, it's more directly outbound in the patient. 
And as you think about future technologies like patch pump or other options, they also will require a very different commercial channel than is the -- what's inherent in the rest of the BD businesses, be the eye life sciences or the rest of Medical. So we think that absolutely, there are tremendous opportunities for BD Diabetes Care business, which is why we're excited that spinning them will be -- allow them to unleash that potential, not competing with other programs in the company, allowing them to attract the best talent, reinvest their profits back into driving their strategy in a very focused way and will allow RemainCo BD to also be more focused in executing our strategy.

So the bottom line is -- the good news is the momentum is in the core. Moderating slightly on COVID testing as we look out the second half of the year. You put all those together and we're right where we said we would be in terms of both the top line and the bottom line. 
On the bottom line, we're also seeing a little bit of an impact on the profitability of Veritor as the prices begin to move more rapidly towards the typical flu pricing.

It's going to be a great product for them. It's really a breakthrough technology that's in a market that, again, is growing much faster than the company average. As we think about the 2 acquisitions in MMS that get us into the non-acute medication management area. That's an area that's growing much faster than the acute care medication management. As we've made very clear in our strategy, helping to enable the shift of care into the non-acute sector is important to us.

We had acquired that last year, but we didn't announce it until now, until we're actually launching it. So we'll do the same there. 
And the same factor with a new vascular access product that we're excited about that we just closed in the last month or so, which we'll talk about very forthcoming as we bring that to market. So a number of different opportunities, all very relevant in driving our business strategy. All of those acquisitions are participating in markets, and we expect to grow faster than the BD average. And again, it's part of our growth strategy."

As we've shared, we have a team of over 200 people who have been working on that submission. They'll continue to be engaged in responding to any FDA questions. And obviously, we'll pivot them towards innovation opportunities as we move forward beyond that as well. But maybe just another point as you think about the timing of it, I can give a little bit more color, is if you look back, right, just factually look back and say, over the last few years, how long has the FDA taken to clear pumps? And the date -- the clearance time ranges from 161 days to 412 days. So those are the facts. So call it, 5.5 to 14 months. So that's a little bit of the logic. While we're not predicting the FDA time line right now, clearly, the timing of approval within FY '22 will have a meaningful impact in the answer to your question in terms of how we see the recovery and how much that contributes in '22. 
And again, as I mentioned before, as we get further in the review process, we'll provide updates as we can. But right now, we're saying it will be prudent based on, again, historical clearance timings, as I just described. So think about the clearance during the second half of our fiscal year 2022.

And don't forget, we had some non-medical necessity earlier in the year. So you think about $200 million of revenues last year. The run rate prior to that was about $450 million thereabouts. So you could see that step down. And then this year, we see less medical necessity, a little bit over [ $60 million ] or so in the first half of the year. We see that tailing off in the second half of the year. So that gives us some things to work with to show that there is certainly a drag on growth rate from the step down offset by some of the medical necessity revenues, but certainly a step down in both '20 and '21. 
As you think about next year, what we were giving you a sense of is that we think it's prudent to model that as during the second half of the year. It could happen sooner, well, was to try to make it happen sooner, but it's prudent to think about it in the second half of the year. And we did point to the fact that there is some ramping that will happen. The good news is that we'll get the full year benefit of that coming back to us in FY '23 regardless. But we do expect to see some of that ramping in the second half of the year."

And so we're not being precise about exactly how much is in each quarter. But it is -- there's more to come. And so it is putting pressure on the margins, which is why we're saying that the guidance for the second half is what it is as we expected it would be. So it is important to keep in mind that, that investment that we're making does drive future growth, it's not something that will impact margins going forward. It's not going to repeat.

As I noted earlier, hernia is one of those areas that severely impacted early ad and recovers late. So that's a bit of a laggard. But in general, the procedures that are critical to health care are coming back. And not only do we see it in our numbers, but the survey data that we gather from physicians, and we typically survey about 300 a month, they are indicating that their volumes are rebounding.

Leading this morning's call today is Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer. 
Given the announcement of the spinoff of our diabetes business, we will also have Dev Kurdikar, our are Worldwide President of Diabetes Care, who has been named CEO of NewCo, to provide his early thoughts on the transaction. Following our prepared remarks, Tom and Chris will be joined for Q&A by our 3 segment presidents, Alberto Mas, President of the Medical Segment; Simon Campion, President of Interventional segment; Dave Hickey, President of the Life Sciences segment.
And before I turn it over to Tom, I want to address a few items. During the call, we'll be making some forward-looking statements, and it is possible that these actual results could differ from our expectations. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause such differences can be found in our earnings release and our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10 and subsequent Form 10-Qs. 
We will also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. Reconciliations to GAAP measures that include details of our purchase accounting and other adjustments can be found in our earnings release and its financial schedules. They are also in the appendix of the Investor Relations presentation slides available at the bd.com website. Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis versus relevant period. When we discuss revenue percent changes, they are on an FX-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted.  
To avoid any confusion, when we refer to any given period, whether that's on a quarter or year basis, we will be referring to the period in fiscal terms, unless we specifically call it out as a calendar period. Finally, when we refer to NewCo during today's call, we are referring to the independent publicly traded diabetes company following the effective date of the spin, while RemainCo refers to BD post separation.  
And with all that said, I am very pleased to turn it over to Tom. Tom?"

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will provide an update on how we are executing on creating value for our stakeholders through our BD 2025 strategy. We have a lot of exciting updates for you, so let's jump r",3298,"Thanks, Kristen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will provide an update on how we are executing on creating value for our stakeholders through our BD 2025 strategy. We have a lot of exciting updates for you, so let's jump right in.  
Our second quarter results came in better than expected, and we delivered strong revenue and EPS growth. We are very pleased with the continued momentum in our core business, and therefore, based on our first half results and our projections for the second half, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2021 guidance. We are making steady progress on each of our growth initiatives, which include very purposely shifting our investments and portfolio into higher-growth categories and shifting our weighted average market growth rate over time.
We are advancing our product pipeline as well as our tuck-in M&A strategy, which now includes making selective investments in earlier stage and potentially disruptive technologies. And this morning, we announced our intention to spin-off our Diabetes Care businesses into a separate public company. We see this planned spin as a significant value-creating opportunity for all stakeholders, for our patients, customers, associates and shareholders.  
As an independent public company, we believe the diabetes business can leverage its global leadership position and unleash its growth potential in this attractive market category through the more efficient allocation of its own capital. For RemainCo BD, this transaction allows us to focus on our prioritized core businesses. We expect this transaction to strengthen our mid-single-digit revenue and double-digit total return growth profile. We expect the spin to be completed in the first half of calendar year 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, including final approval by the BD Board of Directors and the SEC declaring our registration statement effective.
We are progressing well against our simplification initiatives, which are focused on reducing complexity, enhancing our product quality, refining our customer experience and improving cost efficiencies. Our recode initiatives are progressing on track to generate savings of $300 million by the end of FY '24. And these initiatives help unlock value and allow us the flexibility to reinvest back into our business to fuel future growth. Chris will talk more about our capital allocation strategy later in the call, but we expect share repurchases to return as part of a more balanced capital allocation strategy as our balance sheet position and cash flows have strengthened over the past year.
We also continue to be guided by our purpose of advancing the world of health and continue to make great progress on our ESG initiatives. On Earth Day, we reaffirmed our climate change targets, which includes our pledge to be carbon neutral by 2040 across our direct operations. 
Last week, as I was preparing for our Board meeting, I reflected on where we were a year ago, where we are today and the progress we've made. First, we achieved my number one priority since taking over as CEO. Last week, we announced that we submitted our Alaris 510(k) premarket notification. This is an important milestone in our commitment to our customers and our patients. The Alaris pump is the leading infusion pump in the U.S. market, administering more than 1 million infusions each day. 
Second, we've significantly strengthened our balance sheet and cash flows. Over the past year, we've improved our net leverage ratio by a full turn from 3.4x to 2.4x and taken actions to meaningfully strengthen our cash flows. 
Third, we answered the call to action with COVID. We developed a series of innovative COVID diagnostic tests and scaled these to diagnose patients and help control the spread. We secured our global supply chain to ensure that our essential medical devices were available to treat COVID patients in ICUs around the world, including BD devices used in the treatment of an estimated 90% of U.S. ICU patients. And today, we continue to add capacity and enable over 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine to be delivered using our injection devices. I am very proud of our team's impact when it matters most.
Fourth, we reinvested in growth. We set up the BD Innovation and Growth Fund and advanced impactful new innovation programs in each of our businesses. We acquired 11 tuck-in acquisitions since the beginning of 2020 along with early-stage investments, and we're reinvesting some of BD Veritor profits back into the business and behind our BD 2025 strategy.
Fifth, we started to shift the BD culture to one of a growth mindset. We've been systematically advancing our leadership capabilities and culture in this area, which includes partnering with the Neuro Leadership Institute to embed an enhanced focus on innovation and growth across our culture and mindset, and the progress we're making with shifting the culture is very real and tangible. And today, we are announcing our intention to spin-off the diabetes business. We believe this spin-off will be another value-creating opportunity for our shareholders. But what excites me most is not what we've done, it's where we're going and what's to come. Over the next several years, all of our future successes and milestones to come. The BD 2025 value-creation story has only just begun. And later this year, we are planning to host an Investor Day, and we'll look forward to sharing greater insights into our 2025 strategy and pipeline.
So with that, let's turn to Slide 8 and our second quarter results. Chris is going to run through our financial results in greater detail later on. But just to highlight, we are very pleased with our second quarter results as the BD team continued to execute well. Our second quarter revenues totaled $4.9 billion, up 15.4% on a reported basis and up 12.2% on an FX-neutral basis. I was particularly pleased with the continued momentum of our core businesses, which were above our expectations in all 3 business segments.
To call out a few, our market-leading BD Pharmaceutical Systems business continues to deliver robust revenue growth of nearly 10%. Medication Delivery Solutions business was up over 8% as we continue to deliver on our COVID vaccine injection devices commitments, and our results were also driven by higher patient acuity. Our Bioscience business turned in double-digit growth as research activity has rebounded and urology and critical care continued to perform well, driven by PureWick and targeted temperature management.  
In China, where we began to anniversary the impact of COVID-19, we saw a strong revenue growth of 62%, and we continue to invest, support our future growth, including reinvesting some of the profits from our COVID diagnostics. Our R&D spending was up 18.7% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. Adjusted EPS was $3.19, representing year-over-year growth of 25.1% on a reported and 22.7% on a currency-neutral basis. The performance of our business, particularly our core, gives us comfort to reaffirm our fiscal 2021 guidance ranges, which include currency-neutral revenue growth of 10% to 12% and adjusted EPS guidance of $12.75 to $12.85, up 25% to 26% on a year-over-year basis.  
Turning to Slide 9. As I discussed before, we are proud to play such an important role in the COVID-19 pandemic response across the continuum of care from diagnostics to treatment and now prevention. As vaccination campaigns continue to progress, I am pleased to announce that we now have cumulative commitments for over 1.7 billion injection devices to administer COVID vaccines globally. These commitments will stretch through our fiscal 2022 period. And therefore, we now see higher demand in our MDS hypodermic business as being durable into next year. We also see potential opportunity for our prefilled business in the future and are now working with several partners at various stages of formulation testing on possible pre-filled COVID-19 vaccines.  
Turning to Slide 10. I will provide an update on our COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing business. We recently announced several emergency use authorizations or EUAs from the FDA. We received EUAs for our combination COVID flu assays for both BD Veritor and BD MAX, and we believe combination tests are going to be important in the next flu season. Next, we extended our EUA for the BD Veritor COVID-19 test to include a claim for screening asymptomatic individuals by serial testing. Several peer-reviewed publications have supported the benefits of serial rapid antigen testing, and we are continuing to develop our BD Veritor at-home test. Our test is designed to deliver a clear, digitally displayed record of test results on a smartphone to eliminate the reading guess work, and we also designed it to allow the data to be digitally shared by the user to eliminate errors and report sharing. Our BD Veritor at-home antigen test is also expected to have some other features that we believe will further differentiate it versus others on the market. Our antigen tests will all be manufactured on the same production lines to leverage economies of scale and our capital investments.  
Turning to Slide 11. Growth through innovation is central to our BD 2025 strategy. We are advancing our R&D pipeline across all 3 of our segments. And as you can see on this slide, identified by the green circles, several products have launched or achieved clearance since the beginning of the year. I've already covered our regulatory clearances related to COVID Diagnostics, and I'm happy to share that we've made steady progress in our medical segment with a healthy cadence of relevant portfolio expansions and extensions across the MDS portfolio, such as the broadening of our leading peripheral IV catheter position with the introduction of our first passive safety catheter in the United States, the BD Cathena IV safety catheter. We launched a new catheter stabilization solution for peripheral IV catheters with the BD Secura stabilization device and further advanced the safety of the BD PhaSeal optimal product family with a locking injector. 
In interventional, we're launching Sensica, a smart connected folly catheter, which can be an important tool for the ICU. It provides weight-normalized urine output data that is one of the early parameters used by clinicians to help identify acute kidney injury. BD Sensica can wirelessly transmit this data to the hospital's electronic medical record.  
We're also looking forward to launching Pristine later this quarter. Pristine is our new long-term hemodialysis catheter with unique side hole-free symmetric wide tip distal lumen design. The design of the product is intended to help minimize thrombus adhesion, facilitate blood clot aspiration prior to hemodialysis treatment and help minimize recirculation rates in both forward and reverse.
Turning to Slide 12. As I have often said over the last year, Alaris was my number one priority, and last week, we announced a very important milestone. We submitted our 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA for our BD Alaris system. I am extremely proud of our MMS, regulatory affairs, quality and R&D teams for their dedication and hard work to ensure a comprehensive submission. We're also very appreciative of the FDA's collaboration. We recognize this is one important step, and we look forward to working with them through the FDA review process to obtain clearance for the updated BD Alaris system.
Just to give a sense of what is included in the submission and how comprehensive it is. The 510(k) submission is intended to bring our file up to date for all changes to the pump since the last 510(k) was cleared. We are also implementing updated features and addressing open recall issues, including through a new version of the BD Alaris system software that will provide clinical, operational and cybersecurity updates. These updates are part of our overall commitment to safeguard infusion programming. And included in the software will be updates to our BD Alaris Guardrail Suite and BD Alaris EMR interoperability, including cybersecurity updates, network security and advanced data encryption. 
From a hardware perspective, our submission includes updated PCU, LVP, syringe and ETCO2 modules as well as our existing PCA module. We plan to continue to advance the BD Alaris system with future updates and subsequent submissions. We filed a substantial amount of data to support the filing. This is a complex and comprehensive submission. Therefore, we would expect that the FDA review process will take some time to complete. And while we're not intending to predict the FDA-specific time line, we certainly recognize that our stakeholders would like to have some input for modeling purposes, and we believe it would be prudent to think about Alaris' clearance sometime during the second half of our fiscal year 2022. We plan to update you if there are any significant developments. And for now, we expect to continue to ship to our customers who qualify under medical necessity. We've learned a lot of valuable lessons and gained insights during this journey that we're applying to our ongoing next-generation pump platform programs as well as our quality and risk management systems.  
Turning to Slide 13. We are making significant progress with our tuck-in M&A strategy. Year-to-date, we've closed 5 acquisitions, and we have a robust funnel of opportunities at various stages. We continue to exercise financial discipline in addition to ensuring deals meet our strategic and operational criteria. This includes them being accretive to our growth profile, supporting our key innovation themes, advancing our strategic positions, meeting our financial hurdles and creating shareholder value. As part of building a more holistic approach to expanding our inorganic growth funnel, we also expanded our evaluation and selective investment in early-stage strategic opportunities.
On Slide 14, we highlight our key innovation themes and with some of our tuck-in acquisitions and R&D products across our 3 business segments that align to these themes, some of which I've already highlighted. So within this theme of applying smart devices, robotics, analytics and artificial intelligence to improve care processes, I've already discussed our Smart Foley catheter, Sensica. We also continue to develop new modules of Kiestra, our total lab automation system. Kiestra, as you know, can improve standardization, significantly enhance lab efficiencies and staff productivity. Within Medical, our health site platform is designed to continue to support enterprise-wide medication management. We continue to evolve our capabilities with health site diversions, which was originally launched in fiscal 2019 for Pyxis.  
We have scaled tremendously over the last year in terms of our commercial sites, and we have plans to expand into the OR, followed by integration of infusion data and central pharmacy. Within this theme of enabling new care settings, you've seen us acquire Med Bank and GSL Solutions to expand our medication management offering into the faster-growth non-acute settings and strengthen our existing dispensing leadership position. 
Our PureWick dry dock urine collection system has been helping women with urinary incontinence outside of the acute setting and contributing to the strong growth in our UCC franchise. And I've already talked about how we're excited about the upcoming launch of our BD veritor at-home COVID-19 test that enables the expansion of testing into everyday settings.  
Lastly, our third theme is improving diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases. I already mentioned Pristine, and I've talked about, in the past, our BD Oncology HPV assay, which offers extended genotyping that supports risk stratification. And we look forward to launching this assay on our BD core system in the United States later this year. 
One other product that we haven't talked a lot about is our BD Libertas subcutaneous drug delivery system for the administration of viscous biologics. Our Pharmaceutical Systems business is excited to offer this option to our biopharmaceutical partners as a combination product. These products not only add value to our customers, patients and health care system but they add to our confidence in a sustainable, durable, mid-single-digit growth profile. 
Now turning to Slide 15. As I've described so far on this call, we are making substantial progress in advancing our BD 2025 strategy, which is about unleashing the growth potential of BD, delivering innovation to our customers, empowering our associates and creating value for our shareholders. And I'm really excited today to announce a bold step in our BD 2025 strategy. Our intention to spin-off our diabetes business to our shareholders, which we believe is a value-creating transaction.
Our Diabetes Care business generated $1.1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2020, is a global leader in insulin injection devices. Consistent with our continuing focus on delivering shareholder value, we undergo strategic reviews to identify ways to create value and determine that the strategic priorities of BD have diverged from those of our Diabetes Care business. We believe a spin-off will position both companies for long-term growth and success by allowing both to focus on their respective core markets, innovations and customer outcomes. Each company will be able to more efficiently allocate its resources and capital, best positioning the respective companies for their success and value creation. We see tremendous potential to create value for our Diabetes Care business ahead.  
And let's turn to Slide 16 to dive into some of the benefits in greater detail. We see the spin-off as an operating catalyst for our Diabetes Care business. As an independent public company, NewCo will be able to more effectively allocate its human, operational and financial resources to implement a refined growth strategy that will allow it to focus on innovation and improving the care of patients living with diabetes. Being a separate entity will also better enable NewCo to attract and retain talent, align management and employee incentives and have a stock currency that it can use for future acquisitions.
For RemainCo BD, we expect the spin-off to strengthen our mid-single-digit FX-neutral revenue growth. We estimate the uplift to our revenue growth rate to be about 30 basis points and see this as strengthening our double-digit total return growth profile. The spin-off will allow RemainCo to focus on our R&D, tuck-in M&A and customer growth strategies, simplify our overall focus and maintain financial flexibility. Considering all of these benefits, we believe this transaction has the potential to create value for our shareholders, which will be owners of both companies.
Slide 17 provides an overview of the relevant transaction details, and I've already covered many of these topics. The spin-off is expected to be implemented by a means of a distribution of 100% of the shares of a newly traded -- publicly traded entity to BD shareholders and is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Over the next several months, we'll be filing our Form 10, which will include the carve-out financial statements. Again, we expect the spin-off to be completed in the first half of fiscal year 2022, subject to market, regulatory and other conditions, including final approval by the Board of Directors and the effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement that will be filed with the SEC.  
Turning to Slide 18. NewCo will be led by an experienced management team, and I am very pleased to share that Dev Kurdikar, who joined us earlier this year as the Worldwide President of Diabetes Care, will be the CEO of NewCo. Dev has a long history in the medtech sector, most recently serving as the CEO of Cardiac Science. Dev has been engaged with the business now for the last few months and will share some of his preliminary thoughts in a moment.  
I'm also very happy to announce that Jake Elguicze, the Former Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations of Teleflex, has joined BD and will be the CFO of NewCo upon spin. Jake brings extensive experience in treasury, financial planning, reporting and analysis and investor relations. We're confident that Dev and Jake are the right team to lead NewCo as they embark on this journey that we believe will create value for all stakeholders.  
So with that, I want to turn it over to Dev to provide his perspectives on today's announcement. Dev?"

I see a tremendous opportunity to build shareholder value and advance care for patients who suffer from diabetes. I'm also very humbled to be leading this amazing organization. 
The Diabetes Care business has a long history of caring for patients living with the disease, dating back to BD's introduction of the world's first specialized insulin syringe almost 100 years ago in 1924. Since then, BD has played a leading role in the delivery of insulin, including helping to drive the adoption of insulin pens, which utilize our pen needle technology, as a leading modality for insulin injection. Our Diabetes Care business now reaches more diabetic patients than any other medical device company in the world today. We manufacture 8 billion devices per year and are the global leader in insulin injection devices.
As Tom mentioned earlier, the business generated nearly $1.1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2020, derived from the sale of insulin injection devices such as pen needles and insulin syringes as well as other accessories. One factor that attracted me to this opportunity was the global breadth of the business, with 48% of the revenues generated outside the United States, including 17% in emerging markets.  
And why is this important? As you can see on Slide 21, diabetes is a growing chronic condition across the globe, with some of the higher prevalence rates expected to be in the emerging market regions. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that the number of adults living with diabetes is expected to grow from 463 million in 2019 to 578 million in 2030 and 700 million by 2045. Most of these patients will likely continue to rely on traditional injection devices for their insulin needs. The rapid growth of the disease will likely place a significant burden on health care systems around the world as patients with diabetes are often afflicted with multiple comorbidities, like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetic retinopathy and lower limb complications.  
While I've only been with the company for a few months now, I can assure you that my passion and vision for NewCo is one of growth. Injection devices, like pen needle and syringes, are likely to remain a key part of their treatment paradigm for people with diabetes on a global basis for the foreseeable future. We will look to leverage our global footprint to capitalize on these demographic trends. However, we'll also look to invest in novel insulin delivery technologies, including our internal type 2 patch technologies. We also plan to supplement our internal R&D product development efforts more broadly and accelerate our growth profile through strategic M&A to broaden our product offerings and enter adjacencies on new growth categories.  
Let me end by saying how excited and humbled I am to have this opportunity to lead NewCo. I am confident that our team will work tirelessly to advance care for our patients while building shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn it over back to Tom."

Including our recent commitment to be carbon neutral across direct operations by 2040. We also continue to make progress towards identifying our 2030 goals, and we look forward to sharing more details behind our 2030 sustainability plan with you in future engagements.  
Before turning it over to Chris, I want to say again how proud I am of the organization for the progress we've made in advancing the BD 2025 strategy. We are purposely shifting our focus to growth opportunities. Simplifying the organization to remove complexity as I firmly believe complexity gets in the way of growth, and we're empowering our associates with a growth mindset. We are committed to doing the right things the right way and fulfilling our purpose of advancing the world of health. 
I also want to reiterate how excited I am for what's ahead for both RemainCo BD and NewCo. BD's Board of Directors and management team believe our plans to spin-off the Diabetes Care business will create value for all stakeholders.

And before I turn to the results, let me also share my enthusiasm for the spin-off of our Diabetes Care business. I see the transaction is a win-win for all stakeholders, our shareholders, our employees, our customers and our patients. I'm confident that we have the right leadership to navigate NewCo on this exciting journey ahead.
Now let me turn to the second quarter financial results. Slide 27 summarizes our high-level revenue performance. Our revenues came in just over $4.9 billion, up 15.4% on a reported basis and up 12.2% on an FX-neutral basis. As Tom mentioned, we were very pleased with our results. Our core segment results, excluding COVID-19 diagnostic testings, were ahead of our expectations across all segments.
Now turning to Slide 28. Our medical segment delivered 4.7% FX-neutral revenue growth, led by our market-leading BD Pharmaceutical Solutions Systems business, which continues to deliver robust revenue growth of nearly 10%. We are proceeding with our capacity expansion to support the future growth of this business unit.  
MDS grew a solid 8.1%, which included $43 million from COVID-19 vaccination injection device revenues. We also benefited from higher patient acuity and higher utilization internationally, particularly in China where we anniversaried the impact of COVID-19.  
Now turning to Slide 29. Our Life Science segment delivered revenue growth of nearly 38% on an FX-neutral basis. Our COVID-19 diagnostic testing revenues totaled $480 million and are included in our Integrated Diagnostics Solutions business. While BD Veritor ASPs were as expected in the low to mid-teens, the market's overall demand for symptomatic COVID diagnostic testing was lower.
Looking at our IDS business, excluding COVID testing, our routine diagnostic testing has not yet fully recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels. There was virtually no traditional flu this year, so we did not have our usual flu test revenues, and this impacted our IDS growth rate by 540 basis points and our BD Life Sciences growth rate but 410 basis points. The impact to our overall BD growth rate was 110 basis points.  
Our Biosciences business unit delivered strong growth of over 12% as research lab activity has recovered nicely. We are seeing strong demand for research instruments and reagents as well as from biopharmaceutical companies for vaccine research and development.
As shown on Slide 30, the BD Interventional segment was flat this quarter, which was better than expected given the COVID-19 resurgences. The performance in surgery and PI reflected the early impact from the COVID resurgence. However, we did see recovery in elective procedures as the quarter progressed, and this trend has continued into April. Our urology and critical care franchise continues to deliver solid growth, led by our Purewick and targeted temperature management product lines.  
Turning to our results by geographic regions on Slide 31. In the United States, revenues were up 1.9%. As we had discussed on our February earnings call, we did see some early impact from COVID-19 resurgence, which waned as the quarter progressed, and we exited March with improved momentum, and this continued in April.  
International revenues were up 25.7% on a currency-neutral basis as we begin to anniversary the initial impact of COVID-19, particularly in China, where our revenues were up 62%. We also benefited from our COVID-19 responses, our diagnostic testing and vaccine injection delivery device revenues.  
Now turning to the P&L on Slide 32. As expected, our gross margin was sequentially lower as compared to our first quarter. Our gross margin was 53.8%, driven mostly by the lower COVID diagnostic testing revenues. On a year-over-year basis, the gross margin included a 70 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange and 70 basis points from reinvestment initiatives. Favorable impacts from our continuous improvement initiatives were offset by product quality-related expenses.  
Our SSG&A spending rose 9% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis, including a 380 basis point impact from deferred compensation, which, as you know, is fully offset in other income expense. The remaining increase in SSG&A is primarily related to higher shipping costs and investment spending as part of our BD Veritor profit reinvestments.
Our R&D spending ramped sequentially as planned as we reinvested some of the BD Veritor profits behind new pipeline innovations. R&D increased 18.7% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis to $295 million, representing 6% of our revenues.
Our operating income grew 14.3% on a year-over-year reported basis and 13% on an FX-neutral basis. Our operating margin was 24.5%, up 20 basis points on an FX-neutral basis. Deferred compensation was an 80 basis point headwind. Our interest and other expenses totaled $111 million versus $170 million in the year ago period. The reduction of interest other net on a year-over-year basis primarily reflects a decrease in deferred compensation, offsetting increases in SSG&A, as previously mentioned. It also reflects reduced interest expense due to debt repayment and refinancing activities and lower interest rates.  
Our tax rate was 12%, lower than expected due to discrete tax items that occurred this quarter. Our adjusted EPS increased 25.1% over the prior year to $3.19 on a reported basis and were up 22.7% on an FX-neutral basis. The average diluted share count used to calculate our EPS in the quarter was $293.6 million.  
Now turning to Slide 33, I'd like to provide an update on our capital allocation priorities, but first, I want to update you on the great progress we made with our cash flows and balance sheet on a year-to-date basis. For the first half of the year, our cash flows from operations have more than doubled, growing from $1.2 billion to $2.8 billion, driven by the improvement in our net income as well as working capital. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in cash and equivalents, and our net leverage ratio was 2.4x, a full turn lower than a year ago. Going forward, our capital allocation strategy will be more balanced than it had been in the past as we were paying down our debt. Now more of our cash can be deployed to support our growth strategy, tuck-in M&A, maintaining a competitive dividend and returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases. As a reminder, under the existing share repurchase authorization plan, we have just under 7.9 million shares or roughly $2 billion remaining. Also note that we would expect BD's dividend to be unaffected by the diabetes spin-off and therefore, would increase BD's payout ratio.  
Next, I want to address our fiscal 2021 guidance and provide some general commentary on our overall outlook, which you can see on Slide 34. From a reporting perspective, we will continue to report our diabetes business with our BD results until the spin-off of the diabetes business is complete. We're very pleased with the results for the quarter, how we are building momentum in our core, advancing our pipeline and achieving critical milestones. We are also pleased with the early progress we see from BD Veritor profit reinvestments. We believe these projects should begin to provide incremental growth beginning in late 2022. 
We are reaffirming our fiscal 2021 financial guidance ranges. We continue to expect reported revenue growth of 12% to 14% for the full year 2021. The this reflects FX-neutral revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12%. BD Veritor revenues towards the higher end of the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range, and foreign currency adding approximately 200 basis points. We also continue to expect adjusted EPS in the range of $12.75 to $12.85, which represents growth of 25% to 26% year-over-year. 
Now we wanted to give you some color as you consider your models for the back half of the year. We continue to reinvest some of the Veritor profits to fund projects in line with our BD 2025 strategic pillars of growth simplify and power. Our investments continue to put temporary pressure on both our gross and operating margins in 2021. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect our operating margins in the second half of the year to be in the low 20s, reflecting our reinvestment initiatives as well as higher raw material costs. As a reminder, we expect the reinvestment pressures that you're seeing on our margins to lift next year.
As you've seen in the past, from time to time, there can be some volatility in our tax rate. We now expect our FY '21 tax rate to be slightly lower than FY '20's tax rate. This helps to offset some gross margin pressure from the lower ASPs from Veritor as pricing is now approaching compared to our flu test price a bit faster than we originally anticipated.
Regarding 2022, given the momentum we are seeing, our progress with our R&D pipeline, the reinvestments of our BD Veritor proceeds and our tuck-in acquisition strategy, we have increased confidence in our core outlook. In fiscal 22, excluding COVID-19 testing and Alaris 510(k) clearance, we expect our revenues to grow solidly in the mid-single digits. As you heard Tom mention, while we're not intending to predict the FDA's time line, we recognize the desire to have some input for modeling purposes. We believe it would be prudent to think about Alaris' 510(k) clearance sometime during the second half of our fiscal 2022. We believe it would also be prudent to model both our revenues and our margins gradually ramping as we scale our selling and manufacturing efforts.
In conclusion, we are really pleased with our second quarter results and the momentum across our businesses. We are excited about our plans to spin-off of the diabetes business and see this as an important opportunity to create value for our shareholders.  
With that, Tom, Alberto, Simon, Dave and I are happy to take any questions you have. Operator, please open up the line for Q&A."

The relaunch of -- the expected relaunch of Alaris, obviously, next year would also be a margin tailwind from that perspective as we start getting absorption back in that plant as well as it tends to be a higher-margin item. And so those are all positives as well as continued volume returning in as we think about the recovery post-pandemic, particularly in areas like BDI, which we saw, and we can talk about later on. We saw good continued recovery, particularly in the back end of the quarter in March, and we continue to see that strong momentum, and Simon can comment on that later on as we look at, at April in procedure volume recovery."

One is we see continued durable growth you saw last year in Pharmaceutical Systems. You saw it again in the quarter that they were in 8% plus, I think, last year, growth, and we see that durably, higher-than-average company growth is my intention there. And you saw us obviously communicate, I think it was last quarter or the quarter before, over $1 billion, $1.2 billion of incremental investment, capital investment in that business to support the long-term growth outlook. So that's number one. We also reaffirm that we expect -- we are in discussions, and we have collaborations going on with several pharma companies about putting COVID vaccines in prefilled syringes. So again, another opportunity as we think about that business long term.  
In MDS, we also commented that, I remember a year ago or less than a year ago, we were talking about that we could do up to 1 billion syringes to help in the COVID vaccination. We now -- today announced we have orders -- commitments in hand for 1.7 billion syringes that spans well into FY '22. And so we see while we were wondering was there going to be a cliff of syringes into '22, we see that demand in our MDS business as being durable into '22. And certainly, as we think about potential even further demand, from things like booster shots, that would just make that demand even more durable. Overall, that business continues to do well in terms of taking share in the catheter space as well as a series of new innovations. They obviously had had some benefits from higher acuity patients in the ICU, which are maybe using products like midlines or PICCs, which have higher ASPs than peripheral catheters for shorter-time stays, but there's strong durable trends there, I think, in MDS. And obviously, MMS, we look forward with the submission of the 510(k) to have bigger growth opportunities as we look ahead to '22.  
I think I'll turn it over to Simon on BDI. But I would say what you saw is, is that the impact from the pandemic was very minimal in the first 2 months of the quarter last year for BDI. And so I think you see just that comparable happening given our product mix. And then we did see strong trajectory and uptake in March, and we saw that continue into April. Simon."

So continues to be a mid- to high single-digit performer for us this quarter. Peripheral, as Tom has mentioned, Peripheral, we did see impacts early in the quarter in this space and particularly in the ESKD business, and that is -- that should not be a surprise to you based on what you've probably heard from others involved in that space, but a sequential improvement through the end of March and into April, and the outlook remained positive there.  
And then with Surgery, no great surprise to us. Two factors driving that. Number one, hernia is not an emergent procedure. So patients have had hernias for several years. So that is typically impacted first when a resurgence happens and they are treated later when the recovery is initiated. And secondly, the Q2 of last year for us had a particularly high growth in ChloraPrep, I would say, higher than normal. So that's a bit of an offset as we move into this quarter. But the sustainability of our business, I think, is demonstrated in China, for example, this past quarter. We were very significantly impacted in Q2 last year in China, and it has rebounded really strongly in Q2 of this year. So we remain confident in our ability to recover our business as the resurgence abates here."

But to your point, we're almost -- we ended the first 2 quarters at almost $1 billion of revenue on Veritor. So you could think we're all basically roughly 2/3 of the way through that number halfway through the year, which gives us confidence in reiterating that towards the high end of that range. And as you said, it's maybe a little bit less than what you indicated would be split by quarter there. 
On the Alaris, we do have a backlog of orders that we would be able to ship initially. And then as we think about upgrades, those are shorter install times than, let's say, Pyxis so it would be a couple of months typically in that space from an order to implementation for Alaris."

So that's a positive. We haven't addressed the growth rate of SpinCo going forward. You heard Dev say that his emphasis is on growth. And we think that being a separate public company, it unleashes that growth potential because right now, SpinCo would be fighting or diabetes care within BD is fighting for investment against other items that we are -- feel more strategic.

So it's a great question. As we think about other opportunities in the company that we have, whether or not it's across our Interventional segment, and just the tremendous technology opportunities that are happening there in our BD Medical segment as well, future of medication management and the opportunities in the non-acute space, the opportunity, again, to apply automation and informatics across both our Interventional and Medical and our Life Science business are significant for us. We see very attractive opportunities in those areas. And also, of course, diabetes business, as we look at it, it has a more unique business profile relative to our other franchises. So for example, they have very distinct patients, physician and distribution channel dynamics as compared to our other businesses. 
As you think about our BD Medical, excluding Diabetes, our Interventional and our Life Science franchise, they have very significant overlap in call points, right? They all call on health care systems. It's where we sell the majority of our Life Science products, our Interventional products and our BD MMS and MDS products into that channel. That's very different than diabetes. And as we think about that digital footprint that we've been building out, how we're leveraging data and connectivity connected into electronic medical records across the segments that's also a different dynamic than what we see in the diabetes care business, which is, again, it's not connecting into EMRs in the same way, it's more directly outbound in the patient. 
And as you think about future technologies like patch pump or other options, they also will require a very different commercial channel than is the -- what's inherent in the rest of the BD businesses, be the eye life sciences or the rest of Medical. So we think that absolutely, there are tremendous opportunities for BD Diabetes Care business, which is why we're excited that spinning them will be -- allow them to unleash that potential, not competing with other programs in the company, allowing them to attract the best talent, reinvest their profits back into driving their strategy in a very focused way and will allow RemainCo BD to also be more focused in executing our strategy. So that's why we, again, reiterate why we're so excited about this being a tremendous opportunity for not only the business, but for our shareholders and our associates."

So a couple of things going on as we think about and contemplate the remainder of '21. So number one, that core momentum is increasing. We did mention that Veritor is still within that -- towards the high end of that 1% to 1.5% range. But it has moderated slightly as volumes have come down a bit from the last time we gave guidance. And so that offsets that a little bit. And when you're looking at the pure dollars, it's that Veritor testing and the COVID testing that's impacting the pure dollars. 
So the bottom line is -- the good news is the momentum is in the core, moderating slightly on COVID testing as we look out the second half of the year. You put all those together and we're right where we said we would be in terms of both the top line and the bottom line. 
On the bottom line, we're also seeing a little bit of an impact on the profitability of Veritor as the prices begin to move more rapidly towards the typical flu pricing. And so that's having an impact, and that's being offset in the second half of the year. So we're still within the guidance range on the top and the bottom."

So we obviously view that as a form of -- we think about organic and inorganic innovation opportunities as both fueling that growth profile that we have and that we've defined. I think as we think about just the 5 that we've done this year, obviously, 6 last year, there are a number of them that are meaningful within the businesses that we have. We're really excited about the new catheter, for example, in BDI in their Peripheral Intervention business, which is where that will show up. It's going to be a great product for them. It's really a breakthrough technology that's in a market that, again, is growing much faster than the company average. As we think about the 2 acquisitions in MMS that get us into the non-acute medication management area. That's an area that's growing much faster than the acute care medication management. As we've made very clear in our strategy, helping to enable the shift of care into the non-acute sector is important to us. And we want to have a continue our leadership in the acute, but be the leader also in enabling the trend that's happening, building up the capabilities in the non-acute sector. 
And so those 2 acquisitions, I think we'll look back on as being very strategic in enabling that. And both of those markets are growing in the teens. So again, very positive growth rate there. And there's a couple that we haven't disclosed yet, and you can see on the Slide 13 that we had shared, products like an infection prevention product. We haven't launched a new infection prevention product for a while. Our ChloraPrep franchise and a great commercial organization that drives that product globally. This will be a nice new addition to their bag, and we'll talk about that forthcoming, just like we did with Pristine. We had acquired that last year, but we didn't announce it until now, until we're actually launching it. So we'll do the same there. 
And the same factor with a new vascular access product that we're excited about that we just closed in the last month or so, which we'll talk about very forthcoming as we bring that to market. So a number of different opportunities, all very relevant in driving our business strategy. All of those acquisitions are participating in markets, and we expect to grow faster than the BD average.

And obviously, we'll pivot them towards innovation opportunities as we move forward beyond that as well. But maybe just another point as you think about the timing of it, I can give a little bit more color, is if you look back, right, just factually look back and say, over the last few years, how long has the FDA taken to clear pumps. And the date -- the clearance time ranges from 161 days to 412 days. So those are the facts. So call it, 5.5 to 14 months. So that's a little bit of the logic. While we're not predicting the FDA time line right now, clearly, the timing of approval within FY '22 will have a meaningful impact in the answer to your question in terms of how we see the recovery and how much that contributes in '22. 
And again, as I mentioned before, as we get further in the review process, we'll provide updates as we can.

And don't forget, we had some non-medical necessity earlier in the year. So you're thinking about $200 million of revenues last year. The run rate prior to that was about $450 million thereabouts.

We see that tailing off in the second half of the year. So that gives you some things to work with to show that there is certainly a drag on growth rate from the step down, offset by some of the medical necessity revenues, but certainly a step down in both '20 and '21. 
As you think about next year, what we were giving you a sense of is that we think it's prudent to model that as during the second half of the year. It could happen sooner, we'll work to try to make it happen sooner, but it's prudent to think about it in the second half of the year.

So because of that, we don't see any impact on Pyxis. Obviously, there is a great value that one gets from having the full BD enterprise medication management suite that allows you to do things like diversion analytics and other parts of our HealthSight platform to use data from not only dispensing, but infusion as well as our software that's in the central pharmacy. And so all of those things remain the case going forward, and we think customers will continue to see strong value in that."

This morning, BD released its results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. You can find the press release along with the accompanying presentation on the Investor Relations website at investors.bd.com.
Leading this morning's call is Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; as well as Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer.
Following the prepared remarks, Tom and Chris will be joined for Q&A by our 3 segment presidents: Alberto Mas, President of the Medical segment; Simon Campion, President of Interventional segment; and Dave Hickey, President of the Life Sciences segment. 
During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements, and it is possible actual results could differ from our expectations. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause such differences can be found in our earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10 and subsequent Form 10-Qs. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures regarding our performance. Reconciliations to GAAP measures that include the details of purchase accounting and other adjustments can be found in our earnings release and its related financial schedules. There are also in the appendix of the Investor Relations presentation slides available on the bd.com website.
Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis versus the relevant period. Revenue percent changes are on an FX-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. When we refer to the base revenues, we're referring to our total revenues less our COVID diagnostic testing revenues, which include COVID-related revenues from Veritor, BD MAX and swabs. When we refer to base margins, we are adjusting for estimated COVID diagnostic testing profitability and the related profit we have reinvested back into our business. When we refer to any given period referring to fiscal period, it must be noted as a calendar period.
Finally, when we refer to NewCo during today's call, we're referring to the planned spinout of our Diabetes Care business into an independently public traded company following the effective trade date of the spin, which was announced on the second quarter earnings call. RemainCo refers to BD post separation. As a reminder, this transaction is subject to market, regulatory and other conditions, including final approval by BD's Board of Directors and the effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement that will be filed with the SEC.
With that, I'm very pleased to turn it over to Tom. Tom?"

I'll then turn it over to Chris for the financial review and outlook. After our prepared remarks, Chris and I will then open the call up for Q&A.
But first, I want to comment on the other announcement we made this morning regarding Chris' intention to retire from BD and join the Board of our diabetes spin-off. On behalf of the Board of Directors, the leadership team and the company, I want to express my gratitude to Chris for his leadership and service to BD. I'm confident the CFO transition ahead will be seamless and his leadership and experience will make him an excellent director for NewCo's Board.
Now let's jump into our results. We were very pleased with our third quarter performance, powered by strong growth and momentum in our base business across all 3 segments. Revenues totaled $4.9 billion, and our adjusted EPS was $2.74, both ahead of our expectations. Total revenues were up 26.9% on a reported basis and up 22% on a currency-neutral basis. Results included COVID diagnostic testing revenues of $300 million, which contributed 4.8% to growth. Excluding COVID testing revenues, our base business revenues were up 17.6%, better than we expected across most business units. The strong growth reflected the anniversary of the initial COVID wave and the temporary halting of elective procedures and its impact on medical device utilization in the year ago quarter. But Q3's result also reflects the continued momentum driven by the successful execution of our BD 2025 strategy. 
Excluding COVID diagnostic revenues, base business revenues in Q3 fiscal '21 increased 3.9% relative to our pre-pandemic third quarter fiscal 2019 on a currency-neutral basis, which includes the impact of the Alaris ship hold. If you exclude the U.S. infusion systems business, our total revenues would have increased 6.6% relative to our pre-pandemic third quarter fiscal 2019. Our Pharmaceutical Systems and Urology Critical Care franchises continue to be standout performers, where revenues are up 17% and 11%, respectively, over 2019 levels. Bioscience revenues were up 9%. Surgery and Peripheral Intervention revenues are both up 8%. Elsewhere, we see opportunities for improvement ahead in fiscal '22 and beyond. For example, our MDS revenues are up about 2% versus 2019 levels, reflecting the continued impact of COVID as well as the impact of China volume-based purchasing. As hospital utilization improves, we should see further improvements here. Also, as I mentioned, Medication Management Solutions revenues are impacted by the Alaris ship hold, and we expect our revenues to improve once we receive our 510(k) clearance for our BD Alaris system.
While I'm pleased with how we are accelerating our revenue performance and profile, I'm equally pleased with the process we're making in improving our working capital and cash flows. Cash flow performance has been a key focus for us since I became CEO, and that is evident in our working capital metrics. Year-to-date, cash flows from operations totaled $3.7 billion, an increase of 80% from the prior year period. This improvement in our cash flows allowed us to advance our more balanced capital allocation strategy this quarter, which included the repurchase of $1 billion in BD stock at an average price of approximately $242. This marks the first time we have repurchased shares since 2017 and the largest amount we have repurchased since 2012. Even with this repurchase activity, we ended the third quarter with nearly $3.2 billion in cash and an adjusted net leverage ratio of 2.4x.
Overall, I'm really pleased with our performance in the quarter, particularly with the continued positive momentum in our base business. This gives us the confidence to raise our base revenue assumption. We now expect our base business to grow approximately 7.5% to 8% on an FX-neutral basis. This is higher than our previous expectation of mid-single-digit growth. We continue to expect COVID diagnostic testing revenues of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, with more revenues coming from international markets than we previously anticipated. We now expect currency-neutral revenue growth overall of approximately 14%. Our positive base business momentum and a lower tax rate allows us to raise our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 while continuing to reinvest in our business and overcome lower COVID testing profits, including a provision for excess and obsolete COVID testing inventory. We now expect our full year adjusted EPS range to be $12.85 to $12.95. Chris will provide you further details on our financial outlook later in the call.
Next, I want to provide an update on our BD Alaris pump remediation, which remains my #1 priority. Last week, we announced to our customers a positive step in our remediation efforts. Working with the FDA, we are now initiating remediation of existing Alaris system devices in the field by updating the software to version 12.1.2 following submission of the 510(k), which includes this software version. This new software version is intended to remediate the issues identified in the February 4, 2020, recall notice and provide programming, operational and cyber security updates to affected devices. However, the software update has not been reviewed or cleared by the FDA.
To address the question on Alaris clearance timing, we remain confident in our submission and the process we are undertaking, including working closely with the FDA. As Chris will later discuss, we believe it is responsible to not definitively predict the FDA clearance in our FY '22 outlook. We believe this is a prudent approach given the inherent difficulty in predicting FDA clearance time lines.
Next, I want to update you on our BD 2025 strategy of grow, simplify and empower. First, I'd like to focus on our growth pillar. We continue to strengthen our market leadership positions in our durable core business while purposely investing in new innovations that help accelerate and shape irreversible trends that we see transforming global health now and in the decade ahead. I've spoken about these 3 innovation and growth focuses before. And we've been purposely shifting more of our R&D and tuck-in M&A investments into these spaces, which are growing over 6%. Through this, we aim to lift our weighted average market growth rate and performance over time. And this year, we've launched several innovative products and solutions across the continuum of care, across our business units and across the globe. And after completing our strategic portfolio review last month, I can share with you that our pipeline is very deep and wide across our businesses. It's been further enhanced by our acquisitions over the past 18 months. And you'll hear much more about our innovation pipeline at our Investor Day on November 12.
But let me highlight a few of our organic innovations that we're advancing in the near term. In our Life Sciences business, I'm pleased that we will start shipping our BD MAX and BD Veritor combination flu/COVID assays this month, in time for the upcoming respiratory season. Our BD Veritor combination test can detect and distinguish between COVID, flu A and flu B in a single rapid test with a digital readout. We see the combination test becoming the standard of care moving forward, advancing our strategy to enable better outcomes in non-acute settings.
Another innovation area I'd like to highlight is our Biosciences business. Biosciences has been a strong performer this year, and we expect the unit to deliver high single-digit growth for the full year. In June, we launched our new e-commerce site, bdbiosciences.com, which is an entirely new and innovative digital marketplace designed to provide a best-in-class online purchasing experience for our flow cytometry customers. Early feedback has been outstanding, and we're already seeing excellent traction and early adoption. We also have an exciting wave of new product introductions this summer, with the launch of our FACSymphony A5 SE, which is our first BD spectral analyzer, and provides an even higher cellular parameter analysis. We've launched our FACSymphony A1 as well, which offers high-end technology and a cost-effective bench top design.
In addition to these launches, we have a healthy innovation pipeline of modular, scalable new instruments and next-generation dyes that will allow our customers to fully leverage our complete and integrated solution suite of instruments, reagents, informatics, single-cell multiomics and scientific support services. Our products and solutions are being used to uncover new insights on the immune system and develop treatments for many related chronic diseases. You can hear more about our Life Sciences strategy from Dave Hickey, our Executive Vice President of BD Life Sciences; and Puneet Sarin, our Worldwide President of BD Biosciences, at the upcoming UBS Genomics 2.0 and Medtech Innovation Summit on Wednesday, August 11.
Next, let's turn to our inorganic innovations that we've added to our portfolio. As you know, we continue to be focused on tuck-in M&A as a means of adding innovative products and solutions that leverage our core market leadership positions and advance us into higher-growth adjacencies. Year-to-date, we've completed 7 tuck-in acquisitions. While at the same -- at the time of the acquisitions these individual deals were not meaningful from a revenue perspective, as we integrate these transactions into our portfolio, we expect them to strengthen our growth profile.
Our 3 most recent transactions, Velano Vascular, Tepha, Inc. and ZebraSci are good examples of our M&A strategy. Let me begin with Velano Vascular, which is being added to our MDS business. Velano has an innovative needle-free technology that enables high-quality blood draws from existing peripheral IV catheter lines, eliminating the need for multiple needle sticks. This technology will help customers transform the patient experience through the vision of a 1-stick hospital stay. Velano's PIVO device will be integrated into our sales team's bag of broader catheter solutions initially in the U.S. This is a great example of how we're expanding and strengthening our base business.
The second transaction is Tepha, Inc., a leading manufacturer of a proprietary resorbable biopolymer technology. Over the past several years, through our long-standing relationship, we've been commercializing this platform via our Phasix resorbable hernia mesh platform. The acquisition benefits are twofold. First, it provides us with a vertical integration strategy for our current Phasix platform. But more importantly, it provides us with exciting new opportunities to expand our horizon into new high-growth areas of tissue repair, reconstruction and regeneration.
Lastly, we acquired ZebraSci, a pharmaceutical services company. This acquisition provides the opportunity to expand our Pharmaceutical Systems business beyond injectable device design and manufacturing to include best-in-class testing for drug device combination products. ZebraSci allows us to further engage and collaborate with biopharmaceutical companies and particularly smaller companies, where a large amount of the pipeline is, to support the transition of their molecules into prefilled combination devices.
Next, I want to update you on our Simplify initiatives, which are advancing well. Through Project Recode, we are optimizing our portfolio, optimizing our plant network and simplifying our business processes. Project Recode remains on track to achieve $300 million of cumulative savings by the end of FY '24. We are also continuing the rollout of our BD production system, which is a standardized BD approach to driving the next level of lean processes and continuous improvements across our plants. The BD production system is already helping to drive improvements in quality and reductions in our inventory days. We also continue to advance Inspire quality, our quality, regulatory and risk mitigation program.
The last pillar of our BD 2025 strategy is empower, which represents the changes in our culture and capabilities that we're driving to empower our strategy. In Q3, we completed our Voice of Associates survey with over 86% participation. And what stood out was that our associates said we're making strong progress with improvements in 95% of the metrics since our last survey in 2018. And most notable were improvements in our focus areas of growth mindset, strong teams, quality and excitement about the future of BD. We're also advancing our 2030 sustainability strategy, which addresses a range of challenges in our industry while helping to make a difference on relevant issues that affect society and the planet. Our strategy will ensure we remain focused on shared value creation, meaning how we address unmet societal needs through business models and initiatives that also contribute to the commercial success of BD.
Next, I want to provide a brief update on the progress of our proposed diabetes spin-off, which remains on track for the first half of calendar 2022. We are making steady progress with our separation activities. We recently announced that 2 directors from BD's Board will be appointed as future directors of the Diabetes NewCo. Retired Lieutenant General David Melcher will serve as the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. And Dr. Claire Pomeroy will serve as a director. Their appointments will be effective upon the completion of the spin, at which point they will transition from the BD Board to the Board of NewCo. Lieutenant General Melcher brings extensive experience in spin-offs, having served as the CEO of Exelis following its spin-off from ITT. And under his leadership, Exelis spun off its mission systems business as a separate public company. Dr. Pomeroy brings broad experience in health care delivery, administration, medical research and public health. I'm confident their combined experience, along with future planned board members, will help to set NewCo well on its path to becoming a successful independent publicly traded company focused on growth.
While continuing to evaluate additional Board members, we are also continuing to build a new Diabetes Care leadership team through a combination of current BD leaders and new hires, including Deb Kurdikar, who will be NewCo's CEO; Jake Elguicze, who will be CFO, and most recently, Jeff Mann. Jeff Mann joined our Diabetes Care organization and will be General Counsel and Head of Corporate Development for NewCo. Jeff brings more than 2 decades of experience in M&A and transactions, securities law and corporate governance. Most recently, he served as General Counsel and Secretary of Cantel Medical Group.
We are also progressing with the Form 10, which will have the carve-out financials, and we expect it to be publicly available around the end of the calendar year.
Before turning it over to Chris, I will leave you with some key thoughts. First, our base business momentum and our recovery from COVID continues, and it is broad-based. We expect that momentum to carry into fiscal '22 and beyond. As Chris will share with you, today's results underscore our confidence in strong mid-single-digit top line growth for our base business next year. Second, we are executing well against our innovation-driven growth strategy, which includes our internal R&D as well as advancing our tuck-in M&A strategy. And third, I'm proud of the substantial progress in advancing our BD 2025 strategy and how that will unleash our growth potential in the years to come. We'll deliver innovations for our customers, empower our associates and create value for you, our shareholders.
I've been with BD for 20 years, and I've never been more excited. We just completed our annual strategic review process, as I said, and the road ahead is looking more exciting than it did a year ago. We look forward to sharing our BD 2025 strategy in greater detail at our November 12 Investor Day. We hope you can join us.
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials and our outlook."

I'm also very pleased with our overall performance in the quarter, particularly with the base business, which showed continued strong momentum. Third quarter revenues of $4.9 billion increased 26.9% on a reported basis and 22% on a currency-neutral basis and were ahead of our expectations. Our current quarter results also include $300 million in COVID diagnostic testing revenues, compared to $98 million in the prior year period. Excluding COVID diagnostic revenues in both periods, our base business revenues increased 17.6%. Our base business reflects continued strong performance as the market continues to recover from the COVID pandemic, the impact from which was most acute in Q3 of last year.
The BD Medical segment revenues totaled $2.4 billion and were up 7.7% versus the prior year. MDS revenues increased 24%, reflecting a strong recovery in the U.S., led by strong growth in catheters and vascular care devices. Additionally, worldwide revenues included $18 million from COVID vaccination devices. In MMS, the double-digit increase in our dispensing revenues was more than offset by the expected declines in our infusion solutions. As you may recall, when the pandemic started, we saw a higher level of demand for infusion pumps and sets globally. Diabetes Care benefited from an easy comparison to the prior year, the timing of sales and slightly better-than-expected market demand. Pharma Systems continued to deliver strong growth with revenues up 12%, driven by demand for our prefilled devices. BD Life Sciences revenues totaled $1.4 billion and were up 43%. This included the $300 million in COVID diagnostic testing revenues, $212 million related to our BD Veritor system, with the remaining $88 million from BD MAX collection, transport and swabs. Year-to-date, COVID diagnostic testing revenues were over $1.6 billion. Despite lower average selling prices, driven in part by geographic mix, we are still on track to deliver on our target of total worldwide revenues of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion for the fiscal year. 
Excluding COVID diagnostic testing revenues, our Life Sciences segment grew revenues 27%, driven by strong performances in both Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences. IDS revenues increased 49%. Excluding COVID diagnostic testing, IDS revenues increased 27%, driven by strong double-digit performance across specimen management and microbiology. Biosciences increased 27%, driven by both research and clinical solutions. We continue to see strong demand for research reagents and instruments as lab activity is returning to normal levels. We also continue to see steady demand for research reagents globally, fueled by COVID research activities related to vaccines and variants, especially from academic research and biopharma companies.
BD Interventional sales totaled nearly $1.1 billion and were up nearly 35%, reflecting the COVID anniversary impact on elective procedures. Surgery revenues increased 68%, and peripheral intervention increased 32%. Both businesses saw the greatest recovery in the U.S. and Western Europe, which experienced the greatest impact on elective procedure volumes in the prior year quarter. We saw sequential improvement in both surgery and peripheral intervention. However, in the last several weeks, we are seeing some impact from the COVID delta variant on elective surgeries in certain U.S. states. Urology and Critical Care revenues were up approximately 14%, driven by continued growth in our PureWick and targeted temperature management franchises.
Now turning to our P&L. As we expected and have communicated, our gross margins this year are being negatively impacted by COVID-related expenses, manufacturing variances and FX headwinds, which are more acute in the second half of the year. Also, as expected, our gross margin declined sequentially. Our gross margin was 51.5%. However, this included a net negative 90 basis point impact from COVID testing and reinvestments. The 90 basis point impact includes a negative 140 basis point impact from an inventory provision related to COVID testing. Adjusting for the net impact of COVID testing and reinvestments, our underlying base business gross margin was 52.4%. On a sequential basis, our base business gross margin declined from our second quarter rate of 53.7% due to 3 factors: 70 basis points of incremental FX headwinds; 40 basis points from inflationary pressures, including higher raw material costs and inbound freight as these costs roll through our inventory; and 20 basis points of other expenses, including Alaris quality remediation.
Now turning to SSG&A. Our total SSG&A spending increased 21% on a currency-neutral basis to $1.2 billion or 25.2% of revenues. As a reminder, in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we implemented several cost-containment measures in response to the COVID pandemic. In addition, we are continuing to see higher shipping costs. This quarter also included higher expenses related to our COVID profit reinvestment initiatives. As a reminder, the COVID testing reinvestments we made in FY '21 will not reoccur.
Our R&D spending totaled $321 million, an increase of 31.1% on a currency-neutral basis. The higher R&D reflects the timing of project spending, including a higher spending related to the BD Innovation and Growth Fund. Our R&D spending was 6.6% of revenues, which is higher than our long-term target of 6%.
On a currency-neutral basis, our operating income increased 26.5% as compared to our revenue growth of 22%. Our operating margin of 19.8% was slightly below our guidance of below 20%. The inventory provision related to COVID testing I referenced earlier negatively impacted operating margins by approximately 150 basis points.
Interest and other expenses were essentially flat year-over-year at $98 million. The adjusted tax rate was 5.8%, lower than we previously expected due to discrete tax items that occurred this quarter. The lower tax rate essentially offsets the impact from the COVID diagnostic inventory provision in the quarter.
The average diluted share count used to calculate our EPS in the quarter was 291.9 million. We repurchased a total of 4.1 million shares for a total of $1 billion at an average price of approximately $242. Our adjusted EPS increased 24.5% over the prior year to $2.74 on a reported basis and were up 25.9% on a currency-neutral basis.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the balance of the fiscal year. Our guidance continues to assume no major widespread hospital restrictions on elective procedures related to the COVID pandemic. However, we did start to see some impact on elective procedures from the COVID delta variant in the last 1 to 2 weeks in certain U.S. states and have assumed some continuation of this in our guidance. That said, given the continued positive momentum of the base business, we are pleased to be able to cover this and still raise our currency-neutral revenue growth to about 14%, up from our previous range of 10% to 12%. Our revised revenue range would incorporate a base business currency-neutral growth assumption of 7.5% to 8%. Further, we reaffirm our previously communicated COVID diagnostic test revenue range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. We now expect a favorable 250 to 300 basis point impact from currency. This brings our total reported revenue growth to approximately 16.5% to 17.5%. For the full year, we now expect our fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $12.85 to $12.95. This higher guidance reflects the positive base business momentum and a lower tax rate. These benefits allow us to continue to invest while offsetting the COVID testing inventory provision and lower COVID selling prices.
Next, I want to share with you our expectations for gross operating margins for full year fiscal '21 and provide you with an estimate of the net impact of COVID testing and the related reinvestments of profits on our margins. We expect our full year adjusted gross margins to be in the range of 53.5% to 54%, and this range includes a net neutral to slight positive impact from COVID testing reinvestments. We expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 23.5% to 24%. This range includes a 200 basis point contribution from the net impact of COVID testing and reinvestments.
Finally, I'd like to address FY '22. We plan to provide our specific fiscal 2022 guidance on our November earnings call, but we wanted to provide some directional color today. To give you a sense as to what a floor could look like in fiscal '22, we have taken the following approach: As you know, there is a great deal of uncertainty around the level of COVID testing. Therefore, we have not modeled any testing revenue beyond the typical flu season. With the continued momentum we are seeing, we have increased confidence in our ability to deliver strong mid-single-digit revenue growth in fiscal '22 over our fiscal '21 base revenues, which, as a reminder, adjusts for COVID diagnostic testing revenues.
With respect to Alaris, our filing is comprehensive and more complex than most submissions. As we have previously stated, it is possible that the review could be in line with past pump time lines. However, as we have also mentioned, it was more likely to take longer for the FDA to review and ultimately grant clearance. It is inherently difficult to predict clearance timing. We are not assuming Alaris 510(k) clearance. It is difficult to predict how things will play out as shipments are only being made under the medical necessity process. At this time, we have incorporated the assumption that revenues associated with Alaris will be approximately similar to FY '21. We believe it is prudent and responsible not to definitively predict FDA clearance time lines. That said, we remain confident in our submission and the process we are undertaking, including working closely with the FDA to obtain comprehensive 510(k) clearance.
We expect to drive base business gross and operating margin expansion. We expect the operating margins for our base business to expand more than our traditional annual target of at least 50 basis points and translate into double-digit operating income growth. For reference, we expect our base business operating margins to be between 21.5% to 22% in fiscal 2021. With these assumptions, we expect an adjusted EPS floor of at least $12. This represents approximately low teens growth over our expected base business earnings in fiscal 2021. 
Now before opening it up for Q&A, I want to take a moment to comment on today's announcement of my upcoming retirement. With our strong base business momentum, our strengthened balance sheet and improved cash flows, which is evidenced by the increased number of tuck-in acquisitions that we've been doing and the restart of our share buyback program for the first time since 2017, I feel that now is the right time for the transition as the company is well positioned to continue to drive shareholder value and impact the lives of patients around the world. I look forward to helping to ensure a seamless transition to the new CFO. And I'm very excited about the value-creating opportunities ahead for NewCo and helping to ensure this success as a member of their Board.
With that, let me turn it back to Tom."

There's a number of things that have pushed those margins down. We've talked about those in the past. You have Alaris, the ship hold, obviously, is an impact, but that will come back. We also have the drop in the China volume-based procurement is an impact. And obviously, we're seeing some pressure from inflation, et cetera, that have run through.

We took a number of onetime items this year, the spending in the Veritor proceeds, et cetera. So those come back.

It's -- one way of looking at it as your prepandemic gross margins were 56%. I think your base for the fiscal '21 is 53.5% to 54%. Walk through the delta about 70 bps seems to be inflationary costs, 70 bps FX, you do have this inventory charges related to COVID diagnostics and Alaris, 4 moving parts. I guess my question is, when do inflationary cost a bit? Do we have to annualize -- is that mid of next year? Should FX still be a drag next year? And when you think about COVID charge is up, are we done with that in Q4? Or is that going to be a drag in fiscal '22?"

When it comes to just the inflationary question that you had, certainly, I think we felt the most significant impact of inflation already. And we have a good view of where that's going to be in '22 as we rolled up our costs. As you know, it's been an unprecedented period of time there as you look at everything from the cost of resins to electronic components and shipping. Shipping is up 4x to move products, let's say, from Asia or Europe to the U.S. or vice versa.
So we are also being very proactive in -- we're not looking to absorb all of those increases in raw material costs over time. We are beginning to pass on some of those. We've raised our shipping rates for customers, and we are passing on price increases. Of course, as you know, we do have long-term contracts and tenders around the world. And so that's not something that we can pass through those price increases immediately. But we do have a very active program to share those increases. We have to share those increases with customers. That will not happen, though, overnight. So I'll just share that, that will also be something that will have an impact as we look forward. We're not going to absorb all of those raw material costs just within BD. Chris, other comments on margins?"

We do expect margins to improve. I think we said that our margins would be 53% to 53.5%. That's up a full point from the Q3 margins. And that's coming from improved utilization combined with some of our continuous improvement efforts. We'll also have less onetime airfreight that we saw in the back half of '21, and we'll have some pricing actions as well. We do expect it to improve operating margins more than the normal 50 basis points relative to that 21% to 22%. And that again comes from utilization. As that improves next year, there's less impact from FX. We have seen FX flowing through our inventory. And so you'll see that abate going forward.
And then we see our continuous improvement items offsetting any continued flow-through of inflationary pricing. When we look at the impact on our raw materials, resins, as you know, is a big piece of that. Resins is a combination of some inflationary pressure, but it's also a function of other things, supply and demand in the oil market. And we took a big hit on that in '21. And we would expect that to abate somewhat, and that's something that we're watching very closely as we think about giving guidance in '22."

And we'll talk about what those specific programs are. Some are -- were short-term R&D life cycle management programs that we'll be hitting, but also include non-R&D initiatives such as reinvestments we made to establish new, for example, telesales organization in Europe. That's helping us access smaller hospitals that we weren't calling in before and we're getting new growth from.
Or expanding our non-acute sales channel in the U.S., we use some of those investments to accelerate investments there, tapping into a high-growth market as the non-acute space is now growing much faster than the acute care market, where we've had our traditional sales strength in. And so obviously, those commercial investments have near-term payoffs. And we expect actually the investments that we're making on the commercial side this year to be fully funding -- self-funding next year. So they're quick paybacks, and we'll see those benefits, as we've said, that strong mid-single-digit profile in our base business next year. On your other question, let me turn that over to Chris."

It's been probably, if I go back a decade plus since you last had operating margins as low as you're guiding for fourth quarter, and even to get to a floor of $12 versus where you are in that fourth quarter margin is pretty tough to do. So I was hoping you could really -- as best as you can walk through the building blocks of why the fourth quarter margin is so low, especially after you said last quarter it'd be in the low 20s for the back half of this year. It looks more like high teens. And then some of the building blocks you used to get to a floor of $12.

On the $12 floor, I think Chris walked through very clearly how we built up to the $12 floor there. And essentially, that takes out all COVID stand-alone COVID diagnostics. So all of that comes out. Any stand-alone COVID testing that we were to have would be incremental to the $12. And you know how much that is this year. Again, it's very difficult to predict what type of COVID testing is going to occur next year. And so we thought it's most prudent to focus on projecting our base business. We do have some Veritor flu sales and flu/COVID combination, which is really a next-generation flu test built-in, but much more aligned to what you would see in a normal flu season rather than increased demand from testing for COVID patients. And as I said, we have no COVID stand-alone revenue in. So that's how we've built in our $12 floor.
As Chris also mentioned, we don't have Alaris 510(k) assumed at all. We do believe that, just given inherent -- ability to predict FDA approval timing is not prudent to to try to peg when that would be. And so we do not have anything beyond Alaris revenues being flat year-on-year, which, as a reminder, we said it was a little over $100 million in FY '21. And so we have that flat going into '22, obviously. So that's that. 
Those are the main factors. Chris went through a number of others. We can circle back on any other questions you have there, but let's go back on your Q4 question. I'll turn it over to Chris."

And what I would remind you, Robbie, is that we have pointed to the fact that we're making investments this year and not to really look at the second half margins, we said they were going to be lower. We said not to use those as an indicative base to jump off for '22, which is what we're saying today.
The Q4 margins are pressured by an additional amount of COVID reinvestment, so we made that reinvestment announcement earlier. It takes a while. It tends to be back-end-loaded. So there's a preponderance of reinvestment there in the quarter. We continue to see some drag from FX in the quarter, although less than the third quarter. We also expect to see the impact of inflationary costs running through the -- through our inventory. And we see that coming through in the fourth quarter as well.
So when you sum all of that up, we talk about the baseline of 21.5% to 22% as the jumping off point. We said that it was more than our 50 basis point target going forward. And that -- how much more is where you have to plug it in to get to the $12 number that we gave as a floor.
And I think Tom articulated what that $12 floor was meant to be. It doesn't have any testing assumption for COVID in it, although we would assume some water level of stand-alone testing. It also assumes the testing for flu and COVID combination, which is equal to a normal flu season. That's still pretty early to call that, and that's something that we'll give more clarity on as we get into November. So it is just that, a baseline. We wanted to make sure people understood that we can grow more than normal off of '21 and get to at least that $12 level and to close out anything lower than that. And then we'll build from there as we give more specific guidance in November."

It's more around the China VOBP, Alaris and some FX impacts that on -- the combination of those bring you down in the area of about 150 basis points on a gross margin basis, for example.
If you take a step back, we're pulling all the levers that are necessary to drive that up. So the base business is doing well. That's a great foundation. We're reinvesting the Veritor proceeds that drive revenue growth going forward, but also to drive Recode and help there. We've got a balanced allocation strategy as far as buying back shares that will help on the bottom line. We're divesting nonstrategic businesses that will help with the growth profile going forward. So all of those things give us great confidence that we'll get back to those kind of margins in the near future as we take those steps. And we're headed in the right direction.
And the fundamental assumption of mid-single-digit growth on the top and double-digit TSR in the bottom implies a certain amount of leverage that we feel very comfortable with. We feel good with that operating model. It's intact. And that will drive margins up over time."

103678,1672579828,2364429,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Yes. This is Tom. I appreciate the question there. So I can give a little bit of color on what we're seeing overall, both in just general utilization, and then I'll talk about what we're seeing more recently in just the last 1 or 2 weeks. So as I think mo",478,"Yes. This is Tom. I appreciate the question there. So I can give a little bit of color on what we're seeing overall, both in just general utilization, and then I'll talk about what we're seeing more recently in just the last 1 or 2 weeks. So as I think most folks are aware, we have one of our informatics platforms is called MedMined, which is a software that allows us to see real-time admission data, utilization data, test data, outbreak data, resistance data, literally real-time at hundreds of hospitals across the U.S. And so some of the details that we see generally are, over Q3, we saw about 91% to 92% utilization versus pre COVID, about 92% exit in June. And that was a sequential improvement from Q2 average, which was in the 80s. And we expect to see further sequential improvement as we think about Q4 overall. In the non-acute sector, it was already -- we saw 105% utilization versus pre COVID in May, June and sequential improvements from Q2, which was in the 95% range. As we think about the impact of -- in Europe, by the way, the data we look at show the bed utilization versus pre-COVID utilization overall versus pre COVID was estimated around 92%, exited the quarter around 93%, which was sequentially up from Q2, which was about 86%.
So as we think about the impact of COVID delta variant in the last 1 or 2 weeks, we've seen it really -- as was expected, I think, when there would be outbreaks, that you'd start seeing them in concentrated geographic pockets. And that's certainly what you're seeing with the delta variant. The last number I had was there were 16 meaningful U.S. health care systems that had stopped or significantly reduced elective procedures. And many of those -- of the largest ones of those U.S. systems that have done that, that was as of last week, that was the number I had was 16. They were down in Florida, Louisiana. A number of those were in the South. So it's -- we're seeing it in those areas, but not -- certainly not across the country broadly, and we're not seeing really any significant change globally.
Certainly, there's pockets where that's happening. But for example, in Europe, which is a major market for us, we're not seeing a change there. We have built in some continuation of that back into our guidance. And so if it doesn't continue at that level, that could be an opportunity. But again, being prudent, as I think we've been all year long, we took an approach that said, look, if the delta were to continue and there were to be some impact on procedural volumes, we would be absorbing that within our guidance. It would have to be a significant change versus what's being seen there."

But as you said, we're excited about the tuck-ins we're doing. It's a combination of both strengthening our base business, like what you see in Velano, offering a really unique innovation into an already extremely strong portfolio and that we have, to areas that are entering us into new spaces like what you saw with Tepha or the ZebraSci, which both enters us into new spaces, but connects us deeply with an important customer segment, small biopharma, providing them services that ZebraSci is the leader in providing, the combination drug device testing services allows us to build those relationships further. And as you know, many of the new drugs coming into the pipelines are in that small biotech segment that we think is attractive to invest behind. Thanks for your question."

This morning, BD released its results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. You can find the press release along with the accompanying presentation on the Investor Relations website at investors.bd.com.
Leading this morning's call is Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; as well as Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer.
Following the prepared remarks, Tom and Chris will be joined for Q&A by our 3 segment presidents: Alberto Mas, President of the Medical segment; Simon Campion, President of Interventional segment; and Dave Hickey, President of the Life Sciences segment. 
During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements, and it is possible actual results could differ from our expectations. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause such differences can be found in our earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10 and subsequent Form 10-Qs. 
We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures regarding our performance. Reconciliations to GAAP measures that include the details of purchase accounting and other adjustments can be found in our earnings release and its related financial schedules. There are also in the appendix of the Investor Relations presentation slides available on the bd.com website.
Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis versus the relevant period. Revenue percent changes are on an FX-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. When we refer to the base revenues, we're referring to our total revenues less our COVID diagnostic testing revenues, which include COVID-related revenues from Veritor, BD MAX and swabs. When we refer to base margins, we are adjusting for estimated COVID diagnostic testing profitability and the related profit we have reinvested back into our business. When we refer to any given period referring to fiscal period, it must be noted as a calendar period.
Finally, when we refer to NewCo during today's call, we're referring to the planned spinout of our Diabetes Care business into an independently public traded company following the effective trade date of the spin, which was announced on the second quarter earnings call. RemainCo refers to BD post separation. As a reminder, this transaction is subject to market, regulatory and other conditions, including final approval by BD's Board of Directors and the effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement that will be filed with the SEC.

I'll then turn it over to Chris for the financial review and outlook. After our prepared remarks, Chris and I will then open the call up for Q&A.
But first, I want to comment on the other announcement we made this morning, regarding Chris' intention to retire from BD and join the Board of our Diabetes spin-off. On behalf of the Board of Directors, the leadership team and the company, I want to express my gratitude to Chris for his leadership and service to BD. I'm confident the CFO transition ahead will be seamless, and his leadership and experience will make him an excellent director for NewCo's Board.
Now let's jump into our results. We were very pleased with our third quarter performance, powered by strong growth and momentum in our base business across all 3 segments. Revenues totaled $4.9 billion, and our adjusted EPS was $2.74, both ahead of our expectations. Total revenues were up 26.9% on a reported basis and up 22% on a currency-neutral basis. Results included COVID diagnostic testing revenues of $300 million, which contributed 4.8% to growth. Excluding COVID testing revenues, our base business revenues were up 17.6%, better than we expected across most business units. The strong growth reflected the anniversary of the initial COVID wave and the temporary halting of elective procedures and its impact on medical device utilization in the year ago quarter. 
But Q3's result also reflects the continued momentum driven by the successful execution of our BD 2025 strategy. Excluding COVID diagnostic revenues, base business revenues in Q3 fiscal '21 increased 3.9% relative to our pre-pandemic third quarter fiscal 2019 on a currency-neutral basis, which includes the impact of the Alaris ship hold. If you exclude the U.S. infusion systems business, our total revenues would have increased 6.6% relative to our prepandemic third quarter fiscal 2019. 
Our Pharmaceutical Systems and Urology and Critical Care franchises continue to be standout performers, where revenues are up 17% and 11%, respectively, over 2019 levels. Bioscience revenues were up 9%. Surgery and Peripheral Intervention revenues are both up 8%. Elsewhere, we see opportunities for improvement ahead in fiscal '22 and beyond. For example, our MDS revenues are up about 2% versus 2019 levels, reflecting the continued impact of COVID as well as the impact of China volume-based purchasing. As hospital utilization improves, we should see further improvements here. Also, as I mentioned, Medication Management Solutions revenues are impacted by the Alaris ship hold, and we expect our revenues to improve once we receive our 510(k) clearance for our BD Alaris system.
While I'm pleased with how we are accelerating our revenue performance and profile, I'm equally pleased with the process we're making in improving our working capital and cash flows. Cash flow performance has been a key focus for us since I became CEO, and that is evident in our working capital metrics. Year-to-date, cash flows from operations totaled $3.7 billion, an increase of 80% from the prior year period. This improvement in our cash flows allowed us to advance our more balanced capital allocation strategy this quarter, which included the repurchase of $1 billion in BD stock at an average price of approximately $242. This marks the first time we have repurchased shares since 2017 and the largest amount we have repurchased since 2012. Even with this repurchase activity, we ended the third quarter with nearly $3.2 billion in cash and an adjusted net leverage ratio of 2.4x.
Overall, I'm really pleased with our performance in the quarter, particularly with the continued positive momentum in our base business. This gives us the confidence to raise our base revenue assumption. We now expect our base business to grow approximately 7.5% to 8% on an FX-neutral basis. This is higher than our previous expectation of mid-single-digit growth. We continue to expect COVID diagnostic testing revenues of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, with more revenues coming from international markets than we previously anticipated. 
We now expect currency-neutral revenue growth overall of approximately 14%. Our positive base business momentum and a lower tax rate allows us to raise our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 while continuing to reinvest in our business and overcome lower COVID testing profits, including a provision for excess and obsolete COVID testing inventory. We now expect our full year adjusted EPS range to be $12.85 to $12.95. Chris will provide you further details on our financial outlook later in the call.
Next, I want to provide an update on our BD Alaris pump remediation, which remains my #1 priority. Last week, we announced to our customers a positive step in our remediation efforts. Working with the FDA, we are now initiating remediation of existing Alaris system devices in the field by updating the software to version 12.1.2 following submission of the 510(k), which includes this software version. This new software version is intended to remediate the issues identified in the February 4, 2020, recall notice and provide programming, operational and cybersecurity updates to affected devices. However, the software update has not been reviewed or cleared by the FDA.
To address the question on Alaris clearance timing, we remain confident in our submission and the process we are undertaking, including working closely with the FDA. As Chris will later discuss, we believe it is responsible to not definitively predict the FDA clearance in our FY '22 outlook. We believe this is a prudent approach given the inherent difficulty in predicting FDA clearance time lines.
Next, I want to update you on our BD 2025 strategy of grow, simplify and empower. First, I'd like to focus on our growth pillar. We continue to strengthen our market leadership positions in our durable core business while purposely investing in new innovations that help accelerate and shape irreversible trends that we see transforming global health now and in the decade ahead. I've spoken about these 3 innovation and growth focuses before. And we've been purposely shifting more of our R&D and tuck-in M&A investments into these spaces, which are growing over 6%. 
Through this, we aim to lift our weighted average market growth rate and performance over time. And this year, we've launched several innovative products and solutions across the continuum of care, across our business units and across the globe. And after completing our strategic portfolio review last month, I can share with you that our pipeline is very deep and wide across our businesses. It's been further enhanced by our acquisitions over the past 18 months. And you'll hear much more about our innovation pipeline at our Investor Day on November 12.
But let me highlight a few of our organic innovations that we're advancing in the near term. In our Life Sciences business, I'm pleased that we will start shipping our BD MAX and BD Veritor combination flu COVID assays this month, in time for the upcoming respiratory season. Our BD Veritor combination test can detect and distinguish between COVID, flu A and flu B in a single rapid test with a digital readout. We see the combination test becoming the standard of care moving forward, advancing our strategy to enable better outcomes in nonacute settings.
Another innovation area I'd like to highlight is our Biosciences business. Biosciences has been a strong performer this year, and we expect the unit to deliver high single-digit growth for the full year. In June, we launched our new e-commerce site, bdbiosciences.com, which is an entirely new and innovative digital marketplace designed to provide a best-in-class online purchasing experience for our flow cytometry customers. Early feedback has been outstanding, and we're already seeing excellent traction and early adoption. 
We also have an exciting wave of new product introductions this summer, with the launch of our FACSymphony A5 SE, which is our first BD spectral analyzer, and provides an even higher cellular parameter analysis. We've launched our FACSymphony A1 as well, which offers high-end technology and a cost-effective bench top design.
In addition to these launches, we have a healthy innovation pipeline of modular, scalable new instruments and next-generation dyes that will allow our customers to fully leverage our complete and integrated solution suite of instruments, reagents, informatics, single-cell multiomics and scientific support services. Our products and solutions are being used to uncover new insights on the immune system and develop treatments for many related chronic diseases. You can hear more about our Life Sciences strategy from Dave Hickey, our Executive Vice President of BD Life Sciences; and Puneet Sarin, our Worldwide President of BD Biosciences, at the upcoming UBS Genomics 2.0 and MedTech Innovation Summit on Wednesday, August 11.
Next, let's turn to our inorganic innovations that we've added to our portfolio. As you know, we continue to be focused on tuck-in M&A as a means of adding innovative products and solutions that leverage our core market leadership positions and advance us into higher-growth adjacencies. Year-to-date, we've completed 7 tuck-in acquisitions. While at the same -- at the time of the acquisitions, these individual deals were not meaningful from a revenue perspective. As we integrate these transactions into our portfolio, we expect them to strengthen our growth profile.
Our 3 most recent transactions, Velano Vascular, Tepha, Inc. and ZebraSci are good examples of our M&A strategy. Let me begin with Velano Vascular, which is being added to our MDS business. Velano has an innovative needle-free technology that enables high-quality blood draws from existing peripheral IV catheter lines, eliminating the need for multiple needle sticks. This technology will help customers transform the patient experience through the vision of a 1-stick hospital stay. Velano's PIVO device will be integrated into our sales team's bag of broader catheter solutions initially in the U.S. This is a great example of how we're expanding and strengthening our base business.
The second transaction is Tepha, Inc., a leading manufacturer of a proprietary resorbable biopolymer technology. Over the past several years, through our long-standing relationship, we've been commercializing this platform via our Phasix resorbable hernia mesh platform. The acquisition benefits are twofold. First, it provides us with a vertical integration strategy for our current Phasix platform. But more importantly, it provides us with exciting new opportunities to expand our horizon into new high-growth areas of tissue repair, reconstruction and regeneration.
Lastly, we acquired ZebraSci, a pharmaceutical services company. This acquisition provides the opportunity to expand our Pharmaceutical Systems business beyond injectable device design and manufacturing to include best-in-class testing for drug device combination products. ZebraSci allows us to further engage and collaborate with biopharmaceutical companies and particularly smaller companies, where a large amount of the pipeline is, to support the transition of their molecules into prefilled combination devices.
Next, I want to update you on our Simplify initiatives, which are advancing well. Through Project Recode, we are optimizing our portfolio, optimizing our plant network and simplifying our business processes. Project Recode remains on track to achieve $300 million of cumulative savings by the end of FY '24. We are also continuing the rollout of our BD production system, which is a standardized BD approach to driving the next level of lean processes and continuous improvements across our plants. The BD production system is already helping to drive improvements in quality and reductions in our inventory days. We also continue to advance Inspire Quality, our quality, regulatory and risk mitigation program.
The last pillar of our BD 2025 strategy is empower, which represents the changes in our culture and capabilities that we're driving to empower our strategy. In Q3, we completed our Voice of Associates survey with over 86% participation. And what stood out was that our associates said we're making strong progress with improvements in 95% of the metrics since our last survey in 2018. And most notable were improvements in our focus areas of growth mindset, strong teams, quality and excitement about the future of BD. 
We're also advancing our 2030 sustainability strategy, which addresses a range of challenges in our industry while helping to make a difference on relevant issues that affect society and the planet. Our strategy will ensure we remain focused on shared value creation, meaning how we address unmet societal needs through business models and initiatives that also contribute to the commercial success of BD.
Next, I want to provide a brief update on the progress of our proposed diabetes spin-off, which remains on track for the first half of calendar 2022. We are making steady progress with our separation activities. We recently announced that 2 directors from BD's Board will be appointed as future directors of the Diabetes NewCo. Retired Lieutenant General David Melcher will serve as the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. And Dr. Claire Pomeroy will serve as a director. Their appointments will be effective upon the completion of the spin, at which point they will transition from the BD Board to the Board of NewCo. Lieutenant General Melcher brings extensive experience in spin-offs, having served as the CEO of Exelis following its spin-off from ITT. And under his leadership, Exelis spun off its mission systems business as a separate public company. 
Dr. Pomeroy brings broad experience in health care delivery, administration, medical research and public health. I'm confident their combined experience, along with future planned board members, will help to set NewCo well on its path to becoming a successful independent publicly traded company focused on growth.
While continuing to evaluate additional Board members, we are also continuing to build a new Diabetes Care leadership team through a combination of current BD leaders and new hires, including Dev Kurdikar, who will be NewCo's CEO; Jake Elguicze, who will be CFO, and most recently, Jeff Mann. Jeff Mann joined our Diabetes Care organization and will be General Counsel and Head of Corporate Development for NewCo. Jeff brings more than 2 decades of experience in M&A and transactions, securities law and corporate governance. Most recently, he served as General Counsel and Secretary of Cantel Medical group.
We are also progressing with the Form 10, which will have the carve-out financials, and we expect it to be publicly available around the end of the calendar year.
Before turning it over to Chris, I will leave you with some key thoughts. First, our base business momentum and our recovery from COVID continues, and it is broad-based. We expect that momentum to carry into fiscal '22 and beyond. As Chris will share with you, today's results underscore our confidence in strong mid-single-digit top line growth for our base business next year. Second, we are executing well against our innovation-driven growth strategy, which includes our internal R&D as well as advancing our tuck-in M&A strategy. And third, I'm proud of the substantial progress in advancing our BD 2025 strategy and how that will unleash our growth potential in the years to come. We'll deliver innovations for our customers, empower our associates and create value for you, our shareholders.
I've been with BD for 20 years, and I've never been more excited. We just completed our annual strategic review process, as I said, and the road ahead is looking more exciting than it did a year ago. We look forward to sharing our BD 2025 strategy in greater detail at our November 12 Investor Day. We hope you can join us.
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials and our outlook."

I'm also very pleased with our overall performance in the quarter, particularly with the base business, which showed continued strong momentum. Third quarter revenues of $4.9 billion increased 26.9% on a reported basis and 22% on a currency-neutral basis and were ahead of our expectations. Our current quarter results also include $300 million in COVID diagnostic testing revenues, compared to $98 million in the prior year period. Excluding COVID diagnostic revenues in both periods, our base business revenues increased 17.6%. Our base business reflects continued strong performance as the market continues to recover from the COVID pandemic, the impact from which was most acute in Q3 of last year.
The BD Medical segment revenues totaled $2.4 billion and were up 7.7% versus the prior year. MDS revenues increased 24%, reflecting a strong recovery in the U.S., led by strong growth in catheters and vascular care devices. Additionally, worldwide revenues included $18 million from COVID vaccination devices. In MMS, the double-digit increase in our dispensing revenues was more than offset by the expected declines in our infusion solutions. 
As you may recall, when the pandemic started, we saw a higher level of demand for infusion pumps and sets globally. Diabetes Care benefited from an easy comparison to the prior year, the timing of sales and slightly better-than-expected market demand. Pharm Systems continued to deliver strong growth with revenues up 12%, driven by demand for our prefilled devices. 
BD Life Sciences revenues totaled $1.4 billion and were up 43%. This included the $300 million in COVID diagnostic testing revenues, $212 million related to our BD Veritor system, with the remaining $88 million from BD MAX collection, transport and swabs. Year-to-date, COVID diagnostic testing revenues were over $1.6 billion. Despite lower average selling prices, driven in part by geographic mix, we are still on track to deliver on our target of total worldwide revenues of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion for the fiscal year. 
Excluding COVID diagnostic testing revenues, our Life Sciences segment grew revenues 27%, driven by strong performances in both Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences. IDS revenues increased 49%. Excluding COVID diagnostic testing, IDS revenues increased 27%, driven by strong double-digit performance across specimen management and microbiology. Biosciences increased 27%, driven by both research and clinical solutions. We continue to see strong demand for research reagents and instruments as lab activity is returning to normal levels. We also continue to see steady demand for research reagents globally, fueled by COVID research activities related to vaccines and variants, especially from academic research and biopharma companies.
BD Interventional sales totaled nearly $1.1 billion and were up nearly 35%, reflecting the COVID anniversary impact on elective procedures. Surgery revenues increased 68%, and Peripheral Intervention increased 32%. Both businesses saw the greatest recovery in the U.S. and Western Europe, which experienced the greatest impact on elective procedure volumes in the prior year quarter. We saw sequential improvement in both surgery and peripheral intervention. However, in the last several weeks, we are seeing some impact from the COVID delta variant on elective surgeries in certain U.S. states. Urology and Critical Care revenues were up approximately 14%, driven by continued growth in our PureWick and Targeted Temperature Management franchises.
Now turning to our P&L. As we expected and have communicated, our gross margins this year are being negatively impacted by COVID-related expenses, manufacturing variances and FX headwinds, which are more acute in the second half of the year. Also, as expected, our gross margin declined sequentially. Our gross margin was 51.5%. However, this included a net negative 90 basis point impact from COVID testing and reinvestments. The 90 basis point impact includes a negative 140 basis point impact from an inventory provision related to COVID testing. Adjusting for the net impact of COVID testing and reinvestments, our underlying base business gross margin was 52.4%. On a sequential basis, our base business gross margin declined from our second quarter rate of 53.7% due to 3 factors: 70 basis points of incremental FX headwinds; 40 basis points from inflationary pressures, including higher raw material costs and inbound freight as these costs roll through our inventory; and 20 basis points of other expenses, including Alaris quality remediation.
Now turning to SSG&A. Our total SSG&A spending increased 21% on a currency-neutral basis to $1.2 billion or 25.2% of revenues. As a reminder, in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we implemented several cost-containment measures in response to the COVID pandemic. In addition, we are continuing to see higher shipping costs. This quarter also included higher expenses related to our COVID profit reinvestment initiatives. As a reminder, the COVID testing reinvestments we made in FY '21 will not reoccur.
Our R&D spending totaled $321 million, an increase of 31.1% on a currency-neutral basis. The higher R&D reflects the timing of project spending, including a higher spending related to the BD Innovation and Growth Fund. Our R&D spending was 6.6% of revenues, which is higher than our long-term target of 6%.
On a currency-neutral basis, our operating income increased 26.5% as compared to our revenue growth of 22%. Our operating margin of 19.8% was slightly below our guidance of below 20%. The inventory provision related to COVID testing I referenced earlier negatively impacted operating margins by approximately 150 basis points.
Interest and other expenses were essentially flat year-over-year at $98 million. The adjusted tax rate was 5.8%, lower than we previously expected due to discrete tax items that occurred this quarter. The lower tax rate essentially offsets the impact from the COVID diagnostic inventory provision in the quarter.
The average diluted share count used to calculate our EPS in the quarter was 291.9 million. We repurchased a total of 4.1 million shares for a total of $1 billion at an average price of approximately $242. Our adjusted EPS increased 24.5% over the prior year to $2.74 on a reported basis and were up 25.9% on a currency-neutral basis.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the balance of the fiscal year. Our guidance continues to assume no major widespread hospital restrictions on elective procedures related to the COVID pandemic. However, we did start to see some impact on elective procedures from the COVID delta variant in the last 1 to 2 weeks in certain U.S. states and have assumed some continuation of this in our guidance. That said, given the continued positive momentum of the base business, we are pleased to be able to cover this and still raise our currency-neutral revenue growth to about 14%, up from our previous range of 10% to 12%. Our revised revenue range would incorporate a base business currency-neutral growth assumption of 7.5% to 8%. 
Further, we reaffirm our previously communicated COVID diagnostic test revenue range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. We now expect a favorable 250 to 300 basis point impact from currency. This brings our total reported revenue growth to approximately 16.5% to 17.5%. For the full year, we now expect our fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $12.85 to $12.95. This higher guidance reflects the positive base business momentum and a lower tax rate. These benefits allow us to continue to invest while offsetting the COVID testing inventory provision and lower COVID selling prices.
Next, I want to share with you our expectations for gross operating margins for full year fiscal '21 and provide you with an estimate of the net impact of COVID testing and the related reinvestments of profits on our margins. We expect our full year adjusted gross margins to be in the range of 53.5% to 54%, and this range includes a net neutral to slight positive impact from COVID testing reinvestments. We expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 23.5% to 24%. This range includes a 200 basis point contribution from the net impact of COVID testing and reinvestments.
Finally, I'd like to address FY '22. We plan to provide our specific fiscal 2022 guidance on our November earnings call, but we wanted to provide some directional color today. To give you a sense as to what a floor could look like in fiscal '22, we have taken the following approach: As you know, there is a great deal of uncertainty around the level of COVID testing. Therefore, we have not modeled any testing revenue beyond the typical flu season. With the continued momentum we are seeing, we have increased confidence in our ability to deliver strong mid-single-digit revenue growth in fiscal '22 over our fiscal '21 base revenues, which, as a reminder, adjusts for COVID diagnostic testing revenues.
With respect to Alaris, our filing is comprehensive and more complex than most submissions. As we have previously stated, it is possible that the review could be in line with past pump time lines. However, as we have also mentioned, it was more likely to take longer for the FDA to review and ultimately grant clearance. It is inherently difficult to predict clearance timing. We are not assuming Alaris 510(k) clearance. It is difficult to predict how things will play out as shipments are only being made under the medical necessity process. At this time, we have incorporated the assumption that revenues associated with Alaris will be approximately similar to FY '21. We believe it is prudent and responsible not to definitively predict FDA clearance time lines. That said, we remain confident in our submission and the process we are undertaking, including working closely with the FDA to obtain comprehensive 510(k) clearance.
We expect to drive base business gross and operating margin expansion. We expect the operating margins for our base business to expand more than our traditional annual target of at least 50 basis points and translate into double-digit operating income growth. For reference, we expect our base business operating margins to be between 21.5% to 22% in fiscal 2021. With these assumptions, we expect an adjusted EPS floor of at least $12. This represents approximately low teens growth over our expected base business earnings in fiscal 2021. 
Now before opening it up for Q&A, I want to take a moment to comment on today's announcement of my upcoming retirement. With our strong base business momentum, our strengthened balance sheet and improved cash flows, which is evident by the increased number of tuck-in acquisitions that we've been doing and the restart of our share buyback program for the first time since 2017, I feel that now is the right time for the transition as the company is well positioned to continue to drive shareholder value and impact the lives of patients around the world. I look forward to helping to ensure a seamless transition to the new CFO. And I'm very excited about the value-creating opportunities ahead for NewCo and helping to ensure this success as a member of their Board.
With that, let me turn it back to Tom."

We also have the drop in the China volume-based procurement is an impact. And obviously, we're seeing some pressure from inflation, et cetera, that have run through.

Walk through the delta about 70 bps seems to be inflationary costs, 70 bps FX, you do have this inventory charges related to COVID diagnostics and Alaris, 4 moving parts. I guess my question is, when do inflationary cost abate? Do we have to annualize -- is that mid of next year? Should FX still be a drag next year?

When it comes to just the inflationary question that you had, certainly, I think we felt the most significant impact of inflation already. And we have a good view of where that's going to be in '22 as we rolled up our costs. As you know, it's been an unprecedented period of time there as you look at everything from the cost of resins to electronic components and shipping. Shipping is up 4x to move products, let's say, from Asia or Europe to the U.S. or vice versa.
So we are also being very proactive in -- we're not looking to absorb all of those increases in raw material costs over time. We are beginning to pass on some of those. We've raised our shipping rates for customers, and we are passing on price increases. Of course, as you know, we do have long-term contracts and tenders around the world. And so that's not something that we can pass through those price increases immediately. But we do have a very active program to share those increases. We have to share those increases with customers. That will not happen, though, overnight. So I'll just share that, that will also be something that will have an impact as we look forward.

We do expect margins to improve. I think we said that our margins would be 53% to 53.5%. That's up a full point from the Q3 margins. And that's coming from improved utilization combined with some of our continuous improvement efforts. We'll also have less onetime airfreight that we saw in the back half of '21, and we'll have some pricing actions as well. We do expect it to improve operating margins more than the normal 50 basis points relative to that 21% to 22%. And that again comes from utilization. As that improves next year, there's less impact from FX. We have seen FX flowing through our inventory. And so you'll see that abate going forward.
And then we see our continuous improvement items offsetting any continued flow-through of inflationary pricing. When we look at the impact on our raw materials, resins, as you know, is a big piece of that. Resins is a combination of some inflationary pressure, but it's also a function of other things, supply and demand in the oil market. And we took a big hit on that in '21. And we would expect that to abate somewhat, and that's something that we're watching very closely as we think about giving guidance in '22."

And we'll talk about what those specific programs are. Some are -- were short-term R&D life cycle management programs that we'll be hitting, but also include non-R&D initiatives such as reinvestments we made to establish new, for example, telesales organization in Europe. That's helping us access smaller hospitals that we weren't calling in before and we're getting new growth from.
Or expanding our non-acute sales channel in the U.S., we use some of those investments to accelerate investments there, tapping into a high-growth market as the nonacute space is now growing much faster than the acute care market, where we've had our traditional sales strength in. And so obviously, those commercial investments have near-term payoffs. And we expect actually the investments that we're making on the commercial side this year to be fully funding -- self-funding next year. So they're quick paybacks, and we'll see those benefits, as we've said, that strong mid-single-digit profile in our base business next year.

It's been probably, if I go back a decade plus since you last had operating margins as low as you're guiding for fourth quarter. And even to get to a floor of $12 versus where you are in that fourth quarter margin is pretty tough to do. So I was hoping you could really -- as best as you can walk through the building blocks of why the fourth quarter margin is so low, especially after you said last quarter it'd be in the low 20s for the back half of this year. It looks more like high teens. And then some of the building blocks you used to get to a floor of $12. And on top of that, how you're thinking about what a floor means in relation to where numbers might settle at?"

On the $12 floor, I think Chris walked through very clearly how we built up to the $12 floor there. And essentially, that takes out all COVID -- stand-alone COVID diagnostics. So all of that comes out. Any stand-alone COVID testing that we were to have would be incremental to the $12. And you know how much that is this year. Again, it's very difficult to predict what type of COVID testing is going to occur next year. And so we thought it's most prudent to focus on projecting our base business. We do have some Veritor flu sales and flu/COVID combination, which is really a next-generation flu test built-in, but much more aligned to what you would see in a normal flu season rather than increased demand from testing for COVID patients. And as I said, we have no COVID stand-alone revenue in. So that's how we've built in our $12 floor.
As Chris also mentioned, we don't have Alaris 510(k) assumed at all. We do believe that, just given inherent ability to predict FDA approval timing is not prudent to to try to peg when that would be. And so we do not have anything beyond Alaris revenues being flat year-on-year, which, as a reminder, we said it was a little over $100 million in FY '21. And so we have that flat going into '22, obviously. So that's that. 
Those are the main factors. Chris went through a number of others. We can circle back on any other questions you have there, but let's go back on your Q4 question. I'll turn it over to Chris."
103678,1672579828,2364853,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Sure. Thanks, Tom.

And what I would remind you, Robbie, is that we have pointed to the fact that we're making investments this year and not to really look at the second half margins, we said they were going to be lower. We said not to use those as an indicative base to jump off for '22, which is what we're saying today.
The Q4 margins are pressured by an additional amount of COVID reinvestment, so we made that reinvestment announcement earlier. It takes a while. It tends to be back-end-loaded. So there's a preponderance of reinvestment there in the quarter. We continue to see some drag from FX in the quarter, although less than the third quarter. We also expect to see the impact of inflationary costs running through the -- through our inventory. And we see that coming through in the fourth quarter as well.
So when you sum all of that up, we talk about the baseline of 21.5% to 22% as the jumping off point. We said that it was more than our 50 basis point target going forward. And that -- how much more is where you have to plug it in to get to the $12 number that we gave as a floor.
And I think Tom articulated what that $12 floor was meant to be. It doesn't have any testing assumption for COVID in it, although we would assume some water level of stand-alone testing. It also assumes the testing for flu and COVID combination, which is equal to a normal flu season. That's still pretty early to call that, and that's something that we'll give more clarity on as we get into November. So it is just that, a baseline.

It's more around the China VoBP, Alaris and some FX impacts that on -- the combination of those bring you down in the area of about 150 basis points on a gross margin basis, for example.
If you take a step back, we're pulling all the levers that are necessary to drive that up. So the base business is doing well. That's a great foundation. We're reinvesting the Veritor proceeds that drive revenue growth going forward, but also to drive Recode and help there. We've got a balanced allocation strategy. You saw us buying back shares that will help on the bottom line. We're divesting nonstrategic businesses that will help with the growth profile going forward. So all of those things give us great confidence that we'll get back to those kind of margins in the near future as we take those steps. And we're headed in the right direction.
And the fundamental assumption of mid-single-digit growth on the top and double-digit TSR in the bottom implies a certain amount of leverage that we feel very comfortable with. We feel good with that operating model. It's intact. And that will drive margins up over time."

And that was a sequential improvement from Q2 average, which was in the 80s. And we expect to see further sequential improvement as we think about Q4 overall. In the nonacute sector, it was already -- we saw 105% utilization versus pre-COVID in May, June and sequential improvements from Q2, which was in the 95% range. As we think about the impact of -- in Europe, by the way, the data we look at show the bed utilization versus pre-COVID utilization overall versus pre-COVID was estimated around 92%, exited the quarter around 93%, which was sequentially up from Q2, which was about 86%.
So as we think about the impact of COVID delta variant in the last 1 or 2 weeks, we've seen it really -- as was expected, I think, when there would be outbreaks, that you'd start seeing them in concentrated geographic pockets. And that's certainly what you're seeing with the delta variant. The last number I had was there were 16 meaningful U.S. health care systems that had stopped or significantly reduced elective procedures. And many of those -- of the largest ones of those U.S. systems that have done that, that was as of last week, that was the number I had was 16. They were down in Florida, Louisiana. A lot number of those were in the South. 
So it's -- we're seeing it in those areas, but not -- certainly not across the country broadly, and we're not seeing really any significant change globally. Certainly, there's pockets where that's happening. But for example, in Europe, which is a major market for us, we're not seeing a change there. 
We have built in some continuation of that back into our guidance. And so if it doesn't continue at that level, that could be an opportunity. But again, being prudent, as I think we've been all year long, we took an approach that said, look, if the delta were to continue and there were to be some impact on procedural volumes, we would be absorbing that within our guidance. It would have to be a significant change versus what's being seen there."

But as you said, we're excited about the tuck-ins we're doing. It's a combination of both strengthening our base business, like what you see in Velano, offering a really unique innovation into an already extremely strong portfolio and that we have, to areas that are entering us into new spaces like what you saw with Tepha or the ZebraSci, which both enters us into new spaces, but connects us deeply with an important customer segment, small biopharma, providing them services that ZebraSci is the leader in providing, the combination drug device testing services allows us to build those relationships further. And as you know, many of the new drugs coming into the pipelines are in that small biotech segment that we think is attractive to invest behind. Thanks for your question."

Many of you already know Chris from his most recent role as Head of Investor Relations at J&J. We are thrilled to have Chris join the team. And while he's only been with us for 2 months, he's already immersing himself and making a very positive impact. I look forward to Chris sharing his perspective with you both today and at our Investor Day next week. 
I would also like to welcome Dr. Carrie Byington, who was recently appointed to the BD Board of Directors. Dr.  Byington is Executive Vice President and Head of University of California Health, where she leads the nation's largest academic health system. Dr. Byington brings deep and highly relevant experience to BD as we work to advance our BD 2025 strategy and accelerate innovation in smart connected care, enabling the transition to new care settings and improving chronic disease outcomes. 
On today's call, I will provide highlights of our performance and the continued progress we have made on our BD 2025 strategy. I'll then turn it over to Chris for the financial review and outlook for fiscal 2022. After our prepared remarks, Chris and I will open the call up for Q&A. 
Now let's jump into our results and key highlights for the year on Slide 7. We were very pleased with the strong close to fiscal 2021, which drove full year revenues, EPS and cash flows ahead of our expectations despite a volatile environment. This reflects our continued laser focus on execution and the strength and expansiveness of our diversified business and geographic model. Revenues grew over 15% to more than $20 billion in fiscal '21 with $2 billion in COVID testing revenues and strong 8.1% growth in our base business. Our adjusted EPS increased 28% to $13.08. And through continued execution of cash flow initiatives we instituted in fiscal '20, we further improved our operating cash flow by over $1.1 billion compared to the prior year. 
Overall performance reflects strong momentum in our base business with a return to more normalized growth rates across all 3 segments versus pre-pandemic revenue levels. As hospitals have been able to return to serving both COVID and non-COVID patients and the overall health care utilization levels increased, we saw strong demand for our broad portfolio of products that were essential to patient care including new products delivered across our innovation pipeline. At the same time, we are proud to have supported our customers and the patients they serve by bringing to market and scaling a broad range of innovations to help the world diagnose, treat and prevent COVID. 
Turning to Slide 8. At the highest level, our strategy has been deeply rooted in helping health care systems balance 4 key priorities, and those are improving outcomes, driving efficiencies, expanding access to care and, more important than ever, improving the clinician experience. BD is uniquely positioned to help our customers deliver against these 3 key priorities across discovery and diagnosis, medication delivery and interventional treatment. And through our innovation-driven growth strategy, we're investing in our broad foundational durable core portfolio while also shifting a larger portion of our business into higher growth, higher impact areas. And those 3 higher-growth, higher-impact areas that we're focused on, that you've heard me talk about before, are smart connected care, enabling the transition of treatment to new care settings and improving chronic disease outcomes. In addition, by simplifying our product portfolio, we're driving growth through increased efficiency and margin expansion. 
Turning to Slide 9. Importantly, we significantly advanced our strategy this past fiscal year, taking bold steps to position BD for the long term, beginning with the actions we took to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our working capital and cash flows. These actions have positioned our cash and net leverage well, giving us the capacity to increase investments in R&D and tuck-in M&A, accelerating our innovation pipeline and advancing our strategy to drive growth in fiscal '22 and beyond. 
In FY '21, we invested over $1.2 billion in R&D, 21% more than last year, with increased funding for key projects through our new Growth and Innovation Fund. We also continued our increased pace of tuck-in acquisitions, completing 7 acquisitions in fiscal '21 as well as a number of additional early-phase investments as we also began to build our long-term inorganic model. In addition, we reinvested over $200 million in profits from COVID testing to drive our growth strategy through investments in our commercial organization in R&D and accelerate our simplification strategy by investing to speed up our recode portfolio and architecture program. 
And today, these investments are meaningfully advancing our strategy to expand in higher growth spaces across smart connected care, new care settings and chronic disease outcomes. And just a few recent accomplishments that I can share here underscore our growing momentum. We're looking forward to sharing a lot more of those accomplishments next week at Analyst Day. These include new manufacturing lines that are now operational and will support demand for vaccination devices globally. And this investment is in addition to our $1.2 billion commitment to expand capacity for our prefillable syringe and advanced drug delivery systems, which represent high-growth opportunities in our durable core. Emergency use authorization for BD Veritor at Home, which is the first at-home COVID antigen test to use a smartphone to interpret and report results. This platform is a great example of how we're applying digital capabilities to bring new first-to-world innovations to market and expanding care to new settings. 
We also received 510(k) clearance of expanded indications for Rotarex Atherectomy System to include treatment of in-stent restenosis which is a first of its kind label expansion. And it's a great example of how we expand optionality for physicians and customers in the treatment of chronic disease. 
We also received U.S. FDA approval of our new high-throughput molecular system, BD COR. In today's challenging labor environment, BD COR's advanced robotics and software algorithms provide customers a way to do more testing with less available staff while providing important new clinical insights for cervical cancer screening and management through our BD Onclarity HPV Assay. 
Now beyond BD COR, as you know, we have a portfolio and pipeline of unique automated solutions that help our customers perform in a tight labor market, from helping nursing staff and pharmacists be more efficient with medication management to increasing efficiency and diagnostic testing for labs experiencing staffing shortages. We're engaging with customers in these markets and are seeing great interest in our solutions. 
At our Investor Day, we'll share more about how we are well positioned not only to capitalize on this opportunity but how we've been very actively optimizing our investment mix to both expand our durable core platforms and simultaneously add technology and platform innovation and higher-impact and higher-growth spaces that we expect to enhance our long-term growth profile. 
Through our disciplined capital allocation framework, we are balancing these investments in future growth with the return of capital to shareholders through our competitive dividend while also resuming our share repurchasing program, having repurchased $1.75 billion in fiscal '21. We also just announced our 50th consecutive year of dividend increases. And we're very proud to be 1 of only 16 companies across all industries to achieve that milestone. 
Turning to Slide 10. We will remain disciplined in our approach to portfolio management as we systematically advance and deliver against our strategy. And earlier this year, we announced the decision to spin off our Diabetes Care business. The proposed spin represents a value-creation opportunity for all stakeholders and is intended to enable growth acceleration for both BD RemainCo and NewCo with more efficient business processes and allocation of resources and capital. NewCo will be able to invest its capital in growth opportunities including high-growth geographies, markets and next-generation products. We continue to make good progress, and the spin-off remains on track for the first half of calendar 2022. 
Regarding our BD Alaris pump, we recently received CE Mark and Health Canada approval for the updated BD Alaris system. We also achieved a significant milestone earlier this year with the filing of our BD Alaris 510(k) submission. We have dedicated resources supporting this and continue to make progress. Alaris is an important tool for clinicians, and there continues to be strong demand for our platform during the pandemic. 
Turning to Slide 11. I'd like to share some details about our enhanced ESG strategy, Together We Advance. BD has been a long-standing leader as a case study for sustainable business models and innovating for shared value. Our strategy serves as a framework through which BD addresses the most relevant ESG issues for the company and its stakeholders and aims to further our leadership role and build on our commitment to improve and advance individual and public health at a global scale. The health of our company, our planet, our communities and the people we serve are directly connected. And when we successfully addressed the health of one, we often solve for challenges of another. 
And under our strategy, we announced a suite of goals for 2030 and beyond with commitments in 5 areas that are most important to BD and our stakeholders and where we have opportunities to create meaningful measured change over the next decade. And those specifically are climate change, product impacts, responsible supply chain, healthy workforce and communities and transparency. And we're acting on these commitments. And for example, we recently signed on to the United Nations Race for Zero campaign. We look forward to sharing more about the advances and impact we are having in each of these areas. 
Before I turn it over to Chris, as we look ahead, we expect the greater resiliency exhibited by health care systems during Delta will continue along with continued recovery in patient demand post delta. While there are inflationary pressures occurring across most every industry, we have been very active in addressing these challenges. We have put specific, defined, actionable plans in place to help mitigate these pressures, which are coordinated through an inflation task force that we've established with work streams across procurement, shipping, cost structure and continuous improvements in our plants. And in this environment, it's also required to initiate pricing actions, which we have begun. 
Looking ahead, while we believe there will be longer-term macro solutions like expanded shipping and resin capacity, we're not waiting for those to occur. Our aim is to be best-in-class in navigating the current environment, and we believe we have a clear path to accelerating margin recovery. We are proud of the progress we are making advancing our BD 2025 and ESG strategies. We have excellent momentum in our base business heading into fiscal '22, a stronger balance sheet and steadily increasing cash flows despite inflationary pressures, all positioning us well for the future. 
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials and outlook. And again, Chris, welcome."

Before I jump in, let me first say I couldn't be more excited about joining BD. BD is a purpose-driven company that is both a deep and broad portfolio that includes leadership positions in many important areas in health care. Combined with our innovative pipeline of products and solutions, we have a tremendous opportunity to shape the delivery of health care to make a meaningful impact on health care outcomes around the world. I look forward to engaging with the investment community next week during our Investor Day and sharing more specifics around our strategy and the actions we are taking to support our growth agenda and deliver long-term value. So with that, let's get into our results. 
Echoing Tom's comments, we delivered on our commitments in 2021, have strong momentum as we enter 2022, and we are well positioned for the future. Slide 13 summarizes our high-level revenue performance. Fourth quarter revenues of $5.1 billion increased 7.3% on a reported basis and 5.9% on an FX-neutral basis. And we're ahead of our expectations. Our base business revenues increased 9.8% driven by strong performance across all 3 segments. 
In Q4, we saw continued improvement in overall health care utilization levels and routine testing and lab activity and higher acuity. The breadth and diversification of the total BD portfolio, including COVID diagnostic testing, provides insulation against COVID-driven procedure fluctuations. 
For the full fiscal year, our revenues grew 15.6% or 8.1% excluding COVID testing, which demonstrates the strength of our business and the momentum of our strategy across our segments with base growth of 6.8% in the Medical segment, 8.4% in Life Sciences,and 10.7% in the Interventional segment. Base business growth was also strong regionally, particularly in the U.S., China and Latin America. Compared to fiscal '19, base business revenues grew 4.5% or about 7% when adjusting for the Alaris ship hold. 
Turning to Slide 14. Our Medical segment delivered $2.5 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter, growing 7.7%, led by our Medication Delivery Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems businesses. MDS revenues increased 11.3% and reflects strong demand for our core products driven by higher acuity and increased utilization in the U.S. and Europe and competitive gains in catheters and vascular care devices. 
In MMS, Q4 revenues were comparable to the prior year despite the high number of infusion pump placements in Europe last year to support hospital needs. We continue to see solid growth in our dispensing platform and a high number of committed contracts, with Q4 being one of our strongest quarters to date for committed contracts. 
Revenue growth of 5.4% in Diabetes Care benefited from the timing associated with certain sales and slightly better-than-expected market demand. On a normalized basis, we see diabetes growth about flat. 
Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 12.3% reflects continued strong growth driven by demand for our prefilled devices and enabled by capacity expansion. Demand for prefilled devices is being needed by the fast-paced vial-to-prefilled device conversion for biologics, vaccines and other injectable drugs. 
Turning to Slide 15. BD Life Sciences revenues totaled $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, increasing 1.5%. However, excluding COVID testing, Life Sciences grew 15.8%. Performance reflects strong double-digit growth in our base business in both Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences partially offset by a decline in COVID testing revenues. In IDS, 16.2% growth in the base business was driven by specimen management and microbiology as lab utilization improved and demand increased for both core products and products used during the care of COVID patients. We're also seeing strong growth in sales of BD MAX IVD assays, which were up about 20% year-over-year. IDS based revenues also included sales of our combination flu COVID assays for both Veritor and BD MAX that began shipping in Q4. Early demand is robust, and we believe the combination test will become the standard of care for symptomatic testing across laboratory and point-of-care testing as we enter the flu season. 
Despite increased demand driven by the Delta variant and shipping our highest quarterly volume of over 30 million tests, COVID testing revenues declined in Q4 from $452 million to $316 million due to lower pricing in the market. 
Biosciences revenues increased 14.6%, driven by Research Solutions as lab utilization is returning to normal levels. We continue to see solid demand for research reagents globally. Our recently launched e-commerce site is a new vehicle for growth and has been well received with strong traffic. 
Turning to Slide 16. BD Interventional revenues totaled nearly $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, growing 8.3%. As we previously communicated, we began to see an impact on the Delta variant on elective procedures in certain U.S. states in July and August. While we contemplated some continuation of that impact, it was slightly greater than anticipated in our Surgery and Peripheral Intervention businesses as hospitals reduced access and restricted elective procedures. 
Our Surgery business grew 16.8%, reflecting the year-over-year recovery in elective procedures with double-digit growth in infection prevention and biosurgery and strength in hernia despite some impacts from the Delta variant. Growth in infection prevention also reflects continued market adoption of our sterile ChloraPrep product. 
Revenues in Peripheral Intervention increased 5.5%. We saw a continued strong performance an atherectomy as we have leveraged the capabilities of our PI sales force and in oncology as more people completed cancer screenings. PI also continues to be impacted by a product recall which impacted growth by about 300 basis points. 
Urology and Critical Care revenues grew 3.8% driven by continued strong demand for PureWick as well as continued adoption of the recently launched Arctic Sun with our targeted temperature management platform. Partially offsetting this growth was a temporary supply disruption with an acute urology that is now remedied. We expect shipments to be caught up within the first quarter of FY '22. For the full fiscal year in 2021, UCC grew 7.6%. 
Turning to Slide 17 and our Q4 and full year adjusted P&L. For the quarter, we delivered adjusted net income and EPS above our expectations with net income of $770 million and diluted EPS of $2.59. On a currency-neutral basis, net income declined 7.8% primarily by lower COVID testing pricing and testing-related onetime costs and reinvestment in the business as well as higher shipping costs due to inflation and increased R&D levels. EPS declined slightly less or 6.5%, reflecting a lower share count due to share repurchases. 
Our full year adjusted net income and EPS were $3.9 billion and $13.08, respectively, with growth of 31% and 28% driven by strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion of over 100 basis points on an FX-neutral basis. We delivered Q4 and full year operating margins in line with the expectations we previously communicated for the company and for the base business. 
Turning to Slide 18. Cash flows from operations totaled $4.6 billion in fiscal '21, an increase of over 30% versus fiscal '20. This improvement in our cash flow has allowed us to advance our balanced capital allocation framework and support our BD 2025 growth strategy through investments in capital, R&D and M&A. During fiscal '21, we invested in capital expenditures to support high-growth opportunities including the new manufacturing lines Tom previously mentioned. In addition to investing in R&D at over 6% of sales to advance our pipeline of innovative programs, we also invested $500 million in tuck-in M&A across our businesses that will support our strong growth profile in 2022 and beyond. 
Beyond our investments in growth, we returned capital to shareholders through $1 billion in dividends and $1.7 billion in share repurchases. We ended the fiscal year with $2.3 billion in cash and an adjusted net leverage ratio of 2.6x. Our current cash and leverage position gives us flexibility to create value through multiple levers, and I look forward to sharing more with you about our capital allocation strategy during our upcoming Investor Day. 
Now turning to our fiscal '22 guidance on Slide 20. First, the macro assumptions that support our guidance range. While we recognize there will continue to be some variability, we assume there will be continued easing of COVID-19 restrictions as vaccination rates continue to increase and thus expect to see continued stabilization of procedures and are not assuming significant disruptions to procedure volumes. Additionally, while we do not expect conditions to return to normal levels, we do not anticipate worsening macro supply chain constraints or inflationary pressures. Finally, we have not assumed any impact of legislation changes that would impact the broader market. 
Given the significant sales and income generated from testing in fiscal '21, we previously provided a preliminary guidance floor that excluded testing. To help you model our underlying base business performance, we will continue to provide our revenue guidance split between base and COVID-only testing through this year along with context regarding testing margins relative to our base business. 
So a few specific comments on testing assumptions. Our base business revenue assumptions include sales of our combination flu COVID assays at a level comparable to a normal flu season, which you should think of as $75 million to $100 million. For COVID only testing, which is in addition to our base business, combo test revenues, we assume the demand would be significantly less in fiscal '22. Given the variability in the COVID environment driven by uncertainty around the length and intensity of outbreaks, our current assumptions are largely based on confirmed orders. We are assuming about $200 million of COVID-only testing revenue. If testing revenues were to be substantially higher, we first would compensate for any resulting procedure softness impacting our base revenue and income, which positions us well to manage through this period of uncertainty. Any further upside would be used to create value through either reinvestment or allowing incremental profits to flow through. 
Regarding Alaris, as Tom noted, we are confident in the progress we are making and the resources that we've invested behind this program. As we previously shared, infusion pump clearances are inherently complex particularly our filing, and thus, it would not be prudent to predict time lines. Consistent with what we shared previously, we do not expect and our guidance does not include a 510(k) clearance in fiscal 2022. Additionally, it is difficult to predict how things will play out as shipments are only being made under the medical necessity process. But at this time, we've assumed that our Alaris capital revenues will be generally in line with fiscal year 2021. 
Let me now share some perspective on what is underlying our base guidance. We are well positioned for strong growth across our 3 segments with a balanced and robust innovation pipeline resulting from investments in increased productivity in R&D. Growth will be further enabled by the strategic acquisitions we have added to our portfolio that are positioned in high-growth categories. While we aren't providing segment-specific guidance relative to total company base growth, we do expect our Medical segment growth to be slightly below, Life Sciences growth to be in line and Interventional to be slightly above total company based growth. 
In the Medical segment, we are continuing to extend our leadership position with competitive gains in significant categories such as peripheral catheters and prefilled devices while investing in solutions transforming health care through smart connected care and new care settings. 
Life Sciences holds leadership positions in attractive and growing categories and is investing in higher-growth spaces by enabling smart, automated laboratory workflows with solutions such as BD COR, improving chronic disease treatment with clinically differentiated assays, research tools and companion diagnostics, where we expect continued above-market growth in research reagents, and migrating point-of-care diagnostics to alternative care settings. 
Interventional is continuing its strategy of evolving from product to category leadership in chronic disease treatment while continuing to invest in accretive high-growth spaces. These investments include increased product offerings, both organic and inorganic, expanded labeling and investments in the non-acute care space. Our PureWick product line and acquisition of Straub Medical are good examples of how we are driving growth through our BDI strategy. 
Turning to Slide 21 and our guidance for fiscal '22. We expect base revenues to grow 5% to 6% on an FX-neutral basis compared to $18.3 billion in fiscal '21. For COVID-only testing, we are assuming $200 million in revenue. Based on current spot rates for illustrative purposes, currency would be a headwind of approximately 50 basis points or about $100 million to total company revenues. All-in base plus COVID-only testing and the illustrative currency, we expect reported revenues in the range of $19.3 billion to $19.5 billion in fiscal '22. We expect operating margins in our base business to improve approximately 200 basis points over fiscal '21 base operating margin of 21.7%. Due to the current COVID test pricing levels, we expect operating margin on COVID-only testing to be modestly above our base business margins. 
A few additional items for your models. We expect up to $50 million in improvement in interest/other given debt refinancing activities we completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21.  As you're aware, interest/other can fluctuate due to deferred compensation, which is offset in SG&A. We plan for an increasing effective tax rate of 12.5% to 13.5% given the discrete tax items in 2021 will not repeat. And in terms of share count, while our priority remains tuck-in M&A, we expect share repurchases to also be a consistent part of value creation. In addition to the year-over-year benefit from share repurchases completed in fiscal '21, where our ending shares outstanding were $288 million, our guidance assumes share repurchases that, at minimum, offset any dilution from share-based compensation. All in, we expect adjusted EPS to be between $12.30 and $12.50, with EPS excluding COVID-only testing being well above the $12 floor we provided in August on our third quarter earnings call. 
Turning to Slide 22. Regarding margins, let me first take a minute to reground everyone on where we are today. There are a few key considerations that have resulted in some margin pressure, some of which will be naturally restored and others that will be addressed by existing margin improvement programs with further improvements through new initiatives we are pursuing. 
Our total operating margin of 23.9% for the full year did improve versus 2020. In 2021, our total margin profile benefited by over 200 basis points from the COVID-19 testing margin net of investments we made to accelerate growth and other value-creating programs. So it's best to look at our base operating margins excluding COVID-19 testing of 21.7%, which also improved on an FX-neutral basis versus 2020. However, they do lag pre-pandemic levels as our base operating margin was primarily impacted by 4 key factors: the Alaris ship hold; negative COVID-19-related volume utilization; above normal inflation in COGS and shipping; along with currency headwinds. Each of these items negatively impacted margin by under 100 basis points and averaged about 80 basis points each. They collectively accounted for about 90% of the erosion from pre-pandemic levels. The remaining impact was small and driven by a few items, including a decision to strategically increase R&D investments to more competitive levels at about 6% of sales to support long-term growth. 
As I shared, we anticipate improving base operating margins by around 200 basis points in fiscal '22 driven by the following. First, like all companies, we experienced short-term impacts from COVID-19 such as underutilization in our plants. These impacts carried into fiscal '21 but will be more than fully restored in fiscal '22 given our strong base sales momentum and associated increased volumes and will drive about 100 basis points improvement in operating margin versus 2021. 
Second, given our global manufacturing and distribution footprint, we faced the impact of currency fluctuations in our P&L. Along with normal FX translation, the timing of inventory movements throughout our network can also impact our margins. Based on current spot rates and our inventory outlook, we expect to recapture about 50 basis points of the currency headwind to operating margin we reported in 2021. 
Lastly, we realized unprecedented inflationary pressures in fiscal '21, driven by increased RASM, inbound and outbound transportation and labor costs. These inflationary pressures will carry into fiscal '22, and we intend to be best-in-class in how we navigate this environment. We are expanding our existing simplification efforts such as Project Recode and intend to drive additional margin improvements through new spend optimization initiatives. These include actions across procurement and shipping such as reduced air freight and supplier cost control. 
In addition, we have actions in place to invest behind continuous improvement in our plants. And inevitably, in this environment, we know we need to offset these pressures through pricing actions which are already being implemented. We also are focused on leveraging our SG&A investments while maintaining competitive investments in R&D. 
In 2022, we are forecasting additional impact to operating margin from inflation above normal levels from 2021. However, with the significant progress we've made to date on margin initiatives that are already underway, we anticipate being able to more than mitigate the incremental inflationary pressures this year to drive an additional 50 basis points of operating margin improvement. 
Increased utilization, reversing FX pressure and initiatives to offset inflationary pressure will also play a key part in restoring our base gross margin to pre-pandemic levels. Combined, we expect these to drive around 100 basis points improvement. We are committed to delivering against these goals, and thus, margin improvement will be a key measurement for performance in this year's compensation plan across the company. Our fiscal '22 operating margin improvement will be a significant step towards recovery of pre-pandemic margin levels. We look forward to sharing more about our longer-term margin recovery initiatives next week at our Investor Day, which includes exceeding prepandemic levels in fiscal '24. 
Turning to Slide 23. Our fiscal '22 adjusted EPS guidance reflects the year-over-year decline in COVID-only testing profit net of reinvestment. In our base business, as we just discussed, we expect strong operational growth driven by revenue growth and margin improvement, with EPS well above the $12 floor provided on our August call. 
Now turning to Slide 24. Our fiscal '22 guidance also includes our Diabetes business. We continue to believe the spin-off is a significant value-creating opportunity for our shareholders. And both RemainCo and NewCo are well positioned for success. Let me take a moment to reinforce some key items that make this compelling to all stakeholders. 
NewCo will be one of the largest pure-play diabetes companies in existence today with an ability to focus on its strategic goals, drive strong cash flow and allocate its capital more efficiently and effectively to drive higher growth. The proposed spin enhances RemainCo's revenue and EPS growth profile as Diabetes Care's revenue growth is slower than the corporate average and its margins are declining. Carve-out financials will be available with the Form 10. 
RemainCo is expected to receive a cash distribution equivalent to multiple years of cash generated by the Diabetes Care unit. We plan to provide more details related to the proceeds and intended use at a later date. The spin is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. And as is normal course for spins, we plan to restate our financials after the spin's effective date to classify the Diabetes business as a discontinued operation. Given the higher margin profile of the Diabetes Care business, one should expect RemainCo's margins to be lower as a percent of sales after they are restated but with a higher rate of growth. We are establishing transition services agreement that will offset stranded costs. We remain excited for what's ahead for NewCo and making this a successful and value-creating opportunity for all. 
Now turning to Slide 25. Finally, I wanted to take a moment to share some phasing considerations for your models. First, we expect revenue growth to be normalized across the quarters with the exception of Q2, where we expect higher growth due to the easier comp resulting from the COVID resurgence in Q2 FY '21, primarily in Interventional. In addition, we expect COVID testing revenue to be weighted towards the first half of the year. 
Second, we expect gross margin to be lower in the first half given that increased inflation began earlier in fiscal '21 and the benefit of cost improvement initiatives we have initiated will be on a lag as they flow through inventory. We expect the inflation flow-through to inventory to be most prominent in Q2 and improve across the balance of the year. 
Third, as we move past COVID variability, we expect SSG&A and R&D expense dollars to be fairly ratable by quarter. Fourth, for full year -- for FY '22, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%. This rate includes assumptions around our jurisdictional mix of income and certain potential discrete items. Of course, the timing of realization of discrete items could result in variability in our rate quarter-to-quarter including a potentially lower Q1 rate. 
In summary, fiscal '21 was a year marked by significant strategic progress and execution against our key priorities. As we look forward and as reflected in our 2022 guidance, we are well positioned for growth with excellent momentum in our base business, increased investments in our innovation pipeline, tuck-in M&A momentum, strong progress executing our balance sheet and cash flow initiatives and clear visibility to meaningful margin improvement. We are excited to share our long-term outlook with you at our Investor Day. 
So let me now turn it back to Nadia to lead the Q&A part of the call."

And on the combo test, is that -- what sort of assumptions should we have on ASP for the combo test because I was curious on your pricing comment for COVID in fiscal Q4?"

So Alaris, as we said, we expect that to be essentially flat to '21. Think about that as about $100 million contribution in '22 and '21. Put in perspective, that's -- as Chris mentioned, that's about '20 was closer to $300 million. So even in our -- as we think about the 8.1% growth this past year, that absorbs about a point of Alaris coming down from the -- when we were getting very large numbers of additional medical necessity orders as people were adding to their fleets. So that's the assumption on Alaris. 
On vaccines, it's -- we still are towards the high end of that $100 million to $150 million range that we had expected for vaccination campaigns. And so we expect that's just kind of part of the MDS business now. I don't know if we're going to call that out as a guide in that growth, but we don't see it as a notable headwind in the growth rate of that business in '22. We still have solid demand for those products. And as we said, we now have visibility to 2 billion units of syringes specifically for COVID vaccines, which we're obviously proud of being able to help deliver 2 billion COVID vaccines around the world. And we -- I think we've shipped about 1.2 billion or 1.3 billion of those so far. So that gives you a little bit of color in terms of how much we're left to ship in '22. 
On the combo assay, great question. We've got Dave Hickey here, obviously, the President of our Life Sciences businesses. And so let me turn that question over to him."

So we do expect that to be the combo test. The installed base is out there to support that testing, and we've put into the range for next year an estimate of around 75 million to 100 million back into the base business. 
From a pricing perspective, we do expect it to be a premium price over the traditional test, as we'd indicated.  We're just not sharing specific pricing at this time."

In addition to that, I articulated on the call, even as it relates to actions we're taking and demonstrated at the end of '21 and heading into '22, we're increasing our initiatives, pricing, mix, portfolio optimization and new initiatives on spend optimization as well. And then certainly, lastly, the Alaris ship hold, that was an 80 basis point drag on the business going back to Ben.

My one -- I really only have one question or one topic I want to cover. And Chris, this is probably for you because it seems like a key part of this call is your assumptions on the improvement base business operating margins from 2021 to 2022. So a couple of things I'd love you to comment on, Chris, if okay. 
One is I'm struggling a little bit with how to think about the starting point because Q4 base business operating margins are obviously a lot lower than full year 2021. So maybe help me understand what's the right starting point. 
And then secondly, I'd love you to talk a little bit about how much of that 200 basis point improvement in base business you're assuming for the full year is gross margin and just what are your assumptions on pricing embedded in that. 
So it's a lot in there. That's my one question, but I would love you to address those things."
103678,1684279471,2424804,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Bob.

I understand your question as it relates to kind of",526,"Yes. Thanks, Bob. I appreciate the question. Great question. So look, I think going forward, we're going to continue to provide transparency as it relates to kind of the base performance of the business. I understand your question as it relates to kind of jump-off points as it relates to quarter. Keep in mind, there are a lot of quarterly fluctuations as we navigated 2020 through COVID and 2021 with inflationary dynamics. I think it's simplest to kind of normalize and just look at things on a full year basis. 
So as you think of our operating margins from 2021 of 21.7% on the base business, there's really a few key drivers. One is we had talked about through this about having our utilization levels impacted due to pandemic. Our strong growth profile through '21 and '22 we now anticipate being well above and driving almost 100 basis points of utilization upside '21 to '22 full year to full year. In addition to that, last year, we had the impact of currency. There was a headwind on earnings. They got trapped in inventory. And as that bleeds through, we actually have about a 50 basis point improvement heading from '21 to '22 that goes through to operating margin. 
Lastly, where we're investing a lot of our time, of course, is navigating the inflationary dynamics. And we talked about a net 50 basis point improvement in terms of outsized inflation, which we would anticipate being north of 200 basis points in full year '22. Offsetting that will be a series of initiatives. There's not one thing. It's actually a very well-balanced plan. We had talked about on the call, we're continuing to drive cost improvement in our plants. We're taking actions on the procurement side of the business as well in terms of spend. We're looking at things from an SSG&A standpoint as well and leveraging that. And then yes, there's going to be a strong focus on pricing, portfolio mix, driving growth through higher GP areas. And the net of all of those, we actually expect a 50 basis point improvement. 
Maybe lastly, just to give you some color on kind of where we are because I think this is important, we've entered the year with specific action plans against those goals. So we have risk-adjusted plans, very detailed targeted actions to deliver the improvement we need to mitigate against the inflation. If you go a step further where we are from kind of an execution standpoint, 80% to 90% of those have been fully identified and the plans are moving. And some of them are just more timing dynamics in terms of when we may take price or when we'll evolve our portfolio. And of that number, almost half of that is actually already banked coming in the year is flowing through our inventory and P&L now. That's quite a testament to the work that we did in the back half of '21 and already have strong progress. So we look forward to sharing more as the year progresses, but we feel good about the plan and the progress that we'll achieve through the year."

So it can be an acceleration from that.

So we'll try not to share too much of the thunder from next week, but it's a good question, and we'll get more into this. But we've spent so about $500 million this year if you look at the acquisitions that we made last year, think about over the last 20 months or so, we've invested about $900 million. That drives about $100 million this year and $200 million next year roughly from those tuck-in M&As. So if you do the math, that's about a little under 5x what we're paying in terms of revenue that we're getting from those acquisitions next year. And as you know that, that's good value that we're getting. And we're obviously performing above our cost of capital on those acquisitions. We're clearly at those levels of multiples that we're being able to get those assets for. We're not buying growth. We're absolutely growing what we buy, leveraging our channels, our global position, our manufacturing capabilities, et cetera, to scale these assets in ways that we're uniquely positioned to do so. 
We'll also share with you next week the mix of how those break out into the amount of spend and acquisitions that are going towards kind of that durable core base portfolio that we have versus those more transformative solution areas that I've talked about, those 3 categories that we discussed. And you'll see the weighting of those. They're highly weighted in high-growth markets. That revenue that I described is growing north of double digits as we go forward. 
We continue to see opportunities as we look ahead. We have a robust funnel. You can expect us to continue to drive that strategy forward. Obviously, it's been an important part of why we focus so heavily on cash flow. Actually, if you look at our cash flow over the last 2 years since '19, it's grown at 18% CAGR. That's not by accident. We've had very focused programs driving that. That's something we're very proud of, and it positions us, as Chris mentioned, to drive a balanced strategy between the tuck-in M&A strategy to drive our growth as well as continue to return value to shareholders, as you've seen us doing.

It is mixed across both innovation as well as accelerating our simplification strategy as well. And we'll share more details on that next week. But there -- it is balanced across both of those categories. And when we say the growth agenda, how it's balanced on that side, it is majority of the growth money that we're spending is in R&D, but there is money that we spent on expanding channels, so specifically telesales in Europe, non-acute sales channels in the U.S. And you'll hear more about those specific investments from our leaders in the U.S. region and from our European leaders next week as well.

How much below the operating -- the base operating margin of about 23.7% do you expect Q1 to be? Is 100 basis points the right way to think about it? And consensus is, I think, $2.84  for EPS right now. I'd love to get your reaction to that just to calibrate us correctly to start the year. 
And Tom, you guys are doing really well in China. There are a lot of investor concerns about multinational companies' ability to continue to grow there given the value-based purchasing and the recent document 551. How are you feeling about your ability to continue to grow strongly in China? And any reaction to some of those initiatives?"

Yes, I'll try to amplify some of the color that I provided earlier. So as we think of the year as the year progresses, first, from the top line, just to reiterate, we do actually expect relatively normalized growth with the exception of Q2, like I had shared, because of the comparables. And then there's a dynamic of COVID-only testing, which you'd expect to be more first half. So I would consider that dynamic. 
From a margin standpoint, certainly first half we anticipate to be lower. This is simply a matter of the inflationary dynamics that started in 2021 rolling through inventory. And the peak of when that rolls through and those costs actually hit is more like Q2. So kind of first half definitely less favorable margins versus the second half and Q2 in particular being kind of the high mark of that low, so to speak. 
And then obviously, as the initiatives that we've already taken, again, there's a lot of that bank, right? If you recall, I had shared, about 50% of it's already happening. But again, you get the dynamic of it flowing through inventory, so you end up with kind of a second half dynamic in the margin improvement throughout the back half. So the last item was just more the discretionary tax item I alluded to that could actually end up with some favorability in Q1, but those are very difficult to predict. So hopefully, that helps some."

And we think we're kind of back to a strong growth rate looking forward. 551 for us, we don't see specific impact in our categories. It's something that we've spent a lot of time talking about. Obviously, we have 4 plants in China. They're focused almost exclusively in China for China and particularly focused in some of the categories that there is more local competition in like catheters, vacutainer tubes, 10 needles, et cetera. But we make those businesses, those products mostly in China for China as well, so we can compete as a local organization in those. 
The other thing is we have a record number of new product launches coming out in China over the next 3 years. You'll hear from Simon and team in China. We're really pleased that we ended '21 having doubled the size of the Bard business in China since acquisition. That was a big focus of ours on revenue synergies. And there continues to be the impact of those registrations that we've been making over the last several years. The impact of those will be continuing to roll out with new launches. As we look forward, I know, again, Simon will talk next week. Maybe you could share a couple of comments now on some of the launches that you're having in China that are occurring.

I think a strong base growth profile that we guided on, coupled with, if you look at the cash flow that we shared through '21, it gives us a lot of flexibility on tuck-in M&A, right?

Tom earlier talked about the acceleration of deals that we've done recently.  Those alone can contribute about 40 basis points to growth. So one, I think there's just a very strong growth profile there. Two is just the disciplined focus on margin improvement. We knew that was something to focus on in addition to the cash management approach we've taken over time that's enhanced growth. 
And so those are the 2 main drivers. As a matter of fact, we're actually cycling over a headwind on tax. That's been offset by some of the capital deployment we've been able to put at work with share repurchases. So you'll see us be more disciplined there with other value-creating levers due to the strong cash flow that we have."

Before I get started, I would like to officially welcome Chris DelOrefice, BD's recently appointed Chief Financial Officer. Chris brings deep health care and med tech experience to BD across board operations and corporate finance. Many of you already know Chris from his most recent role as Head of Investor Relations at J&J. We are thrilled to have Chris join the team. And while he's only been with us for 2 months, he's already immersing himself and making a very positive impact. I look forward to Chris sharing his perspective with you both today and at our Investor Day next week.  
I would also like to welcome Dr. Carrie Byington, who was recently appointed to the BD Board of Directors. Dr.  Byington is Executive Vice President and Head of University of California Health, where she leads the nation's largest academic health system. Dr. Byington brings deep and highly relevant experience to BD as we work to advance our BD 2025 strategy and accelerate innovation in smart connected care, enabling the transition to new care settings and improving chronic disease outcomes.  
On today's call, I will provide highlights of our performance and the continued progress we have made on our BD 2025 strategy. I'll then turn it over to Chris for the financial review and outlook for fiscal 2022. After our prepared remarks, Chris and I will open the call up for Q&A. 
Now let's jump into our results and key highlights for the year on Slide 7. We were very pleased with the strong close to fiscal 2021, which drove full year revenues, EPS and cash flows ahead of our expectations despite a volatile environment. This reflects our continued laser focus on execution and the strength and expansiveness of our diversified business and geographic model. Revenues grew over 15% to more than $20 billion in fiscal '21 with $2 billion in COVID testing revenues and strong 8.1% growth in our base business. Our adjusted EPS increased 28% to $13.08. And through continued execution of cash flow initiatives we instituted in fiscal '20, we further improved our operating cash flow by over $1.1 billion compared to the prior year.  
Overall performance reflects strong momentum in our base business with a return to more normalized growth rates across all 3 segments versus pre-pandemic revenue levels. As hospitals have been able to return to serving both COVID and non-COVID patients and the overall health care utilization levels increased, we saw strong demand for our broad portfolio of products that were essential to patient care, including new products delivered across our innovation pipeline. At the same time, we are proud to have supported our customers and the patients they serve by bringing to market and scaling a broad range of innovations to help the world diagnose, treat and prevent COVID.  
Turning to Slide 8. At the highest level, our strategy has been deeply rooted in helping health care systems balance 4 key priorities, and those are improving outcomes, driving efficiencies, expanding access to care and, more important than ever, improving the clinician experience. BD is uniquely positioned to help our customers deliver against these 3 key priorities across discovery and diagnosis, medication delivery and interventional treatment. And through our innovation-driven growth strategy, we're investing in our broad foundational durable core portfolio while also shifting a larger portion of our business into higher growth, higher impact areas. And those 3 higher-growth, higher-impact areas that we're focused on, that you've heard me talk about before, are smart connected care, enabling the transition of treatment to new care settings and improving chronic disease outcomes. In addition, by simplifying our product portfolio, we're driving growth through increased efficiency and margin expansion.  
Turning to Slide 9. Importantly, we significantly advanced our strategy this past fiscal year, taking bold steps to position BD for the long term, beginning with the actions we took to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our working capital and cash flows. These actions have positioned our cash and net leverage well, giving us the capacity to increase investments in R&D and tuck-in M&A, accelerating our innovation pipeline and advancing our strategy to drive growth in fiscal '22 and beyond.  
In FY '21, we invested over $1.2 billion in R&D, 21% more than last year, with increased funding for key projects through our new Growth and Innovation Fund. We also continued our increased pace of tuck-in acquisitions, completing 7 acquisitions in fiscal '21 as well as a number of additional early-phase investments as we also began to build our long-term inorganic model. In addition, we reinvested over $200 million in profits from COVID testing to drive our growth strategy through investments in our commercial organization in R&D and accelerate our simplification strategy by investing to speed up our recode portfolio and architecture program.  
And today, these investments are meaningfully advancing our strategy to expand in higher growth spaces across smart connected care, new care settings and chronic disease outcomes. And just a few recent accomplishments that I can share here underscore our growing momentum. We're looking forward to sharing a lot more of those accomplishments next week at Analyst Day. These include new manufacturing lines that are now operational and will support demand for vaccination devices globally. And this investment is in addition to our $1.2 billion commitment to expand capacity for our prefillable syringe and advanced drug delivery systems, which represent high-growth opportunities in our durable core. Emergency use authorization for BD Veritor at Home, which is the first at-home COVID antigen test to use a smartphone to interpret and report results. This platform is a great example of how we're applying digital capabilities to bring new first-to-world innovations to market and expanding care to new settings.  
We also received 510(k) clearance of expanded indications for Rotarex Atherectomy System to include treatment of in-stent restenosis which is a first of its kind label expansion. And it's a great example of how we expand optionality for physicians and customers in the treatment of chronic disease.  
We also received U.S. FDA approval of our new high-throughput molecular system, BD COR. In today's challenging labor environment, BD COR's advanced robotics and software algorithms provide customers a way to do more testing with less available staff while providing important new clinical insights for cervical cancer screening and management through our BD Onclarity HPV Assay.  
Now beyond BD COR, as you know, we have a portfolio and pipeline of unique automated solutions that help our customers perform in a tight labor market, from helping nursing staff and pharmacists be more efficient with medication management to increasing efficiency and diagnostic testing for labs experiencing staffing shortages. We're engaging with customers in these markets and are seeing great interest in our solutions.  
At our Investor Day, we'll share more about how we are well positioned not only to capitalize on this opportunity but how we've been very actively optimizing our investment mix to both expand our durable core platforms and simultaneously add technology and platform innovation and higher-impact and higher-growth spaces that we expect to enhance our long-term growth profile.  
Through our disciplined capital allocation framework, we are balancing these investments in future growth with the return of capital to shareholders through our competitive dividend while also resuming our share repurchasing program, having repurchased $1.75 billion in fiscal '21. We also just announced our 50th consecutive year of dividend increases. And we're very proud to be 1 of only 16 companies across all industries to achieve that milestone.  
Turning to Slide 10. We will remain disciplined in our approach to portfolio management as we systematically advance and deliver against our strategy. And earlier this year, we announced the decision to spin off our Diabetes Care business. The proposed spin represents a value-creation opportunity for all stakeholders and is intended to enable growth acceleration for both BD RemainCo and NewCo with more efficient business processes and allocation of resources and capital. NewCo will be able to invest its capital in growth opportunities including high-growth geographies, markets and next-generation products. We continue to make good progress, and the spin-off remains on track for the first half of calendar 2022.  
Regarding our BD Alaris pump, we recently received CE Mark and Health Canada approval for the updated BD Alaris system. We also achieved a significant milestone earlier this year with the filing of our BD Alaris 510(k) submission. We have dedicated resources supporting this and continue to make progress. Alaris is an important tool for clinicians, and there continues to be strong demand for our platform during the pandemic.  
Turning to Slide 11. I'd like to share some details about our enhanced ESG strategy, Together We Advance. BD has been a long-standing leader as a case study for sustainable business models and innovating for shared value. Our strategy serves as a framework through which BD addresses the most relevant ESG issues for the company and its stakeholders and aims to further our leadership role and build on our commitment to improve and advance individual and public health at a global scale. The health of our company, our planet, our communities and the people we serve are directly connected. And when we successfully addressed the health of one, we often solve for challenges of another.  
And under our strategy, we announced a suite of goals for 2030 and beyond with commitments in 5 areas that are most important to BD and our stakeholders and where we have opportunities to create meaningful measured change over the next decade. And those specifically are climate change, product impacts, responsible supply chain, healthy workforce and communities and transparency. And we're acting on these commitments. And for example, we recently signed on to the United Nations Race for Zero campaign. We look forward to sharing more about the advances and impact we are having in each of these areas.  
Before I turn it over to Chris, as we look ahead, we expect the greater resiliency exhibited by health care systems during Delta will continue along with continued recovery in patient demand post delta. While there are inflationary pressures occurring across most every industry, we have been very active in addressing these challenges. We have put specific, defined, actionable plans in place to help mitigate these pressures, which are coordinated through an inflation task force that we've established with work streams across procurement, shipping, cost structure and continuous improvements in our plants. And in this environment, it's also required to initiate pricing actions, which we have begun.  
Looking ahead, while we believe there will be longer-term macro solutions like expanded shipping and resin capacity, we're not waiting for those to occur. Our aim is to be best-in-class in navigating the current environment, and we believe we have a clear path to accelerating margin recovery. We are proud of the progress we are making advancing our BD 2025 and ESG strategies. We have excellent momentum in our base business heading into fiscal '22, a stronger balance sheet and steadily increasing cash flows despite inflationary pressures, all positioning us well for the future.  
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials and outlook. And again, Chris, welcome."

Before I jump in, let me first say I couldn't be more excited about joining BD. BD is a purpose-driven company that is both a deep and broad portfolio that includes leadership positions in many important areas in health care. Combined with our innovative pipeline of products and solutions, we have a tremendous opportunity to shape the delivery of health care to make a meaningful impact on health care outcomes around the world. I look forward to engaging with the investment community next week during our Investor Day and sharing more specifics around our strategy and the actions we are taking to support our growth agenda and deliver long-term value. So with that, let's get into our results.  
Echoing Tom's comments, we delivered on our commitments in 2021, have strong momentum as we enter 2022, and we are well positioned for the future. Slide 13 summarizes our high-level revenue performance. Fourth quarter revenues of $5.1 billion increased 7.3% on a reported basis and 5.9% on an FX-neutral basis. And we're ahead of our expectations. Our base business revenues increased 9.8% driven by strong performance across all 3 segments.  
In Q4, we saw continued improvement in overall health care utilization levels and routine testing and lab activity and higher acuity. The breadth and diversification of the total BD portfolio, including COVID diagnostic testing, provides insulation against COVID-driven procedure fluctuations.  
For the full fiscal year, our revenues grew 15.6% or 8.1% excluding COVID testing, which demonstrates the strength of our business and the momentum of our strategy across our segments with base growth of 6.8% in the Medical segment, 8.4% in Life Sciences,and 10.7% in the Interventional segment. Base business growth was also strong regionally, particularly in the U.S., China and Latin America. Compared to fiscal '19, base business revenues grew 4.5% or about 7% when adjusting for the Alaris ship hold.  
Turning to Slide 14. Our Medical segment delivered $2.5 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter, growing 7.7%, led by our Medication Delivery Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems businesses. MDS revenues increased 11.3% and reflects strong demand for our core products driven by higher acuity and increased utilization in the U.S. and Europe and competitive gains in catheters and vascular care devices.  
In MMS, Q4 revenues were comparable to the prior year despite the high number of infusion pump placements in Europe last year to support hospital needs. We continue to see solid growth in our dispensing platform and a high number of committed contracts, with Q4 being one of our strongest quarters to date for committed contracts.  
Revenue growth of 5.4% in Diabetes Care benefited from the timing associated with certain sales and slightly better-than-expected market demand. On a normalized basis, we see diabetes growth about flat.  
Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 12.3% reflects continued strong growth driven by demand for our prefilled devices and enabled by capacity expansion. Demand for prefilled devices is being aided by the fast-paced vial-to-prefilled device conversion for biologics, vaccines and other injectable drugs.  
Turning to Slide 15. BD Life Sciences revenues totaled $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, increasing 1.5%. However, excluding COVID testing, Life Sciences grew 15.8%. Performance reflects strong double-digit growth in our base business in both Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences partially offset by a decline in COVID testing revenues. In IDS, 16.2% growth in the base business was driven by specimen management and microbiology as lab utilization improved and demand increased for both core products and products used during the care of COVID patients. We're also seeing strong growth in sales of BD MAX IVD assays, which were up about 20% year-over-year. IDS based revenues also included sales of our combination flu COVID assays for both Veritor and BD MAX that began shipping in Q4. Early demand is robust, and we believe the combination test will become the standard of care for symptomatic testing across laboratory and point-of-care testing as we enter the flu season.  
Despite increased demand driven by the Delta variant and shipping our highest quarterly volume of over 30 million tests, COVID testing revenues declined in Q4 from $452 million to $316 million due to lower pricing in the market.  
Biosciences revenues increased 14.6%, driven by Research Solutions as lab utilization is returning to normal levels. We continue to see solid demand for research reagents globally. Our recently launched e-commerce site is a new vehicle for growth and has been well received with strong traffic.  
Turning to Slide 16. BD Interventional revenues totaled nearly $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, growing 8.3%. As we previously communicated, we began to see an impact on the Delta variant on elective procedures in certain U.S. states in July and August. While we contemplated some continuation of that impact, it was slightly greater than anticipated in our Surgery and Peripheral Intervention businesses as hospitals reduced access and restricted elective procedures.  
Our Surgery business grew 16.8%, reflecting the year-over-year recovery in elective procedures with double-digit growth in infection prevention and biosurgery and strength in hernia despite some impacts from the Delta variant. Growth in infection prevention also reflects continued market adoption of our sterile ChloraPrep product.  
Revenues in Peripheral Intervention increased 5.5%. We saw a continued strong performance an atherectomy as we have leveraged the capabilities of our PI sales force and in oncology as more people completed cancer screenings. PI also continues to be impacted by a product recall which impacted growth by about 300 basis points.  
Urology and Critical Care revenues grew 3.8% driven by continued strong demand for PureWick as well as continued adoption of the recently launched Arctic Sun with our targeted temperature management platform. Partially offsetting this growth was a temporary supply disruption with an acute urology that is now remedied. We expect shipments to be caught up within the first quarter of FY '22. For the full fiscal year in 2021, UCC grew 7.6%.  
Turning to Slide 17 and our Q4 and full year adjusted P&L. For the quarter, we delivered adjusted net income and EPS above our expectations with net income of $770 million and diluted EPS of $2.59. On a currency-neutral basis, net income declined 7.8% primarily by lower COVID testing pricing and testing-related onetime costs and reinvestment in the business as well as higher shipping costs due to inflation and increased R&D levels.  
EPS declined slightly less or 6.5%, reflecting a lower share count due to share repurchases. Our full year adjusted net income and EPS were $3.9 billion and $13.08, respectively, with growth of 31% and 28% driven by strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion of over 100 basis points on an FX-neutral basis. We delivered Q4 and full year operating margins in line with the expectations we previously communicated for the company and for the base business.  
Turning to Slide 18. Cash flows from operations totaled $4.6 billion in fiscal '21, an increase of over 30% versus fiscal '20. This improvement in our cash flow has allowed us to advance our balanced capital allocation framework and support our BD 2025 growth strategy through investments in capital, R&D and M&A. During fiscal '21, we invested in capital expenditures to support high-growth opportunities including the new manufacturing lines Tom previously mentioned. In addition to investing in R&D at over 6% of sales to advance our pipeline of innovative programs, we also invested $500 million in tuck-in M&A across our businesses that will support our strong growth profile in 2022 and beyond.  
Beyond our investments in growth, we returned capital to shareholders through $1 billion in dividends and $1.7 billion in share repurchases. We ended the fiscal year with $2.3 billion in cash and an adjusted net leverage ratio of 2.6x. Our current cash and leverage position gives us flexibility to create value through multiple levers, and I look forward to sharing more with you about our capital allocation strategy during our upcoming Investor Day.  
Now turning to our fiscal '22 guidance on Slide 20. First, the macro assumptions that support our guidance range. While we recognize there will continue to be some variability, we assume there will be continued easing of COVID-19 restrictions as vaccination rates continue to increase and thus expect to see continued stabilization of procedures and are not assuming significant disruptions to procedure volumes. Additionally, while we do not expect conditions to return to normal levels, we do not anticipate worsening macro supply chain constraints or inflationary pressures. Finally, we have not assumed any impact of legislation changes that would impact the broader market.  
Given the significant sales and income generated from testing in fiscal '21, we previously provided a preliminary guidance floor that excluded testing. To help you model our underlying base business performance, we will continue to provide our revenue guidance split between base and COVID-only testing through this year along with context regarding testing margins relative to our base business.  
So a few specific comments on testing assumptions. Our base business revenue assumptions include sales of our combination flu COVID assays at a level comparable to a normal flu season, which you should think of as $75 million to $100 million. For COVID only testing, which is in addition to our base business, combo test revenues, we assume the demand would be significantly less in fiscal '22. Given the variability in the COVID environment driven by uncertainty around the length and intensity of outbreaks, our current assumptions are largely based on confirmed orders. We are assuming about $200 million of COVID-only testing revenue. If testing revenues were to be substantially higher, we first would compensate for any resulting procedure softness impacting our base revenue and income, which positions us well to manage through this period of uncertainty. Any further upside would be used to create value through either reinvestment or allowing incremental profits to flow through.  
Regarding Alaris, as Tom noted, we are confident in the progress we are making and the resources that we've invested behind this program. As we previously shared, infusion pump clearances are inherently complex particularly our filing, and thus, it would not be prudent to predict time lines. Consistent with what we shared previously, we do not expect and our guidance does not include a 510(k) clearance in fiscal 2022. Additionally, it is difficult to predict how things will play out as shipments are only being made under the medical necessity process. But at this time, we've assumed that our Alaris capital revenues will be generally in line with fiscal year 2021.  
Let me now share some perspective on what is underlying our base guidance. We are well positioned for strong growth across our 3 segments with a balanced and robust innovation pipeline resulting from investments in increased productivity in R&D. Growth will be further enabled by the strategic acquisitions we have added to our portfolio that are positioned in high-growth categories. While we aren't providing segment-specific guidance relative to total company base growth, we do expect our Medical segment growth to be slightly below, Life Sciences growth to be in line and Interventional to be slightly above total company based growth.  
In the Medical segment, we are continuing to extend our leadership position with competitive gains in significant categories such as peripheral catheters and prefilled devices while investing in solutions transforming health care through smart connected care and new care settings.  
Life Sciences holds leadership positions in attractive and growing categories and is investing in higher-growth spaces by enabling smart, automated laboratory workflows with solutions such as BD COR. Improving chronic disease treatment with clinically differentiated assays, research tools and companion diagnostics, where we expect continued above-market growth in research reagents, and migrating point-of-care diagnostics to alternative care settings.  
Interventional is continuing its strategy of evolving from product to category leadership in chronic disease treatment while continuing to invest in accretive high-growth spaces. These investments include increased product offerings, both organic and inorganic, expanded labeling and investments in the non-acute care space. Our PureWick product line and acquisition of Straub Medical are good examples of how we are driving growth through our BDI strategy.  
Turning to Slide 21 and our guidance for fiscal '22. We expect base revenues to grow 5% to 6% on an FX-neutral basis compared to $18.3 billion in fiscal '21. For COVID-only testing, we are assuming $200 million in revenue. Based on current spot rates for illustrative purposes, currency would be a headwind of approximately 50 basis points or about $100 million to total company revenues. All-in base plus COVID-only testing and the illustrative currency, we expect reported revenues in the range of $19.3 billion to $19.5 billion in fiscal '22. We expect operating margins in our base business to improve approximately 200 basis points over fiscal '21 base operating margin of 21.7%. Due to the current COVID test pricing levels, we expect operating margin on COVID-only testing to be modestly above our base business margins.  
A few additional items for your models. We expect up to $50 million in improvement in interest/other given debt refinancing activities we completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21.  As you're aware, interest/other can fluctuate due to deferred compensation, which is offset in SSG&A. We plan for an increasing effective tax rate of 12.5% to 13.5% given the discrete tax items in 2021 will not repeat. And in terms of share count, while our priority remains tuck-in M&A, we expect share repurchases to also be a consistent part of value creation. In addition to the year-over-year benefit from share repurchases completed in fiscal '21, where our ending shares outstanding were 288 million, our guidance assumes share repurchases that, at minimum, offset any dilution from share-based compensation. All in, we expect adjusted EPS to be between $12.30 and $12.50, with EPS excluding COVID-only testing being well above the $12 floor we provided in August on our third quarter earnings call.  
Turning to Slide 22. Regarding margins, let me first take a minute to reground everyone on where we are today. There are a few key considerations that have resulted in some margin pressure, some of which will be naturally restored and others that will be addressed by existing margin improvement programs with further improvements through new initiatives we are pursuing. Our total operating margin of 23.9% for the full year did improve versus 2020. In 2021, our total margin profile benefited by over 200 basis points from the COVID-19 testing margin net of investments we made to accelerate growth and other value-creating programs. So it's best to look at our base operating margins excluding COVID-19 testing of 21.7%, which also improved on an FX-neutral basis versus 2020. However, they do lag pre-pandemic levels as our base operating margin was primarily impacted by 4 key factors: the Alaris ship hold; negative COVID-19-related volume utilization; above normal inflation in COGS and shipping; along with currency headwinds. Each of these items negatively impacted margin by under 100 basis points and averaged about 80 basis points each. They collectively accounted for about 90% of the erosion from pre-pandemic levels. The remaining impact was small and driven by a few items, including a decision to strategically increase R&D investments to more competitive levels at about 6% of sales to support long-term growth.  
As I shared, we anticipate improving base operating margins by around 200 basis points in fiscal '22 driven by the following. First, like all companies, we experienced short-term impacts from COVID-19 such as underutilization in our plants. These impacts carried into fiscal '21 but will be more than fully restored in fiscal '22 given our strong base sales momentum and associated increased volumes and will drive about 100 basis points improvement in operating margin versus 2021. Second, given our global manufacturing and distribution footprint, we faced the impact of currency fluctuations in our P&L. Along with normal FX translation, the timing of inventory movements throughout our network can also impact our margins. Based on current spot rates and our inventory outlook, we expect to recapture about 50 basis points of the currency headwind to operating margin we reported in 2021.  
Lastly, we realized unprecedented inflationary pressures in fiscal '21, driven by increased pricing                                                                    , inbound and outbound transportation and labor costs. These inflationary pressures will carry into fiscal '22, and we intend to be best-in-class in how we navigate this environment. We are expanding our existing simplification efforts such as Project Recode and intend to drive additional margin improvements through new spend optimization initiatives. These include actions across procurement and shipping such as reduced air freight and supplier cost control. 
In addition, we have actions in place to invest behind continuous improvement in our plants. And inevitably, in this environment, we know we need to offset these pressures through pricing actions which are already being implemented. We also are focused on leveraging our SSG&A investments while maintaining competitive investments in R&D.  
In 2022, we are forecasting additional impact to operating margin from inflation above normal levels from 2021. However, with the significant progress we've made to date on margin initiatives that are already underway, we anticipate being able to more than mitigate the incremental inflationary pressures this year to drive an additional 50 basis points of operating margin improvement. 
Increased utilization, reversing FX pressure and initiatives to offset inflationary pressure will also play a key part in restoring our base gross margin to pre-pandemic levels. Combined, we expect these to drive around 100 basis points improvement. We are committed to delivering against these goals, and thus, margin improvement will be a key measurement for performance in this year's compensation plan across the company. Our fiscal '22 operating margin improvement will be a significant step towards recovery of pre-pandemic margin levels. We look forward to sharing more about our longer-term margin recovery initiatives next week at our Investor Day, which includes exceeding prepandemic levels in fiscal '24.  
Turning to Slide 23. Our fiscal '22 adjusted EPS guidance reflects the year-over-year decline in COVID-only testing profit net of reinvestment. In our base business, as we just discussed, we expect strong operational growth driven by revenue growth and margin improvement, with EPS well above the $12 floor provided on our August call.  
Now turning to Slide 24. Our fiscal '22 guidance also includes our Diabetes business. We continue to believe the spin-off is a significant value-creating opportunity for our shareholders. And both RemainCo and NewCo are well positioned for success. Let me take a moment to reinforce some key items that make this compelling to all stakeholders.  
NewCo will be one of the largest pure-play diabetes companies in existence today with an ability to focus on its strategic goals, drive strong cash flow and allocate its capital more efficiently and effectively to drive higher growth. The proposed spin enhances RemainCo's revenue and EPS growth profile as Diabetes Care's revenue growth is slower than the corporate average and its margins are declining. Carve-out financials will be available with the Form 10.  
RemainCo is expected to receive a cash distribution equivalent to multiple years of cash generated by the Diabetes Care unit. We plan to provide more details related to the proceeds and intended use at a later date. The spin is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. And as is normal course for spins, we plan to restate our financials after the spin's effective date to classify the Diabetes business as a discontinued operation. Given the higher margin profile of the Diabetes Care business, one should expect RemainCo's margins to be lower as a percent of sales after they are restated but with a higher rate of growth. We are establishing transition services agreement that will offset stranded costs. We remain excited for what's ahead for NewCo and making this a successful and value-creating opportunity for all.  
Now turning to Slide 25. Finally, I wanted to take a moment to share some phasing considerations for your models. First, we expect revenue growth to be normalized across the quarters with the exception of Q2, where we expect higher growth due to the easier comp resulting from the COVID resurgence in Q2 FY '21, primarily in Interventional. In addition, we expect COVID testing revenue to be weighted towards the first half of the year.  
Second, we expect gross margin to be lower in the first half given that increased inflation began earlier in fiscal '21 and the benefit of cost improvement initiatives we have initiated will be on a lag as they flow through inventory. We expect the inflation flow-through to inventory to be most prominent in Q2 and improve across the balance of the year.  
Third, as we move past COVID variability, we expect SSG&A and R&D expense dollars to be fairly ratable by quarter. Fourth, for full year -- for FY '22, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%. This rate includes assumptions around our jurisdictional mix of income and certain potential discrete items. Of course, the timing of realization of discrete items could result in variability in our rate quarter-to-quarter including a potentially lower Q1 rate.  
In summary, fiscal '21 was a year marked by significant strategic progress and execution against our key priorities. As we look forward and as reflected in our 2022 guidance, we are well positioned for growth with excellent momentum in our base business, increased investments in our innovation pipeline, tuck-in M&A momentum, strong progress executing our balance sheet and cash flow initiatives and clear visibility to meaningful margin improvement. We are excited to share our long-term outlook with you at our Investor Day.

And on the combo test, is that -- what sort of assumptions should we have on ASP for the combo test because I was curious on your pricing comment for COVID in fiscal Q4?"

So Alaris, as we said, we expect that to be essentially flat to '21. Think about that as about $100 million contribution in '22 and '21. Put in perspective, that's -- as Chris mentioned, that's about '20 was closer to $300 million. So even in our -- as we think about the 8.1% growth this past year, that absorbs about a point of Alaris coming down from the -- when we were getting very large numbers of additional medical necessity orders as people were adding to their fleets. So that's the assumption on Alaris. 
On vaccines, it's -- we still are towards the high end of that $100 million to $150 million range that we had expected for vaccination campaigns. And so we expect that's just kind of part of the MDS business now. I don't know if we're going to call that out as a guide in that growth, but we don't see it as a notable headwind in the growth rate of that business in '22. We still have solid demand for those products. And as we said, we now have visibility to 2 billion units of syringes specifically for COVID vaccines, which we're obviously proud of being able to help deliver 2 billion COVID vaccines around the world. And we -- I think we've shipped about 1.2 billion or 1.3 billion of those so far. So that gives you a little bit of color in terms of how much we're left to ship in '22. 
On the combo assay, great question. We've got Dave Hickey here, obviously, the President of our Life Sciences businesses. And so let me turn that question over to him."

Just to reiterate what Chris had said, right, so if you think about what's gone back into the base business for '22, we do expect that as we get into the flu season, the respiratory season for both BD Veritor and for BD MAX, that these combination tests will be the sort of the go-to test particularly for people who might be symptomatic and for people who were sort of saying, do I have flu or do I have COVID. So we do expect that to be the combo test. The installed base is out there to support that testing, and we've put into the range for next year an estimate of around 75 million to 100 million back into the base business. 
From a pricing perspective, we do expect it to be a premium price over the traditional test, as we'd indicated.  We're just not sharing specific pricing at this time."

Those can contribute about $300 million. That's one bucket. 
In addition to that, I articulated on the call, even as it relates to actions we're taking and demonstrated at the end of '21 and heading into '22, we're increasing our initiatives, pricing, mix, portfolio optimization and new initiatives on spend optimization as well. And then certainly, lastly, the Alaris ship hold, that was an 80 basis point drag on the business going back to then. So while we're not being committal as it relates to timing, as you think through kind of the longer-term time frame and that we'll share next week, you would expect that to have a benefit over time."

My one -- I really only have one question or one topic I want to cover. And Chris, this is probably for you because it seems like a key part of this call is your assumptions on the improvement base business operating margins from 2021 to 2022. So a couple of things I'd love you to comment on, Chris, if okay. 
One is I'm struggling a little bit with how to think about the starting point because Q4 base business operating margins are obviously a lot lower than full year 2021. So maybe help me understand what's the right starting point. 
And then secondly, I'd love you to talk a little bit about how much of that 200 basis point improvement in base business you're assuming for the full year is gross margin and just what are your assumptions on pricing embedded in that. 
So it's a lot in there. That's my one question, but I would love you to address those things."
103678,1684279471,2425048,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Bob. I appreciate the question. Great question. So look, I think going forward, we're going to continue to provide transparency as it relates to kind of the base performance of the business. I understand your question as it relates to kind of",526,"Yes. Thanks, Bob. I appreciate the question. Great question. So look, I think going forward, we're going to continue to provide transparency as it relates to kind of the base performance of the business. I understand your question as it relates to kind of jump-off points as it relates to quarter. Keep in mind, there are a lot of quarterly fluctuations as we navigated 2020 through COVID and 2021 with inflationary dynamics. I think it's simplest to kind of normalize and just look at things on a full year basis. 
So as you think of our operating margins from 2021 of 21.7% on the base business, there's really a few key drivers. One is we had talked about through this about having our utilization levels impacted due to pandemic. Our strong growth profile through '21 and '22 we now anticipate being well above and driving almost 100 basis points of utilization upside '21 to '22 full year to full year. In addition to that, last year, we had the impact of currency. There was a headwind on earnings. They got trapped in inventory. And as that bleeds through, we actually have about a 50 basis point improvement heading from '21 to '22 that goes through to operating margin. 
Lastly, where we're investing a lot of our time, of course, is navigating the inflationary dynamics. And we talked about a net 50 basis point improvement in terms of outsized inflation, which we would anticipate being north of 200 basis points in full year '22. Offsetting that will be a series of initiatives. There's not one thing. It's actually a very well-balanced plan. We had talked about on the call, we're continuing to drive cost improvement in our plants. We're taking actions on the procurement side of the business as well in terms of spend. We're looking at things from an SSG&A standpoint as well and leveraging that. And then yes, there's going to be a strong focus on pricing, portfolio mix, driving growth through higher GP areas. And the net of all of those, we actually expect a 50 basis point improvement. 
Maybe lastly, just to give you some color on kind of where we are because I think this is important, we've entered the year with specific action plans against those goals. So we have risk-adjusted plans, very detailed targeted actions to deliver the improvement we need to mitigate against the inflation. If you go a step further where we are from kind of an execution standpoint, 80% to 90% of those have been fully identified and the plans are moving. And some of them are just more timing dynamics in terms of when we may take price or when we'll evolve our portfolio. And of that number, almost half of that is actually already banked coming in the year is flowing through our inventory and P&L now. That's quite a testament to the work that we did in the back half of '21 and already have strong progress. So we look forward to sharing more as the year progresses, but we feel good about the plan and the progress that we'll achieve through the year."

That will -- we don't anticipate that being out by next week. Look, it's a good question. It's premature to share. We have to wait until the Form 10 is out. There'll be much more detail there. But I really think the more important dynamic here is, right, this is actually just a portfolio transaction, and there's going to be sort of a reset of margin. And by definition, we had shared that it is accretive, there will be a reset of margin, but more importantly, it's been dilutive to both growth and margin growth -- top line growth and margin growth. So it can be an acceleration from that. 
And as we get into Investor Day, we can certainly share more as it relates to kind of the longer-term impact as it relates to margin and what I just shared in terms of our longer-term margin improvement goals. We still feel really good about where we're going to position margin over time and all these efforts going against that.

So we'll try not to share too much of the thunder from next week, but it's a good question, and we'll get more into this. But we've spent so about $500 million this year if you look at the acquisitions that we made last year, think about over the last 20 months or so, we've invested about $900 million. That drives about $100 million this year and $200 million next year roughly from those tuck-in M&As. So if you do the math, that's about a little under 5x what we're paying in terms of revenue that we're getting from those acquisitions next year. And as you know that, that's good value that we're getting. And we're obviously performing above our cost of capital on those acquisitions. We're clearly at those levels of multiples that we're being able to get those assets for. We're not buying growth. We're absolutely growing what we buy, leveraging our channels, our global position, our manufacturing capabilities, et cetera, to scale these assets in ways that we're uniquely positioned to do so. 
We'll also share with you next week the mix of how those break out into the amount of spend and acquisitions that are going towards kind of that durable core base portfolio that we have versus those more transformative solution areas that I've talked about, those 3 categories that we discussed. And you'll see the weighting of those. They're highly weighted in high-growth markets. That revenue that I described is growing north of double digits as we go forward. 
We continue to see opportunities as we look ahead. We have a robust funnel. You can expect us to continue to drive that strategy forward. Obviously, it's been an important part of why we focus so heavily on cash flow. Actually, if you look at our cash flow over the last 2 years since '19, it's grown at 18% CAGR. That's not by accident. We've had very focused programs driving that. That's something we're very proud of, and it positions us, as Chris mentioned, to drive a balanced strategy between the tuck-in M&A strategy to drive our growth as well as continue to return value to shareholders, as you've seen us doing.

I'll ask them both now. Chris, maybe I'll ask Bob's question in a different way. Can you talk a little bit about the margin and EPS cadence in fiscal '22? How much below the operating -- the base operating margin of about 23.7% do you expect Q1 to be? Is 100 basis points the right way to think about it? And consensus is, I think, $2.84  for EPS right now. I'd love to get your reaction to that just to calibrate us correctly to start the year. 
And Tom, you guys are doing really well in China. There are a lot of investor concerns about multinational companies' ability to continue to grow there given the value-based purchasing and the recent document '551. How are you feeling about your ability to continue to grow strongly in China? And any reaction to some of those initiatives?"

Yes, I'll try to amplify some of the color that I provided earlier. So as we think of the year as the year progresses, first, from the top line, just to reiterate, we do actually expect relatively normalized growth with the exception of Q2, like I had shared, because of the comparables. And then there's a dynamic of COVID-only testing, which you'd expect to be more first half. So I would consider that dynamic. 
From a margin standpoint, certainly first half we anticipate to be lower. This is simply a matter of the inflationary dynamics that started in 2021 rolling through inventory. And the peak of when that rolls through and those costs actually hit is more like Q2. So kind of first half definitely less favorable margins versus the second half and Q2 in particular being kind of the high mark of that low, so to speak. 
And then obviously, as the initiatives that we've already taken, again, there's a lot of that bank, right? If you recall, I had shared, about 50% of it's already happening. But again, you get the dynamic of it flowing through inventory, so you end up with kind of a second half dynamic in the margin improvement throughout the back half. So the last item was just more the discretionary tax item I alluded to that could actually end up with some favorability in Q1, but those are very difficult to predict. So hopefully, that helps some."

And so I know he's looking forward to sharing the progress there. As you said, we were -- we had a good -- very good year in China this year. And we think we're kind of back to a strong growth rate looking forward. '551 for us, we don't see specific impact in our categories. It's something that we've spent a lot of time talking about. Obviously, we have 4 plants in China. They're focused almost exclusively in China for China and particularly focused in some of the categories that there is more local competition in like catheters, vacutainer tubes, 10 needles, et cetera. But we make those businesses, those products mostly in China for China as well, so we can compete as a local organization in those. 
The other thing is we have a record number of new product launches coming out in China over the next 3 years. You'll hear from Simon and team in China. We're really pleased that we ended '21 having doubled the size of the Bard business in China since acquisition. That was a big focus of ours on revenue synergies. And there continues to be the impact of those registrations that we've been making over the last several years. The impact of those will be continuing to roll out with new launches. As we look forward, I know, again, Simon will talk next week. Maybe you could share a couple of comments now on some of the launches that you're having in China that are occurring. So we feel good about the outlook for China. As all, we're watching the situation very cautiously being prudent in our investments there. But we've got a great team, we saw strong performance this year, and we do have a strong outlook in China for next year as well."

Appreciate the question. Look, I think it really starts with our focus on growth. I think a strong base growth profile that we guided on, coupled with, if you look at the cash flow that we shared through '21, it gives us a lot of flexibility on tuck-in M&A, right? So we have strong organic growth profile, the enhancement we're making to our R&D portfolio and then that, coupled with the tuck-in M&A capability that we will now be able to have on an ongoing basis. Tom earlier talked about the acceleration of deals that we've done recently.  Those alone can contribute about 40 basis points to growth. So one, I think there's just a very strong growth profile there. Two is just the disciplined focus on margin improvement. We knew that was something to focus on in addition to the cash management approach we've taken over time that's enhanced growth. 
And so those are the 2 main drivers. As a matter of fact, we're actually cycling over a headwind on tax. That's been offset by some of the capital deployment we've been able to put at work with share repurchases. So you'll see us be more disciplined there with other value-creating levers due to the strong cash flow that we have."
