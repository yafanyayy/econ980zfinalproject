I hope you and your families continue to be safe and well. Before we get to the details of our performance in the fourth quarter, I want to take a moment and thank the thousands of MGM Resorts collea",2705,"Thank you, Jim, and thank you all for joining us today. I hope you and your families continue to be safe and well. Before we get to the details of our performance in the fourth quarter, I want to take a moment and thank the thousands of MGM Resorts colleagues around the world who have helped worked so hard over the past several months. I, along with the other members of the senior management team, am eternally grateful for the resilience and commitment that our employees have shown throughout this crisis. 
I continue to be amazed by what we've accomplished together. We have adopted seamlessly to a rapidly changing environment, always putting the safety and enjoyment of our guests and our employees first and foremost. More than anything else, that gives me confidence in our company's future success. 
I'd also like to welcome the newest member of our executive team, our CFO, Jonathan Halkyard. Many of you know Jonathan from his tenure as CFO of Caesars, and most recently as the Chief Executive Officer of Extended Stay America. Over the past 20 years, Jonathan has built a well-earned reputation for integrity, developing people, driving strategy and delivering results for shareholders. I'm excited to have him here at MGM. And even though it's only been a short time, I can assure you, he's already having an impact. Welcome, Jonathan. 
At MGM, our long-term vision is clear and differentiated. Our goal is simple: to be the premier omni-channel gaming, hospitality and entertainment company in the world. We will achieve this vision by investing in the development of our people, providing fun and inspiring entertainment experiences for our guests, delivering operational excellence at every level and allocating our capital to drive the highest returns for our shareholders. 
During the quarter, we made progress on each of these fronts. As the pandemic unfolded over the past year, we had to take the unfortunate steps of furloughing many of our employees to match business levels. As the business begins to recover and operating restrictions abate, we expect to continue remobilizing our fantastic teams, rehiring and retraining them in order to serve our guests. Over the course of this year, we will do the same with our industry-leading entertainers across all of our properties. 
Our BetMGM sports betting and iGaming venture is growing at a historic rate, enabled by what I believe is digital gaming's most talented management and technology development teams. I believe our people are truly the best in this new industry. 
Operational excellence is a mantra here. Beginning in late 2019, we refined our operating model, increasing spans of control and simplifying organizational layers to accelerate decision-making, bringing us all closer to our guests and to reducing costs. These moves are already paying off. Our program of $450 million in domestic cost savings helped drive margin improvement, especially at our regional properties in the fourth quarter, and we should achieve the full target when business demands return to our 2019 levels. 
And finally, we are focused on being disciplined allocators of capital, always driven by the goal of creating value for our shareholders. In the first and second quarter of 2020 in the early days of the pandemic, it was critical to create and sustain a liquidity cushion for the company. With the top line still under pressure and the travel climate a bit uncertain, our fortified balance sheet is essential to protect equity value while enabling MGM to be aggressive when identifying opportunities to invest for growth. And invest for growth, we have. Even as we've been managing through the crisis before us, we have kept an unwavering focus on the future and particularly on several attractive ROI growth opportunities that align to our long-term vision. 
Along with our partners in [indiscernible], we have invested in BetMGM, and we have seen it emerge as a leader in the U.S. sports betting and iGaming business. We've launched an extensive room remodel program here at Bellagio, slated to be done this summer. And we're taking steps to expand the company's digital capacities and strengthen our omnichannel strategy globally. And we have been laying the groundwork for growing our presence in Asia with the Japan IR opportunity and additional investments in Macau. 
With that, let's focus on, obviously, the fourth quarter's results. Our consolidated fourth quarter 2020 revenues were $1.5 billion, incrementally better than our third quarter by $1.1 billion. Our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDAR has improved sequentially to a positive $97 million this quarter. Our full year 2020 revenues were $5.2 billion, about 40% of 2019 levels. And our full year 2020 adjusted EBITDAR loss was approximately $148 million. 
The operating dynamics in Las Vegas and our regional properties were, however, quite different in the fourth quarter. Let's start with Las Vegas. 
Our fourth quarter Las Vegas Strip revenues were $480 million, about flat from the third quarter. However, our Strip's property EBITDAR was $54 million, up from $15 million in the third quarter driven almost entirely by October and the first half of November. The fourth quarter started relatively strong here in Las Vegas with hotel occupancies of about 46% during October. And in fact, October was our strongest month since the beginning of the pandemic, but public health concerns dampened visitation over the course of the quarter, and this has obviously continued at least till now through February. Our fourth quarter hotel occupancy finished at 38% with weekends running at 52 and mid-week at 31. 
Our M life loyalty members continue to drive visitation with our casino segment contributing to total room nights improving by about 13 points over the last year. And our casino customers and new M life member sign-ups also continue to skew towards higher worth and younger customers during this quarter. It's our belief these headwinds will continue into the near term with current Nevada gathering guidelines in effect. And public health sentiment, where it is, we expect midweek business will be challenged throughout the first quarter. In this demand environment, we have remained flexible to minimize our cash usage and ultimately maximize our portfolio-wide profitability. 
In the fourth quarter, we closed our hotel towers at Mandalay Bay and Park MGM during the mid week. And in early January, we also announced the full closure of Mirage during the midweek. We remain diligent in closely aligning labor needs to demand. The good news is the approved vaccines appear highly effective for vulnerable populations, and we are monitoring the rollout closely. As the burden of our health care system eases, gathering, travel restrictions are being lifted. Assuming that most of the population is willing to resume normal activity, which we certainly saw glimpses of last summer, then we believe the demand for travel and visitation in Las Vegas could be robust later in the year. In fact, our gross bookings in January was the strongest since the start of the pandemic, and guests are increasingly booking 90-plus days out. I'm also looking forward to the coming pool season with much optimism. 
While the return of the larger groups will ultimately depend on the easing of gathering guidelines and other factors, we remain bullish on the long-term demand. We still have significant rooms on the books for the third quarter and have more on the fourth quarter than we had at this time last year. Both 2022 and 2023 are approximately one on pace compared with prior years. And it's interesting the L.B. CBA recently conducted a survey which indicated that 91% of those surveys missed the face-to-face nature of meetings, and the majority were also just simply burned out from virtual meetings. The survey also indicated that business travelers believe Las Vegas is more prepared than other leading business destinations to safely host in-person events. 
Data points like these tell me that the fundamental drivers of Las Vegas as a tourism and meeting destination remain firmly intact. We remain bullish in its proven ability to drive demand and believe the markets return to pre-pandemic levels over time. 
Now let's move on to our regional performance. Our regional operations performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter despite being subject to a series of operating restrictions. Our fourth quarter regional operations revenues were $595 million, up 7% sequentially versus the third quarter. And adjusted property EBITDA was up 9% sequentially from the third quarter to $159 million. As in Las Vegas, we are highly encouraged that our performance was led by a higher level of casino spend by a younger demographic. 
Gaming volumes were approximately 70% of last year's fourth quarter, but our regional properties delivered 129 basis points year-over-year EBITDA margin growth to 27%. We achieved this despite the statewide restrictions, including the full closure of Detroit per month as well as the week-long exposure in extended hurricane repairs at the Bo Ravage. Adjusting for these headwinds and other state-by-state restrictions, we expect our margins for the quarter would have been up 580 basis points year-over-year. 
These continued cost improvements, predominantly in labor and marketing efficiency, are largely sustainable. I expect continued strong regional margins as revenues return towards our 2019 levels. 
Finally, I know we are all encouraged by the states lifting operating mandates over the past couple of weeks. No doubt, this will enable our properties to serve greater numbers of guests and expect these guests will lead the recovery in our system. 
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes on BetMGM. The sports betting and iGaming market is one of the largest and most exciting growth opportunities in the U.S.A. today, and BetMGM is emerging as a long-term leader. BetMGM began 2020 in just 3 markets and has ended the year with 10. It is now currently live in 12 states, and we expect to be in 20 states by the end of 2021 with access to approximately 40% of the U.S. adult population. As each state rolls out, MGM is securing a leading market share position. 
In the fourth quarter, BetMGM's market share was 17% in its retail and online markets and 19% if you exclude Pennsylvania, which were only open for part of December. This is a testament to BetMGM's successful execution and strong management teams as it continues to enter new states on day 1 -- on day 1 and gained share in its existing markets. Consider the venture's entry into Michigan just a couple of weeks ago. We had a fully operational iGaming and online sports betting offering on day 1 and prelaunch registration efforts to build momentum into go live day. 
Between December and January, BetMGM registered 138,000 new customers. In the first 10 days of launch BetMGM generated 13 million in GGR. That's especially impressive is that our iGaming GGR per day in January was higher than in New Jersey, where BetMGM is the #1 operator. 
Michigan is a market where we knew we had the right format to win. We have an MGM branded retail presence with a loyal customer base. The ability to go live on day 1 with both iGaming and sports betting, a compelling product, an attractive target and an attractive target demographic. While it's still very early, we're extremely pleased with these results thus far. 
Our leadership positions have proven sustainable BetMGM was the #1 iGaming operator in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, and we expect to continue growing our market share. 
On the sports wagering side, BetMGM delivered impressive online sports betting results in 2 of its newest markets, Colorado and Tennessee. In the fourth quarter, BetMGM had market shares of 31% and 34%, respectively. These share gains led to $178 million of net gaming revenues associated with BetMGM in 2020, well above its target of $150 million. And in fact, in the fourth quarter, BetMGM's net revenues doubled the previous quarter. 
The convergence between BetMGM and M life has been monumental. In the fourth quarter, 17% of BetMGM sign-ups have come from MGM, and 39% of the new M life sign-ups have come from Bet MGM. BetMGM's key competitive advantage is its ability to lever MGM's destinations our broad-based experiential offerings and our M life loyalty program as efficient and effective customer acquisition tools. Once engaged, we know that omnichannel customers have vastly greater value to our company than single channel customers. And again, while we're still in this in the early days in Michigan, we are already proving this out we are currently seeing customer acquisition costs below the $200 range. 
In 2021, we and our partners in expect new revenue associated with BetMGM to grow well over 100%. And in fact, preliminary estimates of January's net gaming revenues associated with BetMGM operations was $44 million. On Super Bowl Sunday, the number of online bets placed with BetMGM was 11x last year's online bets, and the online handle was 17x last year's handle. That is why we remain aligned on investing aggressively to fund the growth of this business, and we expect to continue doing so this year in pursuit of this market opportunity. 
Let me conclude now with our performance in Macau. This market continued to steadily improve sequentially with fourth quarter market-wide GGR declining 70% year-over-year compared with 93% year-over-year decline in the third quarter. MGM China's fourth quarter revenues were $305 million, up sequentially from the third quarter's $47 million. And adjusted property EBITDA was also up sequentially from a $96 million loss in the third quarter to $41 million in the fourth quarter. This included a $23 million bonus accrual reversal during the quarter. 
We are pleased to finally see that BetMGM China is back in the black, driven by strong market share gains as well as continued cost mitigation efforts. Better yet, we think the evolving market structure of Macau's gaming squarely meets our strengths in the market. MGM China has always been geared to the premium mass segment. Between our branch office infrastructure, our product design and our marketing capabilities, we've always had an advantage in this segment. And our growing market share is evidence of this evolution. 
There is no question that we recently reemerged -- with the recently reemerged COVID cases and government warning and limited travel during the Chinese New Year holiday seasons have impacted demand in the near term, but we expect the broader rate of recovery will continue to be gradual and driven by the premier market mass market. 
I like our opportunities for accretive investment in Macau. Currently, construction of the additional suites in the South tower of MGM Cotai is underway and will be ready in mid-2021. We've also begun remodeling our MGM Macau Villas in the gaming space on Level 35. And at both properties, we're adding F&B options focused on the gaming floors. 
And then longer terms, we have also had the ability to build out another hotel tower at MGM Cotai along with meaningful entertainment assets to diversify our offerings. 
For the past 13 years, MGM China has been committed to supporting Macau as a world tourism destination. We again look forward to working with the government through the licensing renewal process and hopes to further our support for many more years to come. 
Switching on to our liquidity. It remains extremely strong and has served as a strong foundation from which to navigate the crisis with an eye towards our longer-term goals. As of December 31, MGM had $8.8 billion of consolidated liquidity, which included $2 billion at the MGP operating partnerships and $1.2 billion at the MGM China, leaving our domestic operations liquidity at over $5.6 billion. 
Before I turn this over to Q&A, I'd like to close just with a few final thoughts. We remain diligent in navigating the near-term operating environment, aggressively managing our operating model and our cost structure. I am optimistic about the long-term recovery of all of our markets and believe that MGM is well positioned to gain share. I'm also excited by BetMGM's position in the rapidly growing U.S. sports and iGaming betting market. And we are confident that despite near-term headwinds, our balance sheet delivers a strong foundation upon which to build the future of our company. With that, I'll be happy to open this up to any of your questions."

We are hopeful that there'll be a March rollback probably till October levels would be ideal. There are no promises that the governor has slated a call for later this week. I would suspect we'll see something targeted towards March. So I think March may hopefully begin to feel like October if we're lucky. And by the way, this is my presumption, not my knowledge. And I'm hoping by end of spring, as we go into June, we'll see yet another significant rollback as we get ready for events. There are several large conference conventions that want to come both citywide and here at the property. 
And then as you know, March madness and followed by really spring break, pull season around here is substantive and meaningful. And so I think we'll see occupancies hopefully go back to October and then beyond. I know Corey is planning on maybe to speak to Corey's quickly, some openings here and sometime in March."

The big -- the first big citywide event has actually been scheduled and has been talked about. That's the World of Concrete at the new convention center addition, which I walked yesterday, and it's quite spectacular will be really great for the city. I think it will give the city a competitive advantage. And then literally 2 weeks later, they have Barrett Jackson. 
So we are optimistic what we see on our books in the third and fourth quarter. We still have a quite amount of rooms on there. And we're -- fourth quarter, we actually have more rooms on the books than we did same time last year as we look at year out. And so we're pretty optimistic on what we see in the future.

So could you maybe unpack that for us a little bit? What do you think is driving the depth of that market? What do you think is driving success there as it relates to maybe some of your cross-sell opportunities and customer acquisition?"

Well, firstly, I'm delighted to be here, and it's a testament to the work of the BetMGM team, the success we're seeing. And Michigan is a great example of our strategy, BetMGM strategy coming to life. 
Bill's already touched on the power of the brand. We've got big deployed branded MGM -- sorry, MGM Grand Detroit branded. As the power of omnichannel, we've got both sports and gaming. And that really plays into our hand. 
The technology that we use from maintain was built in a way that gives us tremendous amount of flexibility in driving product play. And we're really seeing this come to life in Michigan. And I think the key step that perhaps an you're looking for is multiproduct play. Recognizing that we're in the early days of the market, we are seeing well over 30% of our customers playing both casino and sports. And so we're really excited about it. There's so much potential. 
iGaming has started more strongly than our sports business. The Super Bowl was very good for our sports business. So yes, we look to the future of that state very, very encouragingly."

All of these factors play a part into differentiating what BetMGM represents to our customers.

So put all those things together, obviously, combined with product, CRM, all of the acquisition machine working. And we're demonstrating that we can fight and win toe to toe with the best. 
In relation to your second question, which is around deposits, that's important because that's the fuel, no deposits no ability to wager no ability to play. And the other point is to the -- what -- it's important -- rephrase. 
The moment of truth is our players actually putting hard-earned money into an account to play with us rather than it being purely bonus money incentive money. And so the importance of that 13 million is it demonstrates the scale of fuel to drive NGR. I hope that's helpful."

But it's important to note that this time last year, in January and February of 2020, MGM's property-level margins had increased almost 500 basis points over the prior year. And that was a benefit of the cost moves and some restructurings that occurred during 2019, and we were already seeing in the numbers a year ago. 
And that program, those series of programs were augmented further, of course, during 2020. And beyond that, and this has been a bit of a surprise for me coming to MGM for sure, that the company really has a very effective operating model with centers of excellence in the areas you would expect, hospitality, gaming, finance, entertainment, that cut across the entire enterprise and are effective and efficient, delivering, I think, a better outcome at lower cost. And that kind of organization is absolutely critical when we talk about things like the reopening of these properties. 
So I certainly anticipate EBITDAR margins solidly above 30% across the enterprise as we recover. We would have seen that in the regions in the fourth quarter of 2020 had we not had the closures. And I'm confident that we can get there in Las Vegas as well as we reopen."

We open and close some of them every week, and that's a complex process. But -- and so we've proven to ourselves that the restructure, our ability to spread management across multiple properties in terms of senior leadership, not only is going to work, has worked. 
And so it's not overly complicated. I think the trick for us will be -- make sure that we're tight and we're disciplined on yielding volumes and making sure that we do labor the way we forecasted it and the way we've presumed that we've done historically in the last couple of months, as Jonathan mentioned before, the pandemic. That will be our test, if you will. It's not overly complicated at this point. A matter of fact, kind of being here in the middle of the shift is probably the most complicated."

I wanted to ask about the digital gaming and the degree to which and the importance of which owning your own technologies and owning your own capabilities becomes increasingly important as you scale. Candidly, it was one of the first thoughts I had around the -- just before the Super Bowl when there started to be some news about volumes becoming an issue. 
If you could just talk about that importance going forward, that would be helpful, economically and strategically."

The good thing with our partnership is it's that. We gave our retail business. They gave their technology. And so by not owning our technology in most circumstances, there's a percentage that comes with that. We're not burdened with that, if you will. We're not paying a percentage of GGR or NGR, GGR on someone else's technology. So that's the first affirmative thing. 
When it comes to this initiative within Entain obviously, America is the biggest thing in the world right now, and so we're all highly focused on it. And so our ability -- and as you know, it was rough out of the gate, but our ability over the last year, particularly led by Adam now, to get the teams engaged, to get the technology, to get the development effort, to get the product that we need and want for America of note because obviously, it was designed to speak to Premier League and other things, has been meaningful. Sure, ultimately, at some point, it could come into play. But for today, we don't pay the premium that others do. 
As it relates to Super Bowl, it wasn't necessarily a volume thing, but Adam, why don't you just comment on it for a moment?"

Look, owning the owned technology piece is important for -- on 4, 4 pillars. The first, obviously, is cost. We're not paying away to a third party, the cost of it. But importantly, by owning our product, we can get to market quickly. We can be there on day 1 as we've demonstrated 5 times over -- in 87 days. I don't think anybody else has done that. So speed to market so that we can capitalize on that pent-up demand at low CPA period that is vital and valuable. We can also -- staying with product, we can also respond quickly and I believe more quickly than anybody else to what customers are telling us, and we have a research group now and a research process, so that the process of ongoing improvements to product can be translated into what customers experience as quickly as possible. So that's a further benefit. 
Content is the other. We have in-house within our partnership within Entain, we have in-house studios, which allow us to bring unique content to market, which is both cheaper than buying -- obviously, we're not paying away a rev share. But it's the only place in town that you can play certain games. Our most popular iGaming product in New Jersey and now in Michigan is our in-house developed game. 
So -- and playing that forward, why is that relevant? Because we think that we can continue to develop, innovate and differentiate. And the last is the tools that are unique to our platform, the player management tools, the customer communication tools. All of those come together in a way that we think is strategically valuable. 
Now getting on to the -- that's all the good stuff. As regards the Super Bowl, look, Bill already mentioned the Super Bowl was a record-breaking day for BetMGM. Online bets 11x last year, online handled 17x last year. And our digital performance was robust throughout the U.S., which, as you probably read, wasn't the case for all operators and actually enhanced our competitive position. 
But Nevada was different. But -- and in Nevada only, we did have an outage, which resulted in the system being down during the game. But the system was restored shortly after and has been working as normal ever since. 
Now this is the important part. The issue that caused the outage was specific and was the unfortunate result of a human error and has been addressed. We know that the software works, which makes the downtime on Sunday, all the more disappointing, particularly given all the tremendous work that was done by our MGM colleagues in preparation for the event, which was just enormous. And it goes without saying that we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers, who I hope are looking forward to March Madness as much as we are. 
And I'll give it back to you, Bill."

In Macau, actually, the cash flow has been [indiscernible] positive each month in the month -- in the fourth quarter. Actually, December had the best financial results. And also in terms of business recovery, December was the strongest. And of course, going into first quarter, we saw some of the momentum carried over in the first week of January. But after that, because of the COVID cases in China increased so there was some travel advisory put in place by the Chinese authorities at all different levels. We do anticipate that hotel occupancy will reach a level similar to October Golden Week last year for Chinese New Year period. And this will be a period for us to remain positive for month to [ quarter-to-date ] period. 
And visitation to Macau is a function of COVID cases in Macau, COVID cases in China and also the availability of vaccination. I think that when you look at these variables, there is no reason to believe that the travel advisory will stay in place for a long period of time because I think Macau has been almost 250 days without any local cases. And in China, the first that we saw in December or early January has quickly diminished to about low double digits in the teens. And vaccination in Macau and also in China has been pushed out to more and more people. 
So I do believe that we have reason to be optimistic in the first quarter. Back to you, Bill."

I hope you and your families continue to be safe and well. Before we get to the details of our performance in the fourth quarter, I want to take a moment and thank the thousands of MGM Resorts colleagues around the world who have helped worked so hard over the past several months. I, along with the other members of the senior management team, am eternally grateful for the resilience and commitment that our employees have shown throughout this crisis.  
I continue to be amazed by what we've accomplished together. We have adopted seamlessly to a rapidly changing environment, always putting the safety and enjoyment of our guests and our employees first and foremost. More than anything else, that gives me confidence in our company's future success.  
I'd also like to welcome the newest member of our executive team, our CFO, Jonathan Halkyard. Many of you know Jonathan from his tenure as CFO of Caesars, and most recently as the Chief Executive Officer of Extended Stay America. Over the past 20 years, Jonathan has built a well-earned reputation for integrity, developing people, driving strategy and delivering results for shareholders. I'm excited to have him here at MGM. And even though it's only been a short time, I can assure you, he's already having an impact. Welcome, Jonathan.  
At MGM, our long-term vision is clear and differentiated. Our goal is simple: to be the premier omnichannel gaming, hospitality and entertainment company in the world. We will achieve this vision by investing in the development of our people, providing fun and inspiring entertainment experiences for our guests, delivering operational excellence at every level and allocating our capital to drive the highest returns for our shareholders.  
During the quarter, we made progress on each of these fronts. As the pandemic unfolded over the past year, we had to take the unfortunate steps of furloughing many of our employees to match business levels. As the business begins to recover and operating restrictions abate, we expect to continue remobilizing our fantastic teams, rehiring and retraining them in order to serve our guests. Over the course of this year, we will do the same with our industry-leading entertainers across all of our properties.  
Our BetMGM sports betting and iGaming venture is growing at a historic rate, enabled by what I believe is digital gaming's most talented management and technology development teams. I believe our people are truly the best in this new industry.  
Operational excellence is a mantra here. Beginning in late 2019, we refined our operating model, increasing spans of control and simplifying organizational layers to accelerate decision-making, bringing us all closer to our guests and to reducing costs. These moves are already paying off. Our program of $450 million in domestic cost savings helped drive margin improvement, especially at our regional properties in the fourth quarter, and we should achieve the full target when business demands return to our 2019 levels.  
And finally, we are focused on being disciplined allocators of capital, always driven by the goal of creating value for our shareholders. In the first and second quarter of 2020 in the early days of the pandemic, it was critical to create and sustain a liquidity cushion for the company, with the top line still under pressure and the travel climate a bit uncertain, our fortified balance sheet is essential to protect equity value while enabling MGM to be aggressive when identifying opportunities to invest for growth. And invest for growth, we have. Even as we've been managing through the crisis before us, we have kept an unwavering focus on the future and particularly on several attractive ROI growth opportunities that align to our long-term vision.  
Along with our partners, Entain, we have invested in BetMGM, and we have seen it emerge as a leader in the U.S. sports betting and iGaming business. We've launched an extensive room remodel program here at Bellagio, slated to be done this summer. And we're taking steps to expand the company's digital capacities and strengthen our omnichannel strategy globally. And we have been laying the groundwork for growing our presence in Asia to the Japan IR opportunity and additional investments in Macau.  
With that, let's focus on, obviously, the fourth quarter's results. Our consolidated fourth quarter 2020 revenues were $1.5 billion, incrementally better than our third quarter by $1.1 billion. Our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDAR has improved sequentially to a positive $97 million this quarter. Our full year 2020 revenues were $5.2 billion, about 40% of 2019 levels. And our full year 2020 adjusted EBITDAR loss was approximately $148 million.  
The operating dynamics in Las Vegas and our regional properties were, however, quite different in the fourth quarter. Let's start with Las Vegas.  
Our fourth quarter Las Vegas Strip revenues were $480 million, about flat from the third quarter. However, our Strip's property EBITDAR was $54 million, up from $15 million in the third quarter driven almost entirely by October and the first half of November. The fourth quarter started relatively strong here in Las Vegas with hotel occupancies of about 46% during October. And in fact, October was our strongest month since the beginning of the pandemic, but public health concerns dampened visitation over the course of the quarter, and this has obviously continued at least 'til now through February. Our fourth quarter hotel occupancy finished at 38% with weekends running at 52% and midweek at 31%. 
Our M life loyalty members continue to drive visitation with our casino segment contributing to total room nights improving by about 13 points over the last year. And our casino customers and new M life member sign-ups also continue to skew towards higher worth and younger customers during this quarter. It's our belief these headwinds will continue into the near term with current Nevada gathering guidelines in effect. And public health sentiment, where it is, we expect midweek business will be challenged throughout the first quarter. In this demand environment, we have remained flexible to minimize our cash usage and ultimately maximize our portfolio-wide profitability.  
In the fourth quarter, we closed our hotel towers at Mandalay Bay and Park MGM during the midweek. And in early January, we also announced the full closure of Mirage during the midweek. We remain diligent in closely aligning labor needs to demand. The good news is the approved vaccines appear highly effective for vulnerable populations, and we are monitoring the rollout closely. As the burden of our health care system eases, gathering, travel restrictions are being lifted. Assuming that most of the population is willing to resume normal activity, which we certainly saw glimpses of last summer, then we believe the demand for travel and visitation in Las Vegas could be robust later in the year. In fact, our gross bookings in January was the strongest since the start of the pandemic, and guests are increasingly booking 90-plus days out. I'm also looking forward to the coming pool season with much optimism.  
While the return of the larger groups will ultimately depend on the easing of gathering guidelines and other factors, we remain bullish on the long-term demand. We still have significant rooms on the books for the third quarter and have more on the fourth quarter than we had at this time last year. Both 2022 and 2023 are approximately one on pace compared with prior years. And it's interesting the LVCVA recently conducted a survey which indicated that 91% of those surveys missed the face-to-face nature of meetings, and the majority were also just simply burned out from virtual meetings. The survey also indicated that business travelers believe Las Vegas is more prepared than other leading business destinations to safely host in-person events.  
Data points like these tell me that the fundamental drivers of Las Vegas as a tourism and meeting destination remain firmly intact. We remain bullish in its proven ability to drive demand and believe the markets return to pre-pandemic levels over time.  
Now let's move on to our regional performance. Our regional operations performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter despite being subject to a series of operating restrictions. Our fourth quarter regional operations revenues were $595 million, up 7% sequentially versus the third quarter. And adjusted property EBITDAR was up 9% sequentially from the third quarter to $159 million. As in Las Vegas, we are highly encouraged that our performance was led by a higher level of casino spend by a younger demographic.  
Gaming volumes were approximately 70% of last year's fourth quarter, but our regional properties delivered 129 basis points year-over-year EBITDAR margin growth to 27%. We achieved this despite the statewide restrictions, including the full closure of Detroit for a month as well as the week-long exposure in extended hurricane repairs at the Beau Rivage. Adjusting for these headwinds and other state-by-state restrictions, we expect our margins for the quarter would have been up 580 basis points year-over-year. These continued cost improvements, predominantly in labor and marketing efficiency, are largely sustainable. I expect continued strong regional margins as revenues return towards our 2019 levels.  
Finally, I know we are all encouraged by the states lifting operating mandates over the past couple of weeks. No doubt, this will enable our properties to serve greater numbers of guests and expect these guests will lead the recovery in our system.  
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes on BetMGM. The sports betting and iGaming market is one of the largest and most exciting growth opportunities in the U.S.A. today, and BetMGM is emerging as a long-term leader. BetMGM began 2020 in just 3 markets and has ended the year with 10. It is now currently live in 12 states, and we expect to be in 20 states by the end of 2021 with access to approximately 40% of the U.S. adult population. As each state rolls out, MGM is securing a leading market share position.  
In the fourth quarter, BetMGM's market share was 17% in its retail and online markets and 19% if you exclude Pennsylvania, which were only open for part of December. This is a testament to BetMGM's successful execution and strong management teams as it continues to enter new states on day 1 -- on day 1 and gained share in its existing markets. Consider the venture's entry into Michigan just a couple of weeks ago. We had a fully operational iGaming and online sports betting offering on day 1 and prelaunch registration efforts to build momentum into go live day.  
Between December and January, BetMGM registered 138,000 new customers. In the first 10 days of launch, BetMGM generated $13 million in GGR. That's especially impressive is that our iGaming GGR per day in January was higher than in New Jersey, where BetMGM is the #1 operator.  
Michigan is a market where we knew we had the right format to win. We have an MGM branded retail presence with a loyal customer base. The ability to go live on day 1 with both iGaming and sports betting, a compelling product, an attractive target and an attractive target demographic. While it's still very early, we're extremely pleased with these results thus far.  
Our leadership positions have proven sustainable. BetMGM was the #1 iGaming operator in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, and we expect to continue growing our market share.  
On the sports wagering side, BetMGM delivered impressive online sports betting results in 2 of its newest markets, Colorado and Tennessee. In the fourth quarter, BetMGM had market shares of 31% and 34%, respectively. These share gains led to $178 million of net gaming revenues associated with BetMGM in 2020, well above its target of $150 million. And in fact, in the fourth quarter, BetMGM's net revenues doubled the previous quarter.  
The convergence between BetMGM and M life has been monumental. In the fourth quarter, 17% of BetMGM sign-ups have come from MGM, and 39% of the new M life sign-ups have come from Bet MGM. BetMGM's key competitive advantage is its ability to lever MGM's destinations our broad-based experiential offerings and our M life loyalty program as efficient and effective customer acquisition tools. Once engaged, we know that omnichannel customers have vastly greater value to our company than single-channel customers. And again, while we're still in this in the early days in Michigan, we are already proving this out. We are currently seeing customer acquisition costs below the $200 range.  
In 2021, we and our partners, Entain, expect new revenue associated with BetMGM to grow well over 100%. In fact, preliminary estimates of January's net gaming revenues associated with BetMGM operations was $44 million. On Super Bowl Sunday, the number of online bets placed with BetMGM was 11x last year's online bets, and the online handle was 17x last year's handle. That is why we remain aligned on investing aggressively to fund the growth of this business, and we expect to continue doing so this year in pursuit of this market opportunity.  
Let me conclude now with our performance in Macau. This market continued to steadily improve sequentially with fourth quarter market-wide GGR declining 70% year-over-year compared with 93% year-over-year decline in the third quarter. MGM China's fourth quarter revenues were $305 million, up sequentially from the third quarter's $47 million. And adjusted property EBITDAR was also up sequentially from a $96 million loss in the third quarter to $41 million in the fourth quarter. This included a $23 million bonus accrual reversal during the quarter.  
We are pleased to finally see that MGM China is back in the black, driven by strong market share gains as well as continued cost mitigation efforts. Better yet, we think the evolving market structure of Macau's gaming squarely meets our strengths in the market. MGM China has always been geared to the premium mass segment. Between our branch office infrastructure, our product design and our marketing capabilities, we've always had an advantage in this segment. And our growing market share is evidence of this evolution.  
There is no question that we recently reemerged -- with the recently reemerged COVID cases and government warning and limited travel during the Chinese New Year holiday seasons have impacted demand in the near term, but we expect the broader rate of recovery will continue to be gradual and driven by the premier market -- mass market.  
I like our opportunities for accretive investment in Macau. Currently, construction of the additional suites in the south tower of MGM Cotai is underway and will be ready in mid-2021. We've also begun remodeling our MGM Macau villas in the gaming space on level 35. And at both properties, we're adding F&B options focused on the gaming floors. And then longer terms, we have also had the ability to build out another hotel tower at MGM Cotai along with meaningful entertainment assets to diversify our offerings.  
For the past 13 years, MGM China has been committed to supporting Macau as a world tourism destination. We again look forward to working with the government through the licensing renewal process and hopes to further our support for many more years to come.  
Switching on to our liquidity. It remains extremely strong and has served as a strong foundation from which to navigate the crisis with an eye towards our longer-term goals. As of December 31, MGM had $8.8 billion of consolidated liquidity, which included $2 billion at the MGP operating partnerships and $1.2 billion at the MGM China, leaving our domestic operations liquidity at over $5.6 billion.  
Before I turn this over to Q&A, I'd like to close just with a few final thoughts. We remain diligent in navigating the near-term operating environment, aggressively managing our operating model and our cost structure. I am optimistic about the long-term recovery of all of our markets and believe that MGM is well positioned to gain share. I'm also excited by BetMGM's position in the rapidly growing U.S. sports and iGaming betting market. And we are confident that despite near-term headwinds, our balance sheet delivers a strong foundation upon which to build the future of our company. With that, I'll be happy to open this up to any of your questions."

We are hopeful that there'll be a March rollback probably 'til October levels would be ideal. There are no promises that the governor has slated a call for later this week. I would suspect we'll see something targeted towards March. So I think March may hopefully begin to feel like October if we're lucky. And by the way, this is my presumption, not my knowledge. And I'm hoping by end of spring, as we go into June, we'll see yet another significant rollback as we get ready for events. There are several large conference conventions that want to come both citywide and here at the property. 
And then as you know, March Madness and followed by really spring break, pool season around here is substantive and meaningful. And so I think we'll see occupancies hopefully go back to October and then beyond. I know Corey is planning on -- maybe to speak to Corey's quickly, some openings here and sometime in March."

But I think as vaccines roll out and as people feel more comfortable traveling, the amount of people coming may not approach what it was at peak, but we hope to see that return in the beginning of 2022. 
The big -- the first big citywide event has actually been scheduled and has been talked about. That's the World of Concrete at the new convention center addition, which I walked yesterday, and it's quite spectacular will be really great for the city. I think it will give the city a competitive advantage. And then literally 2 weeks later, they have Barrett-Jackson. 
So we are optimistic what we see on our books in the third and fourth quarter. We still have a quite amount of rooms on there. And we're -- fourth quarter, we actually have more rooms on the books than we did same time last year as we look at year out. And so we're pretty optimistic on what we see in the future. The other data point that we're starting to see is people are starting to look to book, and we have over 120,000 rooms under contract for 2021 out there right now that I think people are just getting -- looking for one more sign to say things are going to be on the clearer side."

And the idea of there being, yes, some of the groups may be lighting participation, but I think the overall leisure travel and the notion of us with this massive amount of pent-up demand for people to get out. I think we'll offset it in occupancy.

I'm personally delighted about Tennessee because many -- some have suggested that we would accelerate gaming but perhaps not be as strong in sports. And for me, Tennessee is the poster child of our ability to compete against the early leaders in a sports market only. Now why are we seeing such success? We were there on day 1. All of the components of our operating model were in place right from the start. We have the right partners. We are partners with the Titans. So put all those things together, obviously, combined with product, CRM, all of the acquisition machine working. And we're demonstrating that we can fight and win toe to toe with the best. 
In relation to your second question, which is around deposits, that's important because that's the fuel, no deposits, no ability to wager, no ability to play. And the other point is to the -- what -- it's important -- rephrase. 
The moment of truth is our players actually putting hard-earned money into an account to play with us rather than it being purely bonus money incentive money. And so the importance of that $13 million is it demonstrates the scale of fuel to drive NGR. I hope that's helpful."

Thanks for getting me in the game. I'll offer a couple of thoughts. There's -- as I've done some forensics on the performance of the business last year and in 2019, and looked at the projects which Corey has led through operations to really reconsider the operating model and not just in the past 12 months, but even before the company entered 2020, I'm convinced that this business, with the return of the volumes as complex as it is, as you noted, can secure the gains in the cost structure that they have seen so far. 
It was a long time ago. It feels like a long time ago. But it's important to note that this time last year, in January and February of 2020, MGM's property-level margins had increased almost 500 basis points over the prior year. And that was a benefit of the cost moves and some restructurings that occurred during 2019, and we were already seeing in the numbers a year ago. 
And that program, those series of programs were augmented further, of course, during 2020. And beyond that, and this has been a bit of a surprise for me coming to MGM for sure, that the company really has a very effective operating model with centers of excellence in the areas you would expect, hospitality, gaming, finance, entertainment, that cut across the entire enterprise and are effective and efficient, delivering, I think, a better outcome at lower cost. And that kind of organization is absolutely critical when we talk about things like the reopening of these properties. 
So I certainly anticipate EBITDAR margins solidly above 30% across the enterprise as we recover. We would have seen that in the regions in the fourth quarter of 2020 had we not had the closures. And I'm confident that we can get there in Las Vegas as well as we reopen."

But -- and so we've proven to ourselves that the restructure, our ability to spread management across multiple properties in terms of senior leadership, not only is going to work, has worked. 
And so it's not overly complicated. I think the trick for us will be -- make sure that we're tight and we're disciplined on yielding volumes and making sure that we do labor the way we forecasted it and the way we've presumed that we've done historically in the last couple of months, as Jonathan mentioned before, the pandemic.

The good thing with our partnership is it's that. We gave our retail business. They gave their technology. And so by not owning our technology in most circumstances, there's a percentage that comes with that. We're not burdened with that, if you will. We're not paying a percentage of GGR or NGR, GGR on someone else's technology. So that's the first affirmative thing. 
When it comes to this initiative with Entain, obviously, America is the biggest thing in the world right now, and so we're all highly focused on it. And so our ability -- and as you know, it was rough out of the gate, but our ability over the last year, particularly led by Adam now, to get the teams engaged, to get the technology, to get the development effort, to get the product that we need and want for America of note because obviously, it was designed to speak to Premier League and other things, has been meaningful. Sure, ultimately, at some point, it could come into play. But for today, we don't pay the premium that others do.

Look, owning the owned technology piece is important for -- on 4 -- 4 pillars. The first, obviously, is cost. We're not paying away to a third party, the cost of it. But importantly, by owning our product, we can get to market quickly. We can be there on day 1 as we've demonstrated 5 times over -- in 87 days. I don't think anybody else has done that. So speed to market so that we can capitalize on that pent-up demand, that low CPA period that is vital and valuable. We can also -- staying with product, we can also respond quickly and I believe more quickly than anybody else to what customers are telling us, and we have a research group now and a research process, so that the process of ongoing improvements to product can be translated into what customers experience as quickly as possible. So that's a further benefit. 
Content is the other. We have in-house within our partnership within Entain, we have in-house studios, which allow us to bring unique content to market, which is both cheaper than buying -- obviously, we're not paying away a rev share. But it's the only place in town that you can play certain games. Our most popular iGaming product in New Jersey and now in Michigan is our in-house developed game. 
So -- and playing that forward, why is that relevant? Because we think that we can continue to develop, innovate and differentiate. And the last is the tools that are unique to our platform, the player management tools, the customer communication tools. All of those come together in a way that we think is strategically valuable. 
Now getting on to the -- that's all the good stuff. As regards the Super Bowl, look, Bill already mentioned the Super Bowl was a record-breaking day for BetMGM. Online bets 11x last year, online handled 17x last year. And our digital performance was robust throughout the U.S., which, as you probably read, wasn't the case for all operators and actually enhanced our competitive position. 
But Nevada was different. But -- and in Nevada only, we did have an outage, which resulted in the system being down during the game. But the system was restored shortly after and has been working as normal ever since. 
Now this is the important part. The issue that caused the outage was specific and was the unfortunate result of a human error and has been addressed. We know that the software works, which makes the downtime on Sunday, all the more disappointing, particularly given all the tremendous work that was done by our MGM colleagues in preparation for the event, which was just enormous. And it goes without saying that we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers, who I hope are looking forward to March Madness as much as we are. 
And I'll give it back to you, Bill."

Thank you, Robin, to make my early rise in Macau worthwhile. Actually, I think I want to correct one thing you stated. 
In Macau, actually, the cash flow has been all positive each month in the month -- in the fourth quarter. Actually, December had the best financial results. And also in terms of business recovery, December was the strongest. And of course, going into first quarter, we saw some of the momentum carried over in the first week of January. But after that, because of the COVID cases in China increased so there was some travel advisory put in place by the Chinese authorities at all different levels. We do anticipate that hotel occupancy will reach a level similar to October Golden Week last year for Chinese New Year period. And this will be a period for us to remain positive for month to -- for quarter-to-date period. 
And visitation to Macau is a function of COVID cases in Macau, COVID cases in China and also the availability of vaccination. I think that when you look at these variables, there is no reason to believe that the travel advisory will stay in place for a long period of time because I think Macau has been almost 250 days without any local cases. And in China, the first that we saw in December or early January has quickly diminished to about low double digits in the teens. And vaccination in Macau and also in China has been pushed out to more and more people. 
So I do believe that we have reason to be optimistic in the first quarter. Back to you, Bill."

We're excited to be speaking to you given the significant progress that we have observed in COVID trends, vaccination, consumer sentiment and state-by-state operating restrictions throughout",1790,"Thank you, Jim, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. We're excited to be speaking to you given the significant progress that we have observed in COVID trends, vaccination, consumer sentiment and state-by-state operating restrictions throughout the quarter. Since we last spoke in mid-February, our domestic business has improved significantly, and the work we've done has allowed us to maximize the pace of our recovery while positioning us for long-term sustainable growth. As business trends improved, we remain focused on our long-term vision to be the premier gaming entertainment company in the world. Our strategy for achieving this vision centers on 4 strategic focus areas. First, investing in people and planet, providing fun and inspiring experiences for our guests, delivering operational excellence at every level and allocating our capital to drive the highest return for our shareholders. 
I thought it might be helpful to provide an update on each of these focus areas before turning to the details of our first quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the year. Our people and planet strategy is part of everything this company does. At the pinnacle of this strategy is the investment in our amazing people, reflecting a past year to say that's been tough would simply be an understatement. But throughout the year, our employees have been the one consistent bright spot across the organization. I am humbled and of their dedication, their hard work and resilience in the face of unprecedented uncertainty. That is why I'm so passionate about the investment in them. 
We got to this because of their consistent commitment to this company and ultimately, our guests. As we continue to bring employees back across the U.S. to meet heightened levels of demand, we, of course, prioritize their health and safety. To that end, we've dedicated significant resources to getting our people vaccinated. We recently opened our on-site vaccination clinics here in Las Vegas as well as our regional properties for not only our employees, but also their families as well as our entertainment partners who work at our properties. 
As the largest private employer in Nevada, these efforts are far reaching in the local community, and I believe we are doing more than our part to help combat the virus with the ultimate goal of getting our city back open 100% by June 1. I'm also proud to share what our team has been able to accomplish to solidify MGM Resorts as a leader in environmental sustainability. In just a few short months, we will flip the switch on MGM Resorts mega solar array. This 100-megawatt solar at full production will provide up to 90% of total daytime electricity needs for all of our Las Vegas Strip representing over 65 million square feet of buildings. 
Our second focus area is all about providing funding and inspiring experiences for our guests. To date, we have opened 8 shows across our portfolio, adhering to current health and safety restrictions. We continue to work with our local leaders to safely bring large-scale events back both in Las Vegas and our regional properties starting in early summer. In July, T-Mobile Arena is set to host the McGregor fight -- McGregor UFC Fight and you can't get tickets for this event. We sold 20,000 tickets in 22 minutes. This is just one of the many examples of the clear demand for entertainment, and we're excited to see a path to delivering these differentiating offerings to our customers. 
It's important to note, however, that we've not just focused on what experiences we provide, we've also focused on how to provide them, delivering the highest quality guest service through a culture of that remains deeply embedded in our values. We continue to empower our employees to do what they do best, providing world-class service to all of our guests. 
Turning to operational excellence. We refined our operating model in late 2019, increasing of control and simplifying organizational to accelerate decision-making, bringing us closer to the guest and ultimately reducing costs. Driven in part by these efforts, our first quarter domestic margins grew significantly over the fourth quarter. And we are confident that these sustained changes will enable us to deliver a full target of $450 million of cost savings when business demands returned to 2019 levels. 
And finally, we are disciplined allocators of capital, always driven by the goal of creating value for our shareholders. Our targeted growth opportunities align with our long-term vision. We, along with our partners in continue to invest in BetMGM as it grows its leadership position in U.S. sports betting and iGaming. I hope you all listened in on our Investor Day last week. We're investing in our digital journey to drive deeper customer loyalty and engagement over time. And with recent developments in New York, we look forward to working with the legislature on a potential path for a full-scale casino license in Empire City. 
With that, I'll now provide some high-level comments on our results and future business outlook and then let Jonathan -- and then Jonathan will discuss the first quarter in more detail. In Las Vegas and across our regional properties, our initial recovery has been strong. It's been great to see Las Vegas come alive again to the vibrant destination that we've all come to know and enjoy. Our gross bookings were one of the best is in the company's history, clearly backed by pent-up leisure and casino demand. And our operating performance naturally followed the broader demand trend lines and adjusted property EBITDAR was heavily driven by the back half of the quarter. Booking trends are bound to normalize over time as we continue to fill out the resorts in future periods. But good news is we put up a large enough base to start strategically yielding our business, especially now on the weekends. 
As we look ahead, we expect robust leisure demand throughout the spring and summer months with hotel occupancies in the 90% range on the weekends. Weekdays will increasingly be driven by meetings and conventions, and our group business remains solid in the back half of this year. With more clarity around the values gathering guidelines, we're actively working to secure more in the for the business and to partially offset the anticipated levels of wash and attendance per group. Our differentiated Convene with Confidence program designed to safely accommodate events large and small, has received great feedback from our clients. With the larger groups expected to return at scale in '22, our business in '22 and '23 is on pace with pre-COVID levels. 
While our high-end international casino business will still depend on travel restrictions, our domestic casino demand, which we've successfully levered through the crisis remains extremely healthy. We're also proactively engaging more with our in 50-plus age demographic, and we've seen increased receptivity to travel from that group. Our regional properties delivered strong results in the first quarter despite some inclement weather aided by easing state-wide restrictions. It's been encouraging to see again our rated 50-plus and higher-value players begin to return as well with the strength, particularly in And in March, for our -- 50 to 64 age segment was close to that of 2019 levels, and we saw a noticeable improvement in our 65-plus age segment as well. These trends are also continuing now into April. 
I'm especially pleased with our regional team's persistent ability to drive operational efficiencies, resulting in our first quarter regional adjusted property EBITDAR surpassing that of 2019 despite lower revenues. In fact, Our regional EBITDAR and margins this quarter were both all-time first quarter records. As state-wide restrictions ease, further and entertainment alternatives begin to expand consumer options, we will monitor the broader top line environment. But assuming COVID trends remain stable, we are confident through our cost discipline efforts and resulting structural margin gains, we can sustain full EBITDA recovery this year. 
I'd like to share some thoughts now on Macau. While market-wide GGR in the first quarter improved sequentially compared to the fourth quarter, Macau's business volumes remain well below pre-COVID levels. MGM China once again outperformed the market pace of recovery. Our GGR recovered approximately 40% of prepandemic fourth quarter 2019 levels compared to the market's overall recovery of 33%. It is evident that our strength in premium mass is positioning us well as the market gradually the corner. The rate of Macau recovery, we believe, will remain heavily depend on broader sentiment as well as pace of vaccination rollouts throughout the region, which would ultimately lead to the ease travel restrictions.  testing requirements and other bottlenecks currently impact this marketplace. 
The opening of the Macau Hong Kong border is also another important variable in Macau's recovery. I am, however, confident Macau's longer-term growth prospects and believe our investment will ultimately bear much fruit. We expect construction of the additional suites in the South Tower of MGM Cotai that could be complete in the third quarter of this year. We are also remodeling our MGM Macau villas and the gaming space Level 35. And at both properties, we are adding food and beverage options, focusing on our gaming floors. 
We're also organizing theme property attractions to drive visitation. And over time, we have the ability to build out another hotel tower at MGM Cotai, along with new full entertainment assets to help diversify our overall offerings in the destination. And finally, last week, at the Investor Day, BetMGM executive team provided extensive color on its business, and we are incredibly excited about its trajectory in the sports betting and iGaming market. 
Today, we see this space as a 3-horse race, where BetMGM offers unique and unparalleled online and off-line experiences. Given the positive momentum to date that MGM now expects its revenues from operations to reach over $1 billion in 2022. It also is now targeting its long-term U.S. market share to be between 20% and 25% range and long-term EBITDA margins in the 30% to 35% range. 
From a BetMGM's key competitive advantage is its ability to lever MGM's destinations, our broad offerings and our M life loyalty program as efficient and affect customer acquisition and retention tools. MGM also benefited from this relationship not only our new customers being introduced to M life, but through BetMGM, we're also reigniting relationships with customers that had gone In the first quarter, 10% of BetMGM's new players came from MGM and 44% of the new M Life sign-ups have come from BetMGM. 
Putting this tether, we see significant value and and that's why both partners remain committed to ensuing and ensuring BetMGM's leadership in this space. With that, I'll turn it over to Jonathan to discuss our first quarter in more detail. Jonathan?"

Our consolidated first quarter 2021 revenues were $1.6 billion, better than our fourth quarter's $1.5 billion, and our net loss attributable to MGM Resorts was $332 million. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDAR improved sequentially to $218 million, heavily driven by our domestic operations. 
Our Las Vegas Strip net revenues in the first quarter were $545 million, a 14% increase from the fourth quarter. Adjusted property EBITDAR was $108 million, double that of the fourth quarter, and our margins sequentially improved 860 basis points to 20%, driven by the significant pickup in leisure and casino demand, coupled with cost control and the operating leverage inherent in our business. had a fairly insignificant impact this quarter. 
Our first quarter Strip occupancy was 46% compared to 38% in the fourth quarter. With each month improving through the quarter, we exited the first quarter with March occupancy at 62%. Weekends were at 85 and week days were at 52 due to the lack of group business midweek. Occupancy has continued to grow in April. Our Las Vegas Strip occupancy through last weekend was approximately 73%. 
Our first quarter regional net revenues increased 19% sequentially to $711 million from the fourth quarter. Adjusted property EBITDAR increased 53% over the fourth quarter as well to $242 million. Our first quarter regional margins grew sequentially by of 738 basis points to about 34%. Our domestic margin growth is a testament to all of the great work that our teams have put into maximizing the effectiveness of our operating model and rethink how we run our business. This ranges from marketing reinvestment to procurement, from energy utilization to management. And the breadth of our efforts gives me confidence that we'll deliver on $450 million of domestic cost savings which we previously identified. 
Our sports betting and iGaming venture, BetMGM raises the bar every quarter. BetMGM delivered strong results in the first quarter, driven by market share gains in existing markets as well as successful entries into new ones, including Iowa, Michigan and Virginia. In February, BetMGM's market share was 22% in its active markets. It is the clear #1 U.S. iGaming operator. Its leadership in New Jersey strengthened last month as BetMGM had its best iGaming month ever in the Garden State with over 30% market share. 
It has also solidified its position as the top 3 operator in U.S. online sports betting. We estimate, based on February results that BetMGM has overtaken the #2 position in overall U.S. sports betting and iGaming. This growth led to $163 million of net revenues associated with BetMGM operations in the first quarter. These are remarkable results considering the $178 million of net revenues from operations it delivered in all of 2020. 
Given the strong momentum in the early stage of development in a number of markets, we expect BetMGM to require $450 million of capital this year, half of which would be funded by MGM Resorts. In the first quarter, our share of BetMGM's losses amounted to $59 million, which is reported as part of the unconsolidated affiliates line of our adjusted EBITDAR calculation. MGM China's first quarter revenues were $296 million, down 3% sequentially from the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted property EBITDAR of $5 million was also down sequentially from $41 million in the fourth quarter. Much of this decline was driven by the $23 million bonus accrual reversal last quarter, a benefit to earnings, which we discussed during our call back in February. In addition, our first quarter mass table games was lower than that of the fourth quarter, which had a negative impact on our margins. Still, due to the a exogenous reasons Bill described earlier in the call, the demand environment remains challenging in Macau. 
Our first quarter corporate expense, excluding share-based compensation, was $67 million, a 26% decrease year-over-year and a 14% decrease sequentially from the fourth quarter. Now we expect that our quarterly net corporate expense will run higher going forward as our business volumes continue to improve, and we ramp our investments in IT, our digital offerings and our IR efforts in Japan. 
I'll conclude with a few thoughts on liquidity and capital allocation. Throughout the last year, our liquidity position served as a stable foundation from which to navigate the crisis. March was a bit of an inflection point for our company as our domestic operations were roughly cash flow neutral during the month. Now with an improving backdrop in our core domestic business and a solid path to sustain positive free cash flow, we have progressively begun to shift our posture from capital preservation to capital allocation. 
This quarter, we resumed our program of capital returns to shareholders. In the first quarter, MGM repurchased 3.15 million shares for $119 million and we've purchased an additional 1.41 million shares for $55 million in the second quarter through yesterday. We will take a disciplined and programmatic approach to share purchases for the balance of the year. Bill described our vision to be the world's premier gaming and entertainment company. And we allocate capital and further into that vision in ways that are remunerative to shareholders. 
This quarter, we caused MGP $37.1 million of our MGP OP units for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion, thus reducing our ownership stake in MGP to 42% and releasing capital for growth investments or return to shareholders. Our long-term approach to allocating our capital will be as follows: First, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity. We did this in 2020, and it served our shareholders well. Second, we'll return cash to shareholders, which we've already begun to do in the first quarter and this quarter through share repurchases. And third, when assessing potential growth opportunities, we'll invest where we have clear advantages and we'll exercise prudence in measuring prospective returns for our shareholders. 
To close, I see meaningful upside in our current equity value as we innovate and pursue accretive investments over time. BetMGM is one element of this, but there are others. We will build the value of our brands, improve the quality of our customer interactions and invest in more sophisticated marketing interventions, all toward creating a more valuable offering for our guests, which will translate into market growth for MGM. Much of this customer value will be delivered digitally and in so doing, will require new pools of talent for the company in investment in technologies. These are resourced in our current plan, and I look forward to sharing details with you on future calls regarding the payoffs from these investments. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks."

I mean just when thinking about margins when you consider where we were in January where we had a couple of our big businesses here in Las Vegas closed during the midweek, we changed those practices with the beginning of March with demand growing. And so really when -- in Las Vegas, when we had that level of demand against those fixed costs and then even started being able to yield the rooms in Las Vegas, it really had a pretty dramatic impact on the company's earnings generation. In the regional markets that change through the quarter was not as pronounced, but we could see relaxing operating restrictions in many of those markets as we got into March as well as just overall aggregate demand. So we did want to -- as it relates to the occupancy was coming out of March, we exited a lot higher than we started in March, and that's continued through April."

We've got to monitor the 3 feet. But all things being equal, that opens it up dramatically. And then come June 1st, all things being equal, and we can demonstrate that the county has gotten 60% of its people vaccinated, all of the restrictions go away. And so when you talk about and you hear about the things we talked about the entertainment, the pent-up demand has been incredible. We had a show go on sale on Monday. It sold out in 1 day. You heard my UFC story. We had a DJ for next year a baby bunny or what  a bad bunny -- 45,000 people waiting in queue to buy tickets.

And I think it's a very good question. It's one we're studying quite a lot. We are right now operating these businesses with demand in the past 30, 45 days, particularly in Las Vegas, primarily against gaming and hotel revenue streams and cost structures. What -- the parts of the business, which -- where the capacity has not yet grown like it has in the hotel and the casino floors is in some of the profitable, but lower-margin businesses, food and beverage, particularly things like entertainment and even some of the services that are really important and can be margin impacting like valet parking and the like. So we're going to see those costs come back. They will be -- we expect them to be EBITDA accretive, but potentially margin dilutive. But it's important because they add to the full suite of offerings that we provide. So the flow-through really has been strong because in some ways, these businesses in Las Vegas have been presenting the kind of almost the kind of revenue profile that many of our regional businesses did. So I think that there is a -- I'm firmly of the belief that these businesses can, over the long term, both the regional and the Las Vegas businesses, deliver EBITDA margins over 30%. We had regional businesses in the first quarter that delivered margins everywhere from 25% to 50% for the quarter. So we certainly intend on securing the gains that we've made in the cost structure, but there will be some give back as we add to the full level of amenities that we can provide."

And so we stand as the lone entrant in that process starting in July.  it will be then determined by the national government in June in the following year, where the 3 locations will be anointed and that's to be determined, obviously at that -- when it happens. You all know that Japan last couple of weeks back into lockdown. So it's tenuous in some respects, but we are still very focused on it. We intend to hopefully apply in July, if, in fact, that happens. New York is obviously more immediate.  is simple, particularly there in the context of understanding what was done. As of now, we have until June 10 until the legislature closes. We were hoping to keep it in the governor's budget. It didn't make it. But we have a good reason to believe. I was literally there on Monday with some of our team talking to legislators at all about the process. And we hope to get from an RFI to ultimately an RFP process that would happen later this year. We remain optimistic. We like, obviously, our position there, to tell exactly what we might do.

We're excited to be speaking to you given the significant progress that we have observed in COVID trends, vaccination, consumer sentiment and state-by-state operating restrictions throughout the quarter. Since we last spoke in mid-February, our domestic business has improved significantly, and the work we have done has allowed us to maximize the pace of our recovery while positioning us for long-term sustainable growth.
As business trends improved, we remain focused on our long-term vision to be the premier gaming entertainment company in the world. Our strategy for achieving this vision centers on 4 strategic focus areas. First, investing in people and planet, providing fun and inspiring experiences for our guests, delivering operational excellence at every level and allocating our capital to drive the highest return for our shareholders. I thought it might be helpful to provide an update on each of these focus areas before turning to the details of our first quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the year.
Our people and planet strategy is part of everything this company does. At the pinnacle of this strategy is the investment in our amazing people, reflecting on the past year to say it has been tough would simply be an understatement. But throughout the year, our employees have been the one consistent bright spot across the organization. I am humbled and in awe of their dedication, their hard work and resilience in the face of unprecedented uncertainty. That is why I'm so passionate about the investment in them. We got to this because of their consistent commitment to this company and ultimately, our guests.
As we continue to bring employees back across the U.S. to meet heightened levels of demand, we, of course, prioritize their health and safety. To that end, we've dedicated significant resources to getting our people vaccinated. We recently opened our on-site vaccination clinics here in Las Vegas as well as our regional properties for not only our employees, but also their families as well as our entertainment and partners who work at our properties.
As the largest private employer in Nevada, these efforts are far reaching in the local community, and I believe we are doing more than our part to help combat the virus with the ultimate goal of getting our city back open 100% by June 1. I'm also proud to share what our team has been able to accomplish to solidify MGM Resorts as a leader in environmental sustainability. In just a few short months, we will flip the switch on MGM Resorts' Mega Solar Array. This 100-megawatt solar array at full production will provide up to 90% of total daytime electricity needs for all of our Las Vegas Strip properties, representing over 65 million square feet of buildings.
Our second focus area is all about providing fun and inspiring experiences for our guests. To date, we have opened 8 shows across our portfolio, adhering to current health and safety restrictions. We continue to work with our local leaders to safely bring large-scale events back, both in Las Vegas and our regional properties, starting in early summer. In July, T-Mobile Arena is set to host the McGregor fight -- McGregor UFC Fight and you can't get tickets for this event. We sold 20,000 tickets in 22 minutes. This is just one of the many examples of the clear demand for entertainment, and we're excited to see a path to delivering these differentiating offerings to our customers.
It's important to note, however, that we've not just focused on what experiences we provide, we've also focused on how to provide them, delivering the highest quality guest service through a culture of yes is an attribute that remains deeply embedded in our values. We continue to empower our employees to do what they do best, providing world-class service to all of our guests.
Turning to operational excellence. We refined our operating model in late 2019, increasing spans of control and simplifying organizational layers to accelerate decision-making, bringing us closer to the guest and ultimately, reducing costs. Driven in part by these efforts, our first quarter domestic margins grew significantly over the fourth quarter. And we are confident that these sustained changes will enable us to deliver a full target of $450 million of cost savings when business demands return to 2019 levels.
And finally, we are disciplined allocators of capital, always driven by the goal of creating value for our shareholders. Our targeted growth opportunities align with our long-term vision. We, along with our partners, Entain, continue to invest in BetMGM as it grows its leadership position in U.S. sports betting and iGaming. I hope you all listened in on our Investor Day last week. We're investing in our digital journey to drive deeper customer loyalty and engagement over time. And with recent developments in New York, we look forward to working with the legislature on a potential path for a full-scale casino license at Empire City.
With that, I'll now provide some high-level comments on our results and future business outlook and then let Jonathan -- and then Jonathan will discuss the first quarter in more detail.
In Las Vegas and across our regional properties, our initial recovery has been strong. It's been great to see Las Vegas come alive again to the vibrant destination that we've all come to know and enjoy. Our gross bookings in March were one of the best months in the company's history, clearly backed by pent-up leisure and casino demand. And our operating performance naturally followed the broader demand trend lines, and adjusted property EBITDAR was heavily driven by the back half of the quarter.
Booking trends are bound to normalize over time as we continue to fill out the resorts in future periods. But good news is we've built up a large-enough base to start strategically yielding our business, especially now on the weekends.
As we look ahead, we expect robust leisure demand throughout the spring and summer months with hotel occupancies in the 90% range on the weekends. Weekdays will increasingly be driven by meetings and conventions, and our group business remains solid in the back half of this year. With more clarity around Nevada's gathering guidelines, we're actively working to secure more in-the-year, for-the-year business and to partially offset the anticipated levels of wash in attendance per group.
Our differentiated Convene with Confidence program, designed to safely accommodate events large and small, has received great feedback from our clients. With the larger groups expected to return at scale in '22, our business in '22 and '23 is on pace with pre-COVID levels.
While our high-end international casino business will still depend on travel restrictions, our domestic casino demand, which we've successfully levered through the crisis, remains extremely healthy. We're also proactively engaging more with our fly-in and 50-plus age demographic, and we've seen increased receptivity to travel from that group.
Our regional properties delivered strong results in the first quarter despite some inclement weather aided by easing state-wide restrictions. It's been encouraging to see, again, our rated 50-plus and higher-value players begin to return as well with the strength particularly in slots and in March, we did see -- our 50- to 64-age segment was close to that of 2019 levels, and we saw a noticeable improvement in our 65-plus age segment as well. These trends are also continuing now into April.
I'm especially pleased with our regional team's persistent ability to drive operational efficiencies, resulting in our first quarter regional adjusted property EBITDAR surpassing that of 2019 despite lower revenues. In fact, our regional EBITDAR and margins this quarter were both all-time first quarter records. As state-wide restrictions ease further and entertainment alternatives begin to expand consumer options, we will monitor the broader top line environment. But assuming COVID trends remain stable, we are confident, through our cost discipline efforts and resulting structural margin gains, we can sustain full EBITDA recovery this year.
I'd like to share some thoughts now on Macau. While market-wide GGR in the first quarter improved sequentially compared to the fourth quarter, Macau's business volumes remain well below pre-COVID levels. MGM China once again outperformed the market pace of recovery. Our quarter GGR recovered approximately 40% of pre-pandemic fourth quarter 2019 levels compared to the market's overall recovery of 33%. It is evident that our strength in premium mass is positioning us well as the market gradually turns the corner. The rate of Macau's recovery, we believe, will remain heavily dependent on broader sentiment as well as the pace of vaccination rollouts throughout the region, which would ultimately lead to the easing of travel restrictions. Nucleic acid testing requirements and other bottlenecks currently impact this marketplace.
The opening of the Macau-Hong Kong border is also another important variable in Macau's recovery. I am, however, confident Macau's longer-term growth prospects and believe our investment will ultimately bear much fruit. We expect construction of the additional suites in the South Tower of MGM Cotai to be complete in the third quarter of this year. We are also remodeling our MGM Macau villas and the gaming space on Level 35. And at both properties, we are adding food and beverage options focusing on our gaming floors.
We're also organizing theme property attractions to drive visitation. And over time, we have the ability to build out another hotel tower at MGM Cotai, along with meaningful entertainment assets, to help diversify our overall offerings in the destination. 
And finally, last week, at the Investor Day, BetMGM executive team provided extensive color on its business, and we are incredibly excited about its trajectory in the sports betting and iGaming markets. Today, we see this space as a 3-horse race where BetMGM offers unique and unparalleled online and off-line experiences. Given the positive momentum to date, that MGM now expects its revenues from operations to reach over $1 billion in 2022. It also is now targeting its long-term U.S. market share to be between 20% and 25% range and long-term EBITDA margins in the 30% to 35% range.
One of BetMGM's key competitive advantages is its ability to lever MGM's destinations, our broad-based offerings and our M life loyalty program as efficient and affect customer acquisition and retention tools. MGM also benefited from its relationship not only our new customers being introduced to M life, but through BetMGM, we're also reigniting relationships with customers that had gone dormant.
In the first quarter, 10% of BetMGM's new players came from MGM, and 44% of the new M Life sign-ups have come from BetMGM. Putting this together, we see significant value in this opportunity over time, and that's why both partners remain committed to ensuing and ensuring BetMGM's leadership in this space.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jonathan to discuss our first quarter in more detail. Jonathan?"

Our consolidated first quarter 2021 revenues were $1.6 billion, better than our fourth quarter's $1.5 billion, and our net loss attributable to MGM Resorts was $332 million. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDAR improved sequentially to $218 million, heavily driven by our domestic operations.
Our Las Vegas Strip net revenues in the first quarter were $545 million, a 14% increase from the fourth quarter. Adjusted property EBITDAR was $108 million, double that of the fourth quarter, and our margins sequentially improved 860 basis points to 20%, driven by the significant pickup in leisure and casino demand, coupled with cost control and the operating leverage inherent in our business. Hold had a fairly insignificant impact this quarter.
Our first quarter Strip occupancy was 46% compared to 38% in the fourth quarter. With each month improving through the quarter, we exited the first quarter with March occupancy at 62%. Weekends were at 85% and week days were at 52% due to the lack of group business midweek. Occupancy has continued to grow in April. Our Las Vegas Strip occupancy through last weekend was approximately 73%.
Our first quarter regional net revenues increased 19% sequentially to $711 million from the fourth quarter. Adjusted property EBITDAR increased 53% over the fourth quarter as well to $242 million. Our first quarter regional margins grew sequentially by of 738 basis points to about 34%. Our domestic margin growth is a testament to all of the great work that our teams have put into maximizing the effectiveness of our operating model and rethink how we run our business. This ranges from marketing reinvestment to procurement, from energy utilization to labor management. And the breadth of our efforts gives me confidence that we'll deliver on the $450 million of domestic cost savings which we previously identified.
Our sports betting and iGaming venture, BetMGM, raises the bar every quarter. BetMGM delivered strong results in the first quarter, driven by market share gains in existing markets as well as successful entries into new ones, including Iowa, Michigan and Virginia. In February, BetMGM's market share was 22% in its active markets. It is the clear #1 U.S. iGaming operator. Its leadership in New Jersey strengthened last month as BetMGM had its best iGaming month ever in the Garden State with over 30% market share.
It has also solidified its position as a top 3 operator in U.S. online sports betting. We estimate, based on February results, that BetMGM has overtaken the #2 position in overall U.S. sports betting and iGaming. This growth led to $163 million of net revenues associated with BetMGM operations in the first quarter. These are remarkable results considering the $178 million of net revenues from operations it delivered in all of 2020.
Given the strong momentum in the early stage of development in a number of their key markets, we expect BetMGM to require $450 million of capital this year, half of which would be funded by MGM Resorts. In the first quarter, our share of BetMGM's losses amounted to $59 million, which is reported as part of the unconsolidated affiliates line of our adjusted EBITDAR calculation.
MGM China's first quarter revenues were $296 million, down 3% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Adjusted property EBITDAR of $5 million was also down sequentially from $41 million in the fourth quarter. Much of this decline was driven by the $23 million bonus accrual reversal last quarter, a benefit to earnings, which we discussed during our call back in February. In addition, our first quarter mass table games hold was lower than that of the fourth quarter, which had a negative impact on our margins. Still, due to the largely exogenous reasons Bill described earlier in the call, the demand environment remains challenging in Macau.
Our first quarter corporate expense, excluding share-based compensation, was $67 million, a 26% decrease year-over-year and a 14% decrease sequentially from the fourth quarter. Now we expect that our quarterly net corporate expense will run higher going forward as our business volumes continue to improve and we ramp our investments in IT, our digital offerings and our IR efforts in Japan.
I'll conclude with a few thoughts on liquidity and capital allocation. Throughout the last year, our liquidity position served as a stable foundation from which to navigate the crisis. March was a bit of an inflection point for our company as our domestic operations were roughly cash flow neutral during the month. Now with an improving backdrop in our core domestic business and a solid path to sustain positive free cash flow, we have progressively begun to shift our posture from capital preservation to capital allocation.
This quarter, we resumed our program of capital returns to shareholders. In the first quarter, MGM repurchased 3.15 million shares for $119 million and we've purchased an additional 1.41 million shares for $55 million in the second quarter through yesterday. We will take a disciplined and programmatic approach to share purchases for the balance of the year.
Bill described our vision to be the world's premier gaming and entertainment company. And we allocate capital and further into that vision in ways that are remunerative to shareholders. This quarter, we caused MGP to redeem 37.1 million of our MGP OP units for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion, thus, reducing our ownership stake in MGP to 42% and releasing capital for growth investments or return to shareholders.
Our long-term approach to allocating our capital will be as follows: First, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity. We did this in 2020, and it served our shareholders well. Second, we'll return cash to shareholders, which we've already begun to do in the first quarter and this quarter through share repurchases. And third, when assessing potential growth opportunities, we'll invest where we have clear advantages and we'll exercise prudence in measuring prospective returns for our shareholders.
To close, I see meaningful upside in our current equity value as we innovate and pursue accretive investments over time. BetMGM is one element of this, but there are others. We will build the value of our brands, improve the quality of our customer interactions and invest in more sophisticated marketing interventions, all toward creating a more valuable offering for our guests, which will translate into market growth for MGM. Much of this customer value will be delivered digitally and in so doing, will require new pools of talent for the company and investment in technologies. These are resourced in our current plan, and I look forward to sharing details with you on future calls regarding the payoffs from these investments.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks."

I mean just when thinking about the margins, when you consider where we were in January where we had a couple of our big businesses here in Las Vegas closed during the midweek, we changed those practices right at the beginning of March with demand growing. And so really when -- in Las Vegas, when we had that level of demand against those fixed costs and then even started being able to yield the rooms in Las Vegas, it really had a pretty dramatic impact on the company's earnings generation.
In the regional markets, the change through the quarter was not as pronounced, but we did see relaxing operating restrictions in many of those markets as we got into March as well as just overall aggregate demand. So we did want to -- as it relates to the occupancy numbers coming out of March, we exited a lot higher than we started March, and that's continued through April."

I mean the good news for us is come May 1, the county is going to relinquish here in Las Vegas the requirements so that people now can be 3 feet apart and no masks and that we can go to 80% occupancy. So it unleashes restaurants. Most importantly, one of our biggest restrictions has been the pools. At Mandalay, we had restricted occupancy late March through spring break and into April because of the 6-foot requirement, the mask requirement. But come Saturday, that basically in those environments goes away. We've got to monitor the 3 feet. But all things being equal, that opens it up dramatically.
And then come June 1, all things being equal, and we can demonstrate that the county has gotten 60% of its people vaccinated, all of the restrictions go away. And so when you talk about and you hear about the things we talked about the entertainment, the pent-up demand has been incredible. We had a Dave Chappelle show go on sale on Monday. It sold out in 1 day. You heard my UFC story. We had a DJ for next year, a baby bunny or whatever that is -- Bad Bunny -- there's so much I know about baby bunny, but Bad Bunny, 45,000 people waiting in queue to buy tickets.

The back half of the year, we have some pretty decent-sized groups at Mandalay Bay. And the current understanding is some groups are coming in a little lower than normal and some may be coming a little higher. But until we have some normalcy there, I think we'll have a challenge of hitting that 90%. I think the encouraging news, CES just announced they'll be back in January.

And I think it's a very good question. It's one we've been studying quite a lot. We are right now operating these businesses with demand in the past 30, 45 days, particularly in Las Vegas, primarily against gaming and hotel revenue streams and cost structures. What -- the parts of the business, which -- where the capacity has not yet grown like it has in the hotel and the casino floor is in some of the profitable but lower-margin businesses, food and beverage, particularly things like entertainment and even some of the services that are really important and can be margin-impacting like valet parking and the like.
So we're going to see those costs come back. They will be -- we expect them to be EBITDA-accretive but potentially margin dilutive. But it's important because they add to the full suite of offerings that we provide. So the flow-through really has been strong because in some ways, these businesses in Las Vegas have been presenting the kind of -- almost the kind of revenue profile that many of our regional businesses did.
So I think that there is a -- I'm firmly of the belief that these businesses can, over the long term, both the regional and the Las Vegas businesses, deliver EBITDA margins over 30%. We had regional businesses in the first quarter that delivered margins everywhere from 25% to 50% for the quarter. So we certainly intend on securing the gains that we've made in the cost structure, but there will be some give back as we add to the full level of amenities that we can provide."

Just to give you some flavor, right now, the weekend pricing compared to last year, it's up over $10 to $15.

The other -- the international problem part of it was about simply getting liquidity out of the market and getting it here back to Las Vegas. Part of it was the market itself, and it was falling off slightly, particularly the China-based business. That will depend more on Macau than anything else and how it recovers, how we reestablish our pipeline there.
It's going to be interesting what happens in '22. Genting will come into the market, but Sands will presumably get out of the market, at least with the direct connectivity to Macau and Singapore. And so there's a new competitor and potentially somebody falling out over time. It's probably a net neutral. It just really gets down to liquidity and the ability of tourists from China and gamers from China getting cash out and into Macau and potentially here to Las Vegas. And so I think you're thinking about it the right way, though. We got pretty beaten up in '19 there."

Believe it will be then determined by the national government in June in the following year, where the 3 locations will be anointed and that's to be determined, obviously, at that -- when it happens. You all know that Japan, the last couple of weeks, are back into lockdown. So it's tenuous in some respects, but we are still very focused on it.

New York is obviously more immediate. Nothing is simple, particularly, there in the context of understanding what was done. As of now, we have until June 10 until the legislature closes.

Over the past few months, we've had the honor and the privilege of welcoming back guests back to our properties at a remarkable pace, both in Las Vegas and our regional markets. It's been rewarding to see our guests taking in all the world-class gaming and entertainment experiences that only MGM Resorts can provide, and it's been equally gratifying to witness the tremendous effort of our employees delivering these experiences. We have an amazing team of people here at MGM Resorts, the best in the business. And so I'd like to take this time to thank them today for their hard work and dedication to our company and our guests, especially over the last 18 months. I can't say enough how critically important they have been, will continue to be to our success as we carry out our vision to be the world's premier gaming and entertainment company.
In fact, investing in our people and our planet is the foundation upon which we've built our strategic plan for the company's long-term vision. Our strategic plan consists of the following 4 priorities: investing in our people and our planet, providing unique experiences for our guests by leveraging data-driven customer insights and digital capabilities, delivering operational excellence at every level, and allocating our capital responsibly to drive the highest returns for our shareholders. In driving our vision, we have long discussed our goals of simplifying our corporate structure and monetizing our real estate premium valuations to become asset light. We've been busy on this front. And over the past 90 days, we've meaningfully advanced this strategy.
In May, we announced an agreement to sell and leaseback MGM Springfield, underlying real estate to MGM Growth Properties. We followed that news in July with an agreement to purchase Infinity World's 50% interest in CityCenter and then to subsequently sell and lease back the underlying real estate to Blackstone at an unprecedented cap rate for gaming asset. And we're very excited to become the full owners of RA Embeda operations soon. 
I'd also like to take this time to thank Bill Grounds from Infinity World, who has on the heels of this transaction stepped down from MGM's Board after serving us since 2013. He's been a great partner for many years, and we wish him the very best in the future. 
And finally, as you know, we have spent significant time and effort working on the best solutions for our stated goal of deconsolidating MGP. And this morning, we were pleased to announce a comprehensive transaction with VICI and MGP to monetize the majority of our operating partnership units for approximately $4.4 billion in cash at a multiple that's among the strongest in all gaming real estate transactions to date. This is a great win for MGM and MGP, and we're excited by our new long-term partnership with VICI.
Again, I'm incredibly proud of our finance operating and legal teams, who have been accomplishing an astonishing amount in a short order to get these transactions across the finish line. 
Combining these transactions grant us greater financial flexibility by the means of $11.6 billion in domestic liquidity and importantly, they allow us to intensify our focus on maximizing growth in our core business and pursuing opportunities that align to our long-term vision.
In terms of such opportunities, we remain committed to our sports betting and iGaming joint venture that BetMGM, which continues to impress, having expanded its net revenues and its leadership position in the second quarter, BetMGM is the #2 operator in the space nationwide and in the second quarter, it commended commented 24% share of its live markets. BetMGM remains a clear leader in iGaming, having reached a 30% market share in the second quarter, and we also continue to see the benefits of customer acquisition cross pollinization between MGM and BetMGM.
In the second quarter, 15% of BetMGM's new players came from MGM and 31% of MGM -- M Life's sign-ups came from BetMGM. We'll strategically invest in our digital capabilities and customer growth strategies, driving innovation and a deeper customer loyalty throughout technology, led customer-centric experiences, products and services. These efforts will be led by Talok Mandoti, who we recently hired our Chief Strategy, Innovation and Technology Officer. is a visionary, a results driven leader who has spent several decades of experience at both Disney and American Express, where he led similar initiatives. Tlac will also be leading our relationship with BetMGM joining its Board of Directors. He's another fantastic addition to our senior leadership team and complementary to the deep bench we've now built with recent additions of Jonathan as CFO; and Jody Choper as our Chief People Inclusion and Sustainability Officer, excuse me. I have no doubt that will be invaluable to the company's future. 
We'll also increase our diversification into Asia through the footprint expansion in Macau and the integrated resort opportunity in Japan. As a matter of fact, we officially submitted our RFP as a sole bidder for the Osaka license a couple of weeks ago. It starts the clock on a 3-month review process. We and our local partners, ORIX, remain excited by the opportunity, which we expect will give attractive returns. We look forward to Osaka reviewing our proposal, and hopefully, I'm confident, we'll ultimately be named Osaka's Designee operator early this fall. 
And lastly, we continue to study key regional markets of significance, including commercial gaming license at Empire City in New York. 
Before I turn it over to Jonathan to delve into our second quarter results, I'd like to say a few words on our current business trends and our future outlook. We reported a great second quarter at our domestic properties, driven by pent-up consumer demand and high domestic casino spend as well as our ability to yield our business and maintain our cost discipline efforts. In fact, we delivered all-time record margins in both Las Vegas and regional segments as well as all-time record EBITDA quarters at our regional properties. Further, 11 of our 17 domestic properties had all-time record quarters and slot gross win. And that momentum continued into July with another record month that exceeded June. 
I can't tell you enough under these circumstances, how pleased and proud I am of our entire team. We have righted the ship, and we're going full steam ahead. 
In Las Vegas, our weekend volumes are back to normal, driven by leisure and domestic casino customers with ADR is now surpassing 2019 levels. The weekday while improving continued to lag the weekends in the second quarter due to lower level of group business. That being said, June kicked off a series of citywide events coming to town such as World Of Concrete and Surfaces, and we anticipate a return of groups here in the third and fourth quarter. Feedback from meeting participants have been very positive. Our lead volumes in the year for the year, production is now close to normal levels, which we expect will help midweek occupancy uplift in the back half of the year. We continue to believe that full convention business recovery will be post '21 event, itself in the second half of 2022, and we remain pleased with how our '22 and '23 group calendar is shaping up as well as contract commitments for the future. 
In July, we relaunched entertainment with a great line of events that was met with overwhelming demand and now with Allegiant stadium, hosting large-scale entertainment, we can now drive more meaningful compression, especially at the mid- to south end of the strip. Consider the entertainment programming a few weekends ago, we had Garth Brooks at the Legion stadium, we had a McGregor fight at T-Mobile and Bruno Mars at Park MGM, selling over 98,000 tickets within our properties distance situated to capture significant amount of this foot traffic. 
While our conviction in the long-term viability of our business remains stronger than ever, the recent rising number of COVID cases and the subsequent actions taken by the CDC and local regulators and our reinstituted mask mandates here in Las Vegas of note is a reminder that the pandemic is not completely behind us. In Las Vegas, we continue to facilitate vaccinations among our employee base and have partnered with the governor's office to host multiple vaccination clinics including 1 at T-Mobile Arena, another on the strip at The Park, and we're using the full weight of our business and resources as part of this effort, including significant incentive offers to both guests and employees, who get vaccinated or bring friends and family to get vaccinated. 
We've also invested in ongoing educational employee campaigns as well as providing easy access to all 3 vaccines on pop up clinics at all of our properties. In July, we implemented a mandatory COVID testing program for all of our Las Vegas employees, who have not proven proof of vaccination. We've taken the virus very seriously, and as always, the health and safety of our guests and employees is our top priority. 
At this time, it's too early to speak to any meaningful impacts to our business, but we are monitoring the situation closely. And we'll continue to proactively work safely to accommodate guests and our properties. July, as I mentioned before, was the best month this year and by far in terms of operating performance, and we ultimately feel great about our long-term positioning in Las Vegas. The last few months have inevitably proven that the city remains resilient to a top destination for both business and specifically for tourism. 
Our regional properties that I mentioned earlier, delivered their best quarter-to-date yet in terms of EBITDA. We are encouraged by the stability of demand we saw at our properties as restrictions further eased into July, and I'm also pleased that our focus on cost and productivity across labor, player reinvestment and other streamline initiatives remain a key priority for our regional teams. 
And finally, on Macau, in the second quarter, we delivered sequential improvements over the first, amid a choppy GGR environment, that remains well below pre-pandemic levels. Despite this, MGM China, given our strength in premium mass, continue to outperform our former position in the marketplace. We believe the rate of Macau's recovery will continue to hinge on broader sentiment as we pace the vaccinations rollout throughout the regions, which will ultimately lead to sustainable easing of travel restrictions. With the Guangdong outbreak quickly contained, July was off to a better start when we saw visitation and business volumes striking a pickup again. And while the region had felt some additional speed bumps in recent days, with the government's expeditions efforts to contain the outbreak and border restrictions easing over time, we expect gradual growth demand for travel to Macau throughout the end of the second half of the year. 
We remain committed to elevating our footprint in Macau and will soon be increasing our upscale suite inventory. We have finalized the construction and fitting in the South Tower suites and MGM Cotai and are pleased with the final product, which we believe will be well received by our premier mass clients. We are now in soft opening in order to make final adjustments to our product and to achieve a level of service that meets our high-quality of standards. We expect to officially open it later this month, and further, we completed the gaming space Refresh in MGM Macau and are now looking at remodeling our villas. 
At both properties, we're enhancing our F&B options focused on the gaming floors, and over time, we have the ability to build out another hotel tower at MGM Cotai, along with meaningful entertainment assets to diversify our offerings. I am confident in Macau's longer-term growth prospects and firmly believe our investment in premium product positions us well for a broader recovery. 
With that, I'll turn this over to Jonathan to discuss our second quarter in more detail."
286798,1672702918,2363356,"MGM Resorts International, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","MGM Resorts International","Executives","Thanks a lot, Bill. Let's first discuss our second quarter results. Our consolidated second quarter net revenues were $2.3 billion, significantly better sequentially over our first quarter results. Our net income attributable to MGM Resorts was $105 milli",1651,"Thanks a lot, Bill. Let's first discuss our second quarter results. Our consolidated second quarter net revenues were $2.3 billion, significantly better sequentially over our first quarter results. Our net income attributable to MGM Resorts was $105 million, and our second quarter adjusted EBITDAR improved sequentially to $607 million -- $617 million, once again, heavily driven by our domestic operations. Our Las Vegas strip net revenues in the second quarter were $1 billion, 31% below the second quarter of 2019 and 28% below, excluding Circus Circus Las Vegas, which was sold at the end of 2019. 
Despite the lower top line, we delivered far superior EBITDAR results. Our second quarter adjusted property EBITDAR was $397 million, which is 5% below the second quarter of 2019 and just 1% lower, excluding Circus. Hold had a $6 million negative impact to our EBITDAR this quarter, so Hold-adjusted strip EBITDAR in Las Vegas was $403 million. Our strip margins improved almost 1,100 basis points to an all-time record of 39.5%. And this does not include the results of CityCenter, which generated $120 million of EBITDAR at a 46% margin.
As Bill mentioned in his remarks, our margin improvement was driven by a combination of strong leisure and casino demand, continued cost control and the operating leverage inherent in our business. Naturally, with limited convention business and entertainment, we are driving more visitation from customers that we know. And our second quarter casino room mix was 9 points above pre-COVID levels. Furthermore, our second quarter casino revenues were 15% above 2019 levels and contributed to 35% of our overall net revenues in the second quarter. This compares to roughly 22% in all of 2019. 
We're seeing particular strength in the slot customer. Our second quarter slot handle was 23% greater than that of the second quarter of 2019 on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding Circus Circus. And for the first time since being impacted by COVID, we are now attracting the older 65-plus demographic to our strip properties at levels commensurate with what we were seeing pre-pandemic.
Our second quarter occupancy was 77%, an improvement from 46% in the first quarter with weekends and weekdays at 94% and 70%, respectively. June occupancy was 83%, with weekends and weekdays at 96% and 79%, respectively. July occupancy was 86%. As pent-up demand -- as pent-up leisure demand stabilizes longer term, we believe this will be offset by ramping group business, and I echo Bill's comments that we're very pleased with the current trajectory of that segment's rebound. 
I'll close on Las Vegas with some thoughts on margins. Longer term, we believe that the 40% margins we achieved this past quarter will stabilize a bit lower as casino spend and overall business mix normalizes, and also as we ramp up staffing to more sustainable levels in order to serve our guests more fully. However, I know that we have further upside in overall profit dollars as our top line continues to rebound with group business and entertainment. I'm also confident that our focus on operational excellence and cost efficiency efforts will allow us to achieve strip margins well above 2019 levels long term.
Now on to our regional operations. Our second quarter regional net revenues of $856 million were aided by the continuing easing of statewide restrictions, and we're just 6% below that of the second quarter in 2019. We delivered adjusted property EBITDAR well over 2019 levels, 22% to be exact, to $318 million. Much like in Las Vegas, we're driving success in casino, with second quarter casino revenues outpacing 2019 levels by 8%, primarily due to slots and our higher-end customer base. 
Our 50 to 64 age demographic, of which I'm a proud member, is now at 2019 levels, and we're attracting more of the 65-plus age demographic. Our second quarter regional margin of 37% was also an all-time record, growing 855 basis points over the second quarter of 2019 and sequentially by 316 basis points over the first quarter. 
Our regional margin growth is a continued testament to all the great work that our teams have put into maximizing the effectiveness of our operating model and rethinking how we run our business. This ranges from marketing reinvestment to procurement, from energy utilization to labor management. And the breadth of our efforts gives me confidence that we will deliver on the $450 million of cost savings domestically, which we previously identified. 
Our margins of the regions will likely normalize a bit lower from second quarter levels longer-term as casino spend adjusts over time and as we reintroduce F&B and Entertainment, especially in our destination markets. We also expect to rightsize labor in the near term, which has certainly had a favorable impact on our margins, but it's also become a bottleneck in certain segments of our operations, negatively impacting our EBITDAR. Still, similar to Las Vegas, I know that we can achieve regional margins well above 2019 levels longer term. 
Our joint venture BetMGM is clearly the #1 operator in U.S. iGaming and has solidified its #2 position nationwide in U.S. sports betting and iGaming. Net revenues associated with BetMGM operations grew 19% sequentially from the first quarter to $194 million in the second quarter. This was driven by growth in both iGaming and online sports betting verticals as a result of increased customer acquisition and strong retention that yielded more first time deposits and actives. These results are especially impressive during the quarter with arguably minimal exogenous catalysts, no major state launches, a seasonally low sports calendar and a further reopening of brick-and-mortar casinos. 
Our share of BetMGM's losses in the second quarter amounted to $46 million, which is reported as a part of unconsolidated affiliates line of our adjusted EBITDA calculation. We remain excited about BetMGM's strong positioning in this fast-growing marketplace and both partners remain committed to its long-term success.
Finally, in Macau, market-wide GGR sequentially improved 7% in the second quarter, but still remained depressed at only 35% of second quarter 2019 levels. Nevertheless, as Bill mentioned earlier, MGM China outperformed the market, with its GGR having recovered to 43% of pre-pandemic levels. MGM China's second quarter net revenues were $311 million, up slightly from the first quarter. Adjusted property EBITDAR of $9 million also improved quarter-over-quarter from $5 million in the first quarter. Hold-adjusted EBITDAR was $13 million on 2.75% VIP win in second quarter compared to 3.29% in the first quarter. Mass Hold was also lower sequentially.
Our second quarter corporate expense, excluding share-based compensation, was $90 million, which included $6.5 million in transaction costs. We expect that our quarterly net corporate expense will run a bit higher going forward as we ramp our investments in IT, our digital offerings and our IR efforts in Japan. In the near term, we also expect to incur incremental costs related to our recently announced transactions.
We were active share repurchasers in the second quarter, having repurchased 5.6 million shares for $220 million. We believe our shares are attractively valued and we've purchased an additional 6.8 million shares for $263 million in the third quarter through today, bringing us to $615 million of share repurchases year-to-date.
Bill talked about our recent milestones in simplifying our story and becoming asset light. We sold MGM Springfield's underlying real estate to MGP for $400 million at a 13.3x rent multiple or a 7.5% cap rate. We also transacted on CityCenter, effectuating a high watermark on the sale of real estate assets at an 18.1x rent multiple or a 5.5% cap rate and acquiring ownership of 100% of the operations of ARIA and Vdara at an implied multiple of 8.9x based on CityCenter's 2019 adjusted EBITDA from resort operations of $425 million. 
CityCenter's second quarter results demonstrate the premium quality of the property, the excellence of its management team and its cash flow generating potential with adjusted EBITDA of $120 million, 13% above the second quarter of 2019 and with margins of 46%.
And finally, we announced today the transaction with VICI, whereby we will receive $43 per unit or approximately $4.4 billion in cash for a majority of our MGP OP units. As part of the agreement, we'll hold an approximately 1% stake in the newly combined company valued at nearly $400 million. We will enter into an amended and restated master lease with VICI, with initial year's rent at $860 million. The transaction values MGP at an implied 17.5x pro rata EBITDA multiple for a 5.8% cap rate. So it's been a busy and a productive quarter. We expect to close on CityCenter by the end of the third quarter, on Springfield by the end of the year, and our transaction with VICI will likely take us into the first half of next year to close, and all of these transactions are subject to regulatory approvals.
The end result is a cleaner, more focused company, a streamlined reporting structure and a stronger deployable cash position to maximize shareholder value and advance our vision to be the world's premier gaming entertainment company.
As of June 30, our liquidity position, excluding MGM China and MGP, was $6.5 billion and $11.6 billion adjusted for the aforementioned announcements. On last quarter's call, I highlighted our approach to capital allocation, and it is certainly worth reiterating today.
First, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity. Second, we'll return cash to shareholders, which we have done convincingly thus far this year. We will continue to take a disciplined and programmatic approach to shareholder -- share repurchases for the balance of the year. And third, when assessing potential growth opportunities, we'll invest where we have clear advantages. And will exercise discipline in measuring prospective returns for our shareholders. As we evaluate uses of our shareholders' capital over time, these priorities will act as a blueprint for our decision-making process. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks."

We are driving that demand through our marketing channels. And so we've earned those revenue levels for sure. But they are elevated compared to what they've been in the past. 
And that's what I referred to in our remarks, is some expectation that over time, as other avenues for spending are available in our properties, that perhaps that mix normalizes a bit. But at the same time, our hotel RevPAR is still below where it was back in '19 fairly materially, both by occupancy as well as overall rates. And that presents tremendous upside. That's high-margin revenue for us. We fully expect to be able to get back to those levels over the next year or so. And that will lead to -- that will be very profitable revenue growth for us. At the same time, much of that is, of course, going to come with the recovery of the group business. 
So there are the puts and takes, as you put it. We're just -- we're doing the best we can to account in the future for the impact that some of our labor additions are expected to have, but there are clearly sources of upside in revenue and even margin performance, mostly around the hotel mix."

The margin that we did this quarter is not sustainable. I think we've said that in a couple of different ways.

And so as these high value, high revenue, high cost things like a Lady Gaga show come into play, it just -- it works on your margins, given particularly as the higher end business returns, whether it be ultimately from Asia or other places, it will kick in. 
And so I don't think -- I hope you haven't heard us say we're going to sustain where we are this quarter. That wasn't the message. The message is we have learned a lot. We're going to be appreciably better than we've been in -- I can't remember, in our history. And there are certain things we'll never do again, whether it's buffet openings or how we think about labor or services or products, given what we've all gone through for the last 18 months. There's a massive amount of learnings of how even think about our business. I mean I just look at our corporate enterprise, we had 4,750 FTEs. We're under 3,000 today. We will never go back to 4,750 FTEs, full stop. 
And so I hope the message is, from our perspective, we're not going to sustain where we are, but they will be much better than they've ever been historically. And I'm pretty excited about where I think they're going to end up ultimately."

I think that this effort, of course, is led by Steve Zanella, our Chief Commercial Officer. But here's where Talat Mandati, this phenomenal talent that has just joined us from Walt Disney is going to be hugely impactful as he helps us really build out the technology platform and the overall design of that program in its next instance.

Obviously, the regional play that Corey has mentioned and Jonathan and in BetMGM are really the 4 key drivers. And then 1 interesting tidbit, I stumbled on this morning, Corey just mentioned it somewhat in Michigan. One of the questions that's come up with BetMGM is about cannibalization. It's interesting. Detroit just got a 46.5% market share in brick-and-mortar. And we lead the market in iGaming at 38%, and that's an increase in the mid-30. We were 43% in June. We're 46.5% in July, and we're holding at 38% market share in iGaming. 
And so the idea that omni-channel can and will work and not be cannibalizing is something I'm very excited by moving forward."

I think longer term, look, there's a commitment we're making to Japan and to Osaka that we would be a true partner in this. There's an actual requirement for 30% equity in it to be classified or qualified, if you will. But REITs are something that are in Japan. And so I think longer term, we'll see.

Beyond that, we'll look for opportunities to -- inorganic opportunities to really further the company's vision as a premier gaming entertainment company globally. 
In terms of our leverage targets, the company's capital structure is changing from a traditional senior debt structure to the leases that we have, and that certainly impacts our thinking about leverage, because the lease payments do represent financial leverage on the business and lease-adjusted leverage level of 4.0 to 5x, we think, is is reasonable for a business of our geographic diversification.

Our market mix is half of theirs. We know we can increase that. So we think that's sustaining. Obviously, what we have done best historically is high end international business. We're well positioned. We have a plant in Macau, obviously. We have regional offices all over Asia. We'd like to see us get back into that business. I think there's some real growth there. 
And I think interestingly, the demographic has changed to a younger audience, and they've gotten more acclimated to gaming. We've seen it throughout this past year. A lot of these numbers. Remember, the older folks like myself have generally stayed away for health concerns. And I think we've seen the emergence, if you will, of another marketplace, it's called millennial that we haven't seen for a while. So we're all pretty excited about driving that and some of the platform technology things we talked about earlier with M Life, we think will be meaningful in that regard. 
And what I would say is I think we have our cost pretty walked in. Obviously, there's always opportunities. Now it is a revenue discussion and how we continue to maximize that and how we can grow organically higher than what we're seeing in cost of living. I think some of the digital initiatives we're working on on that, the mix will help that as Bill mentioned, that customer base, we're up over 50% M Life customers in that group. And if we could figure out how to capture them, and we believe we have ways to do that and keep them in the properties, we think there's opportunity for revenue lift."

My comment about inorganic opportunities, I'm sure that can be development, can be M&A, and it's really in recognition that it's a very dynamic environment and market with some interesting things going on.

July is even more so. So I know what we have put in play is trackable, is doable and sustainable. And so we're very excited by that. Labor and supply chain remain an issue for our company as it does in the industry. But we've also learned a lot from that by not having some things easily accessible to us, we've figured out different and potentially better ways to do things. And so those learnings aren't going to go away. 
We're going to remain diligent and keep the pressure on with COVID, particularly as it relates to our employees and making sure we get them vaccinated. We're making good headway over the last 30 days, and we'll continue to push on that aggressively. We look forward to our group business returning in the back half of the year and have no reason to believe at this date that it won't with some velocity. BetMGM continues to shine. There's no reason to believe that second half of this year is not going to do the same. And as we've all talked about, we have this tremendous liquidity position we're now looking at.

Over the past few months, we've had the honor and the privilege of welcoming back guests back to our properties at a remarkable pace, both in Las Vegas and our regional markets.

Over the past few months, we've had the honor and the privilege of welcoming back guests back to our properties at a remarkable pace, both in Las Vegas and our regional markets. It's been rewarding to see our guests taking in all the world-class gaming and entertainment experiences that only MGM Resorts can provide, and it's been equally gratifying to witness the tremendous effort of our employees delivering these experiences. We have an amazing team of people here at MGM Resorts, the best in the business. And so I'd like to take this time to thank them today for their hard work and dedication to our company and our guests, especially over the last 18 months. I can't say enough how critically important they have been, will continue to be to our success as we carry out our vision to be the world's premier gaming and entertainment company. 
In fact, investing in our people and our planet is the foundation upon which we've built our strategic plan for the company's long-term vision. Our strategic plan consists of the following 4 priorities: investing in our people and our planet, providing unique experiences for our guests by leveraging data-driven customer insights and digital capabilities, delivering operational excellence at every level, and allocating our capital responsibly to drive the highest returns for our shareholders. In driving our vision, we have long discussed our goals of simplifying our corporate structure and monetizing our real estate premium valuations to become asset light. We've been busy on this front. And over the past 90 days, we've meaningfully advanced this strategy. 
In May, we announced an agreement to sell and lease back MGM Springfield, underlying real estate to MGM Growth Properties. We followed that news in July with an agreement to purchase Infinity World's 50% interest in CityCenter and then to subsequently sell and lease back the underlying real estate to Blackstone at an unprecedented cap rate for gaming asset. And we're very excited to become the full owners of Aria and Vdara operations soon.  
I'd also like to take this time to thank Bill Grounds from Infinity World, who has on the heels of this transaction stepped down from MGM's Board after serving us since 2013. He's been a great partner for many years, and we wish him the very best in the future.  
And finally, as you know, we have spent significant time and effort working on the best solutions for our stated goal of deconsolidating MGP. And this morning, we were pleased to announce a comprehensive transaction with VICI and MGP to monetize the majority of our operating partnership units for approximately $4.4 billion in cash at a multiple that's among the strongest in all gaming real estate transactions to date. This is a great win for MGM and MGP, and we're excited by our new long-term partnership with VICI. 
Again, I'm incredibly proud of our finance, operating and legal teams, who have been accomplishing an astonishing amount in a short order to get these transactions across the finish line.  
Combining these transactions grant us greater financial flexibility by the means of $11.6 billion in domestic liquidity and importantly, they allow us to intensify our focus on maximizing growth in our core business and pursuing opportunities that align to our long-term vision. 
In terms of such opportunities, we remain committed to our sports betting and iGaming joint venture, BetMGM, which continues to impress. Having expanded its net revenues and its leadership position in the second quarter, BetMGM is the #2 operator in the space nationwide, and in the second quarter, it commended 24% share of its live markets. BetMGM remains a clear leader in iGaming, having reached a 30% market share in the second quarter, and we also continue to see the benefits of customer acquisition cross pollinization between MGM and BetMGM. 
In the second quarter, 15% of BetMGM's new players came from MGM and 31% of MGM -- M life sign-ups came from BetMGM. We'll strategically invest in our digital capabilities and customer growth strategies, driving innovation and a deeper customer loyalty throughout technology led customer-centric experiences, products and services. These efforts will be led by Tilak Mandadi, who we recently hired as our Chief Strategy, Innovation and Technology Officer. Tilak is a visionary, a results-driven leader who has spent several decades of experience at both Disney and American Express, where he led similar initiatives. Tilak will also be leading our relationship with BetMGM joining its Board of Directors. He's another fantastic addition to our senior leadership team and complementary to the deep bench we've now built with recent additions of Jonathan as CFO; and Jyoti Chopra as our Chief People, Inclusion and Sustainability Officer. I have no doubt that will be invaluable to the company's future.  
We'll also increase our diversification into Asia through the footprint expansion in Macau and the integrated resort opportunity in Japan. As a matter of fact, we officially submitted our RFP as a sole bidder for the Osaka license a couple of weeks ago, which starts the clock on a 3-month review process. We and our local partners, ORIX, remain excited by the opportunity, which we expect will yield very attractive returns. We look forward to Osaka reviewing our proposal, and hopefully, I'm confident, we'll ultimately be named Osaka's designee operator early this fall.  
And lastly, we continue to study key regional markets of significance, including commercial gaming license at Empire City in New York.  
Before I turn it over to Jonathan to delve into our second quarter results, I'd like to say a few words on our current business trends and our future outlook. We reported a great second quarter at our domestic properties, driven by pent-up consumer demand and high domestic casino spend as well as our ability to yield our business and maintain our cost discipline efforts. In fact, we delivered all-time record margins in both Las Vegas and regional segments as well as all-time record EBITDA quarters at our regional properties. Further, 11 of our 17 domestic properties had all-time record quarters and slot gross win. And that momentum continued into July with another record month that exceeded June.  
I can't tell you enough under these circumstances how pleased and proud I am of our entire team. We have righted the ship, and we're going full steam ahead. In Las Vegas, our weekend volumes are back to normal, driven by leisure and domestic casino customers with ADRs now surpassing 2019 levels. The weekday while improving continued to lag the weekends in the second quarter due to lower level of group business. That being said, June kicked off a series of citywide events coming to town such as World Of Concrete and Surfaces, and we anticipate a return of groups here in the third and fourth quarter. Feedback from meeting participants have been very positive. Our lead volumes in the year for the year, production is now close to normal levels, which we expect will help midweek occupancy uplift in the back half of the year. We continue to believe that full convention business recovery will be post '21 event, solidifying itself in the second half of 2022, and we remain pleased with how our '22 and '23 group calendar is shaping up as well as contract commitments for the future.  
In July, we relaunched entertainment with a great line of events that was met with overwhelming demand and now with Allegiant Stadium hosting large-scale entertainment, we can now drive more meaningful compression, especially at the mid- to south end of the strip. Consider the entertainment programming a few weekends ago, we had Garth Brooks at Allegiant Stadium, we had a McGregor fight at T-Mobile and Bruno Mars at Park MGM, selling over 98,000 tickets within our properties distance situated to capture significant amount of this foot traffic.  
While our conviction in the long-term viability of our business remains stronger than ever, the recent rising number of COVID cases and the subsequent actions taken by the CDC and local regulators and our reinstituted mask mandates here in Las Vegas of note is a reminder that the pandemic is not completely behind us. In Las Vegas, we continue to facilitate vaccinations among our employee base and have partnered with the Governor's Office to host multiple vaccination clinics including 1 at T-Mobile Arena, another on the strip at The Park, and we're using the full weight of our business and resources as part of this effort, including significant incentive offers to both guests and employees, who get vaccinated or bring friends and family to get vaccinated.  
We've also invested in ongoing educational employee campaigns as well as providing easy access to all 3 vaccines on pop-up clinics at all of our properties. In July, we implemented a mandatory COVID testing program for all of our Las Vegas employees, who have not proven proof of vaccination. We've taken the virus very seriously, and as always, the health and safety of our guests and employees is our top priority.  
At this time, it's too early to speak to any meaningful impact to our business, but we are monitoring the situation closely. And we'll continue to proactively work safely to accommodate guests and our properties. July, as I mentioned before, was the best month this year and by far in terms of operating performance, we ultimately feel great about our long-term positioning in Las Vegas. The last few months have inevitably proven that the city remains resilient to a top destination for both business and specifically for tourism.  
Our regional properties that I mentioned earlier, delivered their best quarter-to-date yet in terms of EBITDA. We are encouraged by the stability of demand we saw at our properties as restrictions further eased into July, and I'm also pleased that our focus on cost and productivity across labor, player reinvestment and other streamline initiatives remain a key priority for our regional teams.  
And finally, on Macau, in the second quarter, we delivered sequential improvements over the first, amid a choppy GGR environment that remains well below pre-pandemic levels. Despite this, MGM China, given our strength in premium mass, continued to outperform our former position in the marketplace. We believe the rate of Macau's recovery will continue to hinge on broader sentiment as we pace the vaccinations rollout throughout the regions, which will ultimately lead to sustainable easing of travel restrictions. With the Guangdong outbreak quickly contained, July was off to a better start when we saw visitation and business volumes striking a pickup again. And while the region had felt some additional speed bumps in recent days, with the government's expeditions efforts to contain the outbreak and border restrictions easing over time, we expect gradual growth demand for travel to Macau throughout the end of the second half of the year.  
We remain committed to elevating our footprint in Macau and will soon be increasing our upscale suite inventory. We have finalized the construction and fitting in the South Tower suites and MGM Cotai and are pleased with the final product, which we believe will be well received by our premier mass clients. We are now in soft opening in order to make final adjustments to our product and to achieve a level of service that meets our high-quality of standards. We expect to officially open it later this month, and further, we completed the gaming space refresh in MGM Macau and are now looking at remodeling our villas.  
At both properties, we're enhancing our F&B options focused on the gaming floors, and over time, we have the ability to build out another hotel tower at MGM Cotai, along with meaningful entertainment assets to diversify our offerings. I am confident in Macau's longer-term growth prospects and firmly believe our investment in premium product positions us well for a broader recovery.  
With that, I'll turn this over to Jonathan to discuss our second quarter in more detail."
286798,1672702918,2363696,"MGM Resorts International, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","MGM Resorts International","Executives","Thanks a lot, Bill. Let's first discuss our second quarter results. Our consolidated second quarter net revenues were $2.3 billion, significantly better sequentially over our first quarter results. Our net income attributable to MGM Resorts was $105 milli",1651,"Thanks a lot, Bill. Let's first discuss our second quarter results. Our consolidated second quarter net revenues were $2.3 billion, significantly better sequentially over our first quarter results. Our net income attributable to MGM Resorts was $105 million, and our second quarter adjusted EBITDAR improved sequentially to $607 million -- $617 million, once again, heavily driven by our domestic operations. Our Las Vegas strip net revenues in the second quarter were $1 billion, 31% below the second quarter of 2019 and 28% below, excluding Circus Circus Las Vegas, which was sold at the end of 2019.  
Despite the lower top line, we delivered far superior EBITDAR results. Our second quarter adjusted property EBITDAR was $397 million, which is 5% below the second quarter of 2019 and just 1% lower, excluding Circus. Hold had a $6 million negative impact to our EBITDAR this quarter, so Hold-adjusted strip EBITDAR in Las Vegas was $403 million. Our strip margins improved almost 1,100 basis points to an all-time record of 39.5%. And this does not include the results of CityCenter, which generated $120 million of EBITDAR at a 46% margin. 
As Bill mentioned in his remarks, our margin improvement was driven by a combination of strong leisure and casino demand, continued cost control and the operating leverage inherent in our business. Naturally, with limited convention business and entertainment, we are driving more visitation from customers that we know. 
And our second quarter casino room mix was 9 points above pre-COVID levels. Furthermore, our second quarter casino revenues were 15% above 2019 levels and contributed to 35% of our overall net revenues in the second quarter. This compares to roughly 22% in all of 2019. 
We're seeing particular strength in the slot customer. Our second quarter slot handle was 23% greater than that of the second quarter of 2019 on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding Circus Circus. And for the first time since being impacted by COVID, we are now attracting the older 65-plus demographic to our strip properties at levels commensurate with what we were seeing pre-pandemic.
Our second quarter occupancy was 77%, an improvement from 46% in the first quarter with weekends and weekdays at 94% and 70%, respectively. June occupancy was 83%, with weekends and weekdays at 96% and 79%, respectively. July occupancy was 86%. As pent-up demand -- as pent-up leisure demand stabilizes longer term, we believe this will be offset by ramping group business, and I echo Bill's comments that we're very pleased with the current trajectory of that segment's rebound.
I'll close on Las Vegas with some thoughts on margins. Longer term, we believe that the 40% margins we achieved this past quarter will stabilize a bit lower as casino spend and overall business mix normalizes, and also as we ramp up staffing to more sustainable levels in order to serve our guests more fully. However, I know that we have further upside in overall profit dollars as our top line continues to rebound with group business and entertainment. I'm also confident that our focus on operational excellence and cost efficiency efforts will allow us to achieve strip margins well above 2019 levels long term.
Now on to our regional operations. Our second quarter regional net revenues of $856 million were aided by the continuing easing of statewide restrictions, and we're just 6% below that of the second quarter in 2019. We delivered adjusted property EBITDAR well over 2019 levels, 22% to be exact, to $318 million. Much like in Las Vegas, we're driving success in casino, with second quarter casino revenues outpacing 2019 levels by 8%, primarily due to slots and our higher-end customer base. 
Our 50 to 64 age demographic, of which I'm a proud member, is now at 2019 levels, and we're attracting more of the 65-plus age demographic. Our second quarter regional margin of 37% was also an all-time record, growing 855 basis points over the second quarter of 2019 and sequentially by 316 basis points over the first quarter. 
Our regional margin growth is a continued testament to all the great work that our teams have put into maximizing the effectiveness of our operating model and rethinking how we run our business. This ranges from marketing reinvestment to procurement, from energy utilization to labor management. And the breadth of our efforts gives me confidence that we will deliver on the $450 million of cost savings domestically, which we previously identified. 
Our margins of the regions will likely normalize a bit lower from second quarter levels longer-term as casino spend adjusts over time and as we reintroduce F&B and entertainment, especially in our destination markets. We also expect to rightsize labor in the near term, which has certainly had a favorable impact on our margins, but it's also become a bottleneck in certain segments of our operations, negatively impacting our EBITDAR. Still, similar to Las Vegas, I know that we can achieve regional margins well above 2019 levels longer term. 
Our joint venture BetMGM is clearly the #1 operator in U.S. iGaming and has solidified its #2 position nationwide in U.S. sports betting and iGaming. Net revenues associated with BetMGM operations grew 19% sequentially from the first quarter to $194 million in the second quarter. This was driven by growth in both iGaming and online sports betting verticals as a result of increased customer acquisition and strong retention that yielded more first time deposits and actives. These results are especially impressive during the quarter with arguably minimal exogenous catalysts, no major state launches, a seasonally low sports calendar and a further reopening of brick-and-mortar casinos. 
Our share of BetMGM's losses in the second quarter amounted to $46 million, which is reported as a part of unconsolidated affiliates line of our adjusted EBITDA calculation. We remain excited about BetMGM's strong positioning in this fast-growing marketplace and both partners remain committed to its long-term success.
Finally, in Macau, market-wide GGR sequentially improved 7% in the second quarter, but still remained depressed at only 35% of second quarter 2019 levels. Nevertheless, as Bill mentioned earlier, MGM China outperformed the market, with its GGR having recovered to 43% of pre-pandemic levels. MGM China's second quarter net revenues were $311 million, up slightly from the first quarter. Adjusted property EBITDAR of $9 million also improved quarter-over-quarter from $5 million in the first quarter. Hold-adjusted EBITDAR was $13 million on 2.75% VIP win in second quarter compared to 3.29% in the first quarter. Mass Hold was also lower sequentially.
Our second quarter corporate expense, excluding share-based compensation, was $90 million, which included $6.5 million in transaction costs. We expect that our quarterly net corporate expense will run a bit higher going forward as we ramp our investments in IT, our digital offerings and our IR efforts in Japan. In the near term, we also expect to incur incremental costs related to our recently announced transactions.
We were active share repurchasers in the second quarter, having repurchased 5.6 million shares for $220 million. We believe our shares are attractively valued and we've purchased an additional 6.8 million shares for $263 million in the third quarter through today, bringing us to $615 million of share repurchases year-to-date.
Bill talked about our recent milestones in simplifying our story and becoming asset light. We sold MGM Springfield's underlying real estate to MGP for $400 million at a 13.3x rent multiple or a 7.5% cap rate. We also transacted on CityCenter, effectuating a high watermark on the sale of real estate assets at an 18.1x rent multiple or a 5.5% cap rate and acquiring ownership of 100% of the operations of ARIA and Vdara at an implied multiple of 8.9x based on CityCenter's 2019 adjusted EBITDA from resort operations of $425 million. 
CityCenter's second quarter results demonstrate the premium quality of the property, the excellence of its management team and its cash flow generating potential with adjusted EBITDA of $120 million, 13% above the second quarter of 2019 and with margins of 46%.
And finally, we announced today the transaction with VICI, whereby we will receive $43 per unit or approximately $4.4 billion in cash for a majority of our MGP OP units. As part of the agreement, we'll hold an approximately 1% stake in the newly combined company valued at nearly $400 million. We will enter into an amended and restated master lease with VICI, with initial year's rent at $860 million. The transaction values MGP at an implied 17.5x pro rata EBITDA multiple for a 5.8% cap rate. So it's been a busy and a productive quarter. We expect to close on CityCenter by the end of the third quarter and Springfield by the end of the year, and our transaction with VICI will likely take us into the first half of next year to close, and all of these transactions are subject to regulatory approvals.
The end result is a cleaner, more focused company, a streamlined reporting structure and a stronger deployable cash position to maximize shareholder value and advance our vision to be the world's premier gaming entertainment company.
As of June 30, our liquidity position, excluding MGM China and MGP, was $6.5 billion and $11.6 billion adjusted for the aforementioned announcements. On last quarter's call, I highlighted our approach to capital allocation, and it is certainly worth reiterating today.
First, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity. Second, we'll return cash to shareholders, which we have done convincingly thus far this year. We will continue to take a disciplined and programmatic approach to shareholder -- share repurchases for the balance of the year. And third, when assessing potential growth opportunities, we'll invest where we have clear advantages. And will exercise discipline in measuring prospective returns for our shareholders. As we evaluate uses of our shareholders' capital over time, these priorities will act as a blueprint for our decision-making process. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks."

We are driving that demand through our marketing channels. And so we've earned those revenue levels for sure. But they are elevated compared to what they've been in the past. 
And that's what I referred to in our remarks, is some expectation that over time, as other avenues for spending are available in our properties, that perhaps that mix normalizes a bit. But at the same time, our hotel RevPAR is still below where it was back in '19 fairly materially, both by occupancy as well as overall rates. And that presents tremendous upside. That's high-margin revenue for us. We fully expect to be able to get back to those levels over the next year or so. And that will lead to -- that will be very profitable revenue growth for us. At the same time, much of that is, of course, going to come with the recovery of the group business. 
So there are the puts and takes, as you put it. We're just -- we're doing the best we can to account in the future for the impact that some of our labor additions are expected to have, but there are clearly sources of upside in revenue and even margin performance, mostly around the hotel mix."

I appreciate you bringing it up because I do -- I know this is a huge opportunity for MGM Resorts. I mean we have a fantastic loyalty program with 36 million members, which is growing in significant part by BetMGM right now. And so it's a large and important loyalty program. And where I think some of the sources of upside are particularly around cross property play here in Las Vegas and kind of the transparent portability of those rewards across the network in Las Vegas, and then in driving regional customers of ours, members of the M life's loyalty program to our properties when they visit in Las Vegas, which we know that they already do. 
I think that this effort, of course, is led by Steve Zanella, our Chief Commercial Officer. But here's where Tilak Mandadi, this phenomenal talent that has just joined us from Walt Disney is going to be hugely impactful as he helps us really build out the technology platform and the overall design of that program in its next instance. 
So there's a lot of work going on around that effort right now, and I'm really confident it's going to have a real impact for us in 2022."

Obviously, the regional play that Corey has mentioned and Jonathan and BetMGM are really the 4 key drivers. And then 1 interesting tidbit I stumbled on this morning, Corey just mentioned it's somewhat in Michigan. One of the questions that's come up with BetMGM is about cannibalization. It's interesting. Detroit just got 46.5% market share in brick-and-mortar. And we lead the market in iGaming at 38%, and that's an increase in the mid-30. We were 43% in June. We're 46.5% in July, and we're holding at 38% market share in iGaming. 
And so the idea that omni-channel can and will work and not be cannibalizing is something I'm very excited by moving forward."

I think longer term, look, there's a commitment we're making to Japan and to Osaka that we would be a true partner in this. There's an actual requirement for 30% equity in it to be classified or qualified, if you will. But REITs are something that are in Japan. And so I think longer term, we'll see.

Beyond that, we'll look for opportunities to -- inorganic opportunities to really further the company's vision as a premier gaming entertainment company globally. 
In terms of our leverage targets, the company's capital structure is changing from a traditional senior debt structure to the leases that we have, and that will -- that certainly impacts our thinking about leverage, because the lease payments do represent financial leverage on the business and lease-adjusted leverage level of 4 to 5x, we think, is reasonable for a business of our geographic diversification.

There's really no tax reason why we could not deploy that capital as a dividend to our shareholders or for returning capital to shareholders through other means.

It represents, in broad terms, I think about it as releasing capital from the real estate in this business, freeing it up for other uses, including returning to shareholders. My comment about inorganic opportunities, I'm sure that can be development, can be M&A, and it's really in recognition that it's a very dynamic environment and market with some interesting things going on.

July is even more so. So I know what we have put in play is trackable, is doable and sustainable. And so we're very excited by that. Labor and supply chain remain an issue for our company as it does in the industry. But we've also learned a lot from that by not having some things easily accessible to us. We've figured out different and potentially better ways to do things. And so those learnings aren't going to go away. 
We're going to remain diligent and keep the pressure on with COVID, particularly as it relates to our employees and making sure we get them vaccinated. We're making good headway over the last 30 days, and we'll continue to push on that aggressively. We look forward to our group business returning in the back half of the year and have no reason to believe that at this date that it won't with some velocity. BetMGM continues to shine. There's no reason to believe that second half of this year is not going to do the same. And as we've all talked about, we have this tremendous liquidity position we're now looking at. And so the future is bright and the opportunity is, I think, extensive. But again, we're going to be patient and disciplined about what we do and when we do it.

Over the past few months, we've had the honor and the privilege of welcoming back guests back to our properties at a remarkable pace, both in Las Vegas and our regional markets.

Over the past few months, we've had the honor and the privilege of welcoming back guests back to our properties at a remarkable pace, both in Las Vegas and our regional markets. It's been rewarding to see our guests taking in all the world-class gaming and entertainment experiences that only MGM Resorts can provide, and it's been equally gratifying to witness the tremendous effort of our employees delivering these experiences. We have an amazing team of people here at MGM Resorts, the best in the business. And so I'd like to take this time to thank them today for their hard work and dedication to our company and our guests, especially over the last 18 months. I can't say enough how critically important they have been, will continue to be to our success as we carry out our vision to be the world's premier gaming and entertainment company. 
In fact, investing in our people and our planet is the foundation upon which we've built our strategic plan for the company's long-term vision. Our strategic plan consists of the following 4 priorities: investing in our people and our planet, providing unique experiences for our guests by leveraging data-driven customer insights and digital capabilities, delivering operational excellence at every level, and allocating our capital responsibly to drive the highest returns for our shareholders. In driving our vision, we have long discussed our goals of simplifying our corporate structure and monetizing our real estate premium valuations to become asset light. We've been busy on this front. And over the past 90 days, we've meaningfully advanced this strategy. 
In May, we announced an agreement to sell and lease back MGM Springfield, underlying real estate to MGM Growth Properties. We followed that news in July with an agreement to purchase Infinity World's 50% interest in CityCenter and then to subsequently sell and lease back the underlying real estate to Blackstone at an unprecedented cap rate for a gaming asset. And we're very excited to become the full owners of Aria and Vdara operations soon.  
I'd also like to take this time to thank Bill Grounds from Infinity World, who has on the heels of this transaction stepped down from MGM's Board after serving us since 2013. He's been a great partner for many years, and we wish him the very best in the future.  
And finally, as you know, we have spent significant time and effort working on the best solutions for our stated goal of deconsolidating MGP. And this morning, we were pleased to announce a comprehensive transaction with VICI and MGP to monetize the majority of our operating partnership units for approximately $4.4 billion in cash at a multiple that's among the strongest in all gaming real estate transactions to date. This is a great win for MGM and MGP, and we're excited by our new long-term partnership with VICI. 
Again, I'm incredibly proud of our finance, operating and legal teams, who have been accomplishing an astonishing amount in a short order to get these transactions across the finish line.  
Combining these transactions grant us greater financial flexibility by the means of $11.6 billion in domestic liquidity. And importantly, they allow us to intensify our focus on maximizing growth in our core business and pursuing opportunities that align to our long-term vision. 
In terms of such opportunities, we remain committed to our sports betting and iGaming joint venture, BetMGM, which continues to impress. Having expanded its net revenues and its leadership position in the second quarter, BetMGM is the #2 operator in the space nationwide, and in the second quarter, it commended 24% share of its live markets. BetMGM remains a clear leader in iGaming, having reached a 30% market share in the second quarter, and we also continue to see the benefits of customer acquisition cross pollinization between MGM and BetMGM. 
In the second quarter, 15% of BetMGM's new players came from MGM and 31% of MGM -- M life sign-ups came from BetMGM. We'll strategically invest in our digital capabilities and customer growth strategies, driving innovation and a deeper customer loyalty throughout technology led customer-centric experiences, products and services. These efforts will be led by Tilak Mandadi, who we recently hired as our Chief Strategy, Innovation and Technology Officer. Tilak is a visionary, a results-driven leader who has spent several decades of experience at both Disney and American Express, where he led similar initiatives. Tilak will also be leading our relationship with BetMGM joining its Board of Directors. He's another fantastic addition to our senior leadership team and complementary to the deep bench we've now built with recent additions of Jonathan as CFO; and Jyoti Chopra as our Chief People, Inclusion and Sustainability Officer. I have no doubt that Tilak will be invaluable to the company's future.  
We'll also increase our diversification into Asia through the footprint expansion in Macau and the integrated resort opportunity in Japan. As a matter of fact, we officially submitted our RFP as a sole bidder for the Osaka license a couple of weeks ago, which starts the clock on a 3-month review process. We and our local partners, ORIX, remain excited by the opportunity, which we expect will yield very attractive returns. We look forward to Osaka reviewing our proposal, and hopefully, I'm confident, we'll ultimately be named Osaka's designee operator early this fall.  
And lastly, we continue to study key regional markets of significance, including commercial gaming license at Empire City in New York.  
Before I turn it over to Jonathan to delve into our second quarter results, I'd like to say a few words on our current business trends and our future outlook. We reported a great second quarter at our domestic properties, driven by pent-up consumer demand and high domestic casino spend as well as our ability to yield our business and maintain our cost discipline efforts. In fact, we delivered all-time record margins in both Las Vegas and regional segments as well as all-time record EBITDA quarters at our regional properties. 
Further, 11 of our 17 domestic properties had all-time record quarters in slot gross win. And that momentum continued into July with another record month that exceeded June. 
I can't tell you enough under these circumstances how pleased and proud I am of our entire team. We have righted the ship, and we're going full steam ahead. In Las Vegas, our weekend volumes are back to normal, driven by leisure and domestic casino customers with ADRs now surpassing 2019 levels. The weekday while improving continued to lag the weekends in the second quarter due to lower level of group business. That being said, June kicked off a series of citywide events coming to town such as World Of Concrete and Surfaces, and we anticipate a return of groups here in the third and fourth quarter. Feedback from meeting participants have been very positive. Our lead volumes in the year for the year, production is now close to normal levels, which we expect will help midweek occupancy uplift in the back half of the year. We continue to believe that full convention business recovery will be post '21 event, solidifying itself in the second half of 2022, and we remain pleased with how our '22 and '23 group calendar is shaping up as well as contract commitments for the future.  
In July, we relaunched entertainment with a great line of events that was met with overwhelming demand and now with Allegiant Stadium hosting large-scale entertainment, we can now drive more meaningful compression, especially at the mid- to south end of the Strip. Consider the entertainment programming a few weekends ago, we had Garth Brooks at Allegiant Stadium, we had a McGregor fight at T-Mobile and Bruno Mars at Park MGM, selling over 98,000 tickets within our properties distance situated to capture significant amount of this foot traffic.  
While our conviction in the long-term viability of our business remains stronger than ever, the recent rising number of COVID cases and the subsequent actions taken by the CDC and local regulators and our reinstituted mask mandates here in Las Vegas of note is a reminder that the pandemic is not completely behind us. In Las Vegas, we continue to facilitate vaccinations among our employee base and have partnered with the Governor's Office to host multiple vaccination clinics including 1 at T-Mobile Arena, another on the Strip at The Park. And we're using the full weight of our business and resources as part of this effort, including significant incentive offers to both guests and employees who get vaccinated or bring friends and family to get vaccinated. 
We've also invested in ongoing educational employee campaigns as well as providing easy access to all 3 vaccines on pop-up clinics at all of our properties. In July, we implemented a mandatory COVID testing program for all of our Las Vegas employees, who have not proven proof of vaccination. We've taken the virus very seriously, and as always, the health and safety of our guests and employees is our top priority.  
At this time, it's too early to speak to any meaningful impact to our business, but we are monitoring the situation closely. And we'll continue to proactively work safely to accommodate guests and our properties. July, as I mentioned before, was the best month this year and by far in terms of operating performance, we ultimately feel great about our long-term positioning in Las Vegas. The last few months have inevitably proven that the city remains resilient to a top destination for both business and specifically for tourism.  
Our regional properties that I mentioned earlier, delivered their best quarter-to-date yet in terms of EBITDAR. We are encouraged by the stability of demand we saw at our properties as restrictions further eased into July. And I'm also pleased that our focus on cost and productivity across labor, player reinvestment and other streamline initiatives remain a key priority for our regional teams. 
And finally, on Macau, in the second quarter, we delivered sequential improvements over the first, amid a choppy GGR environment that remains well below pre-pandemic levels. Despite this, MGM China, given our strength in premium mass, continued to outperform our former position in the marketplace. We believe the rate of Macau's recovery will continue to hinge on broader sentiment as we pace the vaccinations rollout throughout the regions, which will ultimately lead to sustainable easing of travel restrictions. 
With the Guangdong outbreak quickly contained, July was off to a better start when we saw visitation and business volumes striking a pickup again. And while the region had felt some additional speed bumps in recent days, with the government's expeditious efforts to contain the outbreak and border restrictions easing over time, we expect gradual growth demand for travel to Macau throughout the end of the second half of the year. 
We remain committed to elevating our footprint in Macau and will soon be increasing our upscale suite inventory. We have finalized the construction and fitting in the South Tower suites and MGM Cotai and are pleased with the final product, which we believe will be well received by our premier mass clients. We are now in soft opening in order to make final adjustments to our product and to achieve a level of service that meets our high-quality of standards. We expect to officially open it later this month, and further, we completed the gaming space refresh in MGM Macau and are now looking at remodeling our villas.  
At both properties, we're enhancing our F&B options focused on the gaming floors, and over time, we have the ability to build out another hotel tower at MGM Cotai, along with meaningful entertainment assets to diversify our offerings. I am confident in Macau's longer-term growth prospects and firmly believe our investment in premium product positions us well for a broader recovery.  
With that, I'll turn this over to Jonathan to discuss our second quarter in more detail."
286798,1672702918,2391408,"MGM Resorts International, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","MGM Resorts International","Executives","Thanks a lot, Bill. Let's first discuss our second quarter results. Our consolidated second quarter net revenues were $2.3 billion, significantly better sequentially over our first quarter results. Our net income attributable to MGM Resorts was $105 milli",1651,"Thanks a lot, Bill. Let's first discuss our second quarter results. Our consolidated second quarter net revenues were $2.3 billion, significantly better sequentially over our first quarter results. Our net income attributable to MGM Resorts was $105 million, and our second quarter adjusted EBITDAR improved sequentially to $607 million -- $617 million, once again, heavily driven by our domestic operations. Our Las Vegas Strip net revenues in the second quarter were $1 billion, 31% below the second quarter of 2019 and 28% below, excluding Circus Circus Las Vegas, which was sold at the end of 2019.  
Despite the lower top line, we delivered far superior EBITDAR results. Our second quarter adjusted property EBITDAR was $397 million, which is 5% below the second quarter of 2019 and just 1% lower, excluding Circus. Hold had a $6 million negative impact to our EBITDAR this quarter, so Hold-adjusted Strip EBITDAR in Las Vegas was $403 million. Our Strip margins improved almost 1,100 basis points to an all-time record of 39.5%. And this does not include the results of CityCenter, which generated $120 million of EBITDAR at a 46% margin. 
As Bill mentioned in his remarks, our margin improvement was driven by a combination of strong leisure and casino demand, continued cost control and the operating leverage inherent in our business. Naturally, with limited convention business and entertainment, we are driving more visitation from customers that we know. 
And our second quarter casino room mix was 9 points above pre-COVID levels. Furthermore, our second quarter casino revenues were 15% above 2019 levels and contributed to 35% of our overall net revenues in the second quarter. This compares to roughly 22% in all of 2019. 
We're seeing particular strength in the slot customer. Our second quarter slot handle was 23% greater than that of the second quarter of 2019 on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding Circus Circus. And for the first time since being impacted by COVID, we are now attracting the older 65-plus demographic to our Strip properties at levels commensurate with what we were seeing pre-pandemic.
Our second quarter occupancy was 77%, an improvement from 46% in the first quarter with weekends and weekdays at 94% and 70%, respectively. June occupancy was 83%, with weekends and weekdays at 96% and 79%, respectively. July occupancy was 86%. As pent-up demand -- as pent-up leisure demand stabilizes longer term, we believe this will be offset by ramping group business, and I echo Bill's comments that we're very pleased with the current trajectory of that segment's rebound.
I'll close on Las Vegas with some thoughts on margins. Longer term, we believe that the 40% margins we achieved this past quarter will stabilize a bit lower as casino spend and overall business mix normalizes, and also as we ramp up staffing to more sustainable levels in order to serve our guests more fully. However, I know that we have further upside in overall profit dollars as our top line continues to rebound with group business and entertainment. I'm also confident that our focus on operational excellence and cost efficiency efforts will allow us to achieve Strip margins well above 2019 levels long term.
Now on to our regional operations. Our second quarter regional net revenues of $856 million were aided by the continuing easing of statewide restrictions, and we're just 6% below that of the second quarter in 2019. We delivered adjusted property EBITDAR well over 2019 levels, 22% to be exact, to $318 million. Much like in Las Vegas, we're driving success in casino, with second quarter casino revenues outpacing 2019 levels by 8%, primarily due to slots and our higher-end customer base. 
Our 50 to 64 age demographic, of which I'm a proud member, is now at 2019 levels, and we're attracting more of the 65-plus age demographic. Our second quarter regional margin of 37% was also an all-time record, growing 855 basis points over the second quarter of 2019 and sequentially by 316 basis points over the first quarter. 
Our regional margin growth is a continued testament to all the great work that our teams have put into maximizing the effectiveness of our operating model and rethinking how we run our business. This ranges from marketing reinvestment to procurement, from energy utilization to labor management. And the breadth of our efforts gives me confidence that we will deliver on the $450 million of cost savings domestically, which we previously identified. 
Our margins of the regions will likely normalize a bit lower from second quarter levels longer-term as casino spend adjusts over time and as we reintroduce F&B and entertainment, especially in our destination markets. We also expect to rightsize labor in the near term, which has certainly had a favorable impact on our margins, but it's also become a bottleneck in certain segments of our operations, negatively impacting our EBITDAR. Still, similar to Las Vegas, I know that we can achieve regional margins well above 2019 levels longer term. 
Our joint venture BetMGM is clearly the #1 operator in U.S. iGaming and has solidified its #2 position nationwide in U.S. sports betting and iGaming. Net revenues associated with BetMGM operations grew 19% sequentially from the first quarter to $194 million in the second quarter. This was driven by growth in both iGaming and online sports betting verticals as a result of increased customer acquisition and strong retention that yielded more first time deposits and actives. These results are especially impressive during a quarter with arguably minimal exogenous catalysts, no major state launches, a seasonally low sports calendar and a further reopening of brick-and-mortar casinos. 
Our share of BetMGM's losses in the second quarter amounted to $46 million, which is reported as a part of unconsolidated affiliates line of our adjusted EBITDA calculation. We remain excited about BetMGM's strong positioning in this fast-growing marketplace and both partners remain committed to its long-term success.
Finally, in Macau, market-wide GGR sequentially improved 7% in the second quarter, but still remained depressed at only 35% of second quarter 2019 levels. Nevertheless, as Bill mentioned earlier, MGM China outperformed the market, with its GGR having recovered to 43% of pre-pandemic levels. MGM China's second quarter net revenues were $311 million, up slightly from the first quarter. Adjusted property EBITDAR of $9 million also improved quarter-over-quarter from $5 million in the first quarter. Hold-adjusted EBITDAR was $13 million on 2.75% VIP win in second quarter compared to 3.29% in the first quarter. Mass Hold was also lower sequentially.
Our second quarter corporate expense, excluding share-based compensation, was $90 million, which included $6.5 million in transaction costs. We expect that our quarterly net corporate expense will run a bit higher going forward as we ramp our investments in IT, our digital offerings and our IR efforts in Japan. In the near term, we also expect to incur incremental costs related to our recently announced transactions.
We were active share repurchasers in the second quarter, having repurchased 5.6 million shares for $220 million. We believe our shares are attractively valued and we've purchased an additional 6.8 million shares for $263 million in the third quarter through today, bringing us to $615 million of share repurchases year-to-date.
Bill talked about our recent milestones in simplifying our story and becoming asset light. We sold MGM Springfield's underlying real estate to MGP for $400 million at a 13.3x rent multiple or a 7.5% cap rate. We also transacted on CityCenter, effectuating a high watermark on the sale of real estate assets at an 18.1x rent multiple or a 5.5% cap rate and acquiring ownership of 100% of the operations of ARIA and Vdara at an implied multiple of 8.9x based on CityCenter's 2019 adjusted EBITDA from resort operations of $425 million. 
CityCenter's second quarter results demonstrate the premium quality of the property, the excellence of its management team and its cash flow generating potential with adjusted EBITDA of $120 million, 13% above the second quarter of 2019 and with margins of 46%.
And finally, we announced today the transaction with VICI, whereby we will receive $43 per unit or approximately $4.4 billion in cash for a majority of our MGP OP units. As part of the agreement, we'll hold an approximately 1% stake in the newly combined company valued at nearly $400 million. We will enter into an amended and restated master lease with VICI, with initial year's rent at $860 million. The transaction values MGP at an implied 17.5x pro rata EBITDA multiple or a 5.8% cap rate.
So it's been a busy and a productive quarter. We expect to close on CityCenter by the end of the third quarter, on Springfield by the end of the year, and our transaction with VICI will likely take us into the first half of next year to close. And all of these transactions are subject to regulatory approvals. 
The end result is a cleaner, more focused company, a streamlined reporting structure and a stronger deployable cash position to maximize shareholder value and advance our vision to be the world's premier gaming entertainment company.
As of June 30, our liquidity position, excluding MGM China and MGP, was $6.5 billion and $11.6 billion adjusted for the aforementioned announcements. On last quarter's call, I highlighted our approach to capital allocation, and it is certainly worth reiterating today.
First, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity. Second, we'll return cash to shareholders, which we have done convincingly thus far this year. We will continue to take a disciplined and programmatic approach to shareholder -- share repurchases for the balance of the year. And third, when assessing potential growth opportunities, we'll invest where we have clear advantages. And we'll exercise discipline in measuring prospective returns for our shareholders. As we evaluate uses of our shareholders' capital over time, these priorities will act as a blueprint for our decision-making process. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks."

One is certainly the -- just the higher levels of casino spend from our customers that we've been experiencing over the past 6 months. And we're not simply just kind of taking this business. We are driving that demand through our marketing channels. And so we've earned those revenue levels for sure. But they are elevated compared to what they've been in the past. 
And that's what I referred to in our remarks, is some expectation that over time, as other avenues for spending are available in our properties, that perhaps that mix normalizes a bit. But at the same time, our hotel RevPAR is still below where it was back in '19 fairly materially, both by occupancy as well as overall rates. And that presents tremendous upside. That's high-margin revenue for us. We fully expect to be able to get back to those levels over the next year or so. And that will lead to -- that will be very profitable revenue growth for us. At the same time, much of that is, of course, going to come with the recovery of the group business. 
So there are the puts and takes, as you put it. We're just -- we're doing the best we can to account in the future for the impact that some of our labor additions are expected to have, but there are clearly sources of upside in revenue and even margin performance, mostly around the hotel mix."

Obviously, the regional play that Corey has mentioned and Jonathan and BetMGM are really the 4 key drivers. And 1 interesting tidbit I stumbled on this morning, Corey just mentioned it's somewhat in Michigan. One of the questions that's come up with BetMGM is about cannibalization. It's interesting. Detroit just got 46.5% market share in brick-and-mortar. And we lead the market in iGaming at 38%, and that's an increase in the mid-30s. We were 43% in June.

I think longer term, look, there's a commitment we're making to Japan and to Osaka that we would be a true partner in this. There's an actual requirement for 30% equity in it to be classified or qualified, if you will. But REITs are something that are in Japan. And so I think longer term, we'll see.

Beyond that, we'll look for opportunities to -- inorganic opportunities to really further the company's vision as a premier gaming entertainment company globally. 
In terms of our leverage targets, the company's capital structure is changing from a traditional senior debt structure to the leases that we have. And that will -- that certainly impacts our thinking about leverage, because the lease payments do represent financial leverage on the business. And a lease-adjusted leverage level of 4 to 5x, we think, is reasonable for a business of our geographic diversification.

Thank you, Chad, and I'll be quick since this has gone a little bit over. Again, I just want to call out and thank our team, both universally and specific the deal teams that got us through this quarter with this tremendous pace. We're coming off an amazing quarter. July is even more so. So I know what we have put in play is trackable, is doable and sustainable. And so we're very excited by that. 
Labor and supply chain remain an issue for our company as it does the industry. But we've also learned a lot from that. By not having some things easily accessible to us we figured out different and potentially better ways to do things. And so those learnings aren't going to go away. 
We're going to remain vigilant and keep the pressure on with COVID, particularly as it relates to our employees and making sure we get them vaccinated. We're making good headway over the last 30 days, and we'll continue to push on that aggressively. We look forward to our group business returning in the back half of the year and have no reason to believe that at this date that it won't with some velocity. 
BetMGM continues to shine. There's no reason to believe that second half of this year it is not going to do the same. And as we've all talked about, we have this tremendous liquidity position we're now looking at. And so the future is bright and the opportunity is, I think, extensive. But again, we're going to be patient and disciplined about what we do and when we do it.

Over the past few months, we've had the honor and the privilege of welcoming back guests back to our properties at a remarkable pace, both in Las Vegas and our regional markets.

Over the past few months, we've had the honor and the privilege of welcoming back guests back to our properties at a remarkable pace, both in Las Vegas and our regional markets. It's been rewarding to see our guests taking in all the world-class gaming and entertainment experiences that only MGM Resorts can provide, and it's been equally gratifying to witness the tremendous effort of our employees delivering these experiences. We have an amazing team of people here at MGM Resorts, the best in the business. And so I'd like to take this time to thank them today for their hard work and dedication to our company and our guests, especially over the last 18 months. I can't say enough how critically important they have been, will continue to be to our success as we carry out our vision to be the world's premier gaming and entertainment company. 
In fact, investing in our people and our planet is the foundation upon which we've built our strategic plan for the company's long-term vision. Our strategic plan consists of the following 4 priorities: investing in our people and our planet, providing unique experiences for our guests by leveraging data-driven customer insights and digital capabilities, delivering operational excellence at every level, and allocating our capital responsibly to drive the highest returns for our shareholders. In driving our vision, we have long discussed our goals of simplifying our corporate structure and monetizing our real estate premium valuations to become asset light. We've been busy on this front. And over the past 90 days, we've meaningfully advanced this strategy. 
In May, we announced an agreement to sell and lease back MGM Springfield, underlying real estate to MGM Growth Properties. We followed that news in July with an agreement to purchase Infinity World's 50% interest in CityCenter and then to subsequently sell and lease back the underlying real estate to Blackstone at an unprecedented cap rate for a gaming asset. And we're very excited to become the full owners of Aria and Vdara operations soon.  
I'd also like to take this time to thank Bill Grounds from Infinity World, who has on the heels of this transaction stepped down from MGM's Board after serving us since 2013. He's been a great partner for many years, and we wish him the very best in the future.  
And finally, as you know, we have spent significant time and effort working on the best solutions for our stated goal of deconsolidating MGP. And this morning, we were pleased to announce a comprehensive transaction with VICI and MGP to monetize the majority of our operating partnership units for approximately $4.4 billion in cash at a multiple that's among the strongest in all gaming real estate transactions to date. This is a great win for MGM and MGP, and we're excited by our new long-term partnership with VICI. 
Again, I'm incredibly proud of our finance, operating and legal teams, who have been accomplishing an astonishing amount in a short order to get these transactions across the finish line.  
Combining these transactions grant us greater financial flexibility by the means of $11.6 billion in domestic liquidity. And importantly, they allow us to intensify our focus on maximizing growth in our core business and pursuing opportunities that align to our long-term vision. 
In terms of such opportunities, we remain committed to our sports betting and iGaming joint venture, BetMGM, which continues to impress. Having expanded its net revenues and its leadership position in the second quarter, BetMGM is the #2 operator in the space nationwide, and in the second quarter, it commended 24% share of its live markets. BetMGM remains a clear leader in iGaming, having reached a 30% market share in the second quarter, and we also continue to see the benefits of customer acquisition cross pollinization between MGM and BetMGM. 
In the second quarter, 15% of BetMGM's new players came from MGM and 31% of MGM -- M life sign-ups came from BetMGM. We'll strategically invest in our digital capabilities and customer growth strategies, driving innovation and a deeper customer loyalty throughout technology led customer-centric experiences, products and services. These efforts will be led by Tilak Mandadi, who we recently hired as our Chief Strategy, Innovation and Technology Officer. Tilak is a visionary, a results-driven leader who has spent several decades of experience at both Disney and American Express, where he led similar initiatives. Tilak will also be leading our relationship with BetMGM joining its Board of Directors. He's another fantastic addition to our senior leadership team and complementary to the deep bench we've now built with recent additions of Jonathan as CFO; and Jyoti Chopra as our Chief People, Inclusion and Sustainability Officer. I have no doubt that Tilak will be invaluable to the company's future.  
We'll also increase our diversification into Asia through the footprint expansion in Macau and the integrated resort opportunity in Japan. As a matter of fact, we officially submitted our RFP as a sole bidder for the Osaka license a couple of weeks ago, which starts the clock on a 3-month review process. We and our local partners, ORIX, remain excited by the opportunity, which we expect will yield very attractive returns. We look forward to Osaka reviewing our proposal, and hopefully, I'm confident, we'll ultimately be named Osaka's designee operator early this fall.  
And lastly, we continue to study key regional markets of significance, including commercial gaming license at Empire City in New York.  
Before I turn it over to Jonathan to delve into our second quarter results, I'd like to say a few words on our current business trends and our future outlook. We reported a great second quarter at our domestic properties, driven by pent-up consumer demand and high domestic casino spend as well as our ability to yield our business and maintain our cost discipline efforts. In fact, we delivered all-time record margins in both Las Vegas and regional segments as well as all-time record EBITDA quarters at our regional properties. 
Further, 11 of our 17 domestic properties had all-time record quarters in slot gross win. And that momentum continued into July with another record month that exceeded June. 
I can't tell you enough under these circumstances how pleased and proud I am of our entire team. We have righted the ship, and we're going full steam ahead. In Las Vegas, our weekend volumes are back to normal, driven by leisure and domestic casino customers with ADRs now surpassing 2019 levels. The weekday while improving continued to lag the weekends in the second quarter due to lower level of group business. That being said, June kicked off a series of citywide events coming to town such as World Of Concrete and Surfaces, and we anticipate a return of groups here in the third and fourth quarter. Feedback from meeting participants have been very positive. Our lead volumes in the year for the year, production is now close to normal levels, which we expect will help midweek occupancy uplift in the back half of the year. We continue to believe that full convention business recovery will be post '21 event, solidifying itself in the second half of 2022, and we remain pleased with how our '22 and '23 group calendar is shaping up as well as contract commitments for the future.  
In July, we relaunched entertainment with a great line of events that was met with overwhelming demand and now with Allegiant Stadium hosting large-scale entertainment, we can now drive more meaningful compression, especially at the mid- to south end of the Strip. Consider the entertainment programming a few weekends ago, we had Garth Brooks at Allegiant Stadium, we had a McGregor fight at T-Mobile and Bruno Mars at Park MGM, selling over 98,000 tickets within our properties distance situated to capture significant amount of this foot traffic.  
While our conviction in the long-term viability of our business remains stronger than ever, the recent rising number of COVID cases and the subsequent actions taken by the CDC and local regulators and our reinstituted mask mandates here in Las Vegas of note is a reminder that the pandemic is not completely behind us. In Las Vegas, we continue to facilitate vaccinations among our employee base and have partnered with the Governor's Office to host multiple vaccination clinics including 1 at T-Mobile Arena, another on the Strip at The Park. And we're using the full weight of our business and resources as part of this effort, including significant incentive offers to both guests and employees who get vaccinated or bring friends and family to get vaccinated. 
We've also invested in ongoing educational employee campaigns as well as providing easy access to all 3 vaccines on pop-up clinics at all of our properties. In July, we implemented a mandatory COVID testing program for all of our Las Vegas employees, who have not proven proof of vaccination. We've taken the virus very seriously, and as always, the health and safety of our guests and employees is our top priority.  
At this time, it's too early to speak to any meaningful impact to our business, but we are monitoring the situation closely. And we'll continue to proactively work safely to accommodate guests and our properties. July, as I mentioned before, was the best month this year and by far in terms of operating performance, we ultimately feel great about our long-term positioning in Las Vegas. The last few months have inevitably proven that the city remains resilient to a top destination for both business and specifically for tourism.  
Our regional properties that I mentioned earlier, delivered their best quarter-to-date yet in terms of EBITDAR. We are encouraged by the stability of demand we saw at our properties as restrictions further eased into July. And I'm also pleased that our focus on cost and productivity across labor, player reinvestment and other streamline initiatives remain a key priority for our regional teams. 
And finally, on Macau, in the second quarter, we delivered sequential improvements over the first, amid a choppy GGR environment that remains well below pre-pandemic levels. Despite this, MGM China, given our strength in premium mass, continued to outperform our former position in the marketplace. We believe the rate of Macau's recovery will continue to hinge on broader sentiment as we pace the vaccinations rollout throughout the regions, which will ultimately lead to sustainable easing of travel restrictions. 
With the Guangdong outbreak quickly contained, July was off to a better start when we saw visitation and business volumes striking a pickup again. And while the region had felt some additional speed bumps in recent days, with the government's expeditious efforts to contain the outbreak and border restrictions easing over time, we expect gradual growth demand for travel to Macau throughout the end of the second half of the year. 
We remain committed to elevating our footprint in Macau and will soon be increasing our upscale suite inventory. We have finalized the construction and fitting in the South Tower suites and MGM Cotai and are pleased with the final product, which we believe will be well received by our premier mass clients. We are now in soft opening in order to make final adjustments to our product and to achieve a level of service that meets our high-quality of standards. We expect to officially open it later this month, and further, we completed the gaming space refresh in MGM Macau and are now looking at remodeling our villas.  
At both properties, we're enhancing our F&B options focused on the gaming floors, and over time, we have the ability to build out another hotel tower at MGM Cotai, along with meaningful entertainment assets to diversify our offerings. I am confident in Macau's longer-term growth prospects and firmly believe our investment in premium product positions us well for a broader recovery.  
With that, I'll turn this over to Jonathan to discuss our second quarter in more detail."
286798,1672702918,2391409,"MGM Resorts International, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","MGM Resorts International","Executives","Thanks a lot, Bill. Let's first discuss our second quarter results. Our consolidated second quarter net revenues were $2.3 billion, significantly better sequentially over our first quarter results. Our net income attributable to MGM Resorts was $105 milli",1651,"Thanks a lot, Bill. Let's first discuss our second quarter results. Our consolidated second quarter net revenues were $2.3 billion, significantly better sequentially over our first quarter results. Our net income attributable to MGM Resorts was $105 million, and our second quarter adjusted EBITDAR improved sequentially to $607 million -- $617 million, once again, heavily driven by our domestic operations. Our Las Vegas Strip net revenues in the second quarter were $1 billion, 31% below the second quarter of 2019 and 28% below, excluding Circus Circus Las Vegas, which was sold at the end of 2019.  
Despite the lower top line, we delivered far superior EBITDAR results. Our second quarter adjusted property EBITDAR was $397 million, which is 5% below the second quarter of 2019 and just 1% lower, excluding Circus. Hold had a $6 million negative impact to our EBITDAR this quarter, so Hold-adjusted Strip EBITDAR in Las Vegas was $403 million. Our Strip margins improved almost 1,100 basis points to an all-time record of 39.5%. And this does not include the results of CityCenter, which generated $120 million of EBITDAR at a 46% margin. 
As Bill mentioned in his remarks, our margin improvement was driven by a combination of strong leisure and casino demand, continued cost control and the operating leverage inherent in our business. Naturally, with limited convention business and entertainment, we are driving more visitation from customers that we know. 
And our second quarter casino room mix was 9 points above pre-COVID levels. Furthermore, our second quarter casino revenues were 15% above 2019 levels and contributed to 35% of our overall net revenues in the second quarter. This compares to roughly 22% in all of 2019. 
We're seeing particular strength in the slot customer. Our second quarter slot handle was 23% greater than that of the second quarter of 2019 on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding Circus Circus. And for the first time since being impacted by COVID, we are now attracting the older 65-plus demographic to our Strip properties at levels commensurate with what we were seeing pre-pandemic.
Our second quarter occupancy was 77%, an improvement from 46% in the first quarter with weekends and weekdays at 94% and 70%, respectively. June occupancy was 83%, with weekends and weekdays at 96% and 79%, respectively. July occupancy was 86%. As pent-up demand -- as pent-up leisure demand stabilizes longer term, we believe this will be offset by ramping group business, and I echo Bill's comments that we're very pleased with the current trajectory of that segment's rebound.
I'll close on Las Vegas with some thoughts on margins. Longer term, we believe that the 40% margins we achieved this past quarter will stabilize a bit lower as casino spend and overall business mix normalizes, and also as we ramp up staffing to more sustainable levels in order to serve our guests more fully. However, I know that we have further upside in overall profit dollars as our top line continues to rebound with group business and entertainment. I'm also confident that our focus on operational excellence and cost efficiency efforts will allow us to achieve Strip margins well above 2019 levels long term.
Now on to our regional operations. Our second quarter regional net revenues of $856 million were aided by the continuing easing of statewide restrictions, and we're just 6% below that of the second quarter in 2019. We delivered adjusted property EBITDAR well over 2019 levels, 22% to be exact, to $318 million. Much like in Las Vegas, we're driving success in casino, with second quarter casino revenues outpacing 2019 levels by 8%, primarily due to slots and our higher-end customer base. 
Our 50 to 64 age demographic, of which I'm a proud member, is now at 2019 levels, and we're attracting more of the 65-plus age demographic. Our second quarter regional margin of 37% was also an all-time record, growing 855 basis points over the second quarter of 2019 and sequentially by 316 basis points over the first quarter. 
Our regional margin growth is a continued testament to all the great work that our teams have put into maximizing the effectiveness of our operating model and rethinking how we run our business. This ranges from marketing reinvestment to procurement, from energy utilization to labor management. And the breadth of our efforts gives me confidence that we will deliver on the $450 million of cost savings domestically, which we previously identified. 
Our margins of the regions will likely normalize a bit lower from second quarter levels longer-term as casino spend adjusts over time and as we reintroduce F&B and entertainment, especially in our destination markets. We also expect to rightsize labor in the near term, which has certainly had a favorable impact on our margins, but it's also become a bottleneck in certain segments of our operations, negatively impacting our EBITDAR. Still, similar to Las Vegas, I know that we can achieve regional margins well above 2019 levels longer term. 
Our joint venture BetMGM is clearly the #1 operator in U.S. iGaming and has solidified its #2 position nationwide in U.S. sports betting and iGaming. Net revenues associated with BetMGM operations grew 19% sequentially from the first quarter to $194 million in the second quarter. This was driven by growth in both iGaming and online sports betting verticals as a result of increased customer acquisition and strong retention that yielded more first time deposits and actives. These results are especially impressive during a quarter with arguably minimal exogenous catalysts, no major state launches, a seasonally low sports calendar and a further reopening of brick-and-mortar casinos. 
Our share of BetMGM's losses in the second quarter amounted to $46 million, which is reported as a part of unconsolidated affiliates line of our adjusted EBITDA calculation. We remain excited about BetMGM's strong positioning in this fast-growing marketplace and both partners remain committed to its long-term success.
Finally, in Macau, market-wide GGR sequentially improved 7% in the second quarter, but still remained depressed at only 35% of second quarter 2019 levels. Nevertheless, as Bill mentioned earlier, MGM China outperformed the market, with its GGR having recovered to 43% of pre-pandemic levels. MGM China's second quarter net revenues were $311 million, up slightly from the first quarter. Adjusted property EBITDAR of $9 million also improved quarter-over-quarter from $5 million in the first quarter. Hold-adjusted EBITDAR was $13 million on 2.75% VIP win in second quarter compared to 3.29% in the first quarter. Mass Hold was also lower sequentially.
Our second quarter corporate expense, excluding share-based compensation, was $90 million, which included $6.5 million in transaction costs. We expect that our quarterly net corporate expense will run a bit higher going forward as we ramp our investments in IT, our digital offerings and our IR efforts in Japan. In the near term, we also expect to incur incremental costs related to our recently announced transactions.
We were active share repurchasers in the second quarter, having repurchased 5.6 million shares for $220 million. We believe our shares are attractively valued and we've purchased an additional 6.8 million shares for $263 million in the third quarter through today, bringing us to $615 million of share repurchases year-to-date.
Bill talked about our recent milestones in simplifying our story and becoming asset light. We sold MGM Springfield's underlying real estate to MGP for $400 million at a 13.3x rent multiple or a 7.5% cap rate. We also transacted on CityCenter, effectuating a high watermark on the sale of real estate assets at an 18.1x rent multiple or a 5.5% cap rate and acquiring ownership of 100% of the operations of ARIA and Vdara at an implied multiple of 8.9x based on CityCenter's 2019 adjusted EBITDA from resort operations of $425 million. 
CityCenter's second quarter results demonstrate the premium quality of the property, the excellence of its management team and its cash flow generating potential with adjusted EBITDA of $120 million, 13% above the second quarter of 2019 and with margins of 46%.
And finally, we announced today the transaction with VICI, whereby we will receive $43 per unit or approximately $4.4 billion in cash for a majority of our MGP OP units. As part of the agreement, we'll hold an approximately 1% stake in the newly combined company valued at nearly $400 million. We will enter into an amended and restated master lease with VICI, with initial year's rent at $860 million. The transaction values MGP at an implied 17.5x pro rata EBITDA multiple or a 5.8% cap rate.
So it's been a busy and a productive quarter. We expect to close on CityCenter by the end of the third quarter, on Springfield by the end of the year, and our transaction with VICI will likely take us into the first half of next year to close. And all of these transactions are subject to regulatory approvals. 
The end result is a cleaner, more focused company, a streamlined reporting structure and a stronger deployable cash position to maximize shareholder value and advance our vision to be the world's premier gaming entertainment company.
As of June 30, our liquidity position, excluding MGM China and MGP, was $6.5 billion and $11.6 billion adjusted for the aforementioned announcements. On last quarter's call, I highlighted our approach to capital allocation, and it is certainly worth reiterating today.
First, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity. Second, we'll return cash to shareholders, which we have done convincingly thus far this year. We will continue to take a disciplined and programmatic approach to shareholder -- share repurchases for the balance of the year. And third, when assessing potential growth opportunities, we'll invest where we have clear advantages. And we'll exercise discipline in measuring prospective returns for our shareholders. As we evaluate uses of our shareholders' capital over time, these priorities will act as a blueprint for our decision-making process. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks."

As you think about kind of being at a 40% margin level and that incremental $400 million of revenue that should come back over time, is it being overly conservative to say that the kind of margins do compress over the long term? Or is there some spend here over the medium-term that might kind of bring margins in a little bit before they could rise again from kind of the natural operating leverage of getting that revenue back?"

Thank you for the question, Carlo, and it's well posed. Because there are a few dynamics going on here. One is certainly the -- just the higher levels of casino spend from our customers that we've been experiencing over the past 6 months. And we're not simply just kind of taking this business. We are driving that demand through our marketing channels. And so we've earned those revenue levels for sure. But they are elevated compared to what they've been in the past. 
And that's what I referred to in our remarks, is some expectation that over time, as other avenues for spending are available in our properties, that perhaps that mix normalizes a bit. But at the same time, our hotel RevPAR is still below where it was back in '19 fairly materially, both by occupancy as well as overall rates. And that presents tremendous upside. That's high-margin revenue for us. We fully expect to be able to get back to those levels over the next year or so. And that will lead to -- that will be very profitable revenue growth for us. At the same time, much of that is, of course, going to come with the recovery of the group business. 
So there are the puts and takes, as you put it. We're just -- we're doing the best we can to account in the future for the impact that some of our labor additions are expected to have, but there are clearly sources of upside in revenue and even margin performance, mostly around the hotel mix."

Obviously, the regional play that Corey has mentioned and Jonathan and BetMGM are really the 4 key drivers. And 1 interesting tidbit I stumbled on this morning, Corey just mentioned it's somewhat in Michigan. One of the questions that's come up with BetMGM is about cannibalization. It's interesting. Detroit just got 46.5% market share in brick-and-mortar. And we lead the market in iGaming at 38%, and that's an increase in the mid-30s. We were 43% in June. We're 46.5% in July, and we're holding at 38% market share in iGaming.

So for us, it's a $2 billion to $2.25 billion check. Probably over '24, '25 and '26, give or take, if you want to think about how that might flow itself through the system. 
I think longer term, look, there's a commitment we're making to Japan and to Osaka that we would be a true partner in this. There's an actual requirement for 30% equity in it to be classified or qualified, if you will. But REITs are something that are in Japan. And so I think longer term, we'll see. But in the short term, it's about a $2 billion to $2.5 billion cash commitment over 3 years. And depending, again, on licensing, '24, '25 and '26 is probably the best way to think about that."

Beyond that, we'll look for opportunities to -- inorganic opportunities to really further the company's vision as a premier gaming entertainment company globally. 
In terms of our leverage targets, the company's capital structure is changing from a traditional senior debt structure to the leases that we have. And that will -- that certainly impacts our thinking about leverage, because the lease payments do represent financial leverage on the business. And a lease-adjusted leverage level of 4 to 5x, we think, is reasonable for a business of our geographic diversification.

Thank you, Chad, and I'll be quick since this has gone a little bit over. Again, I just want to call out and thank our team, both universally and specific the deal teams that got us through this quarter with this tremendous pace. We're coming off an amazing quarter. July is even more so. So I know what we have put in play is trackable, is doable and sustainable. And so we're very excited by that. 
Labor and supply chain remain an issue for our company as it does the industry. But we've also learned a lot from that. By not having some things easily accessible to us we figured out different and potentially better ways to do things. And so those learnings aren't going to go away. 
We're going to remain vigilant and keep the pressure on with COVID, particularly as it relates to our employees and making sure we get them vaccinated. We're making good headway over the last 30 days, and we'll continue to push on that aggressively. We look forward to our group business returning in the back half of the year and have no reason to believe that at this date that it won't with some velocity. 
BetMGM continues to shine. There's no reason to believe that second half of this year it is not going to do the same. And as we've all talked about, we have this tremendous liquidity position we're now looking at. And so the future is bright and the opportunity is, I think, extensive. But again, we're going to be patient and disciplined about what we do and when we do it.  
So having said that, I appreciate everyone's attendance, and thank you all."

Well, we delivered another quarter of strong domestic results with our Las Vegas Strip and regional segments, reaching all-time adjusted property EBITDA records in the third quarter. I remain in all of what our talented teams have accomplished this year given the ongoing COVID pandemic. We are emerging from a stronger company with a sharpened focus on operational efficiencies and providing the best experiences for our guests as we carry out the vision to become the world's premier gaming entertainment company. I continue to express my sincere pride and gratitude of the tremendous effort of our employees, who are the foundation upon which we built our strategic plan and long-term vision. As a reminder, our strategic plan consists of the following 4 key elements: investing in our people in planet, providing unique experiences for guests by leveraging data-driven consumer insights and digital capabilities, delivering operational excellence at every level, and allocating our capital responsibly to yield the high returns to our shareholders. .
On last earnings call, we discussed the meaningful steps our company has taken to simplify our story and monetize our real estate. We have reached a number of milestones in this regard. In August, we announced a transaction with [ VICI ] and MGP to redeem the majority of our operating partnership units and deconsolidate MGP within our financial reporting structure. In September, we acquired the other 50% interest in CityCenter, monetizing its underlying real estate and are now proud owners of 100% of its operations. In October, we monetized MGM Springfield's underlying real estate as well. And these transactions [indiscernible] the financial flexibility to take foothold of front-footed actions to invest in our core business and to maximize growth and pursue opportunities that align to our long-term vision. 
For example, this quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire the operations of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, a high-quality resort with enviable product offerings, strong brand awareness and complementary customer base making it an ideal addition to our Las Vegas Strip portfolio. We also believe that the synergies we have identified are highly achievable. We are incredibly excited to welcome The Cosmopolitan team to the MGM Resorts family, pending the transaction closing next year. 
Now I've mentioned in the past that we are happy with the amount of exposure we currently have in Las Vegas. As such, we are currently in the early stages of a process to sell the operations of the Mirage. Doing so will allow us to maintain our existing Las Vegas exposure, while focusing on the complementary and diverse nature of our offerings in our hometown. I spent the early part of my career at Mirage have been a part of that team's opening of the property in 1989. It's a stored property with great brand recognition and a strong customer and loyal following. The campus also sits on approximately 77 acres that provides attractive development opportunities to capture large amounts of foot traffic. Mirage has served us well over the years, and we are certain it will remain a success with a new operator in the future. Importantly, I want to thank our valued team members at the Mirage. They're an integral part of what makes that property so special, and I know they will remain strong ambassadors of the brand during this transition. 
We also remain keen on diversifying our business and further expanding our operations globally. To that end, in September, we announced that our MGM-Orix consortium had achieved a milestone in Japan having been selected as a Osaka's partner to build and operate a world-class integrated resort. We are now working with Orix in the city to submit an area development plan to the central government in the coming months and are hopeful and confident that we'll be awarded a license next year. Outside of Japan, we will continue to study key U.S. regional markets of significance. This includes the commercial gaming license in New York, for which we believe MGM is well positioned given our existing operations at Empire City. 
Moving on to BetMGM. Our sports betting and iGaming venture continues to build on its success every quarter. In the third quarter, BetMGM launched in 3 new states: Arizona, South Dakota and Wyoming. And within a short 9-day period, BetMGM is now live in 16 markets and is well on its way to 20 by the end of the first quarter of 2022. In the 3 months ending August, BetMGM commanded 23% share nationwide in both U.S. sports and betting and iGaming. And in the month of August, we believe BetMGM was competing for first place driven by iGaming in which BetMGM remains the clear leader with a 32% market share. 
We're in the middle of the NFL season and the market remains competitive, however, the team has performed exceptionally well, focusing on ROI-positive marketing spend, and we are encouraged to see early signs of a more rational environment as the season progresses. BetMGM continued momentum through this year has been extraordinary, and we expect full year 2021 net revenues associated with BetMGM will be in excess of $800 million. 
Finally, we think about opportunities for organic growth in our core business. We have a great network of premier properties across the U.S. that we believe we can better leverage to drive customer choice, increase loyalty and maximize wallet share over time. For example, we recently launched a new tailgating experience at Mandalay for events at Allegiant Stadium. We've hosted Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga's concert of Park MGM, and completed our room remodels at Bellagio's main tower as well as the pyramid at Luxor with additional remodels ongoing at Aria suites and villas. We also continue to focus on targeting strategies that draw on our competitive advantage to acquire and drive sustainable growth from high-value customers in our business. Over the years, we will invest in customer-centric products and services to execute these strategies, which we will be enabled by advanced marketing practices and enhanced physical and digital experiences. 
Before I turn it over to Jonathan to discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to make some high-level comments on our current trends and our future outlook. I must say it's simply great to be in Las Vegas right now. We've kicked off the quarter exceptionally strong, anchored by a great fourth of July holiday, better than pre-pandemic casino spend levels, and pent-up demand for the city's wide-scale entertainment relaunch that drew large crowds in the town, especially on the weekends. While the Delta variant impacted our group business during the quarter, we have been able to offset with leisure and casino customers. With cases on the downswing, we have built -- quickly, we built momentum into October. And the level of demand in the marketplace, especially on the weekends, has simply been incredible, October will be another all-time record month. Groups are still coming to town. We have a healthy amount of group room nights on the books through the rest of the year. And we look ahead -- and as we look ahead, we feel good about our group business coming together, anchored by the back half of this year and what's already on the books for '23 and 2024. 
With the relaunch of large-scale entertainment in July, these offerings are driving visitation to Las Vegas. [indiscernible] Stadium brings fans to the strip for events, and we've had some of the best weekends around these events. The Raiders estimate that roughly 60% of tickets are sold to out-of-state fans. And when the majority of the 50,000 to 60,000 people walking to and from [indiscernible] Stadium over the Hacienda Bridge between Mandalay Bay and Luxor, we are seeing significant broad-based uplift at both properties on event days and even more so on Raiders games. 
We're also driving our own destiny with a fantastic line of events across our venues, which have been met with great enthusiasm whether it was the McGregor fight at T-Mobile, which by the way, produced our second highest single day for table games win in the company's history, or the debut of our new Americas Got Talent Show At Luxor this week. We continue to demonstrate that the city, and MGM Resorts is a leading destination for exceptional entertainment. 
Turning to our regional properties. As I mentioned earlier, our regional operations delivered another all-time record EBITDAR and margin quarter driven by continued strength in our rated gaming spend levels as we yield to our higher net worth customers. With the easing of statewide restrictions, we have begun to strategically reintroduce entertainment and F&B at all of our regional properties. And I'm gratified that our customers can once again enjoy the quality experience for which MGM is known. 
On the cost side, our team continues to focus on productivity across labor, player reinvestment and other streamlining initiatives, and this gives us great confidence in our ability to sustain strong margins as we head into 2022. 
I'll conclude with some final thoughts on Macau. The market continues to operate well below pre-pandemic levels as varying forms of travel restrictions have limited visitation to the region. The obvious catalyst to Macau's recovery is a sustained resumption of frictionless travel between Macau, Hong Kong and Mainland China, which heavily relies on the higher vaccination rates that will take some time. When the market does rebound more meaningfully, we believe MGM China is well positioned given its strength in premium mass. Macau remains an important part of our business, and we have high conviction in the future success of this region. We will continue to work with the government, and we are highly confident in ultimately getting our license renewed. Ongoing discussions with the government give us a greater confidence in our belief that the process will be both judicious and fair. We look forward to further promoting the long-term development of Macau's gaming industry and to supporting the government's tourism and diversification goals for the region. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jonathan to discuss the details before some final comments and questions. Jonathan?"

And now with only 60 days until the start o",1865,"Thanks very much, Bill. I certainly join Bill and gratitude to our entire team for outstanding results this quarter. What a difference in performance and momentum as we have moved through the course of the year. And now with only 60 days until the start of 2022, I could not be more excited about our prospects for the year ahead, and it's all due to the heroic efforts of our thousands of colleagues here at MGM Resorts. Now let's talk about our third quarter results in some detail. 
Our consolidated third quarter net revenues were $2.7 billion, a 19% sequential improvement over our second quarter results. Our net income attributable to MGM Resorts was $1.4 billion driven by a $1.6 billion net gain from the consolidation of CityCenter. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDAR improved sequentially to $765 million, led once again by our domestic operations. 12 of our 18 domestic properties achieved either all-time or third quarter EBITDAR records, and 15 achieved either all-time or third quarter margin records. This performance was driven by strong leisure, transient and domestic casino demand. 
We have demonstrated our ability to improve and expand our operations while maintaining cost discipline, all against the backdrop of ramping nongaming revenues and a stabilizing workforce complement. Our Las Vegas Strip net revenues were $1.4 billion, just 8% below the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted property EBITDAR for the Strip was $535 million, 21% above the third quarter of 2019. Hold had a $20 million positive impact on our EBITDAR this quarter. So hold adjusted Strip EBITDAR was approximately $514 million. Our Strip margins were 39% in the third quarter, a 943 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2019 and a slight decline on a sequential basis over the second quarter of 2021. This was driven by a combination of effective casino marketing efforts and continued cost discipline across the business. Availability of labor also improved sequentially each month in the third quarter, and our payroll per FTE remained in line with the third quarter of 2019. 
We continue to attract strong casino demand and drive healthy performance in the third quarter. Here are a few data points. Third quarter Strip casino room nights were 27% greater than in the third quarter of 2019. Casino revenues per casino room night was up 10% above the third quarter of 2019. And not surprisingly, our slot handle was an all-time quarterly record. All of this translated into third quarter casino revenues increasing to 26% above the third quarter of 2019, contributing 31% of our total Strip revenues in the third quarter, and that compares to our casino revenue mix of 22% back in 2019. Our Strip hotel occupancy was 82% in the third quarter, improving from 77% in the second quarter. And for the first time since reopening, the third quarter's room rates ran higher than pre-pandemic levels, with ADR 10% above that of the third quarter of 2019 or 5% when we exclude Circus Circus. We finished a strong October with occupancy of 92%, the highest since reopening, and we expect November and December to be strong but also to follow seasonal slowdowns as we typically do every year heading into the holidays. 
As we ramp staffing and our nongaming revenues increasingly become larger contributors to our overall business, I expect margins to come in a bit in our Las Vegas operations. Our customers demand, and our willing to pay for the breadth of offerings we provide here at MGM Resorts. And while healthy margins are an important feature of our business model and financial health, we are focused on growing our absolute EBITDAR dollars, a goal well supported by future upside from the recovery in group events and international visitation. We expect our margins to stabilize well above pre-pandemic levels, resulting from our efficiency and cost-saving efforts. 
Finally, it's important to note that we closed the CityCenter transactions towards the end of the quarter. And as a result, we started consolidating CityCenter within our Las Vegas Strip results beginning on September 27. Our third quarter Strip numbers include 4 days of Aria and Vidaras results. Led by [ Anton Nikodemus ] and his team, the CityCenter joint venture reported quarter-to-date ended September 26, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $120 million, with 40% margins. Had CityCenter been consolidated for the full quarter, our Las Vegas Strip EBITDAR would have been approximately 22% higher than what we reported in the third quarter. Its magnitude and growth potential makes CityCenter a difference maker for us financially. 
Our third quarter regional net revenues were $925 million, just 1% below that of the third quarter in 2019. We delivered adjusted property EBITDAR of $348 million, which was 29% above 2019 levels and 9% above what we achieved in the second quarter of 2021. Our regional casino business further strengthened in the third quarter with our slots and table games volumes improving sequentially by 6% and 11%, respectively, from the second quarter this year. 
We measure rated player spend levels through theoretical win or theo per day, net of promotions. Our net theo per day for our rated customers reached record levels in the third quarter, led by our younger demographic despite fewer trips as compared with their visitation pre-COVID. Unlike the younger crowd, visitation and spend from our -- from our 65-plus demographic has not yet fully recovered but we're encouraged with the resiliency in this segment's demand, especially through the Delta variant outbreak. Our third quarter regional margins of 38% were another all-time record growing 886 basis points over the third quarter of 2019. While our strong EBITDAR margin has benefited from elevated casino spend, and importantly, also validates the great work that our teams have put into maximizing the effectiveness of our operating model and rethinking how we run our business. 
Disciplined customer reinvestment is a key component of this, where we track marketing efficiency across all of our properties against specific goals. With the return of more nongaming amenities, we'll continue to exercise prudence in our marketing reinvestment strategies, taking a test-and-learn approach to ensure intended returns on any increases in reinvestment. We're also rightsizing labor in the near term, which has had a near-term favorable impact on our margins, but it's also caused capacity constraints in certain segments of our operations. Overall, I believe our regional margins will stabilize well above 2019 levels.
Moving on to BetMGM. Our 50% share of BetMGM's losses in the third quarter amounted to $49 million, which is reported as a part of the unconsolidated affiliates line of our adjusted EBITDAR calculation. Net revenues associated with BetMGM operations were $227 million in the quarter, exhibiting a 17% sequential growth from the second quarter, led by the continued strength in iGaming. This was partially offset by heavier customer acquisition and reactivation spend from BetMGM's successful Arizona launch and the return of football, resulting in September first-time deposits growing to over 5x, 5x that of September 2020. We know that an omni-channel customer is worth more than a single channel customer. We're particularly excited about the mutually beneficial advantages of our omnichannel strategy with BetMGM, and we remain its top partner for driving new players. In the third quarter, 16% of BetMGM's new players were attributed to MGM, meaning they were active with MGM in the last 12 months. This percentage has remained in a relatively stable range while BetMGM has significantly broadened its reach, illustrating our ability to continually optimize the conversion of M life members to BetMGM. 
The BetMGM team previously disclosed during their April Investor Day that MGM-sourced players have much lower customer acquisition costs and over 5x the marketing ROI when compared to non-MGM-sourced players. What's also encouraging is that in New Jersey, our most mature market, based upon preliminary data, we found that MGM-sourced omni customers are spending more on property at Borgata than they did when they were exclusively land-based. And clearly, the benefit goes both ways. In the third quarter, 42% of our new M life sign-ups have come from BetMGM, which plays a crucial role in our database expansion, a database which currently stands at over 37 million members. 
Finally, in Macau, third quarter market-wide gross gaming revenues sequentially declined 26% from the second quarter and was 27% of the third quarter 2019. MGM China's third quarter results were also sequentially lower from the second quarter with net revenues of $289 million and adjusted property EBITDAR of $7 million. Hold adjusted EBITDAR was a $2 million loss. While the latest hurdles surrounding the local outbreaks in Macau negatively impacted travel in September and most of October, the situation has now largely been contained. And with quarantine-free travel having resumed on October 19, the markets seen daily visitation rebound from less than 1,000 in the first 18 days to over 26,000 for the remainder of the month. 
Our third quarter corporate expense, excluding share-based compensation, was $105 million, which included approximately $18 million of transaction costs for both MGM and MGP. We expect that our net corporate expense will run at a similar level in the fourth quarter, heavily driven by our ramping Japan efforts as well as our investments in IT and digital. In the near term, we also expect to incur incremental costs related to our recently announced transactions. 
We believe repurchasing our shares is an attractive use of capital. In the third quarter, we repurchased 17.2 million shares for $687 million, and we purchased an additional 1.8 million shares for $80 million in the fourth quarter through today. That's $1.1 billion of share repurchases year-to-date, or approximately 5% of our market cap. And that is this year since March. Over the past few months, we announced some significant deals that simplify our corporate structure, further bolster our liquidity position and advance our vision to be the world's premier gaming entertainment company. We closed the CityCenter transactions in the third quarter. In October, we closed the MGM Springfield transaction for cash proceeds of $400 million. Our transaction with [ VICI ] is on track to close in the first half of next year, subject to regulatory approvals, at which point we will bring in an additional $4.4 billion in proceeds. In September, we announced an agreement to acquire the operations of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for $1.625 billion. This represents a multiple of approximately 8x adjusted EBITDA inclusive of expected operational synergies, and revenue growth opportunities that we have identified. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of next year, subject to regulatory approvals. 
As of September 30, our liquidity position, excluding MGM China and MGP, was $6.4 billion, or $9.6 billion when adjusted for the Springfield, [ VICI ] and The Cosmopolitan transactions. So our approach to capital allocation is critical. And our approach to capital allocation will be as follows. First, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity. Second, we will return cash to our shareholders. And finally, when assessing potential growth opportunities, we'll invest where we have clear advantages, and will exercise discipline in measuring prospective returns for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks."

I was hoping maybe you can talk about it in a sort of a different way and think about returning cash to shareholders, maybe kind of near term, medium term and long term. Obviously, in the near term, you have more cash coming in. And if you get another $500 million or $600 million from Mirage, that's just even more to play with. Longer term, you have Japan, but that's not going to be a huge source in any given year. And then medium term, you have whatever external growth opportunities that maybe you want to kind of talk about how you're thinking about that.

I'll offer a few thoughts. First of all, the real estate monetizations that we have undertaken recently, and I would include the MGP transaction in that category broadly, really is the completion of a strategy that the company began 4 or 5 years ago. And I think when originally conceived, the idea was that we would be monetizing the cash to shareholders. And so I think to address the question directly that the completion of that strategy, freeing up that cash will likely entail some accelerated return of that capital to shareholders as we've been doing this year. That's, I think, a different matter from the long term -- the longer-term plan for return of capital to shareholders, which will be driven really out of free cash flow of the business, whereas in the shorter term, it's really driven more by these asset transactions we've undertaken. 
And then just finally, as it relates to October, we've been disciplined and regular, repurchases of our shares, but we certainly we moderate depending upon where we see the share price to a certain extent. So we remain active because we believe that the share price right now is still attractively values the company, but we do moderate our purchases from time-to-time."

Look, through COVID, through obviously the Great Recession, we've got some deferred maintenance. So there's a couple of projects we're going to do here regarding rooms and catching up, not a massive amount of capital in relative terms, but real money. We are just getting started in the digital world. You understand what we've done to date. And as we continue to think about expanding that business with partners, through partners or with others, that will take some capital. Clearly, it's a space in the place. We've indicated many times, we want to be progressive in and be dominant in both domestic and potentially a global basis. And so I think that will take some cash. Japan, you're right, it's down the road. It's probably not until '24 and beyond. And New York, hopefully, they'll start earlier. And I'm hoping in '23, we've given an opportunity to deploy some cash there and start to grow that business. We set it as a unique opportunity sitting on 97 acres, 15 miles from downtown Manhattan. We can't help but think we could do more there. And so those are some of the immediate things that I think lie ahead. And then obviously, we'll wait and see."

And we have a JV that's not -- in the context of basic structure. It's not pure in terms of value creation. So we understand all of that. I think as you look forward, though, we've had all enough exposure and experience to understand a couple of things. BetMGM is here to stay. It will be a dominant player in this space. We can argue every day all day 1, 2 or 3. What's really relevant to us are 2 things. We dominate in iGaming, principally based on the heels of legacy of who and what we are. I think the BetMGM folks put up a great gaming product. We've seen our branded products work exceptionally well. We have a huge database to lean into it. And ultimately, we're going to have a huge reward mechanism with the omnichannel idea of coming to Las Vegas or some of our regional properties to enjoy themselves with a great retail footprint. I mean not only are we in the places that are obvious. But next year, in Arizona, at the Cardinal Stadium, we're going to have a presence. We are literally opening as we speak in that stadium a betting shop. And so we're going to be in other places, and we have an opportunity finally with Illinois freeing up to get into Illinois come, hopefully, March or April of next year. And so no, obviously, we think there could be more value accretive to it. It is complicated. But we know we have a serious bet. We know we have a serious play.

As it relates to Las Vegas margins, the margins of about 39% this quarter. They do benefit from the higher intensity of gaming revenue that we have. As we introduce more nongaming revenue and offerings to the system, and that's going on literally during the month of November with a number of our entertainment offerings opening here. And certainly, we anticipate more groups and so more catering and banquet revenue. We will be making a trade and a very profitable trade over time of customers as lower-worth gaming customers are yielded for in favor of group customers as we go into 2022. Now that's a good trade for us. The group customer will generate revenue per occupied room, 80% higher than a leisure customer will or a lower-rated gaming customer, but they'll do so at a slightly lower margin. And that's the effect that I was trying to describe in the remarks. So we, back in 2019, had margins in the high 20s. And of course, now we're in the high 30s. I expect that with a proper mix of business that will be well above those margins back in 2019, meeting our profit improvement goal of $450 million across the enterprise. But believe me, we have also -- we've learned a lot about ways to do our business differently over the past 9 months, and we don't intend on backtracking there to carry that better margin performance even against a more normalized mix of business."

Obviously, we're buying and selling at the same time, so we understand the marketplace. We all heard [ Tom Reeg ] yesterday. We agree. We think there is an opportune time and we think this might be at the sell asset in Las Vegas. And so it became for us the obvious one.

And I'm excited for somebody to come in and make it their marquee property. I think between the billers that are there, the access to the real estate, its general location.

We've gone from losing money to making a little bit of money again. So we've shifted back into the black. And as long as we don't hit yet another instance, we'll hopefully stay there and grow from that. Obviously, we submitted on the 29th, like all the other concessionaires and many other people in the community, by the way, answers to the 9 core questions that were asked. We had an opportunity to brief that with the government. They'll now continue that public consultation process. I suspect that will go on for another days or so. That's obviously up to their discretion when end that and form some of their own opinions. 
Whether this all gets done in time for June, we don't know yet because there are some steps that they still have to publicly go through with LegCo. But I feel good about what was said. I feel good that we had an opportunity to air some of our concerns, and that they were heard and listened to. And so I think it's relatively given the environment and given what it take been progressive. We've been there like everyone else 20 years. They've been fair to us to date as we have to them. And I think we've been good to the community and vice versa. And so hopefully, we continue on. Whether this gets done by June, I just don't know. There's some complications around several of the issues, as you know. And so time to tell."

As a matter of fact, reports of the job that I want to catch up with MGM to in the context of reaching out to customers, understanding game type, cycles, what they like to do, how they like to do, how to personalize it for them, identifying them. And then we have hosting groups, both at BetMGM and MGM that are tied together. We have -- for example, on site here, we have a Vice President of Marketing, whose principal and only job is to market to and make sure programs are attached to BetMGM and those customers, whether it's sign up when somebody registered at Aria down to making sure their best customers are taking care of, making sure they get tickets for what they may want to have earned or done. And so we're as linked up as one can be at this point in time. I think we have some work to do on the back-end loyalty to make it completely seamless. But now through tier credits, they have exposure to anything and everything they want and can get. And so again, we lean heavily into iGaming. I feel really good about it, and we'll continue to develop product. And it's a combination of branded product, homemade product and licenses with some of the biggest brands, and generally speaking, doing very well."

And clearly to kind of provide that metric right now would be to provide guidance into 2022 consolidated EBITDA, and we're not going to do that yet. Regarding the question around leverage for the business, I do think on a lease-adjusted basis, this business can comfortably sustain 4 to 5x leverage, and that's adjusting our lease expense at 8x the rent, which is the convention and observers of the company. I think given the company's diversification both geographically as well as by business segment that we can sustain that level of leverage.

Well, we delivered another quarter of strong domestic results with our Las Vegas Strip and regional segments, reaching all-time adjusted property EBITDA records in the third quarter. I remain in awe of what our talented teams have accomplished this year given the ongoing COVID pandemic. We are emerging from it a stronger company with a sharpened focus on operational efficiencies and providing the best experiences for our guests as we carry out the vision to become the world's premier gaming entertainment company. 
I continue to express my sincere pride and gratitude of the tremendous effort of our employees, who are the foundation upon which we built our strategic plan and long-term vision. As a reminder, our strategic plan consists of the following 4 key elements: investing in our people and planet, providing unique experiences for guests by leveraging data-driven consumer insights and digital capabilities, delivering operational excellence at every level, and allocating our capital responsibly to yield the high returns to our shareholders.
On last earnings call, we discussed the meaningful steps our company has taken to simplify our story and monetize our real estate. We have reached a number of milestones in this regard. In August, we announced a transaction with VICI and MGP to redeem the majority of our operating partnership units and deconsolidate MGP within our financial reporting structure. In September, we acquired the other 50% interest in CityCenter, monetizing its underlying real estate and are now proud owners of 100% of its operations.
In October, we monetized MGM Springfield's underlying real estate as well. And these transactions grant us the financial flexibility to take foothold of front-footed actions to invest in our core business and to maximize growth and pursue opportunities that align to our long-term vision.
For example, this quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire the operations of the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, a high-quality resort with enviable product offerings, strong brand awareness and complementary customer base making it an ideal addition to our Las Vegas Strip portfolio. We also believe that the synergies we have identified are highly achievable. We are incredibly excited to welcome The Cosmopolitan team to the MGM Resorts family, pending the transaction closing next year.
Now I've mentioned in the past that we are happy with the amount of exposure we currently have in Las Vegas. As such, we are currently in the early stages of a process to sell the operations of the Mirage. Doing so will allow us to maintain our existing Las Vegas exposure, while focusing on the complementary and diverse nature of our offerings in our hometown. I spent the early part of my career at Mirage, I've been a part of that team's opening of the property in 1989. It's a stored property with great brand recognition and a strong customer and loyal following.
The campus also sits on approximately 77 acres that provides attractive development opportunities to capture large amounts of foot traffic. Mirage has served us well over the years, and we are certain it will remain a success with a new operator in the future. Importantly, I want to thank our valued team members at the Mirage. They're an integral part of what makes that property so special, and I know they will remain strong ambassadors of the brand during this transition.
We also remain keen on diversifying our business and further expanding our operations globally. To that end, in September, we announced that our MGM Orix consortium had achieved a milestone in Japan having been selected as a Osaka's partner to build and operate a world-class integrated resort. We are now working with Orix in the city to submit an area development plan to the central government in the coming months and are hopeful and confident that we'll be awarded a license next year. 
Outside of Japan, we will continue to study key U.S. regional markets of significance. This includes the commercial gaming license in New York, for which we believe MGM is well positioned given our existing operations at Empire City.
Moving on to BetMGM. Our sports betting and iGaming venture continues to build on its success every quarter. In the third quarter, BetMGM launched in 3 new states: Arizona, South Dakota and Wyoming. And within a short 9-day period, BetMGM is now live in 16 markets and is well on its way to 20 by the end of the first quarter of 2022. In the 3 months ending August, BetMGM commanded 23% share nationwide in both U.S. sports and betting and iGaming. And in the month of August, we believe BetMGM was competing for first place driven by iGaming in which BetMGM remains the clear leader with a 32% market share.
We're in the middle of the NFL season and the market remains competitive, however, the team has performed exceptionally well, focusing on ROI-positive marketing spend, and we are encouraged to see early signs of a more rational environment as the season progresses. BetMGM continued momentum through this year has been extraordinary, and we expect full year 2021 net revenues associated with BetMGM will be in excess of $800 million.
Finally, we think about opportunities for organic growth in our core business. We have a great network of premier properties across the U.S. that we believe we can better leverage to drive customer choice, increase loyalty and maximize wallet share over time. For example, we recently launched a new tailgating experience at Mandalay for events at Allegiant Stadium. We've hosted Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga's concert of Park MGM, and completed our room remodels at Bellagio's main tower as well as the pyramid at Luxor with additional remodels ongoing at Aria suites and villas. We also continue to focus on targeting strategies that draw on our competitive advantage to acquire and drive sustainable growth from high-value customers in our business. Over the years, we will invest in customer-centric products and services to execute these strategies, which we will be enabled by advanced marketing practices and enhanced physical and digital experiences.
Before I turn it over to Jonathan to discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to make some high-level comments on our current trends and our future outlook. I must say it's simply great to be in Las Vegas right now. We've kicked off the quarter exceptionally strong, anchored by a great fourth of July holiday, better than pre-pandemic casino spend levels, and pent-up demand for the city's wide-scale entertainment relaunch that drew large crowds in the town, especially on the weekends. While the Delta variant impacted our group business during the quarter, we have been able to offset with leisure and casino customers. With cases on the downswing, we have built -- quickly, we built momentum into October. And the level of demand in the marketplace, especially on the weekends, has simply been incredible, October will be another all-time record month. 
Groups are still coming to town. We have a healthy amount of group room nights on the books through the rest of the year. And we look ahead -- and as we look ahead, we feel good about our group business coming together, anchored by the back half of this year and what's already on the books for '23 and 2024.
With the relaunch of large-scale entertainment in July, these offerings are driving visitation to Las Vegas. Allegiant Stadium brings fans to the Strip for events, and we've had some of the best weekends around these events. The Raiders estimate that roughly 60% of tickets are sold to out-of-state fans. And with the majority of the 50,000 to 60,000 people walking to and from Allegiant Stadium over the Hacienda Bridge between Mandalay Bay and Luxor, we are seeing significant broad-based uplift at both properties on event days and even more so on Raiders games.
We're also driving our own destiny with a fantastic line of events across our venues, which have been met with great enthusiasm whether it was the McGregor fight at T-Mobile, which by the way, produced our second highest single day for table games win in the company's history, or the debut of our new Americas Got Talent Show At Luxor this week. We continue to demonstrate that the city, and MGM Resorts is a leading destination for exceptional entertainment.
Turning to our regional properties. As I mentioned earlier, our regional operations delivered another all-time record EBITDAR and margin quarter driven by continued strength in our rated gaming spend levels as we yield to our higher net worth customers. With the easing of statewide restrictions, we have begun to strategically reintroduce entertainment and F&B at all of our regional properties. And I'm gratified that our customers can once again enjoy the quality experience for which MGM is known.
On the cost side, our team continues to focus on productivity across labor, player reinvestment and other streamlining initiatives, and this gives us great confidence in our ability to sustain strong margins as we head into 2022.
I'll conclude with some final thoughts on Macau. The market continues to operate well below pre-pandemic levels as varying forms of travel restrictions have limited visitation to the region. The obvious catalyst to Macau's recovery is a sustained resumption of frictionless travel between Macau, Hong Kong and Mainland China, which heavily relies on the higher vaccination rates that will take some time. 
When the market does rebound more meaningfully, we believe MGM China is well positioned given its strength in premium mass. Macau remains an important part of our business, and we have high conviction in the future success of this region. We will continue to work with the government, and we are highly confident in ultimately getting our license renewed. Ongoing discussions with the government give us a greater confidence in our belief that the process will be both judicious and fair. We look forward to further promoting the long-term development of Macau's gaming industry and to supporting the government's tourism and diversification goals for the region.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jonathan to discuss the details before some final comments and questions. Jonathan?"

I certainly join Bill in gratitude to our entire team for outstanding results this quarter. What a difference in performance and momentum as we have moved through the course of the year. And now with only 60 days until the start of",1860,"Thanks very much, Bill. I certainly join Bill in gratitude to our entire team for outstanding results this quarter. What a difference in performance and momentum as we have moved through the course of the year. And now with only 60 days until the start of 2022, I could not be more excited about our prospects for the year ahead, and it's all due to the heroic efforts of our thousands of colleagues here at MGM Resorts. Now let's talk about our third quarter results in some detail.
Our consolidated third quarter net revenues were $2.7 billion, a 19% sequential improvement over our second quarter results. Our net income attributable to MGM Resorts was $1.4 billion driven by a $1.6 billion net gain from the consolidation of CityCenter. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDAR improved sequentially to $765 million, led once again by our domestic operations. 12 of our 18 domestic properties achieved either all-time or third quarter EBITDAR records, and 15 achieved either all-time or third quarter margin records. This performance was driven by strong leisure, transient and domestic casino demand.
We have demonstrated our ability to improve and expand our operations while maintaining cost discipline, all against the backdrop of ramping nongaming revenues and a stabilizing workforce complement. Our Las Vegas Strip net revenues were $1.4 billion, just 8% below the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted property EBITDAR for the Strip was $535 million, 21% above the third quarter of 2019. 
Hold had a $20 million positive impact on our EBITDAR this quarter. So Hold Adjusted Strip EBITDAR was approximately $514 million. Our Strip margins were 39% in the third quarter, a 943 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2019 and a slight decline on a sequential basis over the second quarter of 2021. This was driven by a combination of effective casino marketing efforts and continued cost discipline across the business. Availability of labor also improved sequentially each month in the third quarter, and our payroll per FTE remained in line with the third quarter of 2019.
We continue to attract strong casino demand and drive healthy performance in the third quarter. Here are a few data points. Third quarter Strip casino room nights were 27% greater than in the third quarter of 2019. Casino revenues per casino room night was up 10% above the third quarter of 2019. And not surprisingly, our slot handle was an all-time quarterly record. All of this translated into third quarter casino revenues increasing to 26% above the third quarter of 2019, contributing 31% of our total Strip revenues in the third quarter, and that compares to our casino revenue mix of 22% back in 2019. 
Our Strip hotel occupancy was 82% in the third quarter, improving from 77% in the second quarter. And for the first time since reopening, the third quarter's room rates ran higher than pre-pandemic levels, with ADR 10% above that of the third quarter of 2019 or 5% when we exclude Circus Circus. We finished a strong October with occupancy of 92%, the highest since reopening, and we expect November and December to be strong but also to follow seasonal slowdowns as we typically do every year heading into the holidays.
As we ramp staffing and our nongaming revenues increasingly become larger contributors to our overall business, I expect margins to come in a bit in our Las Vegas operations. Our customers demand, and are willing to pay for the breadth of offerings we provide here at MGM Resorts. And while healthy margins are an important feature of our business model and financial health, we are focused on growing our absolute EBITDAR dollars, a goal well supported by future upside from the recovery in group events and international visitation. We expect our margins to stabilize well above pre-pandemic levels, resulting from our efficiency and cost-saving efforts.
Finally, it's important to note that we closed the CityCenter transactions towards the end of the quarter. And as a result, we started consolidating CityCenter within our Las Vegas Strip results beginning on September 27. Our third quarter Strip numbers include 4 days of Aria and Vdara's results. Led by Anton Nikodemus and his team, the CityCenter joint venture reported quarter-to-date ended September 26, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $120 million, with 40% margins. Had CityCenter been consolidated for the full quarter, our Las Vegas Strip EBITDAR would have been approximately 22% higher than what we reported in the third quarter. Its magnitude and growth potential makes CityCenter a difference maker for us financially.
Our third quarter regional net revenues were $925 million, just 1% below that of the third quarter in 2019. We delivered adjusted property EBITDAR of $348 million, which was 29% above 2019 levels and 9% above what we achieved in the second quarter of 2021. Our regional casino business further strengthened in the third quarter with our slots and table games volumes improving sequentially by 6% and 11%, respectively, from the second quarter this year.
We measure rated player spend levels through theoretical win or theo per day, net of promotions. Our net theo per day for our rated customers reached record levels in the third quarter, led by our younger demographic despite fewer trips as compared with their visitation pre-COVID. Unlike the younger crowd, visitation and spend from our -- from our 65-plus demographic has not yet fully recovered but we're encouraged with the resiliency in this segment's demand, especially through the Delta variant outbreak. 
Our third quarter regional margins of 38% were another all-time record growing 886 basis points over the third quarter of 2019. While our strong EBITDAR margin has benefited from elevated casino spend, and importantly, also validates the great work that our teams have put into maximizing the effectiveness of our operating model and rethinking how we run our business.
Disciplined customer reinvestment is a key component of this, where we track marketing efficiency across all of our properties against specific goals. With the return of more nongaming amenities, we'll continue to exercise prudence in our marketing reinvestment strategies, taking a test-and-learn approach to ensure intended returns on any increases in reinvestment. We're also rightsizing labor in the near term, which has had a near-term favorable impact on our margins, but it's also caused capacity constraints in certain segments of our operations. Overall, I believe our regional margins will stabilize well above 2019 levels.
Moving on to BetMGM. Our 50% share of BetMGM's losses in the third quarter amounted to $49 million, which is reported as a part of the unconsolidated affiliates line of our adjusted EBITDAR calculation. Net revenues associated with BetMGM operations were $227 million in the quarter, exhibiting a 17% sequential growth from the second quarter, led by the continued strength in iGaming. 
This was partially offset by heavier customer acquisition and reactivation spend from BetMGM's successful Arizona launch and the return of football, resulting in September first-time deposits growing to over 5x, 5x that of September 2020. We know that an omni-channel customer is worth more than a single channel customer. We're particularly excited about the mutually beneficial advantages of our omnichannel strategy with BetMGM, and we remain its top partner for driving new players. In the third quarter, 16% of BetMGM's new players were attributed to MGM, meaning they were active with MGM in the last 12 months. This percentage has remained in a relatively stable range while BetMGM has significantly broadened its reach, illustrating our ability to continually optimize the conversion of M life members to BetMGM.
The BetMGM team previously disclosed during their April Investor Day that MGM-sourced players have much lower customer acquisition costs and over 5x the marketing ROI when compared to non-MGM-sourced players. What's also encouraging is that in New Jersey, our most mature market, based upon preliminary data, we found that MGM-sourced omni customers are spending more on property at Borgata than they did when they were exclusively land-based. And clearly, the benefit goes both ways. In the third quarter, 42% of our new M life sign-ups have come from BetMGM, which plays a crucial role in our database expansion, a database, which currently stands at over 37 million members.
Finally, in Macau, third quarter market-wide gross gaming revenues sequentially declined 26% from the second quarter and was 27% of the third quarter 2019. MGM China's third quarter results were also sequentially lower from the second quarter with net revenues of $289 million and adjusted property EBITDAR of $7 million. Hold adjusted EBITDAR was a $2 million loss. While the latest hurdles surrounding the local outbreaks in Macau negatively impacted travel in September and most of October, the situation has now largely been contained. And with quarantine-free travel having resumed on October 19, the market has seen daily visitation rebound from less than 1,000 in the first 18 days to over 26,000 for the remainder of the month.
Our third quarter corporate expense, excluding share-based compensation, was $105 million, which included approximately $18 million of transaction costs for both MGM and MGP. We expect that our net corporate expense will run at a similar level in the fourth quarter, heavily driven by our ramping Japan effort as well as our investments in IT and digital. In the near term, we also expect to incur incremental costs related to our recently announced transactions.
We believe repurchasing our shares is an attractive use of capital. In the third quarter, we repurchased 17.2 million shares for $687 million, and we purchased an additional 1.8 million shares for $80 million in the fourth quarter through today. That's $1.1 billion of share repurchases year-to-date, or approximately 5% of our market cap, and that is this year since March. 
Over the past few months, we announced some significant deals that simplify our corporate structure, further bolster our liquidity position and advance our vision to be the world's premier gaming entertainment company. We closed the CityCenter transactions in the third quarter. In October, we closed the MGM Springfield transaction for cash proceeds of $400 million. Our transaction with VICI is on track to close in the first half of next year, subject to regulatory approval, at which point we will bring in an additional $4.4 billion in proceeds. 
In September, we announced an agreement to acquire the operations of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for $1.625 billion. This represents a multiple of approximately 8x adjusted EBITDA, inclusive of expected operational synergies, and revenue growth opportunities that we have identified. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of next year, subject to regulatory approvals.
As of September 30, our liquidity position, excluding MGM China and MGP, was $6.4 billion, or $9.6 billion when adjusted for the Springfield, VICI and The Cosmopolitan transactions. So our approach to capital allocation is critical. And our approach to capital allocation will be as follows. First, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity. Second, we will return cash to our shareholders. And finally, when assessing potential growth opportunities, we'll invest where we have clear advantages, and will exercise discipline in measuring prospective returns for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks."

I was hoping maybe you can talk about it in a sort of a different way and think about returning cash to shareholders, maybe kind of near term, medium term and long term. Obviously, in the near term, you have more cash coming in. And if you get another $500 million or $600 million from Mirage, that's just even more to play with. 
Longer term, you have Japan, but that's not going to be a huge source in any given year. And then medium term, you have whatever external growth opportunities that maybe you want to kind of talk about how you're thinking about that. But then when you think about that general overlay, how do you think about sort of the timing of capital return? And the capital return that you mentioned, Jonathan, that the share repurchases in October, has that paused? Or is that still ongoing?"

I'll offer a few thoughts. First of all, the real estate monetizations that we have undertaken recently, and I would include the MGP transaction in that category broadly, really is the completion of a strategy that the company began 4 or 5 years ago. And I think when originally conceived, the idea was that we would be monetizing that real estate, returning the cash to shareholders. And so I think to address the question directly that the completion of that strategy, freeing up that cash will likely entail some accelerated return of that capital to shareholders as we've been doing this year. That's, I think, a different matter from the long term -- the longer-term plan for return of capital to shareholders, which will be driven really out of free cash flow of the business, whereas in the shorter term, it's really driven more by these asset transactions we've undertaken.
And then just finally, as it relates to October, we've been disciplined and regular, repurchases of our shares, but we certainly -- we moderate depending upon where we see the share price to a certain extent. So we remain active because we believe that the share price right now is still attractively values the company, but we do moderate our purchases from time-to-time."

Look, through COVID, through obviously the Great Recession, we've got some deferred maintenance. So there's a couple of projects we're going to do here regarding rooms and catching up, not a massive amount of capital in relative terms, but real money. We are just getting started in the digital world. You understand what we've done to date. And as we continue to think about expanding that business with partners, through partners or with others, that will take some capital. 
Clearly, it's a space in the place, we've indicated many times, we want to be progressive in and be dominant in both domestic and potentially a global basis. And so I think that will take some cash. Japan, you're right, it's down the road. It's probably not until '24 and beyond. And New York, hopefully, they'll start earlier. I'm hoping in '23, we've given an opportunity to deploy some cash there and start to grow that business. We said that's a unique opportunity sitting on 97 acres, 15 miles from Downtown Manhattan. We can't help but think we could do more there. And so those are some of the immediate things that I think lie ahead. And then obviously, we'll wait and see."

So we understand all of that. 
I think as you look forward, though, we've had all enough exposure and experience to understand a couple of things. BetMGM is here to stay. It will be a dominant player in this space. We can argue every day all day 1, 2 or 3. What's really relevant to us are 2 things. We dominate in iGaming, principally based on the heels of legacy of who and what we are. I think the BetMGM folks put up a great gaming product. We've seen our branded products work exceptionally well. 
We have a huge database to lean into it. And ultimately, we're going to have a huge reward mechanism with the omnichannel idea of coming to Las Vegas or some of our regional properties to enjoy themselves with a great retail footprint. I mean not only are we in the places that are obvious. But next year, in Arizona, at the Cardinals Stadium, we're going to have a presence. We are literally opening as we speak in that stadium a betting shop. And so we're going to be in other places, and we have an opportunity finally with Illinois freeing up to get into Illinois come, hopefully, March or April of next year. 
And so no, obviously, we think there could be more value accretive to it. It is complicated. But we know we have a serious bet. We know we have a serious play. And we're continuing to invest and hopefully wisely. I'd like to think we've been a little bit more prudent, judicious than others, but it's not for the ill of heart as we know.

So we didn't go backwards to the contrary. Football got off to a rougher start in September. But all that being said, no, it's motivated and growing in the right direction. I think you heard Jonathan year-over-year 5x more in terms of first-time deposits in September. We like the trajectory of the business. Arizona is off to a massive start for us. And obviously, we've got some other states yet to come here. So no, we don't want to give a real number because we are truly studying it because we want to hold ourselves accountable to it. So we will, by the fourth quarter, though."

As it relates to Las Vegas margins, the margins of about 39% this quarter. They do benefit from the higher intensity of gaming revenue that we have. As we introduce more nongaming revenue and offerings to the system, and that's going on literally during the month of November with a number of our entertainment offerings opening here. And certainly, we anticipate more groups and so more catering and banquet revenue. 
We will be making a trade and a very profitable trade over time of customers as lower-worth gaming customers are yielded for in favor of group customers as we go into 2022. Now that's a good trade for us. A group customer will generate revenue per occupied room 80% higher than a leisure customer will or a lower-rated gaming customer, but they'll do so at a slightly lower margin. And that's the effect that I was trying to describe in the remarks. So we, back in 2019, had margins in the high 20s. And of course, now we're in the high 30s. 
I expect that with a proper mix of business that we'll be well above those margins back in 2019, meeting our profit improvement goal of $450 million across the enterprise. But believe me, we have also -- we've learned a lot about ways to do our business differently over the past 9 months, and we don't intend on backtracking there to carry that better margin performance even against a more normalized mix of business."

But as we look at capital allocation, and we look at the notion of diversification, we have enough of Las Vegas. And so -- and we look at the marketplace right now. 
Obviously, we're buying and selling at the same time, so we understand the marketplace. We all heard Tom Reeg yesterday. We agree. We think there is an opportune time and we think this might be it to sell asset an in Las Vegas. And so it became for us the obvious one. As we think about our portfolio, we think about things going forward in capital allocation. And so no discredit to what's been done there. It's an amazing property. And I'm excited for somebody to come in and make it their marquee property. I think between the villas that are there, the access to the real estate, its general location. I think the right owner could do a lot, but it just fell pretty far down in the spectrum of how much of capital we'd allocate to it in any given period of time in the near future.

That's obviously up to their discretion when to end that and form some of their own opinions.
Whether this all gets done in time for June, we don't know yet because there are some steps that they still have to publicly go through with LegCo. But I feel good about what was said. I feel good that we had an opportunity to air some of our concerns, and that they were heard and listened to.

As a matter of fact, reports of the job that I want to catch up with MGM to in the context of reaching out to customers, understanding game type, cycles, what they like to do, how they like to do, how to personalize it for them, identifying them. 
And then we have hosting groups, both at BetMGM and MGM that are tied together. We have -- for example, on site here, we have a Vice President of Marketing, whose principal and only job is to market to and make sure programs are attached to BetMGM and those customers, whether it's sign up when somebody registered at Aria down to making sure their best customers are taking care of, making sure they get tickets for what they may want to have earned or done. And so we're as linked up as one can be at this point in time. 
I think we have some work to do on the back-end loyalty to make it completely seamless. But now through tier credits, they have exposure to anything and everything they want and can get. And so again, we lean heavily into iGaming. I feel really good about it, and we'll continue to develop product.
