Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. 
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. 
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. 
The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. As a reminder, we are in the quiet period for Spectrum Auction 107, so we will not be able to comment on our mid-band spectrum holdings or strategy at this time. 
Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.11 per share, resulting in full year earnings of $4.30 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported fourth quarter earnings include a pretax loss from special items of approximately $523 million. This includes a net charge of $404 million primarily related to severance, including voluntary separations under our existing plans and the annual mark-to-market for our pension and OPEB liabilities as well as a net loss of $119 million primarily related to the disposition of the HuffPost business. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.21 in the fourth quarter and $4.90 for the full year. 
Let's now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our fourth quarter earnings profile. The impact to earnings from the adoption of accounting standards ASC 606 for revenue recognition is illustrated for comparability purposes and reflects a reduction in the benefit realized due to the deferral of commission expense versus the prior year. We also continue to monitor the ongoing impacts of COVID on our business. The year-over-year impacts of both ASC 606 and COVID were not significant in the fourth quarter. 
The full year 2020 impacts from ASC 606 and COVID were $0.09 and $0.21, respectively, on both a reported and adjusted earnings per share basis. We do not expect the adoption of ASC 606 to have a significant impact on the comparability of 2021 results to 2020. Full year adjusted EPS growth of 1.9%, illustrated on the earnings waterfall slide, reflects the strong underlying performance of the business. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take you through a recap of 2020."

First of all, 2020 was a challenging year, and I can only say that I'm super proud how Verizon responded to the changing environment during 2020. And we supported our customers, our employees and the society in a way that I've never seen before. So all in all, a great year. At the same time, we executed well on our strategy and saw that we had really good financial performance as well. 
When it comes to our 2020 strategic priorities, let me just walk through the execution of them. First of all, strengthening and grow the core business. I'm really proud to announce that we continue to have the best network in the nation. We just got for the 15th time the overall best network with RootMetrics on all 7 different categories. That includes 5G, which is so important to us that we continue to have that lead. 
I'm also happy to announce that we won for the 26th consecutive time the J.D. Powers award. It tells a lot about our network and technology team, how they have been building a network and how we continue to lead this market. 
When it comes to the customer innovation, you have seen us working with our customers to give them richer offering and also even better performance of the network. This year, with Disney+, Discovery Plus, also adding in the iPhone 5 from Apple has, of course, supported a lot of innovation that we're doing in the Verizon Consumer Group. And we see a great migration of our customers to unlimited and to the premium unlimited. 
Finally, you can see also that Verizon Business Group has a year of investments to see that we are putting a foundation to be even stronger for the future, had good growth in the wireless and also in some areas like the public sector, very good performance and also adding a lot of new customers on the enterprise side. When it comes to us leveraging the assets to drive new growth, the commitments we did in February 2020 when it comes to 5G were all met or exceeded. I'm extremely happy with that. 
We now have 64 Ultra Wideband cities. We are more than 10 cities on our home 5G Ultra Wideband. We have 10 mobile edge compute centers public with Amazon. All in all, we deployed more than 5x more Ultra Wideband sites during 2020, and we launched the nationwide 5G that now is covering 230 million POPs in 2,700 cities. 
On the financial side, a strong year ended where we had more than 2% growth in the wireless service revenue. We also have growth on our EPS in the fourth quarter, over 7%. We had an operational cash flow full year of USD 41.8 billion, which is a growth of 17%, a very strong year that put us in a good position when we go into 2021. 
And finally, we have a really large focus on how to include all our 4 stakeholders in the work we're doing. And I'm really proud of the Citizen Verizon that we launched during last year, which is a great way for us to see that the society aspect is part of our strategy, where, of course, our focus on being carbon neutral is very important. And the second green bond was launched at the second half of 2020. So all in all, I have to say, it was a very different year, but a great execution where we hit all our strategic milestones at the same time as we pivot and supported all our stakeholders. 
At the November sell-side event, I presented the 5 vectors of growth. Those are the vectors that is based on our strategy of network as a service. Those are also the enablers for us to get to GDP plus. We have great traction on them, and we also have done quite a lot in 2020, all the way from the 5G adoption to the customer differentiation that I talked a lot about, the new markets that we're addressing still pending the acquisition of Tracfone, but we have other segments we are addressing as well as the next-generation business-to-business application based on our unique mobile edge compute offering that we have with Amazon, also now with Microsoft and many other partners. And finally, the network monetization with our MVNO partners, which are enjoying the best network that we have and we're building. 
All in all, this is built on the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network that we outlined some 3 years ago and giving us the opportunity to have great execution in the future. With that, I would like to hand over to Matt to go through the financials in a little bit more detail."
415798,698771142,2181417,"Verizon Communications Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Verizon Communications Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone.

Total wireless se",2163,"Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by saying how proud I am with the Verizon team and the results we delivered in 2020. 
In the fourth quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $34.7 billion, down 0.2%. Total wireless service revenue growth and strong results in Verizon Media Group were offset by lower wireless equipment revenue and ongoing declines in legacy wireline products. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $11.7 billion as compared to $11.1 billion last year, a 5.3% increase driven by service and other revenue growth and disciplined spending. Full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $47.1 billion. And adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.7%, 90 basis points higher than last year, including headwinds of approximately 40 basis points from the deferral of commission expense. 
Our continued focus on our Business Excellence program has resulted in realized cumulative cash savings of $9.5 billion, and we are well positioned to achieve our $10 billion goal ahead of our year-end 2021 target. COVID has brought about new ways of working, and we believe some of these will be long term in nature. This will create additional savings opportunities beyond the current program. 
As Brady mentioned, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.21, up 7.1% from $1.13 a year ago. We are pleased to report 1.9% growth of full year adjusted EPS at the high end of our revised guidance, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our business. 
Let's now turn to cash flow results on Slide 8. Our cash generation was exceptionally strong in 2020, reflecting our subscription-based business model and the quality of our customer base. This enabled us to continue to execute on our capital allocation model, investing in our business, increasing our dividend for the 14th straight year and strengthening our balance sheet. 
Cash flow from operating activities totaled $41.8 billion for the year, an increase of $6 billion from the prior year driven by continued performance and strength in the business, lower tax payments due to a onetime cash tax benefit received earlier in the year and reductions in working capital primarily due to lower wireless volumes. Capital spending in 2020 totaled $18.2 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband Network and launching our nationwide 5G network. As a result, free cash flow for the year was $23.6 billion, up 32.4% year-over-year. 
Throughout the year, we opportunistically diversified our debt portfolio to optimize our cost of borrowing and retained a higher level of cash as a result of the pandemic. We exited the quarter with net unsecured debt of $96.3 billion, and our net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.0x versus our targeted range of 1.75 to 2.0x. We remain committed to our capital allocation model. 
Now let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 9. Our competitive position is based on compelling unlimited plans that provide choice to consumers paired with the best devices and attractive promotions, all built on the country's best network. This quarter, we launched our nationwide 5G service to coincide with the release of the iPhone 12 lineup, which fully supports our Ultra Wideband offering, enabling Verizon customers to utilize a full range of connectivity provided by this iconic device. 
Partnerships remain a critical component of our value proposition. We recently added Discovery to our list of existing successful partnerships, which includes Apple and Disney. As the early cohort of Disney+ customers have come off of the initial free 12-month period, more than 2/3 have maintained their subscription, either through their Verizon direct billing relationship or by opting into one of our newest Mix & Match plans with the Disney bundle included. 
Volume activity in the quarter was tempered by consumer behavior, given rising COVID cases and elevated store closures that limited foot traffic in addition to the retention offers in the market. As a result, the pool of consumers switching carriers was lower than a year ago. 
Fourth quarter phone gross adds were down approximately 24% year-over-year, relatively consistent with declines experienced in the third quarter. We are pleased with the quality of the additions we are attracting as over 90% of new accounts came in on an unlimited plan, and over 55% of these accounts opted for premium unlimited service. At quarter end, over 60% of our base was on an unlimited plan with more than 20% of our base taking a premium plan. 
Our customer retention remains high with phone churn of 0.76% for the quarter, down 7 basis points from a year ago, contributing to postpaid phone net adds of 163,000. Disconnects related to customers in our Stay Connected program totaled more than 135,000 phones in the quarter. Our Stay Connected program continued to see great results with approximately 95% of customers making a payment since entering the program, and collection cure rates are in line with our expectations. More than 50% of all customers in the program are current on their payments. December was the final month of service billings for the program, and payment activity remained stable, though we will continue to closely monitor payment trends in 2021. 
Turning to Fios. We continue to build on our strong third quarter with consumer Fios Internet net additions of 92,000, more than double the fourth quarter of 2019. Total Fios Internet net additions of 95,000 was the best fourth quarter we have had since 2014 and reflected strong demand for our gigabit offering as consumers continue to work and learn from home. Cord-cutting trends continued, resulting in consumer Fios Video net losses for the quarter of 72,000. 
Now let's move to Slide 10 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. Consumer operating revenues for the fourth quarter were $23.9 billion, down 1.2%. This was primarily driven by a 3.8% decline in wireless equipment revenue due to softer volumes in the quarter. 
For the full year, total Consumer revenue decreased 2.8% to $88.5 billion driven by the decline in wireless equipment revenue. Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter was $13.6 billion, a 1.2% increase. The results reflect the resilience of our business as we recovered from a 2.7% decrease in the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, we delivered ARPA growth of 1.8% year-over-year even as TravelPass and other usage fees remain at subdued levels, demonstrating that our tiered approach to unlimited provides a strong foundation for delivering revenue growth. 
For the full year, Consumer wireless service revenue was $53.6 billion, relatively flat from 2019 levels. Consumer Fios revenue totaled $2.8 billion, a 2.5% decline from a year ago. Customer credits related to regional sports networks negatively impacted Fios revenue by 4.2% in the quarter and also reduced our content expense. We expect Fios revenue to benefit as growth in the broadband base offsets the impact of the shift from the triple-play bundle, the stand-alone service. 
Consumer segment EBITDA grew 2.9% to $9.9 billion. Margins were 41.5% in the quarter, up 160 basis points from last year, including headwinds of approximately 30 basis points from the deferral of commission expense. For the full year, EBITDA margins were 45.5%, an increase of 120 basis points from the prior year, including an impact of approximately 50 basis points from the deferral of commission expense. 
Now let's move to our Business segment on Slide 11. Business wireless trends remained resilient throughout the year, and the fourth quarter was no different. Public sector demand remained strong on the success of our distance learning program and support for increased needs of state and local government agencies. Small and medium business trends improved sequentially, while we experienced modest pressures in enterprise. 
Business segment fund gross adds for the quarter were down 11% from the prior year due to store closures and continued economic weakness. Segment postpaid phone churn was 0.98% in the quarter, which was down 2 basis points over the prior year. As a result, postpaid phone net adds were 116,000. 
Let's now move to Slide 12 to review the Business financial performance. Operating revenues for the Business segment were $8.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down slightly year-over-year. Full year operating revenues of $31 billion represented a decline of 1.5% from the prior year. Wireless service revenue in the quarter accelerated to 7.1% year-over-year from 4.9% in the third quarter, which was more than offset by reductions in wireless equipment volumes and secular pressure on legacy wireline products. 
Looking at wireless service revenue, public sector had a particularly strong quarter. And small and medium business growth improved for the second straight quarter, although it was still below pre-pandemic growth rates. Legacy wireline product trends appear to be normalizing after initially benefiting from the transition to a work-from-home economy. 
The growth in advanced communication services continues to drive opportunities for the segment. While we are pleased with the revenue performance of the Business segment and exit 2020 with momentum, there are uncertainties around how businesses will perform in 2021 given the challenges within the macro environment. The elevated demand experienced in public sector and parts of enterprise throughout 2020 could potentially create headwinds to growth in the Business segment, particularly in the back half of 2021. 
Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.6% in the quarter, up 390 basis points from the year-ago period, reflecting the strength in wireless service revenue and the benefits of our transformation initiatives, including back-office digitalization and optimization. Full year margins of 25.4% were up slightly versus last year. 
Now let's move on to Slide 13 to discuss Verizon Media Group. We are very pleased with Verizon Media Group performance. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, up approximately 11% from a year ago, the first quarter of year-over-year growth since the Yahoo! acquisition. 
Growth in the quarter was fueled by strong advertising trends with demand-type platform revenue growing 41% compared to the prior year. Advertising strength came from political, consumer products, technology and retail, among other verticals. 
The fourth quarter also saw continued high consumer engagement in commerce as offline to online shopping behaviors continued through the holiday season on our owned and operated properties. In particular, mail e-commerce revenue growth was 7x that of the prior year, and we saw continued strength in finance and news as daily active users grew 52% and 11%, respectively. 
Let's now move on to Slide 14 for a quick look at overall wireless performance. Key metrics and financial data of the combined wireless products and services from the Consumer and Business segments are illustrated on this slide. 
Total wireless service revenue was up 2.2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 0.7% for the full year. Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and the supplemental earnings release schedules on our website. 
Now let's focus on our outlook for 2021 on Slide 15. We are excited to deliver 2021 expectations that include accelerating revenue and earnings growth driven by our 5 growth vectors as wireless service strengthens and 5G continues to scale. This year, we are providing an outlook for service and other revenue, which includes revenues from across all of our businesses but excludes wireless equipment revenue given its variability, especially in the current environment. 
For 2021, we expect service and other revenue growth of at least 2%, reflecting an acceleration of total wireless service and Fios revenue growth as well as continued momentum in Verizon Media, partially offset by ongoing legacy wireline product declines. Included in this outlook is total wireless service revenue growth of at least 3% driven by our tiered unlimited plans, new customer contributions and ongoing strength in business. 
For the full year, we expect to see adjusted earnings per share of $5 to $5.15 driven by recurring service and other revenue growth as well as ongoing cost initiatives. We assume no significant year-over-year impact from below-the-line items based on the 2021 opening balance sheet. 
The adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25%. Our consolidated capital spend for full year 2021 is expected to be between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion, consistent with the prior year and within our normal capital intensity range. Our focus for the year includes further expansion of our 5G Ultra Wideband Network in new and existing markets, densification of our network to manage future traffic demands and continued deployment of our fiber infrastructure. 
Our cash flows in 2021 are expected to be driven by higher operating income, offset by taxes and working capital. We anticipate that our cash taxes in 2021 will be higher than in 2020, given expectations for higher pretax income this year and a onetime $2.2 billion cash tax benefit received in the second quarter of 2020. Working capital was a tailwind in 2020 due to the lower equipment volumes, which we do not expect to repeat in 2021. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our 2021 priorities."

Let me review the 2021 priorities based on the 4 pillars of strategic priorities. Starting with the core business. And as you heard Matt talking about accelerating the service revenue, I'm pleased that we're guiding for a plus 3% wireless service revenue growth in 2021. That's based on that we will continue to differentiate our value proposition for customers. We also will continue to invest in our Verizon Business Group to capture that potential we see in the Business segment with a new platform that we're developing together with our customers. 
When it comes to our 5G and investing in our business, we have a big year in front of us in 2021. Again, we're going to almost double the amount of 5G Ultra Wideband sites. We're going to have 14,000 new sites coming in during 2021. That will enable us to continue to increase with plus 20 cities when it comes to 5G Ultra Wideband. And we're also going to add some plus 20 5G Home cities, at the same time, focusing very much on the 5G mobile edge compute with 10 more sites when it comes to the public side. And then on the private side, we will scale that network together with the demand that has come as we know already, all underpinned with the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network and the fiber that we are deploying. 
When it comes to the financial, Matt talked about that we continue to focus on the accelerating the earnings per share growth, now with guidance of $5 to $5.15 earnings per share. The year 2020 solidified our balance sheet, and we will be continued focused on the cash flow generation. 
And finally, when it comes to our culture and our purpose, we have very much focused on the customer-centricity and the brand strength that we have built in the market. That will continue as well as we will have also the Citizen Verizon totally included in the overall strategy. You see that we are managing all the 4 stakeholders that is making the success for Verizon in the future. 
So very clear, a year of execution. We have progressed 1 more year on the Verizon 2.0. We're in a great position. I'm really excited to go into 2021. 
I'm pleased to announce that we will have our normal Investor Day in the early part of 2021. We will come back with the exact date in due time.

I mean, first of all, we came into the third quarter already. I mean, we have our model with the migration of customers, giving them a better network and a better experience, and that is really how we are managing our base. And we came with a good momentum in the third quarter. 
And as you saw in the fourth quarter, we had service revenue growing more than 2% as we said also in the guidance. That's so important for us because we have a model where our net addition is part of our strategy, how we move them up. 
And as Matt said, we have now more than 60% of our customers on unlimited. But more important, I mean if you look in the fourth quarter, 90% of the net adds took unlimited, and out of those, 55% took premium. And the premium is, of course, where we are adding in the 5G, we're adding in Discovery Plus, Disney+. The way that our -- that Ronan and his team has worked with this migration pattern, we believe, and as you heard in the guidance that Matt talked about, we believe that we can continue that work with organic service -- wireless service revenue growth with the model we now have. And we have proven the model over the years. 
And let's also remember the Business side has performed very well when it comes to the wireless account. I mean, we are so strong with the public sector, with the large enterprises on the wireless side. So that is giving us a lot of positives going into 2021 with the guidance we have of continued service revenue growth on the wireless side. And we will constantly measure what the actions we're taking, but we feel good about it. 
When it comes to the fiber question, yes, we continue to roll out fiber. We're probably in the year 3 or 4 right now. We -- I would say with the majority or vast majority of all the 5G sites, they have our own fiber. 
We are migrating our 4G sites also, where it's a good return on investment to our own fiber. And over time, we will also open up opportunities for resell to our enterprise customers and wholesale. So I think that we are seeing that benefit already on the 5G build because we are using our own fiber. 
To get the full impact, we also have a couple of years left in order to have it in all the areas. But we are coming far away on the fiber build, and we will continue to do it where it makes sense for a return on investment. So we feel really good about that, and that's part of our Verizon Intelligent Edge network."

We also believe that SMB will continue to be subdued and have a challenge in '21. And as we saw during the full year, the switch pool has been lower due to the traffic in the stores, et cetera. So that's were factored in. 
But on the other hand, we have line of sight to what we're doing because we're executing on a strategy when it comes to migration of our customers, what we're doing in Verizon Business Group and also Verizon Media Group. As Matt said, I mean they were now, for the first time ever, have a year-on-year growth with 11%. 
All in all, that is giving us the confidence that we can leave up to this guidance. But there are some uncertainties and there are some headwinds from COVID, but we think that with those assumptions we have, we can actually do this. And this is continued work with the EPS growth and acceleration that we have talked about for so many years right now, and we continue to show that we can do it with the assets we have and how we're executing. Matt?"

So Brett, just in summary on the COVID assumption and the EPS guidance, I think I'd say while certainly some level of pressures will continue to exist on the business throughout the year, I would say it's -- we're not overly pessimistic",231,"Yes. Thanks, Hans. So Brett, just in summary on the COVID assumption and the EPS guidance, I think I'd say while certainly some level of pressures will continue to exist on the business throughout the year, I would say it's -- we're not overly pessimistic, but we're not overly optimistic either. We assume some level of pressures. But you saw from the second half of the year, our ability to still execute within that type of environment. 
In terms of the fourth quarter, as you say, there was actually -- the COVID impact was actually a $0.02 benefit. And what you saw there was a couple of onetimers, but primarily it was a case of the revenue pressures we saw declining versus what we've seen in 2Q and 3Q. 
You think media as an example, which had been significantly hit by COVID impacts earlier in the pandemic, but certainly no impact in 4Q as we recorded that 11% revenue growth there. So those revenue -- some of the revenue headwinds moderated in the fourth quarter. 
The expense benefits continued. That's why you saw the $0.02 net benefit, which actually completely offset the $0.02 headwind from 606. So if you kind of think about in the fourth quarter, 606 and COVID having no net impact on the results, and that $1.21 stands on its own, the 7% increase on a year-over-year basis."

And of course, with the Apple iPhone right now in 5G, that has now kicked off that. So that you will see through the year when it comes to our mobility case. 
When it comes to 5G Home, we have very solid progress in 2020, came out with this new CPE. We added some 12 cities now with 5G Home with the NR technology. And our plan is doing 20-plus markets more in 2021. So now we're starting to get a solid foundation for the 5G Home. And as you heard in my remarks, I mean, we are doubling the amount of sites almost in 2021. So are now getting to a very, very solid positioning there. 
But I said before, on the Ultra Wideband build, we're building it mainly in the dense urban areas and then in stadiums, et cetera, in the beginning. So we covered less of houses or residentials in the beginning. But as these continue right now, we're capturing more and more. So I'm really excited. We also know that the CPE is really good. So -- and the self-install is working well. So we're looking forward to seeing that happening over the year more and more. 
On the 5G mobile edge compute, we have a great funnel of customers on the Business side. And we are not expecting that will be in significant revenues in the '21. But you're going to see a lot of customers signing up for the 5G mobile edge compute, both the private and the public, in '21 in order for us to have a very solid base going into '22. 
So a lot of excitement around 5G. I think we have built it absolutely right. We have an opportunity in front of us that we have been working on for a couple of years right now. So I'm happy with my sales team. I'm happy with the technology team, and we have a big year in front of us."

That's number one. 
Number two, just any thoughts on the ability to continue to drive margin improvement in the business, given that -- considering you're close to achieving the $10 billion in savings. And then lastly, sort of a follow-up to Brett's question, is the CapEx guide that we've heard, is that something that could be revised during the year if the circumstances change?"

I mean on the 3% growth, I think we have our strategy when it comes to how to grow it with the migration of customers and all of that. And as always, the team is validating how to make offerings, and we should be more aggressive or not. But we always think about doing long-term positive impact for our shareholders financially. 
And you have seen us now working for the last 2.5 years since we launched unlimited, we are doing the right things in order to make a long-term impact positively for shareholders and for our customers. And so especially Ronan and the team there have quite a lot in the portfolio, but we have now proven that this model is working when it comes to migration of unlimited with the best network and adding in also new value-added services, everything from Disney+ to Discovery Plus, Apple Music, and it might be more coming up in the year as well. So I'm confident that you guys have that in the portfolio. 
And as you heard about the Disney+, it's -- I think it's just unheard of how we can help direct to consumers. I mean 2/3 are signing up or more than 2/3 are signing up to continue the service after 1 year. I think that is something standing out. 
On the EBITDA, I will -- Matt will come back later on, but I can say that we continued with efficiency. And it's a reason why we are giving a guidance that we will grow the EPS again. And the majority or all of it is basically above the line, as Matt said. So this is operational improvements and improvements as we are growing our top line. Again, we have proven the model, the 5 vectors of growth, and now we're in the middle of executing. 
And finally, on CapEx, this is what we need to do right now. We -- the technology team has all the means they have to execute on a strategy with assets we have today. The only thing I can say, as I said I'm not sure 100 times before, we will only increase CapEx if we find something that has a really good return on investment. And then we'll come back and talk about it. Right now, we have everything that we need to execute the plans that we have in front of us."

As you think about the 3% service revenue, it's really a combination of subs and ARPA. Hans, obviously, talked through all of the things that will drive the ARPA side of the equation. But we certainly do expect subs growth, account growth and net add growth is important to our business as well. We will do that in a disciplined way. We're not going to chase unprofitable growth, but you should expect to see volume growth in the business as well as ARPA growth. 
And then the margin improvement, cost savings where, as you mentioned, we're close to the achieving the $10 billion program well ahead of the end of 2021 time line that we put in place. But just because we hit that doesn't mean we'll stop. There's significant opportunities to continue to make our business more efficient. The teams are very focused on those. And the $10 billion goal won't change us -- won't slow us down at all from continuing with that. 
As you think about margin improvement, obviously, revenue will be a big driver of that, and then you combine that with the cost savings. The one thing I would say is as we have an improvement in EBITDA margin dollars, if we have equipment revenue increase this year, which we would certainly be glad to see an indication of the overall economic activity picking up, you'd see an impact of that in the EBIT margin. So you could have EBIT dollars grow, but margins not grow as much, just because of the impact on the numerator, denominator or from the equipment revenue. But we're certainly very much focused on the dollar side to that equation and excited with the guide we have for the year."

And then for Matt, I'm just curious, beyond working capital, any other free cash flow swing factors for 2021? And is there any way to size or quantify working capital? It's kind of hard to tell looking historically what normal might be."

That's when this all started, at the same time as we have the pandemic. Still, I would say we are very pleased what we have seen with our customer migrating to 5G. 
Remember, we have a fair share or a big share of Apple users in our base. So I think that this is a pretty normal, maybe some a little bit subdued, but it's very normal upgrade cycle that we will see. And 5G will just getting better and better. I mean, that's what's happening. I mean we are fortifying our network. We're improving the performance constantly. 
I remember when I talked about Ultra Wideband reaching maybe 1 gigabit per second, now we're up to 4, 5. So there's so much more to do. And the same goes for our nationwide, improving all the time, performance better. So I think that is coming together as the accessibility to phones are coming out much more, and all the main brands have a 5G phone and all of them with Ultra Wideband. 
So I think that we will see that continuing into '21 and '22. But there are longer cycles today when it comes to customers migrating to new phone. They're very attached to it. But I think this is no different than 4G cycle. I think we actually are -- this is going faster than the 4G cycle. It's just that our memories are so short, so we don't remember that. But clearly, this is equal to, to better than what we saw in the 4G cycle that happened some 10 years ago, which I refer to myself when I talk about my memory. So nobody else. Okay, Matt."

So when you talk about the swing factors, obviously, it starts with higher earnings for the year. Above-the-line earnings will be obviously the largest driver in the cash flow for 2021. 
In terms of things that potentially go the other way from a cash flow standpoint, we would expect obviously higher earnings will lead to higher cash taxes. But in addition to that, we had the $2.2 billion onetime cash tax benefit in the second quarter last year that obviously won't repeat. So that will be a year-over-year difference in the cash flow. 
And then working capital, as you say, the biggest item working capital is going to be in the receivables side, predominantly on the handsets. Obviously, as volumes go down, the amount of device payment contracts with customers we're doing goes down as well. So even if we don't see an uptick in volumes this year, if they're just flat year-over-year, you have the removal of that tailwind from last year. 
So all in all, you're going to see the increase from higher earnings with some offsets from cash taxes. And hopefully, on the equipment receivables side are going to be the key factors in there."

In terms of comparing it to historical incremental revenue, I think there is obviously different components all the time. But absolutely, everything that we're doing to step customers up from a revenue standpoint also creates incremental lifetime value with those customers. So you should expect that to be a continuation of how we approach the marketplace that we bring customers on, and we do it in a way that creates significant economic value for us over the long term as we provide best-in-class experiences for those customers. Nothing changes there in our mindset."

Secondly, Biden's proposing increasing the corporate tax rate to 28%. I'm curious how you think about that and whether that would have a huge impact on free cash flow and dividend coverage.

We -- while we expect TracFone to close in the second half of the year, our guidance is -- doesn't assume any significant impact on the EPS during the year, but we'll update that if necessary, during the year. 
Corporate tax is our assumption, as you heard in the guide, 23% to 25%. That's where we've been the last few years. Obviously, we do our outlook based off of what is on the legislative books. And so we do it based on what's there right now. We look forward to seeing how the new administration works on a number of different issues. And if that changes the way we look at the business going forward, we'll obviously talk about that at the appropriate time. But we're very confident in the business. 
Look, we had good dividend coverage when we had a much higher tax rate not too many years ago. So while we certainly believe that the current rate has been very helpful in job creation and in economic growth creation, we're certainly very comfortable with how our business is set up as the administration is looking at different things. 
And in terms of CapEx, I think what you're seeing is a very efficient capital deployment model within the company. That's why you see a guide that's in line year-over-year as we continue to do all of the things that we've done, whether that be on LTE, the 5G build. You heard Hans talk about our goals for the Ultra Wideband build this year, continuing the fiber build-out. And so I think the team has got a very good momentum going there.

As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.  
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.  
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.  
The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. As a reminder, we are in the quiet period for spectrum Auction 107, so we will not be able to comment on our mid-band spectrum holdings or strategy at this time.  
Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.11 per share, resulting in full year earnings of $4.30 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported fourth quarter earnings include a pretax loss from special items of approximately $523 million. This includes a net charge of $404 million primarily related to severance, including voluntary separations under our existing plans and the annual mark-to-market for our pension and OPEB liabilities as well as a net loss of $119 million primarily related to the disposition of the HuffPost business. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.21 in the fourth quarter and $4.90 for the full year.  
Let's now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our fourth quarter earnings profile. The impact to earnings from the adoption of accounting standards ASC 606 for revenue recognition is illustrated for comparability purposes and reflects a reduction in the benefit realized due to the deferral of commission expense versus the prior year. We also continue to monitor the ongoing impacts of COVID on our business. The year-over-year impacts of both ASC 606 and COVID were not significant in the fourth quarter.  
The full year 2020 impacts from ASC 606 and COVID were $0.09 and $0.21, respectively, on both a reported and adjusted earnings per share basis. We do not expect the adoption of ASC 606 to have a significant impact on the comparability of 2021 results to 2020. Full year adjusted EPS growth of 1.9%, illustrated on the earnings waterfall slide, reflects the strong underlying performance of the business.  
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take you through a recap of 2020."

And I can only say that I'm super proud how Verizon responded to the changing environment during 2020. And we supported our customers, our employees and the society in a way that I've never seen before. So all in all, a great year. At the same time, we executed well on our strategy and saw that we had really good financial performance as well.  
When it comes to our 2020 strategic priorities, let me just walk through the execution of them. First of all, strengthening and grow the core business, I'm really proud to announce that we continue to have the best network in the nation. We just got for the 15th time the overall best network with RootMetrics on all 7 different categories. That includes 5G, which is so important to us that we continue to have that lead. I'm also happy to announce that we won for the 26th consecutive time the J.D. Powers Award. It tells a lot about our network and technology team, how they have been building a network and how we continue to lead this market.  
When it comes to the customer innovation, you have seen us working with our customers to give them richer offering and also even better performance of the network. This year, with Disney+, discovery+, also adding in the iPhone 5 from Apple has, of course, supported a lot of innovation that we're doing in the Verizon Consumer Group. And we see a great migration of our customers to unlimited and to the premium unlimited.  
Finally, you can see also that Verizon Business Group has a year of investments to see that we are putting a foundation to be even stronger for the future, had good growth in the wireless and also in some areas like the public sector, a very good performance and also adding a lot of new customers on the enterprise side. 
When it comes to us leveraging the assets to drive new growth, the commitments we did in February 2020 when it comes to 5G were all met or exceeded. I'm extremely happy with that. We now have 64 Ultra Wideband cities. We are more than 10 cities on our home 5G Ultra Wideband. We have 10 mobile edge compute centers public with Amazon. All in all, we deployed more than 5x more Ultra Wideband sites during 2020. And we launched the nationwide 5G that now is covering 230 million POPs in 2,700 cities.  
On the financial side, a strong year ended, where we had more than 2% growth in the wireless service revenue. We also have growth on our EPS in the fourth quarter, over 7%. We had an operational cash flow full year of USD 41.8 billion, which is a growth of 17%, a very strong year that put us in a good position when we go into 2021.  
And finally, we have a really large focus on how to include all our 4 stakeholders in the work we're doing. And I'm really proud of the Citizen Verizon that we launched during last year, which is a great way for us to see that the society aspect is part of our strategy, where, of course, our focus on being carbon neutral is very important. And the second green bond was launched at the second half of 2020. So all in all, I have to say, it was a very different year but a great execution, where we hit all our strategic milestones at the same time as we pivot and supported all our stakeholders.  
At the November sell-side event, I presented the 5 vectors of growth. Those are the vectors that is based on our strategy of Network-as-a-Service. Those are also the enablers for us to get to GDP+. We have great traction on them and we also have done quite a lot in 2020, all the way from the 5G adoption to the customer differentiation that I talked a lot about, the new markets that we're addressing, still pending the acquisition of TracFone, but we have other segments we are addressing as well as the next-generation business-to-business application based on our unique mobile edge compute offering that we have with Amazon, also now with Microsoft and many other partners. And finally, the network monetization with our MVNO partners, which are enjoying the best network that we have and we're building.  
All in all, this is built on the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network that we outlined some 3 years ago and giving us the opportunity to have great execution in the future. With that, I would like to hand over to Matt to go through the financials in a little bit more detail."
415798,698771142,2181460,"Verizon Communications Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Verizon Communications Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by saying how proud I am with the Verizon team and the results we delivered in 2020.  In the fourth quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $34.7 billion, down 0.2%. Total wireless s",2161,"Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by saying how proud I am with the Verizon team and the results we delivered in 2020.  
In the fourth quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $34.7 billion, down 0.2%. Total wireless service revenue growth and strong results in Verizon Media Group were offset by lower wireless equipment revenue and ongoing declines in legacy wireline products.  
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $11.7 billion as compared to $11.1 billion last year, a 5.3% increase driven by service and other revenue growth and disciplined spending. Full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $47.1 billion. And adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.7%, 90 basis points higher than last year, including headwinds of approximately 40 basis points from the deferral of commission expense.  
Our continued focus on our Business Excellence program has resulted in realized cumulative cash savings of $9.5 billion. And we are well positioned to achieve our $10 billion goal ahead of our year-end 2021 target. COVID has brought about new ways of working. And we believe some of these will be long term in nature. This will create additional savings opportunities beyond the current program.  
As Brady mentioned, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.21, up 7.1% from $1.13 a year ago. We are pleased to report 1.9% growth of full year adjusted EPS at the high end of our revised guidance, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our business.  
Let's now turn to cash flow results on Slide 8. Our cash generation was exceptionally strong in 2020, reflecting our subscription-based business model and the quality of our customer base. This enabled us to continue to execute on our capital allocation model, investing in our business, increasing our dividend for the 14th straight year and strengthening our balance sheet.  
Cash flow from operating activities totaled $41.8 billion for the year, an increase of $6 billion from the prior year, driven by continued performance and strength in the business, lower tax payments due to a one-time cash tax benefit received earlier in the year and reductions in working capital primarily due to lower wireless volumes. 
Capital spending in 2020 totaled $18.2 billion as we continued to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband Network and launching our nationwide 5G network. As a result, free cash flow for the year was $23.6 billion, up 32.4% year-over-year.  
Throughout the year, we opportunistically diversified our debt portfolio that optimized our cost of borrowing and retained a higher level of cash as a result of the pandemic. We exited the quarter with net unsecured debt of $96.3 billion. And our net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.0x versus our targeted range of 1.75 to 2.0x. We remain committed to our capital allocation model.  
Now let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 9. Our competitive position is based on compelling unlimited plans that provide choice to consumers paired with the best devices and attractive promotions, all built on the country's best network. This quarter, we launched our nationwide 5G service to coincide with the release of the iPhone 12 lineup, which fully supports our ultra wideband offering, enabling Verizon customers to utilize a full range of connectivity provided by this iconic device.  
Partnerships remain a critical component of our value proposition. We recently added Discovery to our list of existing successful partnerships, which includes Apple and Disney. As the early cohort of Disney+ customers have come off of the initial free 12-month period, more than 2/3 have maintained their subscription, either through their Verizon direct billing relationship or by opting into one of our newest Mix & Match plans with the Disney bundle included. 
Volume activity in the quarter was tempered by consumer behavior, given rising COVID cases and elevated store closures that limited foot traffic in addition to the retention offers in the market. As a result, the pool of consumers switching carriers was lower than a year ago.  
Fourth quarter phone gross adds were down approximately 24% year-over-year, relatively consistent with declines experienced in the third quarter. We are pleased with the quality of the additions we are attracting as over 90% of new accounts came in on an unlimited plan and over 55% of these accounts opted for premium unlimited service. At quarter end, over 60% of our base was on an unlimited plan with more than 20% of our base taking a premium plan.  
Our customer retention remains high with phone churn of 0.76% for the quarter, down 7 basis points from a year ago, contributing to postpaid phone net adds of 163,000. Disconnects related to customers in our Stay Connected program totaled more than 135,000 phones in the quarter. 
Our Stay Connected program continued to see great results with approximately 95% of customers making a payment since entering the program, and collection cure rates are in line with our expectations. More than 50% of all customers in the program are current on their payments. December was the final month of service billings for the program and payment activity remained stable, though we will continue to closely monitor payment trends in 2021.  
Turning to Fios. We continue to build on our strong third quarter with consumer Fios Internet net additions of 92,000, more than double the fourth quarter of 2019. Total Fios Internet net additions of 95,000 was the best fourth quarter we have had since 2014 and reflected strong demand for our gigabit offering as consumers continued to work and learn from home. Cord-cutting trends continued, resulting in consumer Fios Video net losses for the quarter of 72,000.  
Now let's move to Slide 10 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. Consumer operating revenues for the fourth quarter were $23.9 billion, down 1.2%. This was primarily driven by a 3.8% decline in wireless equipment revenue due to softer volumes in the quarter.  
For the full year, total Consumer revenue decreased 2.8% to $88.5 billion, driven by the decline in wireless equipment revenue. Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter was $13.6 billion, a 1.2% increase. The results reflect the resilience of our business as we recovered from a 2.7% decrease in the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, we delivered ARPA growth of 1.8% year-over-year even as TravelPass and other usage fees remain at subdued levels, demonstrating that our tiered approach to unlimited provides a strong foundation for delivering revenue growth.  
For the full year, Consumer wireless service revenue was $53.6 billion, relatively flat from 2019 levels. Consumer Fios revenue totaled $2.8 billion, a 2.5% decline from a year ago. Customer credits related to regional sports networks negatively impacted Fios revenue by 4.2% in the quarter and also reduced our content expense. We expect Fios revenue to benefit as growth in the broadband base offsets the impact of the shift from the triple-play bundle to stand-alone service.  
Consumer segment EBITDA grew 2.9% to $9.9 billion. Margins were 41.5% in the quarter, up 160 basis points from last year, including headwinds of approximately 30 basis points from the deferral of commission expense. For the full year, EBITDA margins were 45.5%, an increase of 120 basis points from the prior year, including an impact of approximately 50 basis points from the deferral of commission expense.  
Now let's move to our Business segment on Slide 11. Business wireless trends remained resilient throughout the year, and the fourth quarter was no different. Public sector demand remained strong on the success of our distance learning program and support for increased needs of state and local government agencies. Small and medium business trends improved sequentially, while we experienced modest pressures in enterprise.  
Business segment phone gross adds for the quarter were down 11% from the prior year due to store closures and continued economic weakness. Segment postpaid phone churn was 0.98% in the quarter, which was down 2 basis points over the prior year. As a result, postpaid phone net adds were 116,000.  
Let's now move to Slide 12 to review the Business financial performance. Operating revenues for the Business segment were $8.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down slightly year-over-year. Full year operating revenues of $31 billion represented a decline of 1.5% from the prior year. Wireless service revenue in the quarter accelerated to 7.1% year-over-year from 4.9% in the third quarter, which was more than offset by reductions in wireless equipment volumes and secular pressure on legacy wireline products.  
Looking at wireless service revenue. Public sector had a particularly strong quarter and small and medium business growth improved for the second straight quarter, although it was still below pre-pandemic growth rates. Legacy wireline product trends appeared to be normalizing after initially benefiting from the transition to a work-from-home economy. The growth in advanced communication services continues to drive opportunities for the segment. 
While we are pleased with the revenue performance of the Business segment and exit 2020 with momentum, there are uncertainties around how businesses will perform in 2021, given the challenges within the macro environment. The elevated demand experienced in public sector and parts of enterprise throughout 2020 could potentially create headwinds to growth in the Business segment, particularly in the back half of 2021.  
Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.6% in the quarter, up 390 basis points from the year-ago period, reflecting the strength in wireless service revenue and the benefits of our transformation initiatives, including back-office digitalization and optimization. Full year margins of 25.4% were up slightly versus last year.  
Now let's move on to Slide 13 to discuss Verizon Media Group. We are very pleased with Verizon Media Group performance. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, up approximately 11% from a year ago, the first quarter of year-over-year growth since the Yahoo! acquisition. Growth in the quarter was fueled by strong advertising trends with demand-type platform revenue growing 41% compared to the prior year. Advertising strength came from political, consumer products, technology and retail, among other verticals.  
The fourth quarter also saw continued high consumer engagement in commerce as offline-to-online shopping behaviors continued through the holiday season on our owned and operated properties. In particular, mail e-commerce revenue growth was 7x that of the prior year. And we saw continued strength in finance and news as daily active users grew 52% and 11%, respectively.  
Let's now move on to Slide 14 for a quick look at overall wireless performance. Key metrics and financial data of the combined wireless products and services from the Consumer and Business segments are illustrated on this slide. Total wireless service revenue was up 2.2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 0.7% for the full year. Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and the supplemental earnings release schedules on our website.  
Now let's focus on our outlook for 2021 on Slide 15. We are excited to deliver 2021 expectations that include accelerating revenue and earnings growth, driven by our 5 growth vectors as wireless service strengthens and 5G continues to scale. This year, we are providing an outlook for service and other revenue, which includes revenues from across all of our businesses but excludes wireless equipment revenue, given its variability, especially in the current environment.  
For 2021, we expect service and other revenue growth of at least 2%, reflecting an acceleration of total wireless service and Fios revenue growth as well as continued momentum in Verizon Media, partially offset by ongoing legacy wireline product declines. Included in this outlook is total wireless service revenue growth of at least 3%, driven by our tiered unlimited plans, new customer contributions and ongoing strength in business.  
For the full year, we expect to see adjusted earnings per share of $5 to $5.15, driven by recurring service and other revenue growth as well as ongoing cost initiatives. We assume no significant year-over-year impact from below-the-line items based on the 2021 opening balance sheet. The adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25%. 
Our consolidated capital spend for full year 2021 is expected to be between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion, consistent with the prior year and within our normal capital intensity range. Our focus for the year includes further expansion of our 5G Ultra Wideband Network in new and existing markets, densification of our network to manage future traffic demands and continued deployment of our fiber infrastructure.  
Our cash flows in 2021 are expected to be driven by higher operating incomes, offset by taxes and working capital. We anticipate that our cash taxes in 2021 will be higher than in 2020, given expectations for higher pretax income this year and a one-time $2.2 billion cash tax benefit received in the second quarter of 2020. Working capital was a tailwind in 2020 due to the lower equipment volumes, which we do not expect to repeat in 2021. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our 2021 priorities."

Let me review the 2021 priorities based on the 4 pillars of strategic priorities. Starting with the core business, and as you heard Matt talking about accelerating the service revenue, I'm pleased that we're guiding for a plus 3% wireless service revenue growth in 2021. That's based on that we will continue to differentiate our value proposition for customers. We also will continue to invest in our Verizon Business Group to capture that potential we see in the Business segment with a new platform that we're developing together with our customers.  
When it comes to our 5G and investing in our business, we have a big year in front of us in 2021. Again, we're going to almost double the amount of 5G Ultra Wideband sites. We're going to have 14,000 new sites coming in during 2021. That will enable us to continue to increase with plus 20 cities when it comes to 5G Ultra Wideband. And we're also going to add some plus 20 5G Home cities, at the same time, focusing very much on the 5G mobile edge compute with 10 more sites when it comes to the public side. And then on the private side, we will scale that network together with the demand that has come as we know already, all underpinned with the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network and the fiber that we are deploying.  
When it comes to the financial, Matt talked about that we continue to focus on the accelerating the earnings per share growth, now with a guidance of $5 to $5.15 earnings per share. The year 2020 solidified our balance sheet. And we will be continued focused on the cash flow generation.  
And finally, when it comes to our culture and our purpose, we have very much focused on the customer-centricity and the brand strength that we have built in the market. That will continue as well as we will have also the Citizen Verizon totally included in the overall strategy. You see that we are managing all the 4 stakeholders that is making the success for Verizon in the future.  
So very clear, a year of execution. We have progressed 1 more year on the Verizon 2.0. We're in a great position. I'm really excited to go into 2021. I'm pleased to announce that we will have our normal Investor Day in the early part of 2021. We will come back with the exact date in due time.  
And by that, I would like to hand over to Brady for Q&A."

I mean, first of all, we came into the third quarter already, I mean, we have our model with the migration of customers, giving them a better network and a better experience. And that is really how we are managing our base. And we came with a good momentum in the third quarter. And as you saw in the fourth quarter, we had service revenue growing more than 2% as we said also in the guidance. 
That's so important for us because we have a model, where our net addition is part of our strategy, how we move them up. And as Matt said, we have now more than 60% of our customers on unlimited. But more important, I mean, if you look in the fourth quarter, 90% of the new net adds took unlimited. And out of those, 55% took premium. And the premium is, of course, where we are adding in the 5G, we're adding in discovery+, Disney+. The way that our -- that Ronan and his team has worked with this migration pattern, we believe -- and as you heard in the guidance that Matt talked about, we believe that we can continue that work with organic service -- wireless service revenue growth with the model we now have. And we have proven the model over the years.  
And let's also remember the Business side has performed very well when it comes to the wireless account. I mean we are so strong with the public sector, with the large enterprises on the wireless side. So that is giving us a lot of positives going into 2021 with the guidance we have of continued service revenue growth on the wireless side. And we'll constantly measure what the actions we're taking, but we feel good about it. 
When it comes to the fiber question, yes, we continue to roll out fiber. We are probably in the year 3 or 4 right now. We -- I would say with the majority or vast majority of all the 5G sites, they have our own fiber. We are migrating our 4G sites also, where it's a good return on investment to our own fiber. And over time, we will also open up opportunities for resell to our enterprise customers and wholesale. So I think that we are seeing that benefit already on the 5G build because we are using our own fiber.  
To get the full impact, we also have a couple of years left in order to have it in all the areas. But we have come a far way on the fiber build, and we will continue to do it where it makes sense for a return on investment. So we feel really good about that. And that's part of our Verizon Intelligent Edge Network."

So when it comes to our guidance for EPS in 2021, of course, there are uncertainties of the pandemic and so on. But some things we know. I mean the roaming charges will continue to be a headwind. We also think that as the pandemic and economic recoveries is coming back probably latter part of '21, the public sector will not have an equally strong year as they had in 2020. We also believe the SMB will continue to be subdued and have a challenge in '21. And as we saw during the full year, the switcher pool has been lower due to the traffic in the stores, et cetera. So that's were factored in.  
But on the other hand, we have line of sight to what we're doing because we're executing on a strategy when it comes to migration of our customers, what we're doing in Verizon Business Group and also Verizon Media Group. As Matt said, I mean, they were now, for the first time ever, have a year-on-year growth with 11%. All in all, that is giving us the confidence that we can live up to this guidance. But there are some uncertainties and there are some headwinds from COVID. But we think that with those assumptions we have, we can actually do this. And this is continued work with the EPS growth and acceleration that we have talked about for so many years right now. And we continue to show that we can do it with the assets we have and how we're executing. Matt?"

So Brett, just in summary on the COVID assumption and the EPS guidance, I think I'd say while certainly some level of pressures will continue to exist on the business throughout the year, I would say it's -- we're not overly pessimistic",233,"Yes. Thanks, Hans. So Brett, just in summary on the COVID assumption and the EPS guidance, I think I'd say while certainly some level of pressures will continue to exist on the business throughout the year, I would say it's -- we're not overly pessimistic, but we're not overly optimistic either. We assume some level of pressures. But you saw from the second half of the year, our ability to still execute within that type of environment.  
In terms of the fourth quarter, as you say, there was actually -- the COVID impact was actually a $0.02 benefit. And what you saw there was there was a couple of one-timers, but primarily it was a case of the revenue pressures we saw declining versus what we've seen in 2Q and 3Q. You think media as an example, which had been significantly hit by COVID impacts earlier in the pandemic but certainly no impact in 4Q as we recorded that 11% revenue growth there. 
So those revenue -- some of the revenue headwinds moderated in the fourth quarter. The expense benefits continued. That's why you saw the $0.02 net benefit, which actually completely offsets the $0.02 headwind from 606. So if you kind of think about in the fourth quarter, 606 and COVID having no net impact on the results, and that $1.21 stands on its own, the 7% increase on a year-over-year basis."

And of course, with the Apple iPhone right now in 5G, that has now kicked off that. So that you will see through the year when it comes to our mobility case.  
When it comes to 5G Home, we have very solid progress in 2020, came out with this new city. We added some 12 cities now with 5G Home with the NR technology. And our plan is doing 20-plus markets more in 2021. So now we're starting to get a solid foundation for the 5G Home. And as you heard in my remarks, I mean, we are doubling the amount of sites almost in 2021. So we're now getting to a very, very solid positioning there.  
But I said before, on the Ultra Wideband build, we're building it mainly in the dense urban areas and then in stadiums, et cetera, in the beginning. So we covered less of houses or residentials in the beginning. But as these continue right now, we're capturing more and more. So I'm really excited. We also know that the CPE is really good. So -- and the self-install is working well. So we're looking forward to seeing that happening over the year more and more.  
On the 5G mobile edge compute, we have a great funnel of customers on the Business side. And we are not expecting that will be in significant revenues in the '21. But you're going to see a lot of customers signing up for the 5G mobile edge compute, both the private and the public, in '21 in order for us to have a very solid base going into '22. 
So a lot of excitement around 5G. I think we have built it absolutely right. We have an opportunity in front of us that we have been working on for a couple of years right now. So I'm happy with my sales team. I'm happy with the technology team. And we have a big year in front of us."

That's number one.  
Number two, just any thoughts on the ability to continue to drive margin improvement in the business, given that -- considering you're close to achieving the $10 billion in savings. And then lastly, sort of a follow-up to Brett's question, is the CapEx guide that we've heard, is that something that could be revised during the year if the circumstances change?"

I mean on the 3% growth, I think we have our strategy when it comes to how to grow it with the migration of customers and all of that. And as always, the team is validating how to make offerings, if we should be more aggressive or not. But we always think about doing long-term positive impact for our shareholders financially. And you have seen us now working for the last 2.5 years since we launched unlimited, we are doing the right things in order to make a long-term impact positively for shareholders and for our customers. 
And so especially Ronan and the team there have quite a lot in the portfolio, but we have now proven that this model is working when it comes to migration of unlimited with the best network and adding in also new value-added services, everything from Disney+ to discovery+, Apple Music, and it might be more coming up in the year as well. So I'm confident that the guys have that in the portfolio. And as you heard about the Disney+, it's -- I think it's just unheard of how we can help direct to consumers. I mean 2/3 are signing up or more than 2/3 are signing up to continue the service after 1 year. I think that is something standing out.  
On the EBITDA, I will -- Matt will come back later on. But I can say that we continued with efficiency. And it's a reason why we are giving a guidance that we will grow the EPS again. And the majority or all of it is basically above the line, as Matt said. So this is operational improvements and improvements as we are growing our top line. Again, we have proven the model, the 5 vectors of growth. And now we're in the middle of executing. 
And finally, on CapEx, this is what we need to do right now. We -- the technology team has all the means they have to execute on a strategy with assets we have today. The only thing I can say, as I said I'm not sure 100 times before, we will only increase CapEx if we find something that has a really good return on investment. And then we'll come back and talk about it. Right now, we have everything that we need to execute the plans that we have in front of us."

As you think about the 3% service revenue, it's really a combination of subs and ARPA. Hans obviously talked through all of the things that will drive the ARPA side of the equation. But we certainly do expect subs growth, account growth. And net add growth is important to our business as well. We will do that in a disciplined way. We're not going to chase unprofitable growth. But you should expect to see volume growth in the business as well as ARPA growth. 
And then the margin improvement, cost savings where, as you mentioned, we're close to the achieving the $10 billion program well ahead of the end of 2021 timeline that we put in place. But just because we hit that doesn't mean we'll stop. There's significant opportunities to continue to make our business more efficient. The teams are very focused on those. And the $10 billion goal won't change us -- won't slow us down at all from continuing with that. 
As you think about margin improvement, obviously, revenue will be a big driver of that and then you combine that with the cost savings. The one thing I would say is as we have an improvement in EBITDA margin dollars, if we have equipment revenue increase this year, which we would certainly be glad to see an indication of the overall economic activity picking up, you'd see an impact of that in the EBIT margin. So you could have EBIT dollars grow, but margins not grow as much, just because of the impact on the numerator and denominator from the equipment revenue. But we're certainly very much focused on the dollar side to that equation and excited with the guide we have for the year."

That's sort of a different story than what we've seen for the last few years, which it sort of speaks to perhaps a moderation of competitive intensity but clearly a weakening of your ability to acquire new subscribers. I wonder if you could just talk about that for a bit and talk about how you see that evolving in the 5G era as we -- particularly now that more and more of the handsets that are being sold are 5G handsets."

We want quality customers that likes our network, that likes our offerings and our experience. And if you look at what we have done in the last 2.5 years with our migration story, that's exactly what we have done. And that's what you see impact in the fourth quarter. 
We're growing our service revenue as well as the guidance for next year. So we are confident with the strategy we have, and that might not be the same strategy that others have, that we can grow. And that's part of the 5 growth vectors we have to get to GDP+. And with the guidance that Matt gave or we gave with plus 3% on the wireless service revenue, I think we have all the confidence in the model we have and how we'll work with. But it's also true that the switcher pool during 2020 in the fourth quarter was lower due to COVID, less traffic and all of that. So -- but all in all, we are very pleased with the high-quality net additions that we are getting and that we can create growth with that and continues on. Matt?"

I wonder if it raises any questions about for Fios. Does it make sense to stay in the video business as you currently have it, where you're still selling a direct package? Or would it make sense to move to a similar strategy for the wireline side, where you sort of offer more third-party aggregators, if you will, across your network?"

But the discovery+, the Disney+, they are sort of super A brands that we want to work with or Apple Music. We will look for more of these to see that they're fitting into our customer base, that they like it and are willing both to upgrade and migrate. So we'll continue with that. 
On the Fios side, of course, we will continue with the video right now. But you have seen us also, starting with Mix & Match, starting to shop up this because ultimately, I want our customers to have choices. And I want them to choose. If they want the D2C solution or if they want a linear or they want over-the-top, they should be able to choose it. And look at the numbers in the fourth quarter again. We continue to grow our Fios Internet customers and we have a decline in the video customers. That's good for us, I mean, financially. But ultimately, it is to meet our customers' needs. 
And I think the whole setup that we did in Verizon 2.0 is just catered for us to do things that we never thought about before. We have a Consumer division thinking about how are we now delivering to consumers. And that's what you see in the numbers. That's what you see in the numbers that we have. We have the same in Verizon Business Group. They are thinking totally different we have done before. And we still have more to do with platforms and things to be even more scalable and be able to bring more to the bottom line. But I have to say, I'm pleased. And I hope that you guys, what you see, are pleased as well. I mean the strategy is working. We have the 5 vectors of growth.

But on the postpaid churn, I think that we are just having a great moment with our customers. They love our network and the performance we have and the additions we're doing with 5G and 5G Ultra Wideband. At the same time, our offerings are so distinct and different than anybody else in the market, where they can go to the unlimited premium together with discovery+ or Disney+ or Disney+ plus, plus. We have ESPN and Hulu included. I think nobody else has those type of things in the market. And our partners, at least if you ask them, I think you should, are very happy and pleased on how we can deal with this. We are happy with it, both from a retention but also from a bottom line side. We were making money on this, which is the whole idea with the Network-as-a-Service that we're building on the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network. 
On the wireline side, I think the whole idea of the Verizon Business Group is really to see that we are working these year-over-year. This is nothing that you fix in a month or a quarter or 2. This is things that we need to invest in a billing system, direct-to-consumer, call centers, everything being set up to deliver scalable platforms for our customer in the Business side. That will, over time, improve our margins in the Verizon Business Group. And I think that if you look at 2020, I mean, it was a good performance of them, still doing investments in order to get where we want to get over time.

And so you had a positive benefit from that in Q2 and 3Q, a little bit of a catch-up in 4Q. But even with that, a very strong churn number, and it's just based off of the best network experience as you saw confirmed again by RootMetrics yesterday.

So I'm just curious how much of it sort of not happening in that way as due to the pandemic and the lack of getting people to retail versus the lack of applications that would really just sort of delight consumers and get them to upgrade and how you think that's going to evolve over the next year or 2 or 3. Is it going to be sort of a slow walk? Or is there something exciting around the quarter? 
And then for Matt, I'm just curious, beyond working capital, any other free cash flow swing factors for 2021? And is there any way to size or quantify working capital? It's kind of hard to tell looking historically what normal might be."

So I think that this is a pretty normal, maybe some a little bit subdued, but it's very normal upgrade cycle that we will see. And 5G will just getting better and better. I mean that's what's happening. I mean we are fortifying our network. We're improving the performance constantly. I remember when I talked about Ultra Wideband reaching maybe 1 gigabit per second, now we're up to 4, 5. So there's so much more to do. And the same goes for our nationwide, improving all the time, performance better. So I think that is coming together as the accessibility to phones are coming out much more and all the main brands have a 5G phone and all of them with ultra wideband. 
So I think that we will see that continuing into '21 and '22. But there are longer cycles today when it comes to customers migrating to new phone. They're very attached to it. But I think this is no different than 4G cycle. I think we actually are -- this is going faster than the 4G cycle. It's just that our memories are so short, so we don't remember that. But clearly, this is equal to, to better than what we saw in the 4G cycle that happened some 10 years ago, which I refer to myself when I talk about my memory, so nobody else. Okay, Matt."

Above-the-line earnings will be obviously the largest driver in the cash flow for 2021. In terms of things that potentially go the other way from a cash flow standpoint, we would expect obviously higher earnings will lead to higher cash taxes. But in addition to that, we had the $2.2 billion one-time cash tax benefit in the second quarter last year that obviously won't repeat. So that will be a year-over-year difference in the cash flow.  
And then working capital, as you say, the biggest item working capital is going to be in the receivables side, predominantly on the handsets. Obviously, as volumes go down, the amount of device payment contracts with customers we're doing goes down as well. So even if we don't see an uptick in volumes this year, if they're just flat year-over-year, you have the removal of that tailwind from last year. So all in all, you're going to see the increase from higher earnings with some offsets from cash taxes and hopefully, on the equipment receivables side are going to be the key factors in there."

But absolutely, everything that we're doing to step customers up from a revenue standpoint also creates incremental lifetime value with those customers.

Corporate taxes, our assumption, as you heard in the guide, 23% to 25%. That's where we've been the last few years. Obviously, we do our outlook based off of what is on the legislative books. And so we do it based on what's there right now. We look forward to seeing how the new administration works on a number of different issues. And if that changes the way we look at the business going forward, we'll obviously talk about that at the appropriate time. But we're very confident in the business. 
Look, we had good dividend coverage when we had a much higher tax rate not too many years ago. So while we certainly believe that the current rate has been very helpful in job creation and in economic growth creation, we're certainly very comfortable with how our business is set up as the administration is looking at different things. 
And in terms of CapEx, I think what you're seeing is a very efficient capital deployment model within the company.

As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.  
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.  
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.  
The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. As a reminder, we are in the quiet period for spectrum Auction 107, so we will not be able to comment on our mid-band spectrum holdings or strategy at this time.  
Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.11 per share, resulting in full year earnings of $4.30 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported fourth quarter earnings include a pretax loss from special items of approximately $523 million. This includes a net charge of $404 million primarily related to severance, including voluntary separations under our existing plans and the annual mark-to-market for our pension and OPEB liabilities as well as a net loss of $119 million primarily related to the disposition of the HuffPost business. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.21 in the fourth quarter and $4.90 for the full year.  
Let's now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our fourth quarter earnings profile. The impact to earnings from the adoption of accounting standards ASC 606 for revenue recognition is illustrated for comparability purposes and reflects a reduction in the benefit realized due to the deferral of commission expense versus the prior year. We also continue to monitor the ongoing impacts of COVID on our business. The year-over-year impacts of both ASC 606 and COVID were not significant in the fourth quarter.  
The full year 2020 impacts from ASC 606 and COVID were $0.09 and $0.21, respectively, on both a reported and adjusted earnings per share basis. We do not expect the adoption of ASC 606 to have a significant impact on the comparability of 2021 results to 2020. Full year adjusted EPS growth of 1.9%, illustrated on the earnings waterfall slide, reflects the strong underlying performance of the business.  
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take you through a recap of 2020."

When it comes to our 2020 strategic priorities, let me just walk through the execution of them. First of all, strengthening and grow the core business, I'm really proud to announce that we continue to have the best network in the nation.

This year, with Disney+, discovery+, also adding in the iPhone 5 from Apple has, of course, supported a lot of innovation that we're doing in the Verizon Consumer Group. And we see a great migration of our customers to unlimited and to the premium unlimited.  
Finally, you can see also that Verizon Business Group has a year of investments to see that we are putting a foundation to be even stronger for the future, had good growth in the wireless and also in some areas like the public sector, a very good performance and also adding a lot of new customers on the enterprise side. 
When it comes to us leveraging the assets to drive new growth, the commitments we did in February 2020 when it comes to 5G were all met or exceeded. I'm extremely happy with that. We now have 64 Ultra Wideband cities. We are more than 10 cities on our home 5G Ultra Wideband. We have 10 mobile edge compute centers public with Amazon. All in all, we deployed more than 5x more Ultra Wideband sites during 2020. And we launched the nationwide 5G that now is covering 230 million POPs in 2,700 cities.  
On the financial side, a strong year ended, where we had more than 2% growth in the wireless service revenue. We also have growth on our EPS in the fourth quarter, over 7%. We had an operational cash flow full year of USD 41.8 billion, which is a growth of 17%, a very strong year that put us in a good position when we go into 2021.  
And finally, we have a really large focus on how to include all our 4 stakeholders in the work we're doing. And I'm really proud of the Citizen Verizon that we launched during last year, which is a great way for us to see that the society aspect is part of our strategy, where, of course, our focus on being carbon neutral is very important. And the second green bond was launched at the second half of 2020. So all in all, I have to say, it was a very different year but a great execution, where we hit all our strategic milestones at the same time as we pivot and supported all our stakeholders.  
At the November sell-side event, I presented the 5 vectors of growth. Those are the vectors that is based on our strategy of Network-as-a-Service. Those are also the enablers for us to get to GDP+. We have great traction on them and we also have done quite a lot in 2020, all the way from the 5G adoption to the customer differentiation that I talked a lot about, the new markets that we're addressing, still pending the acquisition of TracFone, but we have other segments we are addressing as well as the next-generation business-to-business application based on our unique mobile edge compute offering that we have with Amazon, also now with Microsoft and many other partners. And finally, the network monetization with our MVNO partners, which are enjoying the best network that we have and we're building.  
All in all, this is built on the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network that we outlined some 3 years ago and giving us the opportunity to have great execution in the future. With that, I would like to hand over to Matt to go through the financials in a little bit more detail."

I would like to start by saying how proud I am with the Verizon team and the results we delivered in 2020.  In the fourth quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $34.7 billion, down 0.2%. Total wireless s",2161,"Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by saying how proud I am with the Verizon team and the results we delivered in 2020.  
In the fourth quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $34.7 billion, down 0.2%. Total wireless service revenue growth and strong results in Verizon Media Group were offset by lower wireless equipment revenue and ongoing declines in legacy wireline products.  
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $11.7 billion as compared to $11.1 billion last year, a 5.3% increase driven by service and other revenue growth and disciplined spending. Full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $47.1 billion. And adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.7%, 90 basis points higher than last year, including headwinds of approximately 40 basis points from the deferral of commission expense.  
Our continued focus on our Business Excellence program has resulted in realized cumulative cash savings of $9.5 billion. And we are well positioned to achieve our $10 billion goal ahead of our year-end 2021 target. COVID has brought about new ways of working. And we believe some of these will be long term in nature. This will create additional savings opportunities beyond the current program.  
As Brady mentioned, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.21, up 7.1% from $1.13 a year ago. We are pleased to report 1.9% growth of full year adjusted EPS at the high end of our revised guidance, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our business.  
Let's now turn to cash flow results on Slide 8. Our cash generation was exceptionally strong in 2020, reflecting our subscription-based business model and the quality of our customer base. This enabled us to continue to execute on our capital allocation model, investing in our business, increasing our dividend for the 14th straight year and strengthening our balance sheet.  
Cash flow from operating activities totaled $41.8 billion for the year, an increase of $6 billion from the prior year, driven by continued performance and strength in the business, lower tax payments due to a one-time cash tax benefit received earlier in the year and reductions in working capital primarily due to lower wireless volumes. 
Capital spending in 2020 totaled $18.2 billion as we continued to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband Network and launching our nationwide 5G network. As a result, free cash flow for the year was $23.6 billion, up 32.4% year-over-year.  
Throughout the year, we opportunistically diversified our debt portfolio that optimized our cost of borrowing and retained a higher level of cash as a result of the pandemic. We exited the quarter with net unsecured debt of $96.3 billion. And our net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.0x versus our targeted range of 1.75 to 2.0x. We remain committed to our capital allocation model.  
Now let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 9. Our competitive position is based on compelling unlimited plans that provide choice to consumers paired with the best devices and attractive promotions, all built on the country's best network. This quarter, we launched our nationwide 5G service to coincide with the release of the iPhone 12 lineup, which fully supports our ultra wideband offering, enabling Verizon customers to utilize a full range of connectivity provided by this iconic device.  
Partnerships remain a critical component of our value proposition. We recently added Discovery to our list of existing successful partnerships, which includes Apple and Disney. As the early cohort of Disney+ customers have come off of the initial free 12-month period, more than 2/3 have maintained their subscription, either through their Verizon direct billing relationship or by opting into one of our newest Mix & Match plans with the Disney bundle included. 
Volume activity in the quarter was tempered by consumer behavior, given rising COVID cases and elevated store closures that limited foot traffic in addition to the retention offers in the market. As a result, the pool of consumers switching carriers was lower than a year ago.  
Fourth quarter phone gross adds were down approximately 24% year-over-year, relatively consistent with declines experienced in the third quarter. We are pleased with the quality of the additions we are attracting as over 90% of new accounts came in on an unlimited plan and over 55% of these accounts opted for premium unlimited service. At quarter end, over 60% of our base was on an unlimited plan with more than 20% of our base taking a premium plan.  
Our customer retention remains high with phone churn of 0.76% for the quarter, down 7 basis points from a year ago, contributing to postpaid phone net adds of 163,000. Disconnects related to customers in our Stay Connected program totaled more than 135,000 phones in the quarter. 
Our Stay Connected program continued to see great results with approximately 95% of customers making a payment since entering the program, and collection cure rates are in line with our expectations. More than 50% of all customers in the program are current on their payments. December was the final month of service billings for the program and payment activity remained stable, though we will continue to closely monitor payment trends in 2021.  
Turning to Fios. We continue to build on our strong third quarter with consumer Fios Internet net additions of 92,000, more than double the fourth quarter of 2019. Total Fios Internet net additions of 95,000 was the best fourth quarter we have had since 2014 and reflected strong demand for our gigabit offering as consumers continued to work and learn from home. Cord-cutting trends continued, resulting in consumer Fios Video net losses for the quarter of 72,000.  
Now let's move to Slide 10 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. Consumer operating revenues for the fourth quarter were $23.9 billion, down 1.2%. This was primarily driven by a 3.8% decline in wireless equipment revenue due to softer volumes in the quarter.  
For the full year, total Consumer revenue decreased 2.8% to $88.5 billion, driven by the decline in wireless equipment revenue. Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter was $13.6 billion, a 1.2% increase. The results reflect the resilience of our business as we recovered from a 2.7% decrease in the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, we delivered ARPA growth of 1.8% year-over-year even as TravelPass and other usage fees remain at subdued levels, demonstrating that our tiered approach to unlimited provides a strong foundation for delivering revenue growth.  
For the full year, Consumer wireless service revenue was $53.6 billion, relatively flat from 2019 levels. Consumer Fios revenue totaled $2.8 billion, a 2.5% decline from a year ago. Customer credits related to regional sports networks negatively impacted Fios revenue by 4.2% in the quarter and also reduced our content expense. We expect Fios revenue to benefit as growth in the broadband base offsets the impact of the shift from the triple-play bundle to stand-alone service.  
Consumer segment EBITDA grew 2.9% to $9.9 billion. Margins were 41.5% in the quarter, up 160 basis points from last year, including headwinds of approximately 30 basis points from the deferral of commission expense. For the full year, EBITDA margins were 45.5%, an increase of 120 basis points from the prior year, including an impact of approximately 50 basis points from the deferral of commission expense.  
Now let's move to our Business segment on Slide 11. Business wireless trends remained resilient throughout the year, and the fourth quarter was no different. Public sector demand remained strong on the success of our distance learning program and support for increased needs of state and local government agencies. Small and medium business trends improved sequentially, while we experienced modest pressures in enterprise.  
Business segment phone gross adds for the quarter were down 11% from the prior year due to store closures and continued economic weakness. Segment postpaid phone churn was 0.98% in the quarter, which was down 2 basis points over the prior year. As a result, postpaid phone net adds were 116,000.  
Let's now move to Slide 12 to review the Business financial performance. Operating revenues for the Business segment were $8.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down slightly year-over-year. Full year operating revenues of $31 billion represented a decline of 1.5% from the prior year. Wireless service revenue in the quarter accelerated to 7.1% year-over-year from 4.9% in the third quarter, which was more than offset by reductions in wireless equipment volumes and secular pressure on legacy wireline products.  
Looking at wireless service revenue. Public sector had a particularly strong quarter and small and medium business growth improved for the second straight quarter, although it was still below pre-pandemic growth rates. Legacy wireline product trends appeared to be normalizing after initially benefiting from the transition to a work-from-home economy. The growth in advanced communication services continues to drive opportunities for the segment. 
While we are pleased with the revenue performance of the Business segment and exit 2020 with momentum, there are uncertainties around how businesses will perform in 2021, given the challenges within the macro environment. The elevated demand experienced in public sector and parts of enterprise throughout 2020 could potentially create headwinds to growth in the Business segment, particularly in the back half of 2021.  
Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.6% in the quarter, up 390 basis points from the year-ago period, reflecting the strength in wireless service revenue and the benefits of our transformation initiatives, including back-office digitalization and optimization. Full year margins of 25.4% were up slightly versus last year.  
Now let's move on to Slide 13 to discuss Verizon Media Group. We are very pleased with Verizon Media Group performance. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, up approximately 11% from a year ago, the first quarter of year-over-year growth since the Yahoo! acquisition. Growth in the quarter was fueled by strong advertising trends with demand-type platform revenue growing 41% compared to the prior year. Advertising strength came from political, consumer products, technology and retail, among other verticals.  
The fourth quarter also saw continued high consumer engagement in commerce as offline-to-online shopping behaviors continued through the holiday season on our owned and operated properties. In particular, mail e-commerce revenue growth was 7x that of the prior year. And we saw continued strength in finance and news as daily active users grew 52% and 11%, respectively.  
Let's now move on to Slide 14 for a quick look at overall wireless performance. Key metrics and financial data of the combined wireless products and services from the Consumer and Business segments are illustrated on this slide. Total wireless service revenue was up 2.2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 0.7% for the full year. Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and the supplemental earnings release schedules on our website.  
Now let's focus on our outlook for 2021 on Slide 15. We are excited to deliver 2021 expectations that include accelerating revenue and earnings growth, driven by our 5 growth vectors as wireless service strengthens and 5G continues to scale. This year, we are providing an outlook for service and other revenue, which includes revenues from across all of our businesses but excludes wireless equipment revenue, given its variability, especially in the current environment.  
For 2021, we expect service and other revenue growth of at least 2%, reflecting an acceleration of total wireless service and Fios revenue growth as well as continued momentum in Verizon Media, partially offset by ongoing legacy wireline product declines. Included in this outlook is total wireless service revenue growth of at least 3%, driven by our tiered unlimited plans, new customer contributions and ongoing strength in business.  
For the full year, we expect to see adjusted earnings per share of $5 to $5.15, driven by recurring service and other revenue growth as well as ongoing cost initiatives. We assume no significant year-over-year impact from below-the-line items based on the 2021 opening balance sheet. The adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25%. 
Our consolidated capital spend for full year 2021 is expected to be between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion, consistent with the prior year and within our normal capital intensity range. Our focus for the year includes further expansion of our 5G Ultra Wideband Network in new and existing markets, densification of our network to manage future traffic demands and continued deployment of our fiber infrastructure.  
Our cash flows in 2021 are expected to be driven by higher operating incomes, offset by taxes and working capital. We anticipate that our cash taxes in 2021 will be higher than in 2020, given expectations for higher pretax income this year and a one-time $2.2 billion cash tax benefit received in the second quarter of 2020. Working capital was a tailwind in 2020 due to the lower equipment volumes, which we do not expect to repeat in 2021. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our 2021 priorities."

Let me review the 2021 priorities based on the 4 pillars of strategic priorities. Starting with the core business, and as you heard Matt talking about accelerating the service revenue, I'm pleased that we're guiding for a plus 3% wireless service revenue growth in 2021. That's based on that we will continue to differentiate our value proposition for customers. We also will continue to invest in our Verizon Business Group to capture that potential we see in the Business segment with a new platform that we're developing together with our customers.  
When it comes to our 5G and investing in our business, we have a big year in front of us in 2021. Again, we're going to almost double the amount of 5G Ultra Wideband sites. We're going to have 14,000 new sites coming in during 2021. That will enable us to continue to increase with plus 20 cities when it comes to 5G Ultra Wideband. And we're also going to add some plus 20 5G Home cities, at the same time, focusing very much on the 5G mobile edge compute with 10 more sites when it comes to the public side. And then on the private side, we will scale that network together with the demand that has come as we know already, all underpinned with the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network and the fiber that we are deploying.  
When it comes to the financial, Matt talked about that we continue to focus on the accelerating the earnings per share growth, now with a guidance of $5 to $5.15 earnings per share. The year 2020 solidified our balance sheet. And we will be continued focused on the cash flow generation.  
And finally, when it comes to our culture and our purpose, we have very much focused on the customer-centricity and the brand strength that we have built in the market. That will continue as well as we will have also the Citizen Verizon totally included in the overall strategy. You see that we are managing all the 4 stakeholders that is making the success for Verizon in the future.  
So very clear, a year of execution. We have progressed 1 more year on the Verizon 2.0. We're in a great position. I'm really excited to go into 2021. I'm pleased to announce that we will have our normal Investor Day in the early part of 2021. We will come back with the exact date in due time.  
And by that, I would like to hand over to Brady for Q&A."

And then second, where are we on the fiber builds? And how should that start to come through in revenue and expense management this year?"

I mean, first of all, we came into the third quarter already, I mean, we have our model with the migration of customers, giving them a better network and a better experience. And that is really how we are managing our base. And we came with a good momentum in the third quarter. And as you saw in the fourth quarter, we had service revenue growing more than 2% as we said also in the guidance. 
That's so important for us because we have a model, where our net addition is part of our strategy, how we move them up. And as Matt said, we have now more than 60% of our customers on unlimited. But more important, I mean, if you look in the fourth quarter, 90% of the new net adds took unlimited. And out of those, 55% took premium. And the premium is, of course, where we are adding in the 5G, we're adding in discovery+, Disney+. The way that our -- that Ronan and his team has worked with this migration pattern, we believe -- and as you heard in the guidance that Matt talked about, we believe that we can continue that work with organic service -- wireless service revenue growth with the model we now have. And we have proven the model over the years.  
And let's also remember the Business side has performed very well when it comes to the wireless account. I mean we are so strong with the public sector, with the large enterprises on the wireless side. So that is giving us a lot of positives going into 2021 with the guidance we have of continued service revenue growth on the wireless side. And we'll constantly measure what the actions we're taking, but we feel good about it. 
When it comes to the fiber question, yes, we continue to roll out fiber. We are probably in the year 3 or 4 right now. We -- I would say with the majority or vast majority of all the 5G sites, they have our own fiber. We are migrating our 4G sites also, where it's a good return on investment to our own fiber. And over time, we will also open up opportunities for resell to our enterprise customers and wholesale. So I think that we are seeing that benefit already on the 5G build because we are using our own fiber.  
To get the full impact, we also have a couple of years left in order to have it in all the areas. But we have come a far way on the fiber build, and we will continue to do it where it makes sense for a return on investment. So we feel really good about that. And that's part of our Verizon Intelligent Edge Network."

So when it comes to our guidance for EPS in 2021, of course, there are uncertainties of the pandemic and so on. But some things we know. I mean the roaming charges will continue to be a headwind. We also think that as the pandemic and economic recoveries is coming back probably latter part of '21, the public sector will not have an equally strong year as they had in 2020. We also believe the SMB will continue to be subdued and have a challenge in '21. And as we saw during the full year, the switcher pool has been lower due to the traffic in the stores, et cetera. So that's were factored in.  
But on the other hand, we have line of sight to what we're doing because we're executing on a strategy when it comes to migration of our customers, what we're doing in Verizon Business Group and also Verizon Media Group. As Matt said, I mean, they were now, for the first time ever, have a year-on-year growth with 11%. All in all, that is giving us the confidence that we can live up to this guidance. But there are some uncertainties and there are some headwinds from COVID. But we think that with those assumptions we have, we can actually do this. And this is continued work with the EPS growth and acceleration that we have talked about for so many years right now.

Thanks, Hans. So Brett, just in summary on the COVID assumption and the EPS guidance, I think I'd say while certainly some level of pressures will continue to exist on the business throughout the year, I would say it's -- we're not overly pessimistic, but we're not overly optimistic either. We assume some level of pressures. But you saw from the second half of the year, our ability to still execute within that type of environment.  
In terms of the fourth quarter, as you say, there was actually -- the COVID impact was actually a $0.02 benefit. And what you saw there was there was a couple of one-timers, but primarily it was a case of the revenue pressures we saw declining versus what we've seen in 2Q and 3Q. You think media as an example, which had been significantly hit by COVID impacts earlier in the pandemic but certainly no impact in 4Q as we recorded that 11% revenue growth there. 
So those revenue -- some of the revenue headwinds moderated in the fourth quarter. The expense benefits continued. That's why you saw the $0.02 net benefit, which actually completely offsets the $0.02 headwind from 606. So if you kind of think about in the fourth quarter, 606 and COVID having no net impact on the results, and that $1.21 stands on its own, the 7% increase on a year-over-year basis."

When it comes to 5G Home, we have very solid progress in 2020, came out with this new city. We added some 12 cities now with 5G Home with the NR technology. And our plan is doing 20-plus markets more in 2021. So now we're starting to get a solid foundation for the 5G Home.

But I said before, on the Ultra Wideband build, we're building it mainly in the dense urban areas and then in stadiums, et cetera, in the beginning. So we covered less of houses or residentials in the beginning. But as these continue right now, we're capturing more and more. So I'm really excited. We also know that the CPE is really good. So -- and the self-install is working well. So we're looking forward to seeing that happening over the year more and more.  
On the 5G mobile edge compute, we have a great funnel of customers on the Business side. And we are not expecting that will be in significant revenues in the '21. But you're going to see a lot of customers signing up for the 5G mobile edge compute, both the private and the public, in '21 in order for us to have a very solid base going into '22. 
So a lot of excitement around 5G. I think we have built it absolutely right. We have an opportunity in front of us that we have been working on for a couple of years right now. So I'm happy with my sales team. I'm happy with the technology team. And we have a big year in front of us."

Obviously, you guys, in your commentary, talked about some of the headwinds to the sub growth. I'm just wondering if you guys think you can maintain sub growth as you look through the year. That's number one.  
Number two, just any thoughts on the ability to continue to drive margin improvement in the business, given that -- considering you're close to achieving the $10 billion in savings. And then lastly, sort of a follow-up to Brett's question, is the CapEx guide that we've heard, is that something that could be revised during the year if the circumstances change?"

I mean on the 3% growth, I think we have our strategy when it comes to how to grow it with the migration of customers and all of that. And as always, the team is validating how to make offerings, if we should be more aggressive or not. But we always think about doing long-term positive impact for our shareholders financially. And you have seen us now working for the last 2.5 years since we launched unlimited, we are doing the right things in order to make a long-term impact positively for shareholders and for our customers. 
And so especially Ronan and the team there have quite a lot in the portfolio, but we have now proven that this model is working when it comes to migration of unlimited with the best network and adding in also new value-added services, everything from Disney+ to discovery+, Apple Music, and it might be more coming up in the year as well. So I'm confident that the guys have that in the portfolio. And as you heard about the Disney+, it's -- I think it's just unheard of how we can help direct to consumers. I mean 2/3 are signing up or more than 2/3 are signing up to continue the service after 1 year. I think that is something standing out.  
On the EBITDA, I will -- Matt will come back later on. But I can say that we continued with efficiency. And it's a reason why we are giving a guidance that we will grow the EPS again. And the majority or all of it is basically above the line, as Matt said. So this is operational improvements and improvements as we are growing our top line. Again, we have proven the model, the 5 vectors of growth. And now we're in the middle of executing. 
And finally, on CapEx, this is what we need to do right now. We -- the technology team has all the means they have to execute on a strategy with assets we have today. The only thing I can say, as I said I'm not sure 100 times before, we will only increase CapEx if we find something that has a really good return on investment. And then we'll come back and talk about it. Right now, we have everything that we need to execute the plans that we have in front of us."

As you think about the 3% service revenue, it's really a combination of subs and ARPA. Hans obviously talked through all of the things that will drive the ARPA side of the equation. But we certainly do expect subs growth, account growth. And net add growth is important to our business as well. We will do that in a disciplined way. We're not going to chase unprofitable growth. But you should expect to see volume growth in the business as well as ARPA growth. 
And then the margin improvement, cost savings where, as you mentioned, we're close to the achieving the $10 billion program well ahead of the end of 2021 timeline that we put in place. But just because we hit that doesn't mean we'll stop. There's significant opportunities to continue to make our business more efficient. The teams are very focused on those. And the $10 billion goal won't change us -- won't slow us down at all from continuing with that. 
As you think about margin improvement, obviously, revenue will be a big driver of that and then you combine that with the cost savings. The one thing I would say is as we have an improvement in EBITDA margin dollars, if we have equipment revenue increase this year, which we would certainly be glad to see an indication of the overall economic activity picking up, you'd see an impact of that in the EBIT margin. So you could have EBIT dollars grow, but margins not grow as much, just because of the impact on the numerator and denominator from the equipment revenue. But we're certainly very much focused on the dollar side to that equation and excited with the guide we have for the year."

We will look for more of these to see that they're fitting into our customer base, that they like it and are willing both to upgrade and migrate. So we'll continue with that. 
On the Fios side, of course, we will continue with the video right now. But you have seen us also, starting with Mix & Match, starting to shop up this because ultimately, I want our customers to have choices. And I want them to choose. If they want the D2C solution or if they want a linear or they want over-the-top, they should be able to choose it. And look at the numbers in the fourth quarter again. We continue to grow our Fios Internet customers and we have a decline in the video customers. That's good for us, I mean, financially. But ultimately, it is to meet our customers' needs.

At the same time, our offerings are so distinct and different than anybody else in the market, where they can go to the unlimited premium together with discovery+ or Disney+ or Disney+ plus, plus. We have ESPN and Hulu included. I think nobody else has those type of things in the market. And our partners, at least if you ask them, I think you should, are very happy and pleased on how we can deal with this. We are happy with it, both from a retention but also from a bottom line side. We were making money on this, which is the whole idea with the Network-as-a-Service that we're building on the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network. 
On the wireline side, I think the whole idea of the Verizon Business Group is really to see that we are working these year-over-year. This is nothing that you fix in a month or a quarter or 2. This is things that we need to invest in a billing system, direct-to-consumer, call centers, everything being set up to deliver scalable platforms for our customer in the Business side. That will, over time, improve our margins in the Verizon Business Group.

And so you had a positive benefit from that in Q2 and 3Q, a little bit of a catch-up in 4Q.

Is it going to be sort of a slow walk? Or is there something exciting around the quarter?

So I think that this is a pretty normal, maybe some a little bit subdued, but it's very normal upgrade cycle that we will see. And 5G will just getting better and better. I mean that's what's happening. I mean we are fortifying our network. We're improving the performance constantly. I remember when I talked about Ultra Wideband reaching maybe 1 gigabit per second, now we're up to 4, 5. So there's so much more to do. And the same goes for our nationwide, improving all the time, performance better. So I think that is coming together as the accessibility to phones are coming out much more and all the main brands have a 5G phone and all of them with ultra wideband. 
So I think that we will see that continuing into '21 and '22. But there are longer cycles today when it comes to customers migrating to new phone. They're very attached to it. But I think this is no different than 4G cycle. I think we actually are -- this is going faster than the 4G cycle. It's just that our memories are so short, so we don't remember that.

But in addition to that, we had the $2.2 billion one-time cash tax benefit in the second quarter last year that obviously won't repeat. So that will be a year-over-year difference in the cash flow.  
And then working capital, as you say, the biggest item working capital is going to be in the receivables side, predominantly on the handsets. Obviously, as volumes go down, the amount of device payment contracts with customers we're doing goes down as well. So even if we don't see an uptick in volumes this year, if they're just flat year-over-year, you have the removal of that tailwind from last year.

But absolutely, everything that we're doing to step customers up from a revenue standpoint also creates incremental lifetime value with those customers. So you should expect that to be a continuation of how we approach the marketplace that we bring customers on, and we do it in a way that creates significant economic value for us over the long term as we provide best-in-class experiences for those customers. Nothing changes there in our mindset."

Secondly, Biden is proposing increasing the corporate tax rate to 28%. I'm curious how you think about that and whether that would have a huge impact on free cash flow and dividend coverage. Or do you think that there will be offsets that you'd be able to kind of absorb much of that increase? And then just as a housekeeping, is TracFone included in your 2021 guidance?"

We -- while we expect TracFone to close in the second half of the year, our guidance is -- doesn't assume any significant impact on the EPS during the year. But we'll update that if necessary, during the year. 
Corporate taxes, our assumption, as you heard in the guide, 23% to 25%. That's where we've been the last few years. Obviously, we do our outlook based off of what is on the legislative books. And so we do it based on what's there right now. We look forward to seeing how the new administration works on a number of different issues. And if that changes the way we look at the business going forward, we'll obviously talk about that at the appropriate time. But we're very confident in the business. 
Look, we had good dividend coverage when we had a much higher tax rate not too many years ago. So while we certainly believe that the current rate has been very helpful in job creation and in economic growth creation, we're certainly very comfortable with how our business is set up as the administration is looking at different things. 
And in terms of CapEx, I think what you're seeing is a very efficient capital deployment model within the company. That's why you see a guide that's in line year-over-year as we continue to do all of the things that we've done, whether that be on LTE, the 5G build. You heard Hans talk about our goals for the ultra wideband build this year, continuing the fiber build-out. And so I think the team has got a very good momentum going there. As they've got more into those things, the efficiencies continue. That's why you see the guide where it is."

As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.  
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.  
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.  
The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. As a reminder, we are in the quiet period for spectrum Auction 107, so we will not be able to comment on our mid-band spectrum holdings or strategy at this time.  
Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.11 per share, resulting in full year earnings of $4.30 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported fourth quarter earnings include a pretax loss from special items of approximately $523 million. This includes a net charge of $404 million primarily related to severance, including voluntary separations under our existing plans and the annual mark-to-market for our pension and OPEB liabilities as well as a net loss of $119 million primarily related to the disposition of the HuffPost business. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.21 in the fourth quarter and $4.90 for the full year.  
Let's now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our fourth quarter earnings profile. The impact to earnings from the adoption of accounting standards ASC 606 for revenue recognition is illustrated for comparability purposes and reflects a reduction in the benefit realized due to the deferral of commission expense versus the prior year. We also continue to monitor the ongoing impacts of COVID on our business. The year-over-year impacts of both ASC 606 and COVID were not significant in the fourth quarter.  
The full year 2020 impacts from ASC 606 and COVID were $0.09 and $0.21, respectively, on both a reported and adjusted earnings per share basis. We do not expect the adoption of ASC 606 to have a significant impact on the comparability of 2021 results to 2020. Full year adjusted EPS growth of 1.9%, illustrated on the earnings waterfall slide, reflects the strong underlying performance of the business.  
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take you through a recap of 2020."

And I can only say that I'm super proud how Verizon responded to the changing environment during 2020. And we supported our customers, our employees and the society in a way that I've never seen before. So all in all, a great year. At the same time, we executed well on our strategy and saw that we had really good financial performance as well.  
When it comes to our 2020 strategic priorities, let me just walk through the execution of them. First of all, strengthening and grow the core business, I'm really proud to announce that we continue to have the best network in the nation. We just got for the 15th time the overall best network with RootMetrics on all 7 different categories. That includes 5G, which is so important to us that we continue to have that lead. I'm also happy to announce that we won for the 26th consecutive time the J.D. Powers Award. It tells a lot about our network and technology team, how they have been building a network and how we continue to lead this market.  
When it comes to the customer innovation, you have seen us working with our customers to give them richer offering and also even better performance of the network. This year, with Disney+, discovery+, also adding in the iPhone 5 from Apple has, of course, supported a lot of innovation that we're doing in the Verizon Consumer Group. And we see a great migration of our customers to unlimited and to the premium unlimited.  
Finally, you can see also that Verizon Business Group has a year of investments to see that we are putting a foundation to be even stronger for the future, had good growth in the wireless and also in some areas like the public sector, a very good performance and also adding a lot of new customers on the enterprise side. 
When it comes to us leveraging the assets to drive new growth, the commitments we did in February 2020 when it comes to 5G were all met or exceeded. I'm extremely happy with that. We now have 64 Ultra Wideband cities. We are more than 10 cities on our home 5G Ultra Wideband. We have 10 mobile edge compute centers public with Amazon. All in all, we deployed more than 5x more Ultra Wideband sites during 2020. And we launched the nationwide 5G that now is covering 230 million POPs in 2,700 cities.  
On the financial side, a strong year ended, where we had more than 2% growth in the wireless service revenue. We also have growth on our EPS in the fourth quarter, over 7%. We had an operational cash flow full year of USD 41.8 billion, which is a growth of 17%, a very strong year that put us in a good position when we go into 2021.  
And finally, we have a really large focus on how to include all our 4 stakeholders in the work we're doing. And I'm really proud of the Citizen Verizon that we launched during last year, which is a great way for us to see that the society aspect is part of our strategy, where, of course, our focus on being carbon neutral is very important. And the second green bond was launched at the second half of 2020. So all in all, I have to say, it was a very different year but a great execution, where we hit all our strategic milestones at the same time as we pivot and supported all our stakeholders.  
At the November sell-side event, I presented the 5 vectors of growth. Those are the vectors that is based on our strategy of Network-as-a-Service. Those are also the enablers for us to get to GDP+. We have great traction on them and we also have done quite a lot in 2020, all the way from the 5G adoption to the customer differentiation that I talked a lot about, the new markets that we're addressing, still pending the acquisition of TracFone, but we have other segments we are addressing as well as the next-generation business-to-business application based on our unique mobile edge compute offering that we have with Amazon, also now with Microsoft and many other partners. And finally, the network monetization with our MVNO partners, which are enjoying the best network that we have and we're building.  
All in all, this is built on the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network that we outlined some 3 years ago and giving us the opportunity to have great execution in the future. With that, I would like to hand over to Matt to go through the financials in a little bit more detail."
415798,698771142,2251207,"Verizon Communications Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Verizon Communications Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by saying how proud I am with the Verizon team and the results we delivered in 2020.  In the fourth quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $34.7 billion, down 0.2%. Total wireless s",2161,"Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by saying how proud I am with the Verizon team and the results we delivered in 2020.  
In the fourth quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $34.7 billion, down 0.2%. Total wireless service revenue growth and strong results in Verizon Media Group were offset by lower wireless equipment revenue and ongoing declines in legacy wireline products.  
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $11.7 billion as compared to $11.1 billion last year, a 5.3% increase driven by service and other revenue growth and disciplined spending. Full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $47.1 billion. And adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.7%, 90 basis points higher than last year, including headwinds of approximately 40 basis points from the deferral of commission expense.  
Our continued focus on our Business Excellence program has resulted in realized cumulative cash savings of $9.5 billion. And we are well positioned to achieve our $10 billion goal ahead of our year-end 2021 target. COVID has brought about new ways of working. And we believe some of these will be long term in nature. This will create additional savings opportunities beyond the current program.  
As Brady mentioned, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.21, up 7.1% from $1.13 a year ago. We are pleased to report 1.9% growth of full year adjusted EPS at the high end of our revised guidance, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our business.  
Let's now turn to cash flow results on Slide 8. Our cash generation was exceptionally strong in 2020, reflecting our subscription-based business model and the quality of our customer base. This enabled us to continue to execute on our capital allocation model, investing in our business, increasing our dividend for the 14th straight year and strengthening our balance sheet.  
Cash flow from operating activities totaled $41.8 billion for the year, an increase of $6 billion from the prior year, driven by continued performance and strength in the business, lower tax payments due to a one-time cash tax benefit received earlier in the year and reductions in working capital primarily due to lower wireless volumes. 
Capital spending in 2020 totaled $18.2 billion as we continued to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband Network and launching our nationwide 5G network. As a result, free cash flow for the year was $23.6 billion, up 32.4% year-over-year.  
Throughout the year, we opportunistically diversified our debt portfolio that optimized our cost of borrowing and retained a higher level of cash as a result of the pandemic. We exited the quarter with net unsecured debt of $96.3 billion. And our net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.0x versus our targeted range of 1.75 to 2.0x. We remain committed to our capital allocation model.  
Now let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 9. Our competitive position is based on compelling unlimited plans that provide choice to consumers paired with the best devices and attractive promotions, all built on the country's best network. This quarter, we launched our nationwide 5G service to coincide with the release of the iPhone 12 lineup, which fully supports our ultra wideband offering, enabling Verizon customers to utilize a full range of connectivity provided by this iconic device.  
Partnerships remain a critical component of our value proposition. We recently added Discovery to our list of existing successful partnerships, which includes Apple and Disney. As the early cohort of Disney+ customers have come off of the initial free 12-month period, more than 2/3 have maintained their subscription, either through their Verizon direct billing relationship or by opting into one of our newest Mix & Match plans with the Disney bundle included. 
Volume activity in the quarter was tempered by consumer behavior, given rising COVID cases and elevated store closures that limited foot traffic in addition to the retention offers in the market. As a result, the pool of consumers switching carriers was lower than a year ago.  
Fourth quarter phone gross adds were down approximately 24% year-over-year, relatively consistent with declines experienced in the third quarter. We are pleased with the quality of the additions we are attracting as over 90% of new accounts came in on an unlimited plan and over 55% of these accounts opted for premium unlimited service. At quarter end, over 60% of our base was on an unlimited plan with more than 20% of our base taking a premium plan.  
Our customer retention remains high with phone churn of 0.76% for the quarter, down 7 basis points from a year ago, contributing to postpaid phone net adds of 163,000. Disconnects related to customers in our Stay Connected program totaled more than 135,000 phones in the quarter. 
Our Stay Connected program continued to see great results with approximately 95% of customers making a payment since entering the program, and collection cure rates are in line with our expectations. More than 50% of all customers in the program are current on their payments. December was the final month of service billings for the program and payment activity remained stable, though we will continue to closely monitor payment trends in 2021.  
Turning to Fios. We continue to build on our strong third quarter with consumer Fios Internet net additions of 92,000, more than double the fourth quarter of 2019. Total Fios Internet net additions of 95,000 was the best fourth quarter we have had since 2014 and reflected strong demand for our gigabit offering as consumers continued to work and learn from home. Cord-cutting trends continued, resulting in consumer Fios Video net losses for the quarter of 72,000.  
Now let's move to Slide 10 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. Consumer operating revenues for the fourth quarter were $23.9 billion, down 1.2%. This was primarily driven by a 3.8% decline in wireless equipment revenue due to softer volumes in the quarter.  
For the full year, total Consumer revenue decreased 2.8% to $88.5 billion, driven by the decline in wireless equipment revenue. Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter was $13.6 billion, a 1.2% increase. The results reflect the resilience of our business as we recovered from a 2.7% decrease in the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, we delivered ARPA growth of 1.8% year-over-year even as TravelPass and other usage fees remain at subdued levels, demonstrating that our tiered approach to unlimited provides a strong foundation for delivering revenue growth.  
For the full year, Consumer wireless service revenue was $53.6 billion, relatively flat from 2019 levels. Consumer Fios revenue totaled $2.8 billion, a 2.5% decline from a year ago. Customer credits related to regional sports networks negatively impacted Fios revenue by 4.2% in the quarter and also reduced our content expense. We expect Fios revenue to benefit as growth in the broadband base offsets the impact of the shift from the triple-play bundle to stand-alone service.  
Consumer segment EBITDA grew 2.9% to $9.9 billion. Margins were 41.5% in the quarter, up 160 basis points from last year, including headwinds of approximately 30 basis points from the deferral of commission expense. For the full year, EBITDA margins were 45.5%, an increase of 120 basis points from the prior year, including an impact of approximately 50 basis points from the deferral of commission expense.  
Now let's move to our Business segment on Slide 11. Business wireless trends remained resilient throughout the year, and the fourth quarter was no different. Public sector demand remained strong on the success of our distance learning program and support for increased needs of state and local government agencies. Small and medium business trends improved sequentially, while we experienced modest pressures in enterprise.  
Business segment phone gross adds for the quarter were down 11% from the prior year due to store closures and continued economic weakness. Segment postpaid phone churn was 0.98% in the quarter, which was down 2 basis points over the prior year. As a result, postpaid phone net adds were 116,000.  
Let's now move to Slide 12 to review the Business financial performance. Operating revenues for the Business segment were $8.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down slightly year-over-year. Full year operating revenues of $31 billion represented a decline of 1.5% from the prior year. Wireless service revenue in the quarter accelerated to 7.1% year-over-year from 4.9% in the third quarter, which was more than offset by reductions in wireless equipment volumes and secular pressure on legacy wireline products.  
Looking at wireless service revenue. Public sector had a particularly strong quarter and small and medium business growth improved for the second straight quarter, although it was still below pre-pandemic growth rates. Legacy wireline product trends appeared to be normalizing after initially benefiting from the transition to a work-from-home economy. The growth in advanced communication services continues to drive opportunities for the segment. 
While we are pleased with the revenue performance of the Business segment and exit 2020 with momentum, there are uncertainties around how businesses will perform in 2021, given the challenges within the macro environment. The elevated demand experienced in public sector and parts of enterprise throughout 2020 could potentially create headwinds to growth in the Business segment, particularly in the back half of 2021.  
Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.6% in the quarter, up 390 basis points from the year-ago period, reflecting the strength in wireless service revenue and the benefits of our transformation initiatives, including back-office digitalization and optimization. Full year margins of 25.4% were up slightly versus last year.  
Now let's move on to Slide 13 to discuss Verizon Media Group. We are very pleased with Verizon Media Group performance. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, up approximately 11% from a year ago, the first quarter of year-over-year growth since the Yahoo! acquisition. Growth in the quarter was fueled by strong advertising trends with demand-type platform revenue growing 41% compared to the prior year. Advertising strength came from political, consumer products, technology and retail, among other verticals.  
The fourth quarter also saw continued high consumer engagement in commerce as offline-to-online shopping behaviors continued through the holiday season on our owned and operated properties. In particular, mail e-commerce revenue growth was 7x that of the prior year. And we saw continued strength in finance and news as daily active users grew 52% and 11%, respectively.  
Let's now move on to Slide 14 for a quick look at overall wireless performance. Key metrics and financial data of the combined wireless products and services from the Consumer and Business segments are illustrated on this slide. Total wireless service revenue was up 2.2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 0.7% for the full year. Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and the supplemental earnings release schedules on our website.  
Now let's focus on our outlook for 2021 on Slide 15. We are excited to deliver 2021 expectations that include accelerating revenue and earnings growth, driven by our 5 growth vectors as wireless service strengthens and 5G continues to scale. This year, we are providing an outlook for service and other revenue, which includes revenues from across all of our businesses but excludes wireless equipment revenue, given its variability, especially in the current environment.  
For 2021, we expect service and other revenue growth of at least 2%, reflecting an acceleration of total wireless service and Fios revenue growth as well as continued momentum in Verizon Media, partially offset by ongoing legacy wireline product declines. Included in this outlook is total wireless service revenue growth of at least 3%, driven by our tiered unlimited plans, new customer contributions and ongoing strength in business.  
For the full year, we expect to see adjusted earnings per share of $5 to $5.15, driven by recurring service and other revenue growth as well as ongoing cost initiatives. We assume no significant year-over-year impact from below-the-line items based on the 2021 opening balance sheet. The adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25%. 
Our consolidated capital spend for full year 2021 is expected to be between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion, consistent with the prior year and within our normal capital intensity range. Our focus for the year includes further expansion of our 5G Ultra Wideband Network in new and existing markets, densification of our network to manage future traffic demands and continued deployment of our fiber infrastructure.  
Our cash flows in 2021 are expected to be driven by higher operating incomes, offset by taxes and working capital. We anticipate that our cash taxes in 2021 will be higher than in 2020, given expectations for higher pretax income this year and a one-time $2.2 billion cash tax benefit received in the second quarter of 2020. Working capital was a tailwind in 2020 due to the lower equipment volumes, which we do not expect to repeat in 2021. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our 2021 priorities."

Let me review the 2021 priorities based on the 4 pillars of strategic priorities. Starting with the core business, and as you heard Matt talking about accelerating the service revenue, I'm pleased that we're guiding for a plus 3% wireless service revenue growth in 2021. That's based on that we will continue to differentiate our value proposition for customers. We also will continue to invest in our Verizon Business Group to capture that potential we see in the Business segment with a new platform that we're developing together with our customers.  
When it comes to our 5G and investing in our business, we have a big year in front of us in 2021. Again, we're going to almost double the amount of 5G Ultra Wideband sites. We're going to have 14,000 new sites coming in during 2021. That will enable us to continue to increase with plus 20 cities when it comes to 5G Ultra Wideband. And we're also going to add some plus 20 5G Home cities, at the same time, focusing very much on the 5G mobile edge compute with 10 more sites when it comes to the public side. And then on the private side, we will scale that network together with the demand that has come as we know already, all underpinned with the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network and the fiber that we are deploying.  
When it comes to the financial, Matt talked about that we continue to focus on the accelerating the earnings per share growth, now with a guidance of $5 to $5.15 earnings per share. The year 2020 solidified our balance sheet. And we will be continued focused on the cash flow generation.  
And finally, when it comes to our culture and our purpose, we have very much focused on the customer-centricity and the brand strength that we have built in the market. That will continue as well as we will have also the Citizen Verizon totally included in the overall strategy. You see that we are managing all the 4 stakeholders that is making the success for Verizon in the future.  
So very clear, a year of execution. We have progressed 1 more year on the Verizon 2.0. We're in a great position. I'm really excited to go into 2021. I'm pleased to announce that we will have our normal Investor Day in the early part of 2021. We will come back with the exact date in due time.

I mean, first of all, we came into the third quarter already, I mean, we have our model with the migration of customers, giving them a better network and a better experience. And that is really how we are managing our base. And we came with a good momentum in the third quarter. And as you saw in the fourth quarter, we had service revenue growing more than 2% as we said also in the guidance. 
That's so important for us because we have a model, where our net addition is part of our strategy, how we move them up. And as Matt said, we have now more than 60% of our customers on unlimited. But more important, I mean, if you look in the fourth quarter, 90% of the new net adds took unlimited. And out of those, 55% took premium. And the premium is, of course, where we are adding in the 5G, we're adding in discovery+, Disney+. The way that our -- that Ronan and his team has worked with this migration pattern, we believe -- and as you heard in the guidance that Matt talked about, we believe that we can continue that work with organic service -- wireless service revenue growth with the model we now have. And we have proven the model over the years.  
And let's also remember the Business side has performed very well when it comes to the wireless account. I mean we are so strong with the public sector, with the large enterprises on the wireless side. So that is giving us a lot of positives going into 2021 with the guidance we have of continued service revenue growth on the wireless side. And we'll constantly measure what the actions we're taking, but we feel good about it. 
When it comes to the fiber question, yes, we continue to roll out fiber. We are probably in the year 3 or 4 right now. We -- I would say with the majority or vast majority of all the 5G sites, they have our own fiber. We are migrating our 4G sites also, where it's a good return on investment to our own fiber. And over time, we will also open up opportunities for resell to our enterprise customers and wholesale. So I think that we are seeing that benefit already on the 5G build because we are using our own fiber.  
To get the full impact, we also have a couple of years left in order to have it in all the areas. But we have come a far way on the fiber build, and we will continue to do it where it makes sense for a return on investment. So we feel really good about that. And that's part of our Verizon Intelligent Edge Network."

So when it comes to our guidance for EPS in 2021, of course, there are uncertainties of the pandemic and so on. But some things we know. I mean the roaming charges will continue to be a headwind. We also think that as the pandemic and economic recoveries is coming back probably latter part of '21, the public sector will not have an equally strong year as they had in 2020. We also believe the SMB will continue to be subdued and have a challenge in '21. And as we saw during the full year, the switcher pool has been lower due to the traffic in the stores, et cetera. So that's were factored in.  
But on the other hand, we have line of sight to what we're doing because we're executing on a strategy when it comes to migration of our customers, what we're doing in Verizon Business Group and also Verizon Media Group. As Matt said, I mean, they were now, for the first time ever, have a year-on-year growth with 11%. All in all, that is giving us the confidence that we can live up to this guidance. But there are some uncertainties and there are some headwinds from COVID. But we think that with those assumptions we have, we can actually do this. And this is continued work with the EPS growth and acceleration that we have talked about for so many years right now. And we continue to show that we can do it with the assets we have and how we're executing. Matt?"

Thanks, Hans. So Brett, just in summary on the COVID assumption and the EPS guidance, I think I'd say while certainly some level of pressures will continue to exist on the business throughout the year, I would say it's -- we're not overly pessimistic, but we're not overly optimistic either. We assume some level of pressures. But you saw from the second half of the year, our ability to still execute within that type of environment.  
In terms of the fourth quarter, as you say, there was actually -- the COVID impact was actually a $0.02 benefit. And what you saw there was there was a couple of one-timers, but primarily it was a case of the revenue pressures we saw declining versus what we've seen in 2Q and 3Q. You think media as an example, which had been significantly hit by COVID impacts earlier in the pandemic but certainly no impact in 4Q as we recorded that 11% revenue growth there. 
So those revenue -- some of the revenue headwinds moderated in the fourth quarter. The expense benefits continued. That's why you saw the $0.02 net benefit, which actually completely offsets the $0.02 headwind from 606. So if you kind of think about in the fourth quarter, 606 and COVID having no net impact on the results, and that $1.21 stands on its own, the 7% increase on a year-over-year basis."

And of course, with the Apple iPhone right now in 5G, that has now kicked off that. So that you will see through the year when it comes to our mobility case.  
When it comes to 5G Home, we have very solid progress in 2020, came out with this new city. We added some 12 cities now with 5G Home with the NR technology. And our plan is doing 20-plus markets more in 2021. So now we're starting to get a solid foundation for the 5G Home. And as you heard in my remarks, I mean, we are doubling the amount of sites almost in 2021. So we're now getting to a very, very solid positioning there.  
But I said before, on the Ultra Wideband build, we're building it mainly in the dense urban areas and then in stadiums, et cetera, in the beginning. So we covered less of houses or residentials in the beginning. But as these continue right now, we're capturing more and more. So I'm really excited. We also know that the CPE is really good. So -- and the self-install is working well. So we're looking forward to seeing that happening over the year more and more.  
On the 5G mobile edge compute, we have a great funnel of customers on the Business side. And we are not expecting that will be in significant revenues in the '21. But you're going to see a lot of customers signing up for the 5G mobile edge compute, both the private and the public, in '21 in order for us to have a very solid base going into '22. 
So a lot of excitement around 5G. I think we have built it absolutely right. We have an opportunity in front of us that we have been working on for a couple of years right now. So I'm happy with my sales team. I'm happy with the technology team. And we have a big year in front of us."

That's number one.  
Number two, just any thoughts on the ability to continue to drive margin improvement in the business, given that -- considering you're close to achieving the $10 billion in savings. And then lastly, sort of a follow-up to Brett's question, is the CapEx guide that we've heard, is that something that could be revised during the year if the circumstances change?"

I mean on the 3% growth, I think we have our strategy when it comes to how to grow it with the migration of customers and all of that. And as always, the team is validating how to make offerings, if we should be more aggressive or not. But we always think about doing long-term positive impact for our shareholders financially. And you have seen us now working for the last 2.5 years since we launched unlimited, we are doing the right things in order to make a long-term impact positively for shareholders and for our customers. 
And so especially Ronan and the team there have quite a lot in the portfolio, but we have now proven that this model is working when it comes to migration of unlimited with the best network and adding in also new value-added services, everything from Disney+ to discovery+, Apple Music, and it might be more coming up in the year as well. So I'm confident that the guys have that in the portfolio. And as you heard about the Disney+, it's -- I think it's just unheard of how we can help direct to consumers. I mean 2/3 are signing up or more than 2/3 are signing up to continue the service after 1 year. I think that is something standing out.  
On the EBITDA, I will -- Matt will come back later on. But I can say that we continued with efficiency. And it's a reason why we are giving a guidance that we will grow the EPS again. And the majority or all of it is basically above the line, as Matt said. So this is operational improvements and improvements as we are growing our top line. Again, we have proven the model, the 5 vectors of growth. And now we're in the middle of executing. 
And finally, on CapEx, this is what we need to do right now. We -- the technology team has all the means they have to execute on a strategy with assets we have today. The only thing I can say, as I said I'm not sure 100 times before, we will only increase CapEx if we find something that has a really good return on investment. And then we'll come back and talk about it. Right now, we have everything that we need to execute the plans that we have in front of us."

As you think about the 3% service revenue, it's really a combination of subs and ARPA. Hans obviously talked through all of the things that will drive the ARPA side of the equation. But we certainly do expect subs growth, account growth. And net add growth is important to our business as well. We will do that in a disciplined way. We're not going to chase unprofitable growth. But you should expect to see volume growth in the business as well as ARPA growth. 
And then the margin improvement, cost savings where, as you mentioned, we're close to the achieving the $10 billion program well ahead of the end of 2021 timeline that we put in place. But just because we hit that doesn't mean we'll stop. There's significant opportunities to continue to make our business more efficient. The teams are very focused on those. And the $10 billion goal won't change us -- won't slow us down at all from continuing with that. 
As you think about margin improvement, obviously, revenue will be a big driver of that and then you combine that with the cost savings. The one thing I would say is as we have an improvement in EBITDA margin dollars, if we have equipment revenue increase this year, which we would certainly be glad to see an indication of the overall economic activity picking up, you'd see an impact of that in the EBIT margin. So you could have EBIT dollars grow, but margins not grow as much, just because of the impact on the numerator and denominator from the equipment revenue. But we're certainly very much focused on the dollar side to that equation and excited with the guide we have for the year."

But you have seen us also, starting with Mix & Match, starting to shop up this because ultimately, I want our customers to have choices. And I want them to choose. If they want the D2C solution or if they want a linear or they want over-the-top, they should be able to choose it. And look at the numbers in the fourth quarter again. We continue to grow our Fios Internet customers and we have a decline in the video customers. That's good for us, I mean, financially. But ultimately, it is to meet our customers' needs. 
And I think the whole setup that we did in Verizon 2.0 is just catered for us to do things that we never thought about before. We have a Consumer division thinking about how are we now delivering to consumers. And that's what you see in the numbers. That's what you see in the numbers that we have. We have the same in Verizon Business Group. They are thinking totally different we have done before. And we still have more to do with platforms and things to be even more scalable and be able to bring more to the bottom line. But I have to say, I'm pleased. And I hope that you guys, what you see, are pleased as well. I mean the strategy is working. We have the 5 vectors of growth. We're going into 2021, we have proof points on all those 5, including the video strategy you asked about."

But on the postpaid churn, I think that we are just having a great moment with our customers. They love our network and the performance we have and the additions we're doing with 5G and 5G Ultra Wideband. At the same time, our offerings are so distinct and different than anybody else in the market, where they can go to the unlimited premium together with discovery+ or Disney+ or Disney+ plus, plus. We have ESPN and Hulu included. I think nobody else has those type of things in the market. And our partners, at least if you ask them, I think you should, are very happy and pleased on how we can deal with this. We are happy with it, both from a retention but also from a bottom line side. We were making money on this, which is the whole idea with the Network-as-a-Service that we're building on the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network. 
On the wireline side, I think the whole idea of the Verizon Business Group is really to see that we are working these year-over-year. This is nothing that you fix in a month or a quarter or 2. This is things that we need to invest in a billing system, direct-to-consumer, call centers, everything being set up to deliver scalable platforms for our customer in the Business side. That will, over time, improve our margins in the Verizon Business Group. And I think that if you look at 2020, I mean, it was a good performance of them, still doing investments in order to get where we want to get over time. And then we add to that new opportunities, like 5G mobile edge compute. Matt?"

If you think about the Stay Connected customers, there was a delay in those customers going all the way through a collections process and so on. 
And so you had a positive benefit from that in Q2 and 3Q, a little bit of a catch-up in 4Q. But even with that, a very strong churn number, and it's just based off of the best network experience as you saw confirmed again by RootMetrics yesterday. When you put that together with everything else we do, customers who get on the Verizon network want to stay on the Verizon network."

So I'm just curious how much of it sort of not happening in that way as due to the pandemic and the lack of getting people to retail versus the lack of applications that would really just sort of delight consumers and get them to upgrade and how you think that's going to evolve over the next year or 2 or 3. Is it going to be sort of a slow walk? Or is there something exciting around the quarter? 
And then for Matt, I'm just curious, beyond working capital, any other free cash flow swing factors for 2021? And is there any way to size or quantify working capital? It's kind of hard to tell looking historically what normal might be."

Remember, we have a fair share or a big share of Apple users in our base. 
So I think that this is a pretty normal, maybe some a little bit subdued, but it's very normal upgrade cycle that we will see. And 5G will just getting better and better. I mean that's what's happening. I mean we are fortifying our network. We're improving the performance constantly. I remember when I talked about Ultra Wideband reaching maybe 1 gigabit per second, now we're up to 4, 5. So there's so much more to do. And the same goes for our nationwide, improving all the time, performance better. So I think that is coming together as the accessibility to phones are coming out much more and all the main brands have a 5G phone and all of them with ultra wideband. 
So I think that we will see that continuing into '21 and '22. But there are longer cycles today when it comes to customers migrating to new phone. They're very attached to it. But I think this is no different than 4G cycle. I think we actually are -- this is going faster than the 4G cycle. It's just that our memories are so short, so we don't remember that. But clearly, this is equal to, to better than what we saw in the 4G cycle that happened some 10 years ago, which I refer to myself when I talk about my memory, so nobody else. Okay, Matt."

Above-the-line earnings will be obviously the largest driver in the cash flow for 2021. In terms of things that potentially go the other way from a cash flow standpoint, we would expect obviously higher earnings will lead to higher cash taxes. But in addition to that, we had the $2.2 billion one-time cash tax benefit in the second quarter last year that obviously won't repeat. So that will be a year-over-year difference in the cash flow.  
And then working capital, as you say, the biggest item working capital is going to be in the receivables side, predominantly on the handsets. Obviously, as volumes go down, the amount of device payment contracts with customers we're doing goes down as well. So even if we don't see an uptick in volumes this year, if they're just flat year-over-year, you have the removal of that tailwind from last year. So all in all, you're going to see the increase from higher earnings with some offsets from cash taxes and hopefully, on the equipment receivables side are going to be the key factors in there."

But absolutely, everything that we're doing to step customers up from a revenue standpoint also creates incremental lifetime value with those customers.

Corporate taxes, our assumption, as you heard in the guide, 23% to 25%. That's where we've been the last few years. Obviously, we do our outlook based off of what is on the legislative books. And so we do it based on what's there right now. We look forward to seeing how the new administration works on a number of different issues. And if that changes the way we look at the business going forward, we'll obviously talk about that at the appropriate time. But we're very confident in the business. 
Look, we had good dividend coverage when we had a much higher tax rate not too many years ago. So while we certainly believe that the current rate has been very helpful in job creation and in economic growth creation, we're certainly very comfortable with how our business is set up as the administration is looking at different things. 
And in terms of CapEx, I think what you're seeing is a very efficient capital deployment model within the company. That's why you see a guide that's in line year-over-year as we continue to do all of the things that we've done, whether that be on LTE, the 5G build. You heard Hans talk about our goals for the ultra wideband build this year, continuing the fiber build-out. And so I think the team has got a very good momentum going there.

As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. 
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates discussed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. 
Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the first quarter. In the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1.27 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported first quarter earnings include a pretax loss from a special item of approximately $223 million related to the sale of certain wireless licenses. Excluding the effects of this special item, adjusted earnings per share was $1.31 in the first quarter. 
On April 8, we announced a recall process for approximately 2.5 million Jetpack units, which impacted some customers enrolled in our distance learning programs. The overall impact included within consolidated operating income was approximately $160 million during the quarter, split between $100 million in the Business segment and the remaining $60 million in Consumer. The impact included within reported and adjusted earnings per share was $0.03 in the first quarter. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the first quarter."

We marked more than 1 year since the devastating effects of COVID-19. While we see significant progress in vaccination, customer sentiment and recovery of our economy, there's still a lot to go before we're back to normal. 
I'm proud of how Verizon has responded during this period for all our stakeholders as we have executed on our balanced stakeholder-driven strategy. And as I said, during the worst period of the pandemic, Verizon will come out stronger as a company when this is over. 
During the last 12 months, we have progressed all our position with customers, employees and added great assets to an already strong position. And today, we stand stronger than ever to compete in the market and serve our customers. 
Looking back on the quarter, we amplified and accelerated our strategy through our average 160 megahertz nationwide position in C-Band. And as we laid out in our Investor Day, the combination of C-Band and our millimeter wave places us in a unique position of strength to execute on all 5G opportunities: 5G Home, 5G Mobility and 5G mobile edge compute. 
On top of that, we have all our 5 vectors of growth in play together with our network leadership and a strong Network-as-a-Service foundation. And the progress we made in the quarter confirms that our strategy is working. We had growth in all our businesses for the first time since the launch of Verizon 2.0. We had growth in both EPS and cash flow. 
With all this work by our great team, we have a head start in the post-COVID era with a clear and differentiated strategy, diverse go-to-market models, network leadership, industry-leading partner ecosystem and a strong brand, all of which together provides a great platform and foundation to achieve our growth targets for 2021 and beyond. 
Let me talk about some of the highlights from the first quarter. Our network team continues to do great things by leading the network performance in the market as well as deploying more assets than ever before: millimeter wave, C-Band, 4G, 5G and fiber. I have a lot of confidence that this team will accelerate our network leadership. 
Our unique Mix & Match model continues to deliver with the migration to unlimited and unlimited premium in the quarter as well as building on our exclusive offerings like Disney+ and the most recent discovery+ that was launched earlier in the quarter. And we are pleased with the discovery+ with the current enrollment rates we have seen so far. 
Our brand and responsible business framework, Citizen Verizon, continue to set standards in the industry. Verizon was recognized by Fast Company as the sixth most innovative company in the corporate social responsibility earlier this quarter. Brand Finance recognized us as the most valuable telecom brand. 
Within ESG, we have ambitious goals such as our commitment to be net 0 in the carbon emission by 2035. Our long-standing focus on diversity, equity and inclusion is evidenced by the fact that we have 100% pay equity by gender globally and by race ethnicity in the United States. And earlier this week, we also launched our 2020 ESG report. 
We continue with a high level of deployment of millimeter wave and fiber in the quarter. And we're on the track to deliver on our operational targets for the year. We brought 5G service to several additional cities. We currently have 30 5G Home and 67 5G Mobility cities live and more to come. 
We recently signed our first European private 5G deal with associated British ports. We also expanded our 5G edge partnership with AWS with private 5G and edge computing to our customers. 
We continue to scale our Network-as-a-Service strategy across new markets and verticals through a diverse set of partnerships. We have partnered with leading brands across diverse verticals such as Honda to innovate, connected and autonomous driving; Deloitte and SAP to create a 5G and edge computing retail digital platform that will provide retailers with real-time operations data; and Greenscape and Arizona State University to build and commercialize immersive learning and training. 
At our Investor Day, we shared with you our plans and commitments for C-Band and Ultra Wideband deployment, which continues to progress well. Our intent is to invest $10 billion of incremental C-Band CapEx to accelerate the integration on this capacity into our network. We recently signed deals with Crown Castle and SBA to accelerate our C-Band deployment and look forward to providing further updates on the build status throughout the year. 
We have already ordered half of the total network equipment needed from our 5G suppliers to support C-Band deployments in 2021. And the satellite operators are on track to clear the spectrum between third and fourth quarter of 2021 for the first tranche of spectrum. 
In addition, we continue to expand our Ultra Wideband coverage in Q1. We deployed 3,600 new Ultra Wideband sites. And to date, we have close to 21,000 sites on air and on track to reach 30,000 by end of this year. 
OneFiber formed a strategic backbone of our intelligent edge network, and we continue to expand fiber deployment. And to date, we have deployed more than 42,000 route miles. We were also pleased with the low rates we achieved for long-term financing of this critical strategic investment. We view the record investor demand as support of our strategy and our financial discipline. 
Lastly, we were also very proud to offer prominent roles to 9 diversity and inclusion financial firms as part of the USD 25 billion financing. As I outlined earlier, our investments in our network and customers are generating solid revenue growth across all 3 of our operating groups. Our success in Mix & Match continue to drive uptake of unlimited plans and higher ARPA, supporting year-over-year growth of 2.4% in wireless service revenue, up from 2.2% in the fourth quarter last year. 
Ronan and the team closed out Q1 with strong momentum. And I'm excited to see their Q2 performance now that almost all of our stores have reopened. In addition, we see solid growth in Fios and with Fios Internet reporting the best first quarter net adds in 6 years. Additionally, Verizon Media Group continues to contribute meaningful growth, including the second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth year-over-year on the top line. 
With that, let me ask Matt to provide some deeper insight to the financial of the first quarter."

As Hans mentioned in his prepared remarks, the first quarter has been a truly exciting and transformative period for our company. 
I am pleased to report that we're off to an excellent start for the year based on our strong operational and financial performance. We are seeing continued strength in our core business with traction across all 5 of our growth vectors, driving higher revenues and increased demand for our products and services. With the positive momentum exiting the first quarter and the ongoing recovery of business activity, we are highly confident that our actions in the marketplace all deliver strong results throughout the year. 
In the first quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $32.9 billion, up year-over-year by 4.0%. High-quality sustainable wireless service revenue growth, a recovery in wireless equipment revenues, strong Fios momentum and excellent digital advertising trends resulted in revenue growth across Consumer, Business and Media. 
Total wireless service revenues were up 2.4% year-over-year, an acceleration from the 2.2% year-over-year growth that we delivered in the fourth quarter. Additional details on total wireless performance are provided in the financial and operating information and the supplemental earnings release schedules on our website. 
Total Fios revenues were up 2.5% year-over-year driven by the strong broadband volumes in recent quarters. Our portfolio of mobility and broadband products and services continues to lead the industry, delivering value to our customers. And we are well positioned to maintain and expand our leadership position as we enter new markets and broaden our offerings and network capabilities. 
I'm extremely proud of the team's execution of our business excellence program over the past 3 years. At the end of the first quarter, we achieved our cumulative cash savings goal of $10 billion, well ahead of our year-end 2021 target. We will realize additional benefits moving forward from the ways we've improved our operating systems and procedures. As we've said previously, we will create additional savings opportunities on a continuous basis beyond this program. 
The strong revenue performance across our 3 business segments for the quarter, combined with our best-in-class cost structure and disciplined focus on the business, delivered adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 billion, which represents growth of 2.0% over the prior year. The Jetpack recall had a 50 basis point impact to adjusted EBITDA margin during the quarter. 
Brady highlighted the adjusted EPS for the first quarter at $1.31. The growth of 4.0% reflects the strength in our core business and sets the stage for Verizon to fully capitalize on the opportunities in the marketplace while giving us excellent momentum relative to our full year adjusted EPS guidance. 
Now let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 7. This quarter, we continue to see excitement around our unlimited offerings, 5G capabilities, Mix & Match value proposition and our best-in-class Fios broadband services. All of this is part of our customer differentiation strategy, which drives deeper and broader relationships with our customers. 
Starting with wireless. We had total postpaid activations of 6.4 million for the quarter, up approximately 14% compared to the same period last year, made up of approximately 2.3 million gross adds and 4.1 million upgrades. First quarter seasonality drove phone net losses of 225,000, which included the last major cohort of disconnects of approximately 90,000 phones related to our Keep America Connected program. 
Early in the quarter, wireless in-store sales were again tempered by our COVID safety protocols as we saw elevated levels of store closures and limited foot traffic. Beginning in March, the improved COVID environment allowed for almost all of our stores to be open. 
Not surprisingly, we saw our best volume of the quarter in March, producing positive phone net adds in the month. The strong March momentum, combined with our new innovative promotional offers, positions us well for the second quarter. 
We continue to be pleased with the quality of the additions we are attracting. Similar to last quarter, over 90% of new accounts came in on an unlimited plan, and over 50% of these accounts opted for premium unlimited service. At quarter end, over 65% of our base was on an unlimited plan with more than 23% of our base taking a premium plan. 
We have plenty of room to continue to expand these penetration rates and believe that they will grow alongside our 5G adoption rates, which currently resides at 14% of our consumer postpaid phone base. 5G adoption and the customer differentiation associated with our premium and unlimited plans will further benefit our retention efforts, which remained strong in Q1, with phone churn of 0.77% for the quarter. We continue to take a balanced and cost-effective approach to customer retention with strong NPS scores, best-in-class network performance and strong value proposition, leading to our excellent levels of customer retention. 
Turning to Fios. We posted our third consecutive quarter of strong growth and high take rates for our best-in-class broadband products with consumer Fios Internet net adds of 98,000, well ahead of the first quarter 2020 performance of 59,000. Total Fios Internet net adds of 102,000 was the best first quarter performance in 6 years. This reflects both the quality of the product as well as the positive sentiment around our Mix & Match home pricing structure, which provides our customers with unmatched simplicity and optionality. 
Now let's move to Slide 8 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. The higher phone activations in the quarter were the major driver of the 4.7% increase in operating revenues to $22.8 billion. The continued adoption of our unlimited and premium unlimited plans drove a 1.5% increase in Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter of $13.7 billion. This growth comes even as TravelPass and our international roaming revenues remain at subdued levels. 
Strong Internet volumes drove the 2.2% increase in Consumer Fios revenue to $2.9 billion. While we continue to experience revenue pressure associated with secular video trends, our broadband subscriber growth, combined with the shift up in speed tiers, more than offset that pressure and will continue to drive solid revenue performance for us. 
Consumer segment EBITDA grew 2.8% to $10.4 billion. The EBITDA margin was 45.5% in the quarter, down 90 basis points from the prior year due to higher volumes, which drove increased equipment revenues and associated costs as well as the Jetpack recall, which had approximately 30 basis points of impact on EBITDA margin for the quarter. 
Now let's move to our Business segment on Slide 9. Our Business team continues to lead the industry towards next-generation B2B applications. Hans referenced some of their accomplishments from the prior 90 days, including announcements on MEC and private 5G. 
In addition, we launched Verizon Frontline, our branding for our advanced network and technology we deliver for first responders. Being the wireless market share leader for public safety and in all of our other customer groups puts us in an ideal position with our customers to be their digital transformation partner of choice. 
Business wireless trends continued their strong momentum in the first quarter of 2021. Postpaid activations were 2 million with total net adds of 156,000, including 47,000 phones. Remember that Q1 of last year benefited from the COVID-related bulk purchases, providing much of the variance for the year-over-year change in gross and net adds. 
Public sector demand remains strong even as distance learning programs settle into a more normal pattern of buying activity. Small and medium business trends improved sequentially as the team continues to make progress in supporting local businesses as they position for an improving environment. 
As more stores reopened in early March, not only did consumer volume see a lift, SMB volumes benefited as well, an encouraging sign for the rebound. Our enterprise team continues to assist our customers in their digital transformation and unlock the potential of 5G. 
Segment postpaid phone churn was 1.01% in the quarter, an improvement of 1 basis point over the prior year. Our strong churn performance reflects the strength and reliability of our network, combined with the full suite of services and solutions that we provide. 
Let's now move to Slide 10 to review the Business financial performance. The high demand for our services and our brand reputation for reliable connectivity have translated into healthy revenue growth of Verizon Business Group. 
Operating revenues for the Business segment was $7.8 billion, up 1.3% year-over-year, the highest rate of growth since the creation of the Business segment in the Verizon 2.0 structure. This growth highlights the success of our business transformation process as strong wireless service growth of 6.2% offset secular pressure in wireline. 
Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.6% in the quarter, down approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. The Jetpack recall mentioned earlier had a more pronounced impact on the Business segment, reducing EBITDA margins by about 130 basis points. 
Now let's move on to Slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Verizon Media Group continues to deliver strong performance driven by high customer engagement with our brands and demand for our advertising platforms. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.9 billion, up approximately 10.4% from a year ago, the second consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Growth in the quarter was fueled by strong advertising trends growing 26%, including 45% growth in DSP revenues. 
Revenue from our owned and operated brands grew 13% compared to the same period last year. We saw continued high consumer engagement with strength in sports and finance as daily active users grew 22% and 8%, respectively, from the prior year. 
Let's now move to our cash flow results on Slide 12. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter totaled $9.7 billion, up approximately $0.9 billion from the prior year driven by our continued operational discipline and net benefits from our liability management activities, which lowered borrowing rates from last year. 
Capital spending for the first quarter totaled $4.5 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network. This includes approximately $40 million for C-Band-related items. 
As a result, free cash flow for the quarter was $5.2 billion, up 46% year-over-year. We made payments of $45 billion in the first quarter to the FCC for C-Band spectrum, one of the recently completed Auction 107. To finance this purchase, we raised over $31 billion in March in addition to the $12 billion raised in Q4. The weighted average maturity of these C-Band borrowings was 17 years, and we achieved a very attractive average cost of funding of 2.5%, benefiting from record order books for our U.S. dollar offerings. 
We are delighted that the credit rating agencies consider the spectrum asset purchases as strategic and critical to our business operations and held their rating levels unchanged. The success in the capital markets is a result of our disciplined capital allocation policy, coupled with our consistent track record of delivering on our commitments made to our investors. 
We exited the quarter with net unsecured debt of $137.4 billion, and our net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.9x. Based on our current cash flow assumptions, we expect our net leverage ratio to be approximately 2.8x by the end of the year. We will evaluate the level of our cash balance based on the recovery in the economy and developments with the pandemic. 
Now let's review our annual guidance targets on Slide 13. As Hans mentioned in his opening remarks, we are on track to achieve our guidance for the year, which remains unchanged. 
Reaffirming our comments from the Investor Day last month, we expect no material impact to our adjusted earnings per share guidance from our C-Band program for this year. We do expect C-Band-related capital spending be between $2 billion to $3 billion for 2021, and we will provide updates on the quarterly earnings calls. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2021."

Hans, could we get your thoughts on the competitive landscape now and maybe whether the new pricing from Comcast or any other competitive development sort of affect your view of the return to growth in terms of postpaid phone net adds here in the second quarter? From your -- the last slide there, it looks like that you expect some nice acceleration. 
And then secondly, there's potentially just a massive amount of federal stimulus money flowing into broadband infrastructure deployment over the next year or 2. I realize we're very early in the process and the rules aren't laid out yet, but do you think Verizon is in a position to capture some of those funds as you sort of continue your heavy spending on Ultra Wideband deployment?"

On the competitive situation, I mean, as you have seen yourself, it is a competitive market, and it's been for quite a while. But with our model, I can see that we are actually winning in any case because with our growth trajectory that we have in all our businesses and the unique bundle, especially on the Consumer side with the Mix & Match, the value proposition. And you saw in the quarter, we continue to do that. 
And -- but also, as Matt mentioned, it was a little bit light in the beginning of the quarter because stores that were closed to that, et cetera. And then we saw a very good sort of strength in our port ratios and/or growth in the end of the quarter because we have all the stores open. So we look forward to the second quarter and the second part of the year. 
And as Ron had said when we had the Investor Day, we believe we're going to have a good second part of the year. Second quarter is really close to us. And what we have seen so far, we feel good about it. So again, we have an overall strategy in order to address the market for consumer that is really working with these step-ups, the migrations and all of that. So in general, we feel good about it. 
The team is doing well. You saw we came out with a new promo as well. And we have always had -- we have a lot of financial discipline. We do this because we know we can actually capture market at good, high-quality customers. 
On the infrastructure, I mean, as you said, this is in the planning stages. So it's hard to say if this is -- will go through or not. So -- but on the other hand, I think that what we are telling the administration is, of course, that accessibility, affordability and usability are the 3 buckets to address the digital divide. 
And when it comes to accessibility, we have to recognize, and I worked in 180 countries with networks that the networks during the COVID-19 in the U.S., they were really working well. There were basically no major issues at all. They could deliver even though traffic moved around. 
So I think that what we are advocating for, we want that private sector continue to invest in the network and leading that charge and then having government work more with the affordability of it. So we have plans that meets all needs for all different customer segments in the market. So that's what we're advocating for. That's the same as BRT is advocating for as well. We don't think that any price regulation would be -- that will be contra productive to the market. 
So in general, again, it's very early on. I mean it's a plan that has not been approved and submitted. But at least we're advocating, together with BRT and with ourselves, what we think should be the right. Matt, any more comments on the competitive landscape?"

I mean, overall, I think the broadband is in demand and our high-quality Fios, of course, a great opportunity for us to expand on them. 
We -- I think, personally, that this will continue. The demand for broadband will continue. We are just starting a total revolution of using technology, which is scalable and sustainable in the past year of the COVID. So -- and we are a great position. And that also is going to help me tremendously when we come with 5G Home, on millimeter wave and C-Band and all that because we know how to deal with home broadband. And that is an advantage we have to any others that is trying to do fixed wireless access, and we have been on to it for a long time. 
And as -- so as well, I mean, now we're up to over 30 markets with 5G Home, I mean added some 20 very recently. So we are on fire on this right now. We have very big belief in our 5G Home. And then later the year, when C-Band comes, we're going to add even more coverage on that. 
And all is embedded in how we work with the ecosystem from the beginning and how we have developed our own IPRs on how to do self-install, how to do all the sort of grids when it comes to millimeter wave and having a great opportunity to see that our customer gets a fantastic service. So all in all, this is a full package that we are bringing to the market in order to have a fully scaled broadband for the country. And I think it's absolutely the right moment. 
But don't forget on the business side as well, we now -- it's called 5G Internet on the business side. We are using the same methodology. We are doing the scaling on the same platforms, and we address another market with it. It goes back to a strategy that we had for all the time. We have a network of service, and we scale it with different customers. And that scale will help us with growth, but it also means that with the platform thinking we have, that will fall to the bottom line. And if you see in this quarter, all 3 units are growing. And we're bringing it to all to bottom line, and we still have more to do. But we know how to do it, and we have the model."

And as you have seen, I mean, we have already ordered half of the equipment. We have made agreement with the tower cos. We have talked to the satellite companies, that has reaffirmed that they believe that they can clear this first tranche of the spectrum in third quarter and fourth quarter. 
So we're -- and we actually made a press release yesterday that we're now starting deploying C-Band as well, and that's 6 weeks. So we are -- the technology team was on fire to make this happen. And as I said, when we had this see -- at our Investor Day, we said that we worked with the dates we've got from the FCC because we haven't talked to anybody. Right now, this is the best date we have. And of course, we are pushing as much as possible to see that we get this up for our customers as soon as possible in order to get a great experience. 
And then flowing that over to the phone question, I think that we have seen a great uptake on 5G phones and unlimited premium. And as Matt said, in the quarter, over 20% of the unlimited new customers took unlimited premium. That tells you there's a lot of value in it and a lot of 5G unit. 
And with the new promo that Matt talked about, we believe that is going to also drive 5G. So we believe that what we have in the market right now will continue to grow the 5G base. And as I said, this is growing faster than what we saw in 4G. So we will continue to monitor, of course, but we see a good uptake on it. And we can also add that when it comes to the iPad that have been just a recent launch, it's also another additional millimeter wave and how that comes into the whole ecosystem. 
So again, we feel good about the uptake, and we feel good about the line of products we have. And we have the promo supporting it. So that's going to also go well together with the C-Band deployment coming later this year then."

I don't think we're over it that SMBs are coming back immediately. But clearly, we see some signs of improvement in the base. 
On the enterprise side, on the large enterprise side, I think we have the tale of 2 cities here again. I mean, you have certain large enterprises that are really impacted by the COVID-19 in the recession. They are basically holding back on investments. 
Then you have certain that has been fortunate in these tough times to actually grow better and having a lot of demand. So they are investing. And that is giving the blended rate that we have right now.

So once you -- as you're lighting up those cell sites when you go past an enterprise building, the opportunity to go in there and have more customers or enterprise customers on-net rather than paying third-party access absolutely is an opportunity for us to create incremental return on that investment in fiber. So again, another example of a multiuse network."

I know that kind of on a year-over-year basis, there's been a mix shift in an uptake on the higher speed broadband services, but sequentially, it was just a big number. I was wondering if you guys did something on price on the broadband or even on the video that would have contributed to that move. 
And then the second question, I guess, Matt, you guys threw a lot of numbers out on Media. 26% advertising growth, 13% owned property growth, 10.4% total revenue growth. Could you kind of break that down, what the moving parts are kind of dragging down some of those bigger, higher, eye-popping numbers? And kind of is this kind of a 1-year level set over a depressed 2020 and we're going to return to some kind of more normal revenue growth pattern in 2022?"

In the first quarter last year, we introduced Mix & Match into our Fios offering. It's been great for our Consumer business. We introduced it into Fios in first quarter last year. 
Obviously, the initial benefit we were seeing there got interrupted as the pandemic got underway. But you saw, we now have 3 quarters of very strong volumes starting in third quarter last year, fourth quarter and now again in the first quarter here, our best first quarter in total Fios for 6 years. And so what that means is you've got an Internet base of customers in Fios that's now more than 5% higher than it was a year ago. And so that's driving the revenue growth even if you have the secular pressures coming on the video side. 
It's really volume created as much as step-ups or anything else, although there are obviously step-ups in there and opportunities to move customers to gigabit service and so on. But the strong volumes based on the quality of service, combined with bringing the Mix & Match there, it's worked very well for us in consumer mobility, now working well for us in Fios. And as you saw, we brought the Mix & Match construct into our SMB wireless offerings as well. So very excited about what that's going to do. 
On the Media revenue side, as you say, the 10.4% up double digits for the second consecutive quarter. You remember both fourth quarter and now first quarter aren't really lapping COVID-impacted quarters. So what you're seeing here is the benefit of the hard work the team has been doing over the past couple of years. And that's really showing up on the advertising trends as we talked about there, offsetting that, to your question, how do you get from those higher numbers down to the 10%? Things like search revenue continue to be a headwind and will likely continue to be so. But we're very encouraged by the advertising and the O&O momentum that we have. And as you say, now we -- that's not a 1-year thing. As we go forward, the team is getting some good momentum. Hans?"

And so look, I am incredibly proud of the team's efforts over the past 3-plus years now as we've really leaned in on identifying ways to continue to make us more efficient and maintain our position and having the best cost structure in the industry, which we think is going to continue to be important going forward, obviously. 
In terms of your first question, it's the split between both CapEx and P&L items behind the $10 billion. It's roughly even between those 2 where you see that come from. 
So on the CapEx side, that means we've be able to do more deployments for the same amount of money than we would have done previously. That's allowed us to do some of the things across the network as we continue to transform the network, not just in deploying 5G but also the intelligent edge network transformation going on, the OneFiber, there's a backbone in there as well that's going to give us benefits for years to come as a result of some of the efficiencies. 
And then on the P&L side, some of those have helped contribute to the bottom line. But some of them have also allowed us to reinvest in the business so that we can continue to be competitive in the marketplace, continue to bring new promotions and so on to our consumers. And you see the value of us doing that. 
And in terms of the pace going forward, just because we've hit the target, it doesn't mean we slow down. We will have continuous improvement going forward here. The team's got good momentum. And the great news is we didn't coast to the finish line here. We ran through the finish line. We accelerated through the tape. There's a lot more opportunities for us. Obviously, the last year has identified even more items for us. So as we go forward, we will continue to increase the efficiency of the business, both on the income statement and also from a capital side as well. So a lot more to come."

And as we look at that, there's a couple of things going in different directions. As we saw the increase in equipment volumes, we saw the device payables, the receivables related to that increase. As you would expect, that was a benefit on cash flow last year. We said that would be a headwind this year, hope to be a headwind this year, absolutely saw that. 
Offsetting that a little bit was the volumes that we saw in March helped inventory levels. But also we saw really good customer payments in the month of March, too, as those stimulus payments hit. So as I think about cash flow for the rest of the year, I would expect the device receivables to continue to be a little bit of a headwind as those return to a more normal level after the lower volumes last year. 
And then obviously, we don't have cash tax payments in first quarter. Those come through the final 3 quarters of the year. And as we mentioned, we had a couple of faithful items in there last year.

And then as volumes pick up and you focus a bit more on volumes over the course of this year, there's a tailwind -- so there's a headwind from that. So if you could just talk about the puts and takes when it comes to margins over the course of the year in the Consumer business, that would be useful. 
And then secondly, when you think about the stimulus that was passed in December, it looks like some of that money can flow to wireless consumers, the subsidy. The $3 billion subsidy for broadband, I guess some of that could flow to wireless consumers as well. Are you guys starting to see some of that impact? How big of a tailwind do you expect that to be in the second quarter?"

So on the Consumer margins, I think we've historically produced very good margins across the business there, and I'd expect that to continue going forward. As you identified, there is always a number of puts and takes out there as we move forward. And certainly, Fios is performing very well and is contributing nicely to that. 
But as you also rightly pointed out, equipment volumes were up significantly year-over-year. And obviously, that increases the denominator and the margin calculation without really increasing the numerator. So you've got a number of different puts and takes. You'll have the ongoing impacts of building out the network in there as well. But we feel very good about the margins that we'll have for the rest of the year within Consumer, very much in line with what you would expect. 
And then certainly, the seasonality showing up in the fourth quarter with the seasonal volumes that you would expect to see over the course of the holiday period. So certainly to continue to be on track to give the -- to meet the EPS guidance we have for the year. Consumer margins need to be a strong contributor to that, and I expect that will be. 
In terms of stimulus benefits, as I think I mentioned in the comment about working capital, we're seeing very good payment patterns from consumers at this point. That's where I think we'll see the vast majority of any benefit show up. So those payments were very strong in the first quarter, and I suspect the stimulus bills had something to do with that. But it means that our consumers are in very good shape as compared to where they otherwise might have been given the impacts of the pandemic going into the second quarter, and we feel good about the outlook for the rest of the year ahead of us."

As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.  
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.  
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates discussed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.  
Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the first quarter. In the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1.27 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported first quarter earnings include a pretax loss from a special item of approximately $223 million related to the sale of certain wireless licenses. Excluding the effects of this special item, adjusted earnings per share was $1.31 in the first quarter.  
On April 8, we announced a recall process for approximately 2.5 million Jetpack units, which impacted some customers enrolled in our distance learning program. The overall impact included within consolidated operating income was approximately $160 million during the quarter, split between $100 million in the Business segment and the remaining $60 million in Consumer. The impact included within reported and adjusted earnings per share was $0.03 in the first quarter.  
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the first quarter."

We marked more than 1 year since the devastating effects of COVID-19. While we see significant progress in vaccination, customer sentiment and recovery of our economy, there's still a lot to go before we're back to normal.  
I'm proud of how Verizon has responded during this period for all our stakeholders as we have executed on our balanced stakeholder-driven strategy. And as I said during the worst period of the pandemic, Verizon will come out stronger as a company when this is over.  
During the last 12 months, we have progressed all our position with customers, employees and added great assets to an already strong position. And today, we stand stronger than ever to compete in the market and serve our customers.  
Looking back on the quarter, we amplified and accelerated our strategy through our average 160 megahertz nationwide position in C-Band. And as we laid out in our Investor Day, the combination of C-Band and our millimeter wave places us in a unique position of strength to execute on all 5G opportunities: 5G Home, 5G Mobility and 5G mobile edge compute.  
On top of that, we have all our 5 vectors of growth in play together with our network leadership and a strong Network-as-a-Service foundation. And the progress we made in the quarter confirms that our strategy is working. We had growth in all our businesses for the first time since the launch of Verizon 2.0. We had growth in both EPS and cash flow.  
With all this work by our great team, we have a head start in the post-COVID era with a clear and differentiated strategy, diverse go-to-market models, network leadership, industry-leading partner ecosystem and a strong brand, all of which together provides a great platform and foundation to achieve our growth targets for 2021 and beyond.  
Let me talk about some of the highlights from the first quarter. Our network team continues to do great things by leading the network performance in the market as well as deploying more assets than ever before: millimeter wave, C-Band, 4G, 5G and fiber. I have a lot of confidence that this team will accelerate our network leadership.  
Our unique Mix & Match model continues to deliver with the migration to unlimited and unlimited premium in the quarter as well as building on our exclusive offerings like Disney+ and the most recent discovery+ that was launched earlier in the quarter. And we are pleased with the discovery+ with the current enrollment rates we have seen so far.  
Our brand and responsible business framework, Citizen Verizon, continue to set standards in the industry. Verizon was recognized by Fast Company as the sixth most innovative company in the corporate social responsibility earlier this quarter. Brand Finance recognized us as the most valuable telecom brand.  
Within ESG, we have ambitious goals such as our commitment to be net 0 in the carbon emission by 2035. Our long-standing focus on diversity, equity and inclusion is evidenced by the fact that we have 100% pay equity by gender globally and by race ethnicity in the United States. And earlier this week, we also launched our 2020 ESG report.  
We continue with a high level of deployment of millimeter wave and fiber in the quarter. And we're on the track to deliver on our operational targets for the year. We brought 5G service to several additional cities. We currently have 30 5G Home and 67 5G Mobility cities live and more to come.  
We recently signed our first European private 5G deal with Associated British Ports. We also expanded our 5G Edge partnership with AWS with private 5G and edge computing to our customers.  
We continue to scale our Network-as-a-Service strategy across new markets and verticals through a diverse set of partnerships. We have partnered with leading brands across diverse verticals such as Honda to innovate connected and autonomous driving; Deloitte and SAP to create a 5G and edge computing retail digital platform that will provide retailers with real-time operations data; and Dreamscape and Arizona State University to build and commercialize immersive learning and training.  
At our Investor Day, we shared with you our plans and commitment for C-Band and Ultra Wideband deployment, which continues to progress well. Our intent is to invest $10 billion of incremental C-Band CapEx to accelerate the integration on this capacity into our network. We recently signed deals with Crown Castle and SBA to accelerate our C-Band deployment and look forward to providing further updates on the build status throughout the year.  
We have already ordered half of the total network equipment needed from our 5G suppliers to support C-Band deployments in 2021. And the satellite operators are on track to clear the spectrum between third and fourth quarter of 2021 for the first tranche of spectrum.  
In addition, we continue to expand our Ultra Wideband coverage in Q1. We deployed 3,600 new Ultra Wideband sites. And to date, we have close to 21,000 sites on air and on track to reach 30,000 by end of this year.  
One Fiber form the strategic backbone of our intelligent edge network, and we continue to expand fiber deployment. And to date, we have deployed more than 42,000 route miles. We were also pleased with the low rates we achieved for long-term financing of this critical strategic investment. We view the record investor demand as support of our strategy and our financial discipline.  
Lastly, we were also very proud to offer prominent roles to 9 diversity and inclusion financial firms as part of the USD 25 billion financing. 
As I outlined earlier, our investments in our network and customers are generating solid revenue growth across all 3 of our operating groups. Our success in Mix & Match continue to drive uptake of unlimited plans and higher ARPA, supporting year-over-year growth of 2.4% in wireless service revenue, up from 2.2% in the fourth quarter last year.  
Ronan and the team closed out Q1 with strong momentum. And I'm excited to see their Q2 performance now that almost all of our stores have reopened. In addition, we see solid growth in Fios and with Fios Internet reporting the best first quarter net adds in 6 years. Additionally, Verizon Media Group continues to contribute meaningful growth, including the second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth year-over-year on the top line.  
With that, let me ask Matt to provide some deeper insight to the financial of the first quarter."
415798,705575436,2254550,"Verizon Communications Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2021",2021-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Verizon Communications Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. As Hans mentioned in his prepared remarks, the first quarter has been a truly exciting and transformative period for our company.

As Hans mentioned in his prepared remarks, the first quarter has been a truly exciting and transformative period for our company. I am pleased to report that we're off to an excellent start for the year based on our strong operational and financial performance. 
We are seeing continued strength in our core business with traction across all 5 of our growth vectors, driving higher revenues and increased demand for our products and services. With the positive momentum exiting the first quarter and the ongoing recovery of business activity, we are highly confident that our actions in the marketplace all deliver strong results throughout the year.  
In the first quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $32.9 billion, up year-over-year by 4.0%. High-quality sustainable wireless service revenue growth, a recovery in wireless equipment revenues, strong Fios momentum and excellent digital advertising trends resulted in revenue growth across Consumer, Business and Media.  
Total wireless service revenues were up 2.4% year-over-year, an acceleration from the 2.2% year-over-year growth that we delivered in the fourth quarter. Additional details on total wireless performance are provided in the financial and operating information and the supplemental earnings release schedules on our website.  
Total Fios revenues were up 2.5% year-over-year driven by the strong broadband volumes in recent quarters. Our portfolio of mobility and broadband products and services continues to lead the industry, delivering value to our customers. And we are well positioned to maintain and expand our leadership position as we enter new markets and broaden our offerings and network capabilities.  
I'm extremely proud of the team's execution of our business excellence program over the past 3 years. At the end of the first quarter, we achieved our cumulative cash savings goal of $10 billion, well ahead of our year-end 2021 target. We will realize additional benefits moving forward from the ways we've improved our operating systems and procedures. As we've said previously, we will create additional savings opportunities on a continuous basis beyond this program.  
The strong revenue performance across our 3 business segments for the quarter, combined with our best-in-class cost structure and disciplined focus on the business, delivered adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 billion, which represents growth of 2.0% over the prior year. The Jetpack recall had a 50 basis point impact to adjusted EBITDA margin during the quarter.  
Brady highlighted the adjusted EPS for the first quarter at $1.31. The growth of 4.0% reflects the strength in our core business and sets the stage for Verizon to fully capitalize on the opportunities in the marketplace while giving us excellent momentum relative to our full year adjusted EPS guidance.  
Now let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 7. This quarter, we continue to see excitement around our unlimited offerings, 5G capabilities, Mix & Match value proposition and our best-in-class Fios broadband services. All of this is part of our customer differentiation strategy, which drives deeper and broader relationships with our customers.  
Starting with wireless. We had total postpaid activations of 6.4 million for the quarter, up approximately 14% compared to the same period last year, made up of approximately 2.3 million gross adds and 4.1 million upgrades. First quarter seasonality drove phone net losses of 225,000, which included the last major cohort of disconnects of approximately 90,000 phones related to our Keep America Connected program.  
Early in the quarter, wireless in-store sales were again tempered by our COVID safety protocols as we saw elevated levels of store closures and limited foot traffic. Beginning in March, the improved COVID environment allowed for almost all of our stores to be open.  
Not surprisingly, we saw our best volume of the quarter in March, producing positive phone net adds in the month. The strong March momentum, combined with our new innovative promotional offers, positions us well for the second quarter.  
We continue to be pleased with the quality of the additions we are attracting. Similar to last quarter, over 90% of new accounts came in on an unlimited plan, and over 50% of these accounts opted for premium unlimited service. At quarter end, over 65% of our base was on an unlimited plan with more than 23% of our base taking a premium plan.  
We have plenty of room to continue to expand these penetration rates and believe that they will grow alongside our 5G adoption rates, which currently resides at 14% of our consumer postpaid phone base. 5G adoption and the customer differentiation associated with our premium and unlimited plans will further benefit our retention efforts, which remained strong in Q1, with phone churn of 0.77% for the quarter. We continue to take a balanced and cost-effective approach to customer retention with strong NPS scores, best-in-class network performance and strong value proposition, leading to our excellent levels of customer retention.  
Turning to Fios. We posted our third consecutive quarter of strong growth and high take rates for our best-in-class broadband products with consumer Fios Internet net adds of 98,000, well ahead of the first quarter 2020 performance of 59,000. Total Fios Internet net adds of 102,000 was the best first quarter performance in 6 years. This reflects both the quality of the product as well as the positive sentiment around our Mix & Match home pricing structure, which provides our customers with unmatched simplicity and optionality.  
Now let's move to Slide 8 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. The higher phone activations in the quarter were the major driver of the 4.7% increase in operating revenues to $22.8 billion. The continued adoption of our unlimited and premium unlimited plans drove a 1.5% increase in Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter of $13.7 billion. This growth comes even as TravelPass and our international roaming revenues remain at subdued levels.  
Strong Internet volumes drove the 2.2% increase in Consumer Fios revenue to $2.9 billion. While we continue to experience revenue pressure associated with secular video trends, our broadband subscriber growth, combined with the shift up in speed tiers, more than offset that pressure and will continue to drive solid revenue performance for us.  
Consumer segment EBITDA grew 2.8% to $10.4 billion. The EBITDA margin was 45.5% in the quarter, down 90 basis points from the prior year due to higher volumes, which drove increased equipment revenues and associated costs as well as the Jetpack recall, which had approximately 30 basis points of impact on EBITDA margin for the quarter.  
Now let's move to our Business segment on Slide 9. Our Business team continues to lead the industry towards next-generation B2B applications. Hans referenced some of their accomplishments from the prior 90 days, including announcements on MEC and private 5G.  
In addition, we launched Verizon Frontline, our branding for our advanced network and technology we deliver for first responders. Being the wireless market share leader for public safety and in all of our other customer groups puts us in an ideal position with our customers to be their digital transformation partner of choice.  
Business wireless trends continued their strong momentum in the first quarter of 2021. Postpaid activations were 2 million with total net adds of 156,000, including 47,000 phones. Remember that Q1 of last year benefited from the COVID-related bulk purchases, providing much of the variance for the year-over-year change in gross and net adds.  
Public sector demand remains strong even as distance learning programs settle into a more normal pattern of buying activity. Small and medium business trends improved sequentially as the team continues to make progress in supporting local businesses as they position for an improving environment.  
As more stores reopened in early March, not only did consumer volume see a lift, SMB volumes benefited as well, an encouraging sign for the rebound. Our enterprise team continues to assist our customers in their digital transformation and unlock the potential of 5G.  
Segment postpaid phone churn was 1.01% in the quarter, an improvement of 1 basis point over the prior year. Our strong churn performance reflects the strength and reliability of our network, combined with the full suite of services and solutions that we provide.  
Let's now move to Slide 10 to review the Business financial performance. The high demand for our services and our brand reputation for reliable connectivity have translated into healthy revenue growth of Verizon Business Group.  
Operating revenues for the Business segment was $7.8 billion, up 1.3% year-over-year, the highest rate of growth since the creation of the Business segment in the Verizon 2.0 structure. This growth highlights the success of our business transformation process as strong wireless service growth of 6.2% offset secular pressure in wireline.  
Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.6% in the quarter, down approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. The Jetpack recall mentioned earlier had a more pronounced impact on the Business segment, reducing EBITDA margins by about 130 basis points.  
Now let's move on to Slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Verizon Media Group continues to deliver strong performance driven by high customer engagement with our brands and demand for our advertising platforms. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.9 billion, up approximately 10.4% from a year ago, the second consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Growth in the quarter was fueled by strong advertising trends growing 26%, including 45% growth in DSP revenues.  
Revenue from our owned and operated brands grew 13% compared to the same period last year. We saw continued high consumer engagement with strength in sports and finance as daily active users grew 22% and 8%, respectively, from the prior year.  
Let's now move to our cash flow results on Slide 12. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter totaled $9.7 billion, up approximately $0.9 billion from the prior year driven by our continued operational discipline and net benefits from our liability management activities, which lowered borrowing rates from last year.  
Capital spending for the first quarter totaled $4.5 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network. This includes approximately $40 million for C-Band-related items.  
As a result, free cash flow for the quarter was $5.2 billion, up 46% year-over-year. We made payments of $45 billion in the first quarter to the FCC for C-Band spectrum, one of the recently completed Auction 107. To finance this purchase, we raised over $31 billion in March in addition to the $12 billion raised in Q4. The weighted average maturity of these C-Band borrowings was 17 years, and we achieved a very attractive average cost of funding of 2.5%, benefiting from record order books for our U.S. dollar offerings.  
We are delighted that the credit rating agencies consider the spectrum asset purchases as strategic and critical to our business operations and held their rating levels unchanged. The success in the capital markets is a result of our disciplined capital allocation policy, coupled with our consistent track record of delivering on our commitments made to our investors.  
We exited the quarter with net unsecured debt of $137.4 billion, and our net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.9x. Based on our current cash flow assumptions, we expect our net leverage ratio to be approximately 2.8x by the end of the year. We will evaluate the level of our cash balance based on the recovery in the economy and developments with the pandemic.  
Now let's review our annual guidance targets on Slide 13. As Hans mentioned in his opening remarks, we are on track to achieve our guidance for the year, which remains unchanged.  
Reaffirming our comments from the Investor Day last month, we expect no material impact to our adjusted earnings per share guidance from our C-Band program for this year. We do expect C-Band-related capital spending to be between $2 billion to $3 billion for 2021, and we will provide updates on the quarterly earnings calls.  
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2021."

From your -- the last slide there, it looks like that you expect some nice acceleration. 
And then secondly, there's potentially just a massive amount of federal stimulus money flowing into broadband infrastructure deployment over the next year or 2. I realize we're very early in the process and the rules aren't laid out yet, but do you think Verizon is in a position to capture some of those funds as you sort of continue your heavy spending on Ultra Wideband deployment?"

And you saw in the quarter, we continue to do that. 
And -- but also, as Matt mentioned, it was a little bit light in the beginning of the quarter because stores that were closed to that, et cetera. And then we saw a very good sort of strength in our port ratios and our growth in the end of the quarter because we have all the stores open. So we look forward to the second quarter and the second part of the year. 
And as Ronan said when we had the Investor Day, we believe we're going to have a good second part of the year. Second quarter is really close to us. And what we have seen so far, we feel good about it. So again, we have an overall strategy in order to address the market for consumer that is really working with these step-ups, the migrations and all of that. So in general, we feel good about it. 
The team is doing well. You saw we came out with a new promo as well. And we have always had -- we have a lot of financial discipline. We do this because we know we can actually capture market at good high-quality customers. 
On the infrastructure, I mean, as you said, this is in the planning stages. So it's hard to say if this is -- will go through or not. So -- but on the other hand, I think that what we are telling the administration is, of course, that accessibility, affordability and usability are the 3 buckets to address the digital divide. 
And when it comes to accessibility, we have to recognize, and I worked in 180 countries with networks, that the networks during the COVID-19 in the U.S., they were really working well. There were basically no major issues at all. They could deliver even though traffic moved around. 
So I think that what we are advocating for, we want that private sector continue to invest in the network and leading that charge and then having government work more with the affordability of it. So we have plans that meets all needs for all different customer segments in the market. So that's what we're advocating for. That's the same as BRT is advocating for as well. We don't think that any price regulation would be -- that will be contra productive to the market. 
So in general, again, it's very early on. I mean it's a plan that has not been approved and submitted. But at least we're advocating, together with BRT and with ourselves, what we think should be the right. Matt, any more comments on the competitive landscape?"

I mean, overall, I think the broadband is in demand and our high-quality Fios, of course, a great opportunity for us to expand on them. 
We -- I think, personally, that this will continue. The demand for broadband will continue. We are just starting a total revolution of using technology, which is scalable and sustainable in the post era of the COVID. So -- and we are a great position. And that also is going to help me tremendously when we come with 5G Home, on millimeter wave and C-Band and all that because we know how to deal with home broadband. And that is an advantage we have to any others that is trying to do fixed wireless access, and we have been on to it for a long time. 
And as we show as well, I mean, now we're up to over 30 markets with 5G Home, I mean added some 20 very recently. So we are on fire on this right now. We have very big belief in our 5G Home. And then later the year, when C-Band comes, we're going to add even more coverage on that. 
And all is embedded in how we work with the ecosystem from the beginning and how we have developed our own IPRs on how to do self-install, how to do all the sort of grids when it comes to millimeter wave and having a great opportunity to see that our customer gets a fantastic service. So all in all, this is a full package that we are bringing to the market in order to have a fully scaled broadband for the country. And I think it's absolutely the right moment. 
But don't forget on the business side as well, we now -- it's called 5G Internet on the business side. We are using the same methodology. We are doing the scaling on the same platforms, and we address another market with it. It goes back to a strategy that we had for all the time. We have a Network-as-a-Service, and we scale it with different customers. And that scale will help us with growth, but it also means that with the platform thinking we have, that will fall to the bottom line. And if you see in this quarter, all 3 units are growing. And we're bringing it to all to bottom line, and we still have more to do. But we know how to do it, and we have the model."

Equally important to creating that coverage is making sure your customer base is able to use that capacity, which is going to require a fairly significant handset upgrade cycle. 
You noted that you had just put a new promo into the market this quarter. How are you thinking about stimulating device upgrades over the course of the year? What's embedded in your guidance in terms of maybe doing more of this? 
And then just as a follow-up question, you had noted you do expect that the Phase 1 spectrum will be cleared by 3Q, 4Q. But it seems like you don't expect to be fully utilized yet until March. So there's a bit of a gap. I'm just wondering if there's anything you can do to close out or that's just what the supply chain can deliver right now."

When it comes to -- first of all, I can only say that we are on to a fast start on the C-Band. I mean, it's only some 6 weeks ago since we can start to talk to our employees, we could talk to our partners, we can talk to the satellite companies, our suppliers. And as you have seen, I mean, we have already ordered half of the equipment. We have made agreement with the tower cos. We have talked to the satellite companies that has reaffirmed that they believe that they can clear this first tranche of the spectrum in third quarter and fourth quarter. 
So we're -- and we actually made a press release yesterday that we're now starting deploying C-Band as well, and that's 6 weeks. So we are -- the technology team was on fire to make this happen. And as I said, when we had this see -- at our Investor Day, we said that we worked with the dates we've got from the FCC because we haven't talked to anybody. Right now, this is the best date we have. And of course, we are pushing as much as possible to see that we get this up for our customers as soon as possible in order to get a great experience. 
And then flowing that over to the phone question, I think that we have seen a great uptake on 5G phones and on unlimited premium. And as Matt said, in the quarter, over 20% of the unlimited new customers took unlimited premium. That tells you there's a lot of value in it and a lot of 5G unit. 
And with the new promo that Matt talked about, we believe that is going to also drive 5G. So we believe that what we have in the market right now will continue to grow the 5G base. And as I said, this is growing faster than what we saw in 4G. So we will continue to monitor, of course, but we see a good uptake on it. And we can also add that when it comes to the iPad that have been just recently launched, it's also another additional millimeter wave and how that comes into the whole ecosystem. 
So again, we feel good about the uptake, and we feel good about the line of products we have. And we have the promo supporting it. So that's going to also go well together with the C-Band deployment coming later this year then."

And we had enormously strong wireless business with SMBs coming into the COVID-19 that actually came down quite a lot. We have seen over the year that we slowly are coming back on that. And in this quarter, we actually had a very small growth in SMB. 
So as the economy recover, we think our positioning is really good on the wireless side, but also with the 5G Internet, meaning fixed wireless access, I think we have a great combination to support our customers with that on top of some value-added services on top of it. And I know that Tami and the team is working with this every day. 
I don't think we're over it that SMBs are coming back immediately. But clearly, we see some signs of improvement in the base. 
On the enterprise side, on the large enterprise side, I think we have the tale of 2 cities here again. I mean, you have certain large enterprises that are really impacted by the COVID-19 and the recession. They are basically holding back on investments. 
Then you have certain that has been fortunate in these tough times to actually grow better and having a lot of demand. So they are investing. And that is giving the blended rate that we have right now. And of course, in the enterprise business, we have the wireline sort of secular decline in the wireline, which will not go away, but the wireless business is coming in. Our mobile edge compute is happening. You saw how many announcement we did in the first quarter. We start to see exactly what we have predicted, that this year is the year of building the funnel and making this customer commercial. And Tami and the team are working together with Kyle, our CTO, every day to see that the customers are really seeing the benefit of it."

And then the second question, I guess, Matt, you guys threw a lot of numbers out on Media. 26% advertising growth, 13% owned property growth, 10.4% total revenue growth. Could you kind of break that down, what the moving parts are kind of dragging down some of those bigger, higher, eye-popping numbers?

In the first quarter last year, we introduced Mix & Match into our Fios offering. It's been great for our Consumer business. We introduced it into Fios in first quarter last year. 
Obviously, the initial benefit we were seeing there got interrupted as the pandemic got underway. But you saw, we now have 3 quarters of very strong volumes starting in third quarter last year, fourth quarter and now again in the first quarter here, our best first quarter in total Fios for 6 years. And so what that means is you've got an Internet base of customers in Fios that's now more than 5% or higher than it was a year ago. And so that's driving the revenue growth even if you have the secular pressures coming on the video side. 
It's really volume created as much as step-ups or anything else, although there are obviously step-ups in there and opportunities to move customers to gigabit service and so on. But the strong volumes based off the quality of service, combined with bringing the Mix & Match there, it's worked very well for us in consumer mobility, now working well for us in Fios. And as you saw, we brought the Mix & Match construct into our SMB wireless offerings as well. So very excited about what that's going to do. 
On the Media revenue side, as you say, the 10.4% up double digits for the second consecutive quarter. You remember both fourth quarter and now first quarter aren't really lapping COVID-impacted quarters. So what you're seeing here is the benefit of the hard work the team has been doing over the past couple of years. And that's really showing up on the advertising trends as we talked about there, offsetting that, to your question, how do you get from those higher numbers down to the 10%? Things like search revenue continue to be a headwind and will likely continue to be so. But we're very encouraged by the advertising and the O&O momentum that we have. And as you say, now we -- that's not a 1-year thing. As we go forward, the team is getting some good momentum. Hans?"

In terms of your first question, it's -- there's a split between both CapEx and P&L items behind the $10 billion. It's roughly even between those 2 where you see that come from. 
So on the CapEx side, that means we've been able to do more deployments for the same amount of money than we would have done previously. That's allowed us to do some of the things across the network as we continue to transform the network, not just in deploying 5G but also the intelligent edge network transformation going on, the One Fiber, there's a backbone in there as well, that's going to give us benefits for years to come as a result of some of the efficiencies. 
And then on the P&L side, some of those have helped contribute to the bottom line. But some of them have also allowed us to reinvest in the business so that we can continue to be competitive in the marketplace, continue to bring new promotions and so on to our consumers. And you see the value of us doing that. 
And in terms of the pace going forward, just because we've hit the target, it doesn't mean we slow down. We will have continuous improvement going forward here. The team's got good momentum. And the great news is we didn't coast to the finish line here. We ran through the finish line. We accelerated through the tape. There's a lot more opportunities for us. Obviously, the last year has identified even more items for us. So as we go forward, we will continue to increase the efficiency of the business, both on the income statement and also from a capital side as well. So a lot more to come."

We have a good relationship with our MVNO partners. We see them as enterprise customers, but we also see that this is accretive to us because we have all this. I mean, nobody in the market has the same opportunity as we have to play all the way from our premium Verizon, which you heard Matt and me talk about how we migrate and we're doing it in a great job, Ronan and team. And then we also have the MVNO partners bringing in customers and revenue and the best return on investment. 
And ultimately, we start building new markets with Visible and later on this year, with TracFone. And then we have an unparalleled position to anyone else in the market to be growing.

So we're trying to -- we're doing that. And we see a great moment for that. And we have basically a plan for that given how we're going to generate growth and cash flow over the years.

Obviously, working capital was part of the benefit in there. 
And as we look at that, there's a couple of things going in different directions. As we saw the increase in equipment volumes, we saw the device payables, the receivables related to that increase. As you would expect, that was a benefit on cash flow last year. We said that would be a headwind this year, hope to be a headwind this year, absolutely saw that. 
Offsetting that a little bit was the volumes that we saw in March helped inventory levels. But also, we saw really good customer payments in the month of March, too, as those stimulus payments hit. So as I think about cash flow for the rest of the year, I would expect the device receivables to continue to be a little bit of a headwind as those return to a more normal level after the lower volumes last year. 
And then obviously, we don't have cash tax payments in the first quarter. Those come through the final 3 quarters of the year. And as we mentioned, we had a couple of faithful items in there last year. So still feel good, obviously, about where cash flow is going to play out. So no update on our year-end leverage target at this point, but really nice to have a strong first quarter in the bank.

And then as volumes pick up and you focus a bit more on volumes over the course of this year, there's a tailwind -- I'm sorry, there's a headwind from that. So if you could just talk about the puts and takes when it comes to margins over the course of the year in the Consumer business, that would be useful. 
And then secondly, when you think about the stimulus that was passed in December, it looks like some of that money can flow to wireless consumers, the subsidy. The $3 billion subsidy for broadband, I guess some of that could flow to wireless consumers as well. Are you guys starting to see some of that impact? How big of a tailwind do you expect that to be in the second quarter?"

So on the Consumer margins, I think we've historically produced very good margins across the business there, and I'd expect that to continue going forward. As you identified, there is always a number of puts and takes out there as we move forward. And certainly, Fios is performing very well and is contributing nicely to that. 
But as you also rightly pointed out, equipment volumes were up significantly year-over-year. And obviously, that increases the denominator and the margin calculation without really increasing the numerator. So you've got a number of different puts and takes. You'll have the ongoing impacts of building out the network in there as well. But we feel very good about the margins that we'll have for the rest of the year within Consumer, very much in line with what you would expect. 
And then certainly, the seasonality showing up in the fourth quarter with the seasonal volumes that you would expect to see over the course of the holiday period. So certainly, to continue to be on track to give the -- to meet the EPS guidance we have for the year, Consumer margins need to be a strong contributor to do that, and I expect them will be. 
In terms of stimulus benefits, as I think I mentioned in the comment about working capital, we're seeing very good payment patterns from consumers at this point. That's where I think we'll see the vast majority of any benefit show up. So those payments were very strong in the first quarter, and I suspect the stimulus bills had something to do with that. But it means that our consumers are in very good shape as compared to where they otherwise might have been given the impacts of the pandemic going into the second quarter, and we feel good about the outlook for the rest of the year ahead of us."

As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. A discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. 
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. 
Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the second quarter. In the second quarter, we reported earnings of $1.40 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported second quarter earnings include a net pretax gain from special items of $182 million, consisting of a pretax gain of approximately $1.3 billion related to a pension remeasurement credit as well as a pretax loss of $1.1 billion from early debt redemption costs. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.37 in the second quarter. 
In May, we announced an agreement to sell Verizon Media to Apollo Funds with an expected close date in the second half of 2021. Upon the announcement, certain assets of the Verizon Media business were classified as an asset held for sale. As a result, we no longer depreciate or amortize these assets, which resulted in a partial quarter benefit of $0.03 per share in the second quarter, and this benefit will continue until the deal closes. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the second quarter."

It is remarkable what the difference a year can make. We're quickly resuming prepandemic norms. And at Verizon, our network and in-store traffic is almost back to prepandemic volumes, and our office employees are gradually coming back to office. 
Of course, some behaviors are changed permanently. The mass shift toward online activity speed up the time line for work from home, distant learning, banking, entertainment, telemedicine, et cetera. All of these societal and behavior shifts have had an impact on the business. And they reaffirm our Network-as-a-Service strategy and our focus on delivering on our 5 vectors of growth. 
Finally, after a year of virtual meetings, I've been spending time in the field with customers and partners, and importantly, with our frontline workers, who have done such a heroic work throughout the past year serving our customers. All in all, we have a very enthusiastic and cautiously optimistic stakeholder base. 
As we conclude the first half of 2021, I have to say I'm extremely proud of the achievements we have made to strengthen Verizon in all aspects. Let me mention a couple of the milestones. 
We strengthened our strategic focus with our divestment of Verizon Media Group, which we believe will close around the end of the quarter. We invested in the best portion of the C-Band in order to accelerate and amplify our multipurpose network and service model. 
We have also improved our 2.0 organizational structure, and we brought in a diverse slate of top leaders. Our finance and treasury team did an outstanding job of strengthening our balance sheet with low cost of borrowing and maturity for our debt. We also laid out a long-term financial goal with focus on growth. 
All this focus on strategic execution and to deliver profitable growth by our teams have paved the way for a continued great financial performance. And in the second quarter, we not only generate our strongest earnings on record, we also produce good growth and profitability in all our unions and segments. We demonstrated continued strength in our wireless service revenue growth. And combined with our scale and operational efficiency, we produced 5.6% adjusted EBITDA growth. Given the strength of our first half results, we are raising our full year guide, and Matt will provide details later in the call. 
When it comes to our operations, our recent investments in our customers through the biggest 5G upgrade promotion and innovative trading, coupled with a Mix & Match for both wireless and Fios customers, have led to strong performance across both our offerings. On the network side, we just continue to offer our customers the industry's best network experience. 
For the 16th consecutive time, RootMetrics awarded Verizon the best overall network performance. And for the 27th consecutive time, J.D. Power named us the #1 network quality. Our C-Band build, we're on track to build 7,000 to 8,000 sites by year-end, and we're on plan to launch the first 46 markets. And we are also strengthening our network by expanding our fixed wireless access reach. 
If we look to the traffic in the network, the customer activity is near pre-COVID levels. And as mobility traffic comes back, we have seen millimeter wave usage increase 290% June year-to-date. And as we continue to deploy millimeter wave sites and we get more device penetration, we expect these numbers to continue to increase fast and track towards 5% to 10% of traffic in most dense urban areas by year-end. We are making progress in executing across all our 5 vectors of growth. 
On the 5G adoption, approximately 20% of our wireless phone base are now on 5G devices with a majority of them C-Band capable. In the second quarter, the step-up rates were very, very healthy, and this reflects value and differentiated experience for our customers. We also had a record high new accounts that opted for a premium unlimited plan. 
The next-generation business application. We launched the first commercial available private fiber network solution in the U.S. It's an on-site private 5G that brings on-premise 5G capabilities to large enterprises and public sector customers. The team in Verizon Business Group continued to make very important partnership. And one of them in the quarter was with Mastercard, where we will work together with Mastercard on 5G mobile edge compute, transforming the contactless payment for consumer as well as small and medium-sized businesses. 
The customer differentiation that we continue to develop further strengthened in the quarter when new content and experience to our Mix & Match platform with a broken device trading, the biggest upgrade ever promotion, and we also added through partnership content with Apple Arcade and Google Play Pass. 
Expansion into new markets. We have been focusing on continuing to have broadband nationwide. And we expanded our 5G Home services, which is now available across 47 markets. On the 4G Home, we expanded to more suburban and urban areas and is now available in parts of all 50 states. At the same time, we launched a new home router, which is compatible with the C-Band. Finally, we have recently expanded our 5G business Internet also to parts of 42 cities. 
In summary, our strategy is working and is more relevant than ever value for our investors and to our customers and society as they embrace new ways of living and working. We have great momentum on all 5 vectors of growth, delivering on profitable growth with alignment to our long-term growth targets. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Matt to discuss the financial results."

We continue to execute on our strategy, driving contributions from all 5 growth vectors. We attracted new customers and accounts and delivered low churn amid strong upgrade activity, all of which serves to accelerate 5G adoption in advance of our C-Band deployment later this year. 
Accelerating volumes contributed to another quarter of strong sequential wireless service revenue growth, building off our industry-leading performance in recent quarters. At the same time, our disciplined approach is driving profitability and strong earnings results. 
Let's go through the details beginning on Slide 6. In the second quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $33.8 billion, up 10.9% year-over-year. Service and other revenue rose 5.7% driven by strength in wireless, Fios and media. Equipment revenue rose 47.6% year-over-year, given COVID impacted sales a year ago and was up more than 17% from second quarter 2019 levels driven by healthy upgrade activity. 
Total wireless service revenues were up 5.9% year-over-year and 4.0% compared to second quarter 2019. The results represent sequential growth of $139 million, nearly double our industry-leading sequential growth reported in the first quarter. Total Fios revenues were up 5.4% year-over-year driven by continued broadband subscriber growth. 
Adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 billion grew 5.6% over the prior year, in line with our service and other revenue growth despite absorbing approximately $60 million of incremental tower lease costs related to the updated agreements to accelerate the deployment of our C-Band spectrum. As Brady and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $1.37, the best on record. The execution of our strategy is translating to record earnings results, and we are well positioned to continue the momentum into the second half of the year. 
Now let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 7. Momentum built throughout the quarter, and we timed our promotions to take full advantage of the economic recovery and increased customer activity. The result was one of our strongest net new wireless account quarters. 
With stores fully opened and consumer behavior closer to prepandemic levels, we delivered 1.7 million postpaid phone gross adds in the quarter, up from 1.2 million in second quarter 2020 and almost identical to 2019 levels. Phone churn of 0.65% remained favorable throughout the quarter and benefited from new offers in the marketplace. This result was a record low for a non-COVID-impacted quarter. As a result, phone net adds of 197,000 were our best second quarter for Consumer. 
The response to our differentiated customer proposition, including the broken device trade-in and the biggest upgrade ever promotion, was terrific. Device upgrades, which were significantly higher compared to both second quarter 2020 and 2019, drove 5G adoption and step-ups to premium unlimited plans, a strong indicator that our strategy is working. We exited the second quarter with approximately 20% of our phone base using 5G-capable devices with the vast majority supporting C-Band. 
In addition, step-up rates were historically high, and nearly 60% of new accounts opted for a premium unlimited plan, a record high. At quarter end, approximately 69% of our account base was on unlimited plans with nearly 27% of our account base on premium unlimited plans. 
The quality and reliability of our Fios service, combined with the simplicity of our Mix & Match offerings, continues to drive strong demand for broadband. Fios Internet net adds totaled 92,000 in the quarter, supported by strong customer retention. And our Fios Internet customer base is more than 7% higher than a year ago. Our trailing 12-month total Fios Internet net add performance is the highest since 2015. 
Now let's move to Slide 8 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. The improved customer activity translated to impressive top line trends. Total revenue for the quarter grew 11.2% year-over-year and was also 6.7% higher versus second quarter 2019. Equipment revenue was the biggest driver, rebounding above pre-COVID levels from higher activations, aided by our customer value proposition. 
Wireless service revenue momentum translated to 5.4% year-over-year growth and 2.5% growth compared to second quarter 2019. Service revenue was driven by customer growth, step-ups, products such as content as well as reseller and prepaid. This growth comes despite minimal contributions from international roaming, which we expect should provide a further uptick to growth in future quarters. 
Momentum in Fios continues with revenues of $2.9 billion, surpassing pre-COVID levels, driven by the continued uptake of gigabit speeds. The results represent our highest revenue results ever. We remain encouraged by the continued margin improvement within Fios driven by the adoption of Mix & Match plans and a greater contribution from broadband. Consumer segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 4.9% over 2020, representing an EBITDA margin of 44.3%, down from the prior year primarily resulting from higher activations. 
Now let's move to our Business segment on Slide 9. Business wireless activity was highlighted by postpaid gross adds of 1.2 million, up 6.3% over second quarter 2020 and up 2.1% over second quarter 2019. Segment postpaid phone churn was 1.07%, up 17 basis points year-over-year, reflecting elevated disconnects from COVID-related purchases in 2020, particularly within the education vertical or public sector. As schools plan for more in-person learning this fall, we expect disconnects to remain elevated in public sector in the third quarter. 
Despite the disconnect pressures, phone net adds were strong at 78,000, with improving trends in both SMB and enterprise, both of which posted their strongest phone net adds in over a year, offset in the disconnect in public sector. 
Let's now move to Slide 10 to review the Business financial performance. The Business segment delivered strong top line growth with total revenue up 3.7% year-over-year. Equipment revenue, which is up approximately 47%, was the primary driver of the increase. 
Wireless service revenue growth of 8.0% was driven by strong momentum in small and medium business and the first quarter of enterprise growth since the onset of the pandemic. Public sector continued to show strong growth over 2020, though it was pressured by COVID-related churn in education. The wireless strength was partially offset by declines in Business wireline, which returned to a more normal trajectory after elevated COVID-related demand. 
Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.1% in the quarter, down approximately 210 basis points year-over-year mostly driven by higher equipment volumes and wireline pressure. While pressures likely persist in the near term, the economic reopening, business transformation initiatives and 5G for enterprise provide opportunities to drive margin. 
Now let's move on to Slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Verizon Media Group continued its recent trends and delivered strong performance driven by high customer engagement with our brands and demand for our advertising platforms. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.1 billion, up approximately 50% from a year ago and up 13% from second quarter 2019. 
Let's now move to our cash flow results on Slide 12. Cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2021 totaled $20.4 billion compared with $23.6 billion from the prior year. The change was primarily driven by higher cash taxes and higher working capital requirements due to greater volumes. 
The cash tax impact was a result of a onetime benefit received in the second quarter of 2020 as well as a COVID-related postponements of payments in the year-ago period. These expected headwinds were offset by our strong operational results. 
Capital spending for the first half of 2021 totaled $8.7 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network. C-Band CapEx was more than $160 million in the first half, and we have placed orders for approximately $1.4 billion of related equipment year-to-date, giving us confidence that we will be within the previously provided $2 billion to $3 billion range for the year. 
The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first half of the year of $11.7 billion. During the quarter, we began to normalize our cash balance closer to the prepandemic levels given the macro environment, and we ended the period with $4.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet, a sequential change of $5.4 billion. 
We exited the quarter with unsecured debt of $141.6 billion, a sequential improvement of $6 billion as we continue to focus on optimizing our debt footprint. Our total borrowing costs in the second quarter were $1.4 billion, which was relatively flat to second quarter 2019 levels despite having approximately $40 billion in additional debt this year. Net unsecured debt at the end of the first half was $136.8 billion, and our net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.9x. 
Now let's review our annual guidance targets on Slide 13. Our strong first half performance and the momentum in our business gives us the confidence to raise guidance. Please note that the updated guidance reflects the planning assumption that the Verizon Media sale closes at the end of the third quarter. 
Starting with revenue. We are raising our wireless service revenue growth outlook to 3.5% to 4%, up from the prior 3% plus. The drivers of the revised outlook are broad-based and include positive trends we are seeing for customer acquisition, premium plan adoption, products and services such as cloud and content as well as prepaid and reseller growth. 
The anticipated timing of the Verizon Media sale means we would not recognize any revenue from that business in the fourth quarter. As a result, service and other revenue is no longer an apples-to-apples comparison with 2020, and we are withdrawing that growth guidance at this time. 
Turning to earnings. We now expect an adjusted EPS range of $5.25 to $5.35, up from the prior range of $5 to $5.15. The increase is driven by the improved wireless service revenue outlook, the aforementioned media D&A benefit and a reduction in the expected interest expense related to the C-Band investment. Our guidance for the effective tax rate and CapEx are unchanged. 
In summary, we're competing effectively and delivering strong volumes, growing accounts, driving healthy step-ups and positioning our base to capitalize long term as we grow 5G adoption. Our customer performance has led to quality financial results as demonstrated by the sequential wireless service revenue growth while also flowing to the bottom line with best on record adjusted EPS. We entered the second half with a lot of momentum, and I am confident we will continue to execute our strategy and deliver strong operational and financial results throughout the remainder of the year. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our priorities for the remainder of 2021."

We made transformative investment over the last 12 months through acquisitions, divestiture and customer innovation and creating a strong platform for growth in the second half of 2021 and beyond. 
Our priorities for the second half continue to build on our current network and customer initiatives to further amplify and activate 5G adoption, further cement our network leadership through industry-leading millimeter wave and C-Band assets. We expect to close our TracFone and VMG transaction later this year, increasing our focus on what we do best and bringing innovation and best-in-class customer experience to the value segment and overall, drive growth across our 5 vectors with disciplined and customer-focused execution. At the end, the great transform in the first half, we competed very well in the marketplace. And we're very confident and excited on our opportunities ahead.

But I think that on the service revenue, I think you have seen the last 4 quarters right now, I mean, how the team has done a fantastic job to differentiate our offerings all the way to see that our customers are doing step-ups. They are taking the unlimited premium. And that said, I mean, [ 60% ] of the new accounts in the quarter was taken unlimited premium, and the penetration of 5G is happening. 
So we just continue the team. With Ronan on the Consumer side, if we talk about that, they have this model we have added for several years, where we do the Mix & Match. We have a differentiation, and it's clearly resonating in the market. And at the same time, we see, of course, the economy coming back. The stores are getting almost back to prepandemic. 
So all in all, it's a good timing for us, and that's also why we feel good about our guidance and how the service revenue growth growing. And remember, we are always focused on profitable growth. That's what the team is doing. 
And Matt and I see opportunities. We support the team to do it. But as long as it's going to be a profitable growth. And that's what we are seeing right now with all the momentum in the market. The team is taking advantage of that, and that also translates back to the guidance. But all in all, I would say this is our strategy we've been having for a couple of 
[Audio Gap]
the prior couple of quarters. We saw that increase even further in the second quarter, we expect that trend to continue as we get into the second half of the year because of the operational momentum that Hans mentioned, more step-ups to higher-priced plans, et cetera, et cetera. 
In terms of the fees, obviously, the year-over-year component is rather unique this time as second quarter last year was the most heavily impacted by COVID. And more specifically, for us, of course, we had the Keep Americans Connected Pledge that was in place for all of the second quarter that, as you said, impacted some of the fees. 
As you think about the numbers this year, a good chunk of those are back in. We're more at a BAU level. 
A couple of items, though, that aren't in the numbers yet. Obviously, international travel is not back to anywhere close to prepandemic levels. I don't expect that to be there for the balance of this year. Expect -- hope there will be a tailwind as we get into next year, but the guide doesn't make any assumption about an acceleration of a return of those fees in the second half of '21. 
One other thing I'd draw attention to as well when you look at our numbers and you think about return of fees, one of the things has been very strong in the first half of the year is customer payment patterns, which is a great thing to see. And certainly, with all the stimulus payments out there, there's a lot of money in the system, and customers are actually paying more frequently. 
So even though we're back to normal in terms of things like late fees, we're actually charging significantly less than we were in second quarter of '19 because more of our customers are paying on time at this point, which is certainly a trend that we're very happy to see. So some of the fees are back, but not all of them are back when you think about it. And we're not assuming they'll be back in the -- for the balance of the year. 
The guide is based off of the strong operational momentum in the business, customers stepping up to those higher-priced plans. And we see that momentum continuing. 
Your second question about the EPS guidance. And obviously, glad to be able to raise the guidance. That's based off having a very healthy business that is performing exceptionally well. As you mentioned, some of the upside to the guidance comes from the media depreciation, amortization, probably about $0.06 to $0.08 depending on the timing of the close. But the majority of it is coming from cash items, whether that be the wireless service revenue guide we were just discussing but also related to improved expectation around cash interest expense lower than anticipated at the start of the year. 
So most of the guide is driven by cash-related items. And that's, of course, based off the strong momentum you see in the business, both operationally and financially."

So I think that our team, they have a very, very good model for continuing this. And I think I said in the first quarter, it will come more of this value proposition and differentiation. And yes, it came. We went into gaming. 
So I say it again. I have a lot of confidence in the team and Ronan's team to continue to come up with things that our customer loves and using our distribution, our network and the brand to continue to grow this. And then, and that is the whole strategy.

But what -- as Hans said, what we're focused on is if you also look in there, sequential service revenue growth continue to lead the industry in that because not all net adds are created equal. And that also coming with EBITDA dollars increasing. 
So the margin percentage will play out where it does based off the volumes. But we're focused on -- you're seeing that sequential revenue increase and also the EBITDA dollars flowing in the right direction. 
In terms of your question around the cost of service, predominantly in Consumer, don't think -- one of the items that we had in the second quarter was a step-up in the network rent and lease of about $60 million a quarter as a result of the new lease payments we put in place. As you know, under the accounting, you look at the total payments over the life of the lease and kind of flatline it irrespective of how the natural cash flow payments flow. 
So there was, obviously, a significant upgrade to our lease agreements. And that was a onetime step-up in the quarterly rate there that flowed through the books at, say, about 60 -- $60 million, close to $0.01 a share impact from that. That should be the same going forward now. So that's the biggest driver you're seeing on the cost of service."

And as I said before, we are very pleased with the -- with -- I think we have 6 or 7 of these offerings in the market right now, and all of them are very positive to us and to our customers. And we will continue to see if we can find more. And I think it's a unique model that we have created that nobody else has in the market. 
And I said, again, it goes back to Ronan and the team being very, very innovative and creative to see that we bring the best to our customer, not only the best network, but also the differentiation in offering. So I have to say I'm very pleased with that. And I said, we have more in the funnel."

And in terms of the impact of cost of sales, obviously, the content cost associated with the items that Hans mentioned do flow through there. And you should expect to see that number continue to be a contributor of that line. 
But when we look at the overall profitability of bringing that together, the overall customer proposition, it's EBITDA additive to the business and also brings a better experience

guided to sustaining north of 25%. And we saw that below that in the second quarter, also in the first quarter although there's that onetime impact. And it sounds like you're guiding for that to continue to be below 25%. 
I'm just curious what's changed so quickly that you're targeting below that target, at least it looks like for 2021? And then also as it relates to the biggest upgrade ever promotion, when we look across the space competitively, obviously, AT&T has been doing something similar since the fourth quarter. Even T-Mobile did something just yesterday. 
Do you really look at this as a promotion and implying at some point, there is an expiration and you pull that from the market? Or is this really just the new way of competing in today's competitive market and really something that investors should assume in some form or the other is going to be with us for a long period, if not permanently?"

On the Business side, I mean, in Q4 2018, Matt and I talked about that. We think that this is one of the great opportunities we have over time with the Business side. And remember, we have never consolidated our Business side. It was [indiscernible] in between all the different business we have. 
Tami and the team have during that moment -- and remember, we said we're going to invest in order to see that we have the platforms of products of CX and UX for our customers to be harmonized in order to be able to scale this to be a good business. And that they are doing, and they probably are halfway through it. They're doing a lot of transformation in the business. 
At the same time, there are some headwinds as we have seen before. I mean, that would be the wireline sort of cyclical or -- no, it's not cyclical. It's a sustained decline. And then we have a wireless business where we take more than our fair share. We are leading in all segments. And that balance, of course, is coming into this quarter. Of course, we had more hardware this quarter as well. 
And then we're building off -- for the new opportunities with 5G mobile edge compute, private 5G networks, the 5G business Internet, which is using fixed wireless access. So we have a lot of new products coming out as we're building, and we have the same ambitions when it comes to financials, then we will be realistic what's happening in the market and how the team -- but I'm proud of the team of what they are transforming to and what we're aspiring for and seeing the progress on mobile edge compute and business Internet. That's, of course, new opportunities that we have not seen coming into the P&L yet, but we're building it together with the transformation we're doing."

We mentioned it upfront that the wireless volumes that we saw the gross adds were not just higher than 2Q last year, also higher than 2Q '19. So certainly seeing volumes come back, especially in enterprise and small medium business. So that's having some impact there and then obviously, the wireline pressure. 
I would expect second half margins to be reasonably similar to what we saw in the first half of the year. The business transformation work the team is doing is having positive impacts with more to come as we go forward here. So feel good about the direction the team is headed there in spite of the secular wireline pressures that we see. 
And then in terms of your question on promotions, as Hans said, it's a promotion. That means it has both a start date and an end date, and today is the end date. So we've run promotions since the beginning of the wireless industry. They've evolved over time. They will continue to do so. 
And the great position we're in is because of the strong operational results and financials, it gives us the ability when the time is right in the marketplace to bring the right promotion out there. We 
[Audio Gap]
felt this was the right promotion at this time with the economic reopening and wanting to get more customers with a 5G device in their hand as we're about to launch C-Band within the next 6 months. So we will continue to look at what is the right promotion for the right time. But the underlying operational performance of the business showing up in sequential wireless service revenue increase yet again gives us the position to have flexibility as we think about how we approach the market."

Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call.

As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. A discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. 
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. 
Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the second quarter. In the second quarter, we reported earnings of $1.40 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported second quarter earnings include a net pretax gain from special items of $182 million, consisting of a pretax gain of approximately $1.3 billion related to a pension remeasurement credit as well as a pretax loss of $1.1 billion from early debt redemption costs. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.37 in the second quarter. 
In May, we announced an agreement to sell Verizon Media to Apollo Funds with an expected close date in the second half of 2021. Upon the announcement, certain assets of the Verizon Media business were classified as an asset held for sale. As a result, we no longer depreciate or amortize these assets, which resulted in a partial quarter benefit of $0.03 per share in the second quarter, and this benefit will continue until the deal closes. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the second quarter."

It is remarkable what the difference a year can make. We're quickly resuming prepandemic norms. And at Verizon, our network and in-store traffic is almost back to prepandemic volumes, and our office employees are gradually coming back to office. 
Of course, some behaviors are changed permanently. The mass shift toward online activity speed up the time line for work from home, distant learning, banking, entertainment, telemedicine, et cetera. All of these societal and behavior shifts have had an impact on the business. And they reaffirm our Network-as-a-Service strategy and our focus on delivering on our 5 vectors of growth. 
Finally, after a year of virtual meetings, I've been spending time in the field with customers and partners, and importantly, with our frontline workers, who have done such a heroic work throughout the past year serving our customers. All in all, we have a very enthusiastic and cautiously optimistic stakeholder base. 
As we conclude the first half of 2021, I have to say I'm extremely proud of the achievements we have made to strengthen Verizon in all aspects. Let me mention a couple of the milestones. 
We strengthened our strategic focus with our divestment of Verizon Media Group, which we believe will close around the end of the quarter. We invested in the best portion of the C-Band in order to accelerate and amplify our multipurpose network and service model. 
We have also improved our 2.0 organizational structure, and we brought in a diverse slate of top leaders. Our finance and treasury team did an outstanding job of strengthening our balance sheet with low cost of borrowing and maturity for our debt. We also laid out a long-term financial goal with focus on growth. 
All this focus on strategic execution and to deliver profitable growth by our teams have paved the way for a continued great financial performance. And in the second quarter, we not only generate our strongest earnings on record, we also produce good growth and profitability in all our unions and segments. We demonstrated continued strength in our wireless service revenue growth. And combined with our scale and operational efficiency, we produced 5.6% adjusted EBITDA growth. Given the strength of our first half results, we are raising our full year guide, and Matt will provide details later in the call. 
When it comes to our operations, our recent investments in our customers through the biggest 5G upgrade promotion and innovative trading, coupled with a Mix & Match for both wireless and Fios customers, have led to strong performance across both our offerings. On the network side, we just continue to offer our customers the industry's best network experience. 
For the 16th consecutive time, RootMetrics awarded Verizon the best overall network performance. And for the 27th consecutive time, J.D. Power named us the #1 network quality. Our C-Band build, we're on track to build 7,000 to 8,000 sites by year-end, and we're on plan to launch the first 46 markets. And we are also strengthening our network by expanding our fixed wireless access reach. 
If we look to the traffic in the network, the customer activity is near pre-COVID levels. And as mobility traffic comes back, we have seen millimeter wave usage increase 290% June year-to-date. And as we continue to deploy millimeter wave sites and we get more device penetration, we expect these numbers to continue to increase fast and track towards 5% to 10% of traffic in most dense urban areas by year-end. We are making progress in executing across all our 5 vectors of growth. 
On the 5G adoption, approximately 20% of our wireless phone base are now on 5G devices with a majority of them C-Band capable. In the second quarter, the step-up rates were very, very healthy, and this reflects value and differentiated experience for our customers. We also had a record high new accounts that opted for a premium unlimited plan. 
The next-generation business application. We launched the first commercial available private fiber network solution in the U.S. It's an on-site private 5G that brings on-premise 5G capabilities to large enterprises and public sector customers. The team in Verizon Business Group continued to make very important partnership. And one of them in the quarter was with Mastercard, where we will work together with Mastercard on 5G mobile edge compute, transforming the contactless payment for consumer as well as small and medium-sized businesses. 
The customer differentiation that we continue to develop further strengthened in the quarter when new content and experience to our Mix & Match platform with a broken device trading, the biggest upgrade ever promotion, and we also added through partnership content with Apple Arcade and Google Play Pass. 
Expansion into new markets. We have been focusing on continuing to have broadband nationwide. And we expanded our 5G Home services, which is now available across 47 markets. On the 4G Home, we expanded to more suburban and urban areas and is now available in parts of all 50 states. At the same time, we launched a new home router, which is compatible with the C-Band. Finally, we have recently expanded our 5G business Internet also to parts of 42 cities. 
In summary, our strategy is working and is more relevant than ever value for our investors and to our customers and society as they embrace new ways of living and working. We have great momentum on all 5 vectors of growth, delivering on profitable growth with alignment to our long-term growth targets. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Matt to discuss the financial results."

We continue to execute on our strategy, driving contributions from all 5 growth vectors. We attracted new customers and accounts and delivered low churn amid strong upgrade activity, all of which serves to accelerate 5G adoption in advance of our C-Band deployment later this year. 
Accelerating volumes contributed to another quarter of strong sequential wireless service revenue growth, building off our industry-leading performance in recent quarters. At the same time, our disciplined approach is driving profitability and strong earnings results. 
Let's go through the details beginning on Slide 6. In the second quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $33.8 billion, up 10.9% year-over-year. Service and other revenue rose 5.7% driven by strength in wireless, Fios and media. Equipment revenue rose 47.6% year-over-year, given COVID impacted sales a year ago and was up more than 17% from second quarter 2019 levels driven by healthy upgrade activity. 
Total wireless service revenues were up 5.9% year-over-year and 4.0% compared to second quarter 2019. The results represent sequential growth of $139 million, nearly double our industry-leading sequential growth reported in the first quarter. Total Fios revenues were up 5.4% year-over-year driven by continued broadband subscriber growth. 
Adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 billion grew 5.6% over the prior year, in line with our service and other revenue growth despite absorbing approximately $60 million of incremental tower lease costs related to the updated agreements to accelerate the deployment of our C-Band spectrum. As Brady and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $1.37, the best on record. The execution of our strategy is translating to record earnings results, and we are well positioned to continue the momentum into the second half of the year. 
Now let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 7. Momentum built throughout the quarter, and we timed our promotions to take full advantage of the economic recovery and increased customer activity. The result was one of our strongest net new wireless account quarters. 
With stores fully opened and consumer behavior closer to prepandemic levels, we delivered 1.7 million postpaid phone gross adds in the quarter, up from 1.2 million in second quarter 2020 and almost identical to 2019 levels. Phone churn of 0.65% remained favorable throughout the quarter and benefited from new offers in the marketplace. This result was a record low for a non-COVID-impacted quarter. As a result, phone net adds of 197,000 were our best second quarter for Consumer. 
The response to our differentiated customer proposition, including the broken device trade-in and the biggest upgrade ever promotion, was terrific. Device upgrades, which were significantly higher compared to both second quarter 2020 and 2019, drove 5G adoption and step-ups to premium unlimited plans, a strong indicator that our strategy is working. We exited the second quarter with approximately 20% of our phone base using 5G-capable devices with the vast majority supporting C-Band. 
In addition, step-up rates were historically high, and nearly 60% of new accounts opted for a premium unlimited plan, a record high. At quarter end, approximately 69% of our account base was on unlimited plans with nearly 27% of our account base on premium unlimited plans. 
The quality and reliability of our Fios service, combined with the simplicity of our Mix & Match offerings, continues to drive strong demand for broadband. Fios Internet net adds totaled 92,000 in the quarter, supported by strong customer retention. And our Fios Internet customer base is more than 7% higher than a year ago. Our trailing 12-month total Fios Internet net add performance is the highest since 2015. 
Now let's move to Slide 8 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. The improved customer activity translated to impressive top line trends. Total revenue for the quarter grew 11.2% year-over-year and was also 6.7% higher versus second quarter 2019. Equipment revenue was the biggest driver, rebounding above pre-COVID levels from higher activations, aided by our customer value proposition. 
Wireless service revenue momentum translated to 5.4% year-over-year growth and 2.5% growth compared to second quarter 2019. Service revenue was driven by customer growth, step-ups, products such as content as well as reseller and prepaid. This growth comes despite minimal contributions from international roaming, which we expect should provide a further uptick to growth in future quarters. 
Momentum in Fios continues with revenues of $2.9 billion, surpassing pre-COVID levels, driven by the continued uptake of gigabit speeds. The results represent our highest revenue results ever. We remain encouraged by the continued margin improvement within Fios driven by the adoption of Mix & Match plans and a greater contribution from broadband. Consumer segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 4.9% over 2020, representing an EBITDA margin of 44.3%, down from the prior year primarily resulting from higher activations. 
Now let's move to our Business segment on Slide 9. Business wireless activity was highlighted by postpaid gross adds of 1.2 million, up 6.3% over second quarter 2020 and up 2.1% over second quarter 2019. Segment postpaid phone churn was 1.07%, up 17 basis points year-over-year, reflecting elevated disconnects from COVID-related purchases in 2020, particularly within the education vertical or public sector. As schools plan for more in-person learning this fall, we expect disconnects to remain elevated in public sector in the third quarter. 
Despite the disconnect pressures, phone net adds were strong at 78,000, with improving trends in both SMB and enterprise, both of which posted their strongest phone net adds in over a year, offset in the disconnect in public sector. 
Let's now move to Slide 10 to review the Business financial performance. The Business segment delivered strong top line growth with total revenue up 3.7% year-over-year. Equipment revenue, which is up approximately 47%, was the primary driver of the increase. 
Wireless service revenue growth of 8.0% was driven by strong momentum in small and medium business and the first quarter of enterprise growth since the onset of the pandemic. Public sector continued to show strong growth over 2020, though it was pressured by COVID-related churn in education. The wireless strength was partially offset by declines in Business wireline, which returned to a more normal trajectory after elevated COVID-related demand. 
Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.1% in the quarter, down approximately 210 basis points year-over-year mostly driven by higher equipment volumes and wireline pressure. While pressures likely persist in the near term, the economic reopening, business transformation initiatives and 5G for enterprise provide opportunities to drive margin. 
Now let's move on to Slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Verizon Media Group continued its recent trends and delivered strong performance driven by high customer engagement with our brands and demand for our advertising platforms. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.1 billion, up approximately 50% from a year ago and up 13% from second quarter 2019. 
Let's now move to our cash flow results on Slide 12. Cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2021 totaled $20.4 billion compared with $23.6 billion from the prior year. The change was primarily driven by higher cash taxes and higher working capital requirements due to greater volumes. 
The cash tax impact was a result of a onetime benefit received in the second quarter of 2020 as well as a COVID-related postponements of payments in the year-ago period. These expected headwinds were offset by our strong operational results. 
Capital spending for the first half of 2021 totaled $8.7 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network. C-Band CapEx was more than $160 million in the first half, and we have placed orders for approximately $1.4 billion of related equipment year-to-date, giving us confidence that we will be within the previously provided $2 billion to $3 billion range for the year. 
The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first half of the year of $11.7 billion. During the quarter, we began to normalize our cash balance closer to the prepandemic levels given the macro environment, and we ended the period with $4.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet, a sequential change of $5.4 billion. 
We exited the quarter with unsecured debt of $141.6 billion, a sequential improvement of $6 billion as we continue to focus on optimizing our debt footprint. Our total borrowing costs in the second quarter were $1.4 billion, which was relatively flat to second quarter 2019 levels despite having approximately $40 billion in additional debt this year. Net unsecured debt at the end of the first half was $136.8 billion, and our net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.9x. 
Now let's review our annual guidance targets on Slide 13. Our strong first half performance and the momentum in our business gives us the confidence to raise guidance. Please note that the updated guidance reflects the planning assumption that the Verizon Media sale closes at the end of the third quarter. 
Starting with revenue. We are raising our wireless service revenue growth outlook to 3.5% to 4%, up from the prior 3% plus. The drivers of the revised outlook are broad-based and include positive trends we are seeing for customer acquisition, premium plan adoption, products and services such as cloud and content as well as prepaid and reseller growth. 
The anticipated timing of the Verizon Media sale means we would not recognize any revenue from that business in the fourth quarter. As a result, service and other revenue is no longer an apples-to-apples comparison with 2020, and we are withdrawing that growth guidance at this time. 
Turning to earnings. We now expect an adjusted EPS range of $5.25 to $5.35, up from the prior range of $5 to $5.15. The increase is driven by the improved wireless service revenue outlook, the aforementioned media D&A benefit and a reduction in the expected interest expense related to the C-Band investment. Our guidance for the effective tax rate and CapEx are unchanged. 
In summary, we're competing effectively and delivering strong volumes, growing accounts, driving healthy step-ups and positioning our base to capitalize long term as we grow 5G adoption. Our customer performance has led to quality financial results as demonstrated by the sequential wireless service revenue growth while also flowing to the bottom line with best on record adjusted EPS. We entered the second half with a lot of momentum, and I am confident we will continue to execute our strategy and deliver strong operational and financial results throughout the remainder of the year. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our priorities for the remainder of 2021."

At the high end, that's actually a pretty significant improvement. I know you outlined a number of things that were behind it. I was hoping you can maybe just dig into that a bit more. I'm particularly interested in what you're doing to outperform as it relates to plan mix. And then are you seeing a return of any of the fees that had come out of the run rate last year? Is that something you've seen already? Or is that embedded in the outlook? 
And then just on the improved EPS guidance, if we just sort of look at the $0.03 benefit you got from moving away from the D&A in Media in the recent quarter, that would imply that the improvement to your outlook this year maybe capture $0.07, $0.08 just from that accounting shift with the rest of it being operational. But if it's more nuanced than that, I think we all appreciate that insight."

But I think that on the service revenue, I think you have seen the last 4 quarters right now, I mean, how the team has done a fantastic job to differentiate our offerings all the way to see that our customers are doing step-ups. They are taking the unlimited premium. And that said, I mean, [ 60% ] of the new accounts in the quarter was taken unlimited premium, and the penetration of 5G is happening. 
So we just continue the team. With Ronan on the Consumer side, if we talk about that, they have this model we have added for several years, where we do the Mix & Match. We have a differentiation, and it's clearly resonating in the market. And at the same time, we see, of course, the economy coming back. The stores are getting almost back to prepandemic. 
So all in all, it's a good timing for us, and that's also why we feel good about our guidance and how the service revenue growth growing. And remember, we are always focused on profitable growth. That's what the team is doing. 
And Matt and I see opportunities. We support the team to do it. But as long as it's going to be a profitable growth. And that's what we are seeing right now with all the momentum in the market. The team is taking advantage of that, and that also translates back to the guidance. But all in all, I would say this is our strategy we've been having for a couple of years and has been very successful. Matt?"

Thanks, Hans, and thanks for the question, Brett. So starting with the question about wireless service revenue growth. And as Hans mentioned, it's really building on the momentum that we've seen in the first half of the year, the continue -- continua",563,"Yes. Thanks, Hans, and thanks for the question, Brett. So starting with the question about wireless service revenue growth. And as Hans mentioned, it's really building on the momentum that we've seen in the first half of the year, the continue -- continuation of the sequential service revenue growth. We saw that the prior couple of quarters. We saw that increase even further in the second quarter. We expect that trend to continue as we get into the second half of the year because of the operational momentum that Hans mentioned, more step-ups to higher-priced plans, et cetera, et cetera. 
In terms of the fees, obviously, the year-over-year component is rather unique this time as second quarter last year was the most heavily impacted by COVID. And more specifically, for us, of course, we had the Keep Americans Connected Pledge that was in place for all of the second quarter that, as you said, impacted some of the fees. 
As you think about the numbers this year, a good chunk of those are back in. We're more at a BAU level. 
A couple of items, though, that aren't in the numbers yet. Obviously, international travel is not back to anywhere close to prepandemic levels. I don't expect that to be there for the balance of this year. Expect -- hope there will be a tailwind as we get into next year, but the guide doesn't make any assumption about an acceleration of a return of those fees in the second half of '21. 
One other thing I'd draw attention to as well when you look at our numbers and you think about return of fees, one of the things has been very strong in the first half of the year is customer payment patterns, which is a great thing to see. And certainly, with all the stimulus payments out there, there's a lot of money in the system, and customers are actually paying more frequently. 
So even though we're back to normal in terms of things like late fees, we're actually charging significantly less than we were in second quarter of '19 because more of our customers are paying on time at this point, which is certainly a trend that we're very happy to see. So some of the fees are back, but not all of them are back when you think about it. And we're not assuming they'll be back in the -- for the balance of the year. 
The guide is based off of the strong operational momentum in the business, customers stepping up to those higher-priced plans. And we see that momentum continuing. 
Your second question about the EPS guidance. And obviously, glad to be able to raise the guidance. That's based off having a very healthy business that is performing exceptionally well. As you mentioned, some of the upside to the guidance comes from the media depreciation, amortization, probably about $0.06 to $0.08 depending on the timing of the close. But the majority of it is coming from cash items, whether that be the wireless service revenue guide we were just discussing but also related to improved expectation around cash interest expense lower than anticipated at the start of the year. 
So most of the guide is driven by cash-related items. And that's, of course, based off the strong momentum you see in the business, both operationally and financially."

So I think that our team, they have a very, very good model for continuing this. And I think I said in the first quarter, it will come more of this value proposition and differentiation. And yes, it came. We went into gaming. 
So I say it again. I have a lot of confidence in the team and Ronan's team to continue to come up with things that our customer loves and using our distribution, our network and the brand to continue to grow this. And then, and that is the whole strategy.

And that also coming with EBITDA dollars increasing. 
So the margin percentage will play out where it does based off the volumes. But we're focused on -- you're seeing that sequential revenue increase and also the EBITDA dollars flowing in the right direction. 
In terms of your question around the cost of service, predominantly in Consumer, don't think -- one of the items that we had in the second quarter was a step-up in the network rent and lease of about $60 million a quarter as a result of the new lease payments we put in place. As you know, under the accounting, you look at the total payments over the life of the lease and kind of flatline it irrespective of how the natural cash flow payments flow. 
So there was, obviously, a significant upgrade to our lease agreements. And that was a onetime step-up in the quarterly rate there that flowed through the books at, say, about 60 -- $60 million, close to $0.01 a share impact from that. That should be the same going forward now. So that's the biggest driver you're seeing on the cost of service."

You heard Hans mention upfront that we're on track to seeing 5% to 10% of dense urban usage on millimeter wave by the end of the year. That's a combination of more customers having 5G devices in their hands, customer activity moving back to more prepandemic levels and then obviously, building out more millimeter wave sites. 
We said we would do 14,000 sites this year, be it over 30,000 by the end of the year. I can tell you we are running well ahead of schedule for the 14,000 sites through the first half of the year. And so as we do that, we continue to add coverage. And then we said we'd expect to cover 1 million to 2 million homes with millimeter wave open for sale by the end of the year, and we're on track with all of those items."

Then you need to add, too, that you're not only talking about spectrum, you're talking about how you engineer and how you build the network. So in our case, of course, we see great opportunities for being able to handle much more data. 
And remember, I mean, today, on the millimeter wave, we might use 400, sometimes 800 megahertz, but not more. And we have 1,600 megahertz nationwide. So there's so much more we can do. And as Kyle showed at the Investor Day, our headroom in the network is bigger than before, and that's before we start building what we're building right now. 
So we feel really confident how much -- how many X we are doing. And remember, I mean, our 4G is already the best in the nation. And then we're adding up right now what we're doing in 5G, that is also extraordinary good. So others can talk and we usually execute, and we will continue with that."

And the model, as we have spoken about before, is that this is incremental revenue for us. It's not only loyalty. It's actually incremental profit for us. So it's a totally different model that might sometimes not been in the market before because suddenly, we use the best network, the best distribution and the best brand to work with companies like Disney+, et cetera, to give our customers a premium experience on top of the differentiation we already have with the Mix & Match. 
And ultimately, when we make this customer to paying customers, we get our fair share of that because we, with our assets, have created it together with the asset for [indiscernible] or gaming, et cetera. So that's how the model is working. And as I said before, we are very pleased with the -- with -- I think we have 6 or 7 of these offerings in the market right now, and all of them are very positive to us and to our customers. And we will continue to see if we can find more. And I think it's a unique model that we have created that nobody else has in the market. 
And I said, again, it goes back to Ronan and the team being very, very innovative and creative to see that we bring the best to our customer, not only the best network, but also the differentiation in offering. So I have to say I'm very pleased with that. And I said, we have more in the funnel."

And in terms of the impact of cost of sales, obviously, the content cost associated with the items that Hans mentioned do flow through there. And you should expect to see that number continue to be a contributor of that line.

At the same time, there are some headwinds as we have seen before. I mean, that would be the wireline sort of cyclical or -- no, it's not cyclical. It's a sustained decline. And then we have a wireless business where we take more than our fair share. We are leading in all segments. And that balance, of course, is coming into this quarter.

I would expect second half margins to be reasonably similar to what we saw in the first half of the year. The business transformation work the team is doing is having positive impacts with more to come as we go forward here. So feel good about the direction the team is headed there in spite of the secular wireline pressures that we see. 
And then in terms of your question on promotions, as Hans said, it's a promotion. That means it has both a start date and an end date, and today is the end date. So we've run promotions since the beginning of the wireless industry. They've evolved over time. They will continue to do so. 
And the great position we're in is because of the strong operational results and financials, it gives us the ability when the time is right in the marketplace to bring the right promotion out there. We felt this was the right promotion at this time with the economic reopening and wanting to get more customers with a 5G device in their hand as we're about to launch C-Band within the next 6 months, so we will continue to look at what is the right promotion for the right time. But the underlying operational performance of the business showing up in sequential wireless service revenue increase yet again gives us the position to have flexibility as we think about how we approach the market."

Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the second quarter. In the second quarter, we reported earnings of $1.40 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported second quarter earnings include a net pretax gain from special items of $182 million, consisting of a pretax gain of approximately $1.3 billion related to a pension remeasurement credit as well as a pretax loss of $1.1 billion from early debt redemption costs. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.37 in the second quarter.

As a result, we no longer depreciate or amortize these assets, which resulted in a partial quarter benefit of $0.03 per share in the second quarter, and this benefit will continue until the deal closes.  
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the second quarter."

It is remarkable, the difference a year can make. We're quickly resuming prepandemic norms. And at Verizon, our network and in-store traffic is almost back to prepandemic volumes, and our office employees are gradually coming back to office.  
Of course, some behaviors are changed permanently. The mass shift toward online activity speed up the time line for work from home, distant learning, banking, entertainment, telemedicine, et cetera. All of these societal and behavior shifts have had an impact on the business. And they reaffirm our Network-as-a-Service strategy and our focus on delivering on our 5 vectors of growth.  
Finally, after a year of virtual meetings, I've been spending time in the field with customers and partners, and importantly, with our frontline workers, who have done such heroic work throughout the past year serving our customers. All in all, we have a very enthusiastic and cautiously optimistic stakeholder base.  
As we conclude the first half of 2021, I have to say I'm extremely proud of the achievements we have made to strengthen Verizon in all aspects. Let me mention a couple of the milestones.  
We strengthened our strategic focus with our divestment of Verizon Media Group, which we believe will close around the end of the quarter. We invested in the best portion of the C-Band in order to accelerate and amplify our multipurpose network and service model.  
We have also improved our 2.0 organizational structure, and we brought in a diverse slate of top leaders. Our finance and treasury team did an outstanding job of strengthening our balance sheet with low cost of borrowing and maturity for our debt. We also laid out a long-term financial goal with focus on growth.  
All this focus on strategic execution and to deliver profitable growth by our teams have paved the way for a continued great financial performance. And in the second quarter, we not only generate our strongest earnings on record, we also produce good growth and profitability in all our units and segments. We demonstrated continued strength in our wireless service revenue growth. And combined with our scale and operational efficiency, we produced 5.6% adjusted EBITDA growth. Given the strength of our first half results, we are raising our full year guide, and Matt will provide details later in the call.  
When it comes to our operations, our recent investments in our customers through the biggest 5G upgrade promotion and innovative trading, coupled with a Mix & Match for both wireless and Fios customers, have led to strong performance across both our offerings. 
On the network side, we just continue to offer our customers the industry's best network experience. For the 16th consecutive time, RootMetrics awarded Verizon the best overall network performance. And for the 27th consecutive time, J.D. Power named us the #1 network quality. Our C-Band build, we're on track to build 7,000 to 8,000 sites by year-end, and we're on plan to launch the first 46 markets. And we are also strengthening our network by expanding our fixed wireless access reach.  
If we look to the traffic in the network, the customer activity is near pre-COVID levels. And as mobility traffic comes back, we have seen millimeter wave usage increase 290% June year-to-date. And as we continue to deploy millimeter wave sites and we get more device penetration, we expect these numbers to continue to increase fast and track towards 5% to 10% of traffic in most dense urban areas by year-end. We are making progress in executing across all our 5 vectors of growth.  
On the 5G adoption, approximately 20% of our wireless phone base are now on 5G devices with a majority of them C-Band-capable. In the second quarter, the step-up rates were very, very healthy, and this reflects value and differentiated experience for our customers. We also had a record high new accounts that opted for a premium unlimited plan.  
The next-generation business application, we launched the first commercial available private fiber network solution in the U.S. It's an on-site private 5G that brings on-premise 5G capabilities to large enterprises and public sector customers. The team in Verizon Business Group continued to make very important partnership. And one of them in the quarter was with Mastercard, where we will work together with Mastercard on 5G mobile edge compute, transforming the contactless payment for consumer as well as small and medium-sized businesses.  
The customer differentiation that we continue to develop further strengthened in the quarter when new content and experience to our Mix & Match platform with a broken device trading, the biggest upgrade ever promotion, and we also added through partnership, content with Apple Arcade and Google Play Pass.  
Expansion into new markets. We have been focusing and continue to have broadband nationwide. And we expanded our 5G Home services, which is now available across 47 markets. On the 4G Home, we expanded to more suburban and urban areas and is now available in parts of all 50 states. At the same time, we launched a new home router, which is compatible with the C-Band. Finally, we have recently expanded our 5G business Internet also to parts of 42 cities.  
In summary, our strategy is working and is more relevant than ever, driving value for our investors and to our customers and society as they embrace new ways of living and working. We have great momentum on all 5 vectors of growth, delivering on profitable growth with alignment to our long-term growth targets.  
With that, I'll now turn it over to Matt to discuss the financial results."

Second quarter results were exceptional, both financially and operationally. We continue to execute on our strategy, driving contributions from all 5 growth vectors.

We continue to execute on our strategy, driving contributions from all 5 growth vectors. We attracted new customers and accounts and delivered low churn amid strong upgrade activity, all of which serves to accelerate 5G adoption in advance of our C-Band deployment later this year.  
Accelerating volumes contributed to another quarter of strong sequential wireless service revenue growth, building off our industry-leading performance in recent quarters. At the same time, our disciplined approach is driving profitability and strong earnings results.  
Let's go through the details beginning on Slide 6. In the second quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $33.8 billion, up 10.9% year-over-year. Service and other revenue rose 5.7% driven by strength in Wireless, Fios and Media. Equipment revenue rose 47.6% year-over-year, given COVID impacted sales a year ago and was up more than 17% from second quarter 2019 levels driven by healthy upgrade activity.  
Total wireless service revenues were up 5.9% year-over-year and 4.0% compared to second quarter 2019. The results represent sequential growth of $139 million, nearly double our industry-leading sequential growth reported in the first quarter. Total Fios revenues were up 5.4% year-over-year driven by continued broadband subscriber growth.  
Adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 billion grew 5.6% over the prior year, in line with our service and other revenue growth despite absorbing approximately $60 million of incremental tower lease costs related to the updated agreements to accelerate the deployment of our C-Band spectrum. As Brady and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $1.37, the best on record. The execution of our strategy is translating to record earnings results, and we are well positioned to continue the momentum into the second half of the year.  
Now let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 7. Momentum built throughout the quarter, and we timed our promotions to take full advantage of the economic recovery and increased customer activity. The result was one of our strongest net new wireless account quarters.  
With stores fully opened and consumer behavior closer to prepandemic levels, we delivered 1.7 million postpaid phone gross adds in the quarter, up from 1.2 million in second quarter 2020 and almost identical to 2019 levels. Phone churn of 0.65% remained favorable throughout the quarter and benefited from new offers in the marketplace. This result was a record low for a non-COVID-impacted quarter. As a result, phone net adds of 197,000 were our best second quarter for Consumer.  
The response to our differentiated customer proposition, including the broken device trade-in and the biggest upgrade ever promotion, was terrific. Device upgrades, which were significantly higher compared to both second quarter 2020 and 2019, drove 5G adoption and step-ups to premium unlimited plans, a strong indicator that our strategy is working. We exited the second quarter with approximately 20% of our phone base using 5G-capable devices with the vast majority supporting C-Band.  
In addition, step-up rates were historically high, and nearly 60% of new accounts opted for a premium unlimited plan, a record high. At quarter end, approximately 69% of our account base was on unlimited plans with nearly 27% of our account base on premium unlimited plans.  
The quality and reliability of our Fios service, combined with the simplicity of our Mix & Match offerings, continues to drive strong demand for broadband. Fios Internet net adds totaled 92,000 in the quarter, supported by strong customer retention. And our Fios Internet customer base is more than 7% higher than a year ago. Our trailing 12-month total Fios Internet net add performance is the highest since 2015. 
Now let's move to Slide 8 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. The improved customer activity translated to impressive top line trends. Total revenue for the quarter grew 11.2% year-over-year and was also 6.7% higher versus second quarter 2019. Equipment revenue was the biggest driver, rebounding above pre-COVID levels from higher activations, aided by our customer value proposition. 
Wireless service revenue momentum translated to 5.4% year-over-year growth and 2.5% growth compared to second quarter 2019. Service revenue was driven by customer growth, step-ups, products such as content as well as reseller and prepaid. This growth comes despite minimal contributions from international roaming, which we expect should provide a further uptick to growth in future quarters. 
Momentum in Fios continues with revenues of $2.9 billion, surpassing pre-COVID levels, driven by the continued uptake of gigabit speeds. The results represent our highest revenue results ever. We remain encouraged by the continued margin improvement within Fios driven by the adoption of Mix & Match plans and a greater contribution from broadband. Consumer segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 4.9% over 2020, representing an EBITDA margin of 44.3%, down from the prior year primarily resulting from higher activations. 
Now let's move to our Business segment on Slide 9. Business wireless activity was highlighted by postpaid gross adds of 1.2 million, up 6.3% over second quarter 2020 and up 2.1% over second quarter 2019. Segment postpaid phone churn was 1.07%, up 17 basis points year-over-year, reflecting elevated disconnects from COVID-related purchases in 2020, particularly within the education vertical or public sector. As schools plan for more in-person learning this fall, we expect disconnects to remain elevated in public sector in the third quarter. 
Despite the disconnect pressures, phone net adds were strong at 78,000, with improving trends in both SMB and enterprise, both of which posted their strongest phone net adds in over a year, offset in the disconnects in public sector. 
Let's now move to Slide 10 to review the Business financial performance. The Business segment delivered strong top line growth with total revenue up 3.7% year-over-year. Equipment revenue, which is up approximately 47%, was the primary driver of the increase. 
Wireless service revenue growth of 8.0% was driven by strong momentum in small and medium business and the first quarter of enterprise growth since the onset of the pandemic. Public sector continued to show strong growth over 2020, though it was pressured by COVID-related churn in education. The wireless strength was partially offset by declines in Business wireline, which returned to a more normal trajectory after elevated COVID-related demand. 
Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.1% in the quarter, down approximately 210 basis points year-over-year, mostly driven by higher equipment volumes and wireline pressure. While pressures likely persist in the near term, the economic reopening, business transformation initiatives and 5G for enterprise provide opportunities to drive margin. 
Now let's move on to Slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Verizon Media Group continued its recent trends and delivered strong performance driven by high customer engagement with our brands and demand for our advertising platforms. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.1 billion, up approximately 50% from a year ago and up 13% from second quarter 2019. 
Let's now move to our cash flow results on Slide 12. Cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2021 totaled $20.4 billion compared with $23.6 billion from the prior year. The change was primarily driven by higher cash taxes and higher working capital requirements due to greater volumes. 
The cash tax impact was a result of a onetime benefit received in the second quarter of 2020 as well as the COVID-related postponements of payments in the year-ago period. These expected headwinds were offset by our strong operational results. 
Capital spending for the first half of 2021 totaled $8.7 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network. C-Band CapEx was more than $160 million in the first half, and we have placed orders for approximately $1.4 billion of related equipment year-to-date, giving us confidence that we will be within the previously provided $2 billion to $3 billion range for the year. 
The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first half of the year of $11.7 billion. During the quarter, we began to normalize our cash balance closer to the prepandemic levels given the macro environment, and we ended the period with $4.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet, a sequential change of $5.4 billion. 
We exited the quarter with unsecured debt of $141.6 billion, a sequential improvement of $6 billion as we continue to focus on optimizing our debt footprint. Our total borrowing costs in the second quarter were $1.4 billion, which was relatively flat to second quarter 2019 levels despite having approximately $40 billion in additional debt this year. Net unsecured debt at the end of the first half was $136.8 billion, and our net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.9x. 
Now let's review our annual guidance targets on Slide 13. Our strong first half performance and the momentum in our business gives us the confidence to raise guidance. Please note that the updated guidance reflects the planning assumption that the Verizon Media sale closes at the end of the third quarter. 
Starting with revenue. We are raising our wireless service revenue growth outlook to 3.5% to 4%, up from the prior 3% plus. The drivers of the revised outlook are broad-based and include positive trends we are seeing for customer acquisition, premium plan adoption, products and services such as cloud and content as well as prepaid and reseller growth. 
The anticipated timing of the Verizon Media sale means we would not recognize any revenue from that business in the fourth quarter. As a result, service and other revenue is no longer an apples-to-apples comparison with 2020, and we are withdrawing that growth guidance at this time. 
Turning to earnings. We now expect an adjusted EPS range of $5.25 to $5.35, up from the prior range of $5 to $5.15. The increase is driven by the improved wireless service revenue outlook, the aforementioned Media D&A benefit and a reduction in the expected interest expense related to the C-Band investment. Our guidance for the effective tax rate and CapEx are unchanged. 
In summary, we're competing effectively and delivering strong volumes, growing accounts, driving healthy step-ups and positioning our base to capitalize long term as we grow 5G adoption. Our customer performance has led to quality financial results as demonstrated by the sequential wireless service revenue growth while also flowing to the bottom line with best on record adjusted EPS. We entered the second half with a lot of momentum, and I am confident we will continue to execute our strategy and deliver strong operational and financial results throughout the remainder of the year. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our priorities for the remainder of 2021."

I'm particularly interested in what you're doing to outperform as it relates to plan mix. And then are you seeing a return of any of the fees that had come out of the run rate last year? Is that something you've seen already? Or is that embedded in the outlook? 
And then just on the improved EPS guidance, if we just sort of look at the $0.03 benefit you got from moving away from the D&A in Media in the recent quarter, that would imply that the improvement to your outlook this year maybe capture $0.07, $0.08 just from that accounting shift with the rest of it being operational.

They are taking the unlimited premium. And that said, I mean, 60% of the new accounts in the quarter was taking unlimited premium, and the penetration of 5G is happening. 
So we just continue the team with Ronan on the Consumer side, if we talk about that, they have this model, we have had it for several years, where we do the Mix & Match. We have a differentiation, and it's clearly resonating in the market. And at the same time, we see, of course, the economy coming back. The stores are getting almost back to prepandemic. 
So all in all, it's a good timing for us, and that's also why we feel good about our guidance and how the service revenue grow -- growing. And remember, we are always focused on profitable growth. That's what the team is doing. 
And if Matt and I see opportunities, we support the team to do it. But as long as it's going to be a profitable growth. And that's what we are seeing right now with all the momentum in the market. The team is taking advantage of that, and that also translates back to the guidance. But all in all, I would say this is our strategy we've been having for a couple of years and has been very successful. Matt?"

Thanks, Hans, and thanks for the question, Brett. So starting with the question about wireless service revenue growth. And as Hans mentioned, it's really building on the momentum that we've seen in the first half of the year, the continue -- continua",564,"Yes. Thanks, Hans, and thanks for the question, Brett. So starting with the question about wireless service revenue growth. And as Hans mentioned, it's really building on the momentum that we've seen in the first half of the year, the continue -- continuation of the sequential service revenue growth. We saw that the prior couple of quarters. We saw that increase even further in the second quarter. We expect that trend to continue as we get into the second half of the year because of the operational momentum that Hans mentioned, more step-ups to higher-priced plans, et cetera, et cetera. 
In terms of the fees, obviously, the year-over-year component is rather unique this time as second quarter last year was the most heavily impacted by COVID. And more specifically, for us, of course, we had the Keep Americans Connected Pledge that was in place for all of the second quarter that, as you said, impacted some of the fees. As you think about the numbers this year, a good chunk of those are back in. We're more at a BAU level. 
A couple of items, though, that aren't in the numbers yet. Obviously, international travel is not back to anywhere close to prepandemic levels. I don't expect that to be there for the balance of this year. Expect -- hope there will be a tailwind as we get into next year, but the guide doesn't make any assumption about an acceleration of a return of those fees in the second half of '21. 
One other thing I'd draw attention to as well when you look at our numbers and you think about return of fees, one of the things that's been very strong in the first half of the year is customer payment patterns, which is a great thing to see. And certainly, with all the stimulus payments out there, there's a lot of money in the system, and customers are actually paying more frequently. 
So even though we're back to normal in terms of things like late fees, we're actually charging significantly less than we were in second quarter of '19 because more of our customers are paying on time at this point, which is certainly a trend that we're very happy to see. So some of the fees are back, but not all of them are back when you think about it. And we're not assuming they'll be back in the -- for the balance of the year. 
The guide is based off of the strong operational momentum in the business, customers stepping up to those higher-priced plans. And we see that momentum continuing. 
Your second question about the EPS guidance. And obviously, glad to be able to raise the guidance. That's based off having a very healthy business that is performing exceptionally well. As you mentioned, some of the upside to the guidance comes from the Media depreciation and amortization, probably about $0.06 to $0.08, depending on the timing of the close. But the majority of it is coming from cash items, whether that be the wireless service revenue guide we were just discussing but also related to improved expectation around cash interest expense, lower than anticipated at the start of the year. 
So most of the guide is driven by cash-related items. And that's, of course, based off the strong momentum you see in the business, both operationally and financially."

And this quarter, so we open up even more opportunities for that. 
We open more 5G Home markets. We open more 4G Home markets. And then, of course, as Matt's outlined as well, we took more Fios subscribers than ever in the last 3, 4 quarters. 
So this is playing out well for us. We're opening up all of that. We are very excited about what's going to happen in the second half with the new CPE that has C-Band as well. So we executed everything we said we should do in the Investor Day in the second quarter, and we look forward to the second half of this year. And we will continue to report out what we're doing.

I can tell you, our differentiation is really resonating with the market, and that's what you see in the second quarter.

So obviously, the margin percent will be impacted by the volumes. We saw good volumes in the second quarter. But what -- as Hans said, what we're focused on is if you also look in there, sequential service revenue growth continue to lead the industry in that because not all net adds are created equal. And that also coming with EBITDA dollars increasing. 
So the margin percentage will play out where it does based off the volumes. But we're focused on -- you're seeing that sequential revenue increase and also the EBITDA dollars flowing in the right direction. 
In terms of your question around the cost of service, predominantly in Consumer, don't think -- one of the items that we had in the second quarter was a step-up in the network rent and lease of about $60 million a quarter as a result of the new lease payments we put in place. As you know, under the accounting, you look at the total payments over the life of the lease and kind of flatline it irrespective of how the natural cash flow payments flow. 
So there was, obviously, a significant upgrade to our lease agreements. And that was a onetime step-up in the quarterly rate there that flowed through the books at, say, about 60 -- $60 million, close to $0.01 a share impact from that. That should be the same going forward now. So that's the biggest driver you're seeing on the cost of service."

And so I'm wondering if you could suggest a similar number for Verizon's capacity and growth potential considering the wonderful investment in the C-Band.
And then on a related note, as it relates to the Home business, I'm curious if you could describe how you think about allocating the cost of spectrum

On the first one, on the -- if you have been listening to what I've talked about around 5G before, first of all, 5G as a technology is better to handle data than 4G, and that's obvious. 3G (sic) [ 4G ] is better than 4G (sic) [ 3G ] as well.

So that's happening. 
Then you need to add, too, that you're not only talking about spectrum, you're talking about how you engineer and how you build the network. So in our case, of course, we see great opportunities for being able to handle much more data. 
And remember, I mean, today, on the millimeter wave, we might use 400, sometimes 800 megahertz, but not more. And we have 1,600 megahertz nationwide. So there's so much more we can do. And as Kyle showed at the Investor Day, our headroom in the network is bigger than before, and that's before we start building what we're building right now. 
So we feel really confident how much -- how many [ X ] we are doing. And remember, I mean, our 4G is already the best in the nation. And then we're adding up right now what we're doing in 5G, that is also extraordinarily good. So others can talk and we usually execute, and we will continue with that."

But then the ability to also have fixed wireless access, to also have the public mobile edge compute, all coming off of that same network build, that same network investment, we think, gives us the opportunity to provide a very good return on the investment that we've made in both C-Band and millimeter wave."

When it comes to the content deals, I mean, I think I've said it a couple of times now. I mean our whole idea is to offering exclusive offers for our wireless customers. And we also want to offer that partnership to brands that we really think resonate with us. 
And the model, as we have spoken about before, is that this is incremental revenue for us. It's not only loyalty. It's actually incremental profit for us. So it's a totally different model that might sometimes not been in the market before because suddenly, we use the best network, the best distribution and the best brand to work with companies like Disney+, et cetera, to give our customers a premium experience on top of the differentiation we already have with the Mix & Match. 
And ultimately, when we make this customer to paying customers, we get our fair share of that because we, with our assets, have created it together with the asset for Disney+, Discovery or gaming, et cetera. So that's how the model is working. And as I said before, we are very pleased with the -- with, I think, we have 6 or 7 of these offerings in the market right now, and all of them are very positive to us and to our customers. And we will continue to see if we can find more. And I think it's a unique model that we have created that nobody else has in the market. 
And I said, again, it goes back to Ronan and the team being very, very innovative and creative to see that we bring the best to our customer, not only the best network, but also the differentiation in offering. So I have to say I'm very pleased with that. And I said, we have more in the funnel."

And in terms of the impact of cost of sales, obviously, the content cost associated with the items that Hans mentioned do flow through there. And you should expect to see that number continue to be a contributor of that line. 
But when we look at the overall profitability of bringing that together, the overall customer proposition, it's EBITDA additive to the business and also brings a better experience to the customers. So we see that as a win-win."

On the Business side, I mean, in Q4 2018, Matt and I talked about that. We think that this is one of the great opportunities we have over time with the Business side. And remember, we have never consolidated our Business side. It was compartmentalized in between all the different business we have. 
Tami and the team have during that moment -- and remember, we said we're going to invest in order to see that we have the platforms of products of CX and UX for our customers to be harmonized in order to be able to scale this to be a good business. And that they are doing, and they probably are halfway through it. They're doing a lot of transformation in the business. 
At the same time, there are some headwinds as we have seen before. I mean that would be the wireline sort of cyclical or -- no, it's not cyclical. It's a sustained decline. And then we have a wireless business where we take more than our fair share. We are leading in all segments. And that balance, of course, is coming into this quarter. Of course, we had more hardware this quarter as well. 
And then we're building off -- for the new opportunities with 5G mobile edge compute, private 5G networks, the 5G business Internet, which is using fixed wireless access. So we have a lot of new products coming out as we're building, and we have the same ambitions when it comes to financials, then we will be realistic what's happening in the market and how the team -- but I'm proud of the team of what they are transforming to and what we're aspiring for. And seeing the progress on mobile edge compute and business Internet, that's, of course, new opportunities that we have not seen coming into the P&L yet, but we're building it together with the transformation we're doing."

So just a couple of other comments on the business margin there, Colby. So Hans mentioned the higher volumes. We mentioned it upfront that the wireless volumes that we saw the gross adds were not just higher than 2Q last year, also higher than 2Q '19. So certainly seeing volumes come back, especially in enterprise and small, medium business. So that's having some impact there and then obviously, the wireline pressure. 
I would expect second half margins to be reasonably similar to what we saw in the first half of the year. The business transformation work the team is doing is having positive impacts with more to come as we go forward here. So I feel good about the direction the team is headed there in spite of the secular wireline pressures that we see. 
And then in terms of your question on promotions, as Hans said, it's a promotion. That means it has both a start date and an end date, and today is the end date. So we've run promotions since the beginning of the wireless industry. They've evolved over time. They will continue to do so. 
And the great position we're in is because of the strong operational results and financial results, it gives us the ability when the time is right in the marketplace to bring the right promotion out there. We felt this was the right promotion at this time with the economic reopening and wanting to get more customers with a 5G device in their hand as we're about to launch C-Band within the next 6 months, so we will continue to look at what is the right promotion for the right time. But the underlying operational performance of the business showing up in sequential wireless service revenue increase yet again gives us the position to have flexibility as we think about how we approach the market."

As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. 
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.

Now let's take a look at the consolidated earnings for the third quarter. In the third quarter, we reported earnings of $1.55 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported results include a net pretax gain on the sale of Verizon Media of $706 million and a net pretax charge of approximately $247 million, which includes a net charge of $144 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities and $103 million related to a severance charge for voluntary separations under our existing plans. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.41 in the third quarter compared to $1.25 a year ago. Please note, our results include 2 months of Verizon Media as the sale to Apollo Funds closed on September 1. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the third quarter."

We had a solid performance in the third quarter, growing total wireless service revenue by 3.9% year-over-year with earnings growth.

We had a solid performance in the third quarter, growing total wireless service revenue by 3.9% year-over-year with earnings growth. This was supported by strong net additions in wireless and broadband, which are both translated to bottom line growth. This definitely confirms our strategy to grow our business with high-quality offerings. 
As I said throughout the year, we have all the assets we need to extend our #1 position in the market. Our strategy remains unchanged, and we're delivering on everything we promised. And we're gaining momentum on all 5 vectors of growth. 
We have more path to grow than anybody else, and we're confident with our growth targets for outer years based on our third quarter and continued momentum into the fourth quarter. As an evidence, we're updating financial guidance for the full year. We now expect total wireless service revenue growth of around 4%, which is on the high end of our prior guidance and adjusted EPS of $5.35 to $5.40, up from $5.25 to $5.35. We remain on track to achieve our targeted CapEx levels in 2021, assuming no further disruption in the supply chain. 
Our team is working diligently and doing a fantastic work with vendors and suppliers to ensure we have adequate equipment to meet our C-band build and that we have devices that our customers want. Our operational excellence and our partnership strategy is the best in the industry, which I have been so impressed by since I joined Verizon. And in times like this, it matters. 
Let's talk about business. We continue to provide the best-in-class experience across the board. On the network front, third parties continue to recognize us as the best network experience. This includes RootMetrics for the 16th consecutive time and J.D. Power for the 27th consecutive time. Our network team is doing a great job. 
On the commercial front, we've got great momentum in the 5G adoption, with over 25% of our consumer phone base using a 5G-capable device. This is tracking well ahead of the 4G adoption, as I've said before. 
For context, 12 months after 4G launch, 10% of the devices were on 4G. Less than 12 months after 5G DSS launch, more than the double were on 5G devices, and it's growing at a rapid pace. This, combined with our millimeter wave strategy, is an important combination, and that is paying off. In the third quarter, the total millimeter wave users more than doubled sequentially. We're doing more gigabit of users in a month now than we did in all of the first quarter. In some of our more established build-outs, we're seeing more than 20% of users on millimeter wave. And we are on track to have 5% to 10% of all traffic in the urban millimeter wave polygons by year-end. 
For our Business segment, we continue to add wireless subscribers and take broadband share in our ILEC footprint with Fios. And finally, we delivered significant value creation and strategy refinement with the sale of the Verizon Media Group in September, the pending TracFone acquisition and also the issuance of our third green bond, which is a vital step towards our net 0 goal in 2035. All this was accomplished in tandem with a strong quarter results. 
When it comes to the financials, we're on track to meet and exceed all our 2021 guidance. We expect to have a strong finish of the year as we approach the launch of C-band. 
We continue to deliver excellent revenue performance in wireless service and within Fios. We have a diversified path of revenue growth with all 5 vectors contributing. 
EBITDA was up 3.3% year-over-year. And on an adjusted basis, EPS was up 12.8%. Our capital allocation stands firm. We invest in our business to create shareholder value. We continue to increase our dividend, which we did for the 15th consecutive year. And Matt and team are working diligently on our debt reduction. As we said last quarter, our guidance raise is broad-based and across all our 5 vectors of growth. 
Consumer segment EBITDA increased by 2% driven by positive trends in customer acquisition, premium plan adoption, product and services and content as well as prepaid and reseller growth. The service revenue momentum in the third quarter was driven by continued execution of our migration strategy to higher-valued price plans as well as high-quality net adds. 
But our growth is more than that. Much of our long-term growth is in fixed wireless access and mobile edge compute. Our strategy is becoming a national broadband provider with the best access to the tech for our customers include Fios, fixed wireless access on 5G, 4G millimeter wave and C-band. 
When it comes to the mobile edge compute, we are the mobile edge compute leader, both in public and private, thanks to great partnerships. And we just announced a private mobile edge compute partnership with Amazon that we're pleased with. And this just scratches the surface on how we'll continue to utilize our assets. We're confident in our growth opportunities as we move into the investment cycle with C-band. 
Before I hand it over to Matt, I want to briefly touch on our broadband expansion. We are on track to meet our fixed wireless access household coverage targets with an expected 15 million homes passed by the end of the year between 4G and 5G. To date, 5G Home is in 57 markets, and the 4G LTE home in over 200 markets across all 50 states. 
In addition to fixed wireless access, we're pleased with the great performance of Fios and continue to grow the open for sales volumes within our footprint. We're on track on exceeding all the commitments for 2021 and on track for long-term growth expectations outlined in our Investor Day earlier this year. You can expect us to provide 2022 guidance during our Q4 '21 earnings call. 
And now Matt, over to you."
415798,1683358854,2407996,"Verizon Communications Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Verizon Communications Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to share our Q3 results, another quarter in which we delivered strong financial and operating performance. As we have said previously, our focus is not solely on volume growth",2104,"Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to share our Q3 results, another quarter in which we delivered strong financial and operating performance. 
As we have said previously, our focus is not solely on volume growth as a goal in itself but on high-value volume growth that will yield sustainable increases in revenue and profitability going forward. By delivering the best-in-class network experiences to customers with additional services and products like Disney+ that others can't provide, our strategy is focused on increasing the value we receive from every connection. 
As you can see from our results, our disciplined approach is driving profitability and strong earnings results. In the third quarter, consolidated total revenue was $32.9 billion, up 4.3% from prior year. Our results are inclusive of 2 months of Media revenue, which approximated $1.4 billion on a segment basis. Excluding Verizon Media, total revenue grew 5.5%. 
Our service and other revenue growth rate was 0.5% and 1.6% without Verizon Media. Equipment revenue growth was approximately 30% compared to the prior year mainly due to the timing of iconic device launches and the continued pandemic recovery. 
Fios revenue was $3.2 billion, up 4.7% year-over-year driven by continued growth in customers as well as our efforts to increase the value of each customer by encouraging them to step up in speed tiers. Total wireless service revenue, which is the sum of Consumer and Business, was $17.1 billion, an increase of 3.9% over the prior year. The results were driven by higher access revenue, volume growth and products. We are creating more paths to growth with connectivity and nonconnectivity services. 
Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $12.3 billion, up 3.3% from prior year. Top line growth and a reduction in non-equipment-related expenses contributed to the year-over-year EBITDA growth. And net EBITDA growth is helping us drive EPS growth. For the quarter, adjusted EPS was $1.41, up year-over-year by 12.8%. 
Now let's take a look at our consolidated metrics. Throughout the quarter, we remained focused on bringing in high-quality net adds, a key component in helping us continue to deliver strong quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. 
We are seeing strong demand for connectivity across our Consumer and Business units. Our Mix & Match value propositions, network quality and unique partnerships are resonating with both new and existing customers. 
For the quarter, we delivered 429,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net adds, up more than 50% from prior year and in line with 2019 levels. We're seeing growth in new accounts as well as high retention levels, allowing us to grow our base with high-quality net adds. 
Phone churn for the quarter was 0.74%, well below pre-pandemic levels. Churn continues to benefit from a number of sustainable factors, including our best-in-class network with unmatched reliability and coverage and overall value propositions within our Consumer and Business unlimited plans. Additionally, consumer payment patterns continue to be better than pre-pandemic norms. 
Total broadband net adds, defined here as Fios, DSL and fixed wireless, were 129,000. Fios Internet net adds were 104,000 compared to 144,000 last year. As a reminder, last year's 3Q Fios results included a benefit from a higher backlog entering the quarter as we had largely paused in stores in Q2 2020 due to COVID. Fios has continued momentum driven by our best-in-class value proposition, built on network quality and our Mix & Match pricing structure. This combination is helping us to take share and deliver historically low churn rates. 
For the first time, we are providing fixed wireless net adds, which include both Consumer and Business fixed wireless products. We are building momentum and our pre-C-band success in Q3 demonstrates there is demand for the product from consumers and businesses. 
Both our 5G and LTE fixed wireless products are performing very well. We're pleased with what we're seeing around the install process as well as the quality and reliability of the product. 
Now let's turn to our Consumer Group results. Our Consumer Group had another strong quarter, continuing the momentum that we've been seeing in wireless and Fios. Total revenue was $23.3 billion, up 7.3% year-over-year. Service and other revenue was $18.8 billion, an improvement of 2.5% versus prior year. These results include strong wireless revenue as well as growth in Fios. 
Fios revenue was $2.9 billion, up 4.3% year-over-year mainly driven by growth in our Internet base of approximately 400,000 or 6.2% over the past year and migration to higher speeds. Our actions around Mix & Match, which include a broadband-first approach, is helping us to grow Fios revenue and consumer EBITDA. We still see plenty of room for additional growth within Fios as we continue to increase our share, Mix & Match penetration rates and our open-for-sale locations. 
Wireless service revenue was $14 billion, up 4% from the prior year. We have been driving access gains, both in growing accounts and phone net adds as well as by continuing to execute on our migration strategy. As a result of migrations and step-ups, over 30% of our account base is now on premium unlimited plans. 
Our growth in access is being complemented by product revenue, which includes items such as protection plans, content and others. Our wide range of product offerings helps us to not only grow revenue but provides differentiated experiences and more value to our customers. 
For the quarter, EBITDA was $10.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year or more than $200 million driven by our high-quality service and other revenue gains coming from multiple growth vectors. These results show the impact of our strategy to enhance the value of each connection, which we believe will drive continued growth into the future. 
The Mix & Match pricing structure for both wireless and Fios provides tremendous opportunity to migrate customers to higher-value tiers and bringing customers on higher-value plans. We are very pleased with how this strategy is working to help us increase value from our base and from new customers. You can see the impact of this strategy throughout our results. 
Postpaid phone net adds were 267,000, above our Q3 performance in 2019 and 2020. The performance was consistent during the period as we were able to grow accounts and deliver sustainably low churn throughout the quarter. 
Most importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the quality of customers we're adding, with approximately 66% of new accounts taking a premium unlimited plan. And Q3 was another quarter in which we saw a strong acceleration in our 5G penetration, exiting the quarter with over 25% of our phone base now equipped with a 5G-capable device, which is great progress in advance of our launch of 5G service on C-band spectrum in the coming months. 
Fios Internet net adds were 98,000 for the quarter, up slightly from the prior quarter. We continue to be pleased with the results we're seeing, especially on retention. 
Now let's move to Slide 11 to review the Business Group results. Our Business segment continues to see strong demand for wireless services across multiple verticals. We are continuing to focus on what we believe will be the highest growth portions of the Business segment: our small and medium business unit, private wireless and the next space or enterprise customers as well as building momentum for fixed wireless access to serve multiple customer groups. 
Total revenues for the Business segment was $7.7 billion. We continue to see growth in wireless revenue being offset by ongoing legacy wireline declines. Wireless service revenue was $3.1 billion, up 3.6% year-over-year. We saw quarter-over-quarter expansion driven by small and medium business, which was partially offset by distance learning pressures in public sector. Wireline revenues continue to be pressured by secular trends, while also facing elevated year-over-year comps due to 2020 COVID spending. 
Consistent with our focus on driving high-value business, in the wholesale space, we continue to rationalize our international voice traffic, which is contributing to the revenue decline shown on the slide. Business segment EBITDA was $1.9 billion, down 2.4% from the same quarter last year, and Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.8% in the quarter. 
While secular trends within wireline will continue to put pressure on margins in the near term, we're encouraged by the growth opportunities associated with our business transformation efforts as they start to gain traction. Our market leadership in wireless across all customer groups and our continued investment in primary growth areas for Verizon Business Group will position us to take advantage of the growth opportunities in the future. We are encouraged by the results we delivered for the highest-value portions of the segment in 3Q. 
Phone gross add volumes were above pre-pandemic levels, up 11.4% year-over-year and up 3% versus the same quarter in 2019. Total postpaid net adds for the quarter were 276,000. 
To better highlight some of the trends, on this slide, we've broken out the net adds by public sector and our higher-growth commercial businesses, which include small and medium business and enterprise. During 3Q 2020, the commercial space primarily within small and medium business was depressed, while public sector buoyed by distance learning programs saw elevated net adds. 
In 3Q '21, we've seen a rebound in the commercial space, while distance learning disconnects have driven public sector volumes to lower levels. We expect these trends to continue into the fourth quarter. A portion of distance learning disconnects also impacted our phone churn and net add performance. Despite this, we delivered postpaid phone net adds of 162,000. 
Now let's move to our consolidated cash flow summary. The business continues to generate strong cash flow. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $31.2 billion. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by lower cash taxes last year from a onetime benefit and higher working capital requirements this year due to greater volumes. 
Year-to-date capital spending totaled $13.9 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network. C-band CapEx was more than $1 billion through the third quarter. And we have placed orders for approximately $2 billion of related equipment year-to-date, giving us confidence that we will be within the previously guided incremental CapEx range of $2 billion to $3 billion for the year as we accelerate our C-band deployment. 
The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is $17.3 billion of free cash flow for the 9-month period. Net unsecured debt at quarter end was $131.6 billion, a $5.2 billion decrease versus the prior quarter. In addition to our third green bond issuance, we extended over $4.6 billion of near-term debt into a new 2032 maturity as we continue to optimize borrowing costs and our debt profile. Our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.7x. 
Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $9.9 billion, which included the proceeds associated with our sale of Verizon Media Group. We expect lower levels of cash on hand as we progress through the fourth quarter and approach the close of the TracFone acquisition, while continuing to execute on our business strategy within our capital allocation framework. 
Let's move on to Slide 14 for an update on guidance for the remainder of the year. We continued our strong first half performance and momentum in the third quarter. Hans and I are very pleased with the hard work our team is putting forth, and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as we prepare for the C-band launch. 
Our strong year-to-date results and momentum heading into the fourth quarter are allowing us to update guidance on both wireless service revenue growth and EPS. Wireless service revenue growth is now expected to be around 4.0%, the high end of the prior guidance. 
Adjusted EPS guidance is being increased to $5.35 to $5.40, up from the prior range of $5.25 to $5.35. Our guidance for the effective tax rate is unchanged. CapEx guidance is also unchanged, though I'd note that our assumption for our BAU spend of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion is dependent upon no material changes in the current state of our supply chain. 
Our team continues to execute on our strategy and deliver strong operational and financial results. We are attracting high-quality customers that see value in our products and services, evidenced by growth in accounts, migrations and step-ups. I look forward to continued momentum as we wrap up the year and position our base to take full advantage of all the things 5G Built Right has to offer. 
With that, I will hand it over to Hans to wrap up our prepared remarks."

Yes, there is, of course, a little bit more competitive landscape right now. But let me remind you on a couple of things. 
First of all, as we have learned from the history, broadband and mobilities, 2 of the most important infrastructure for any person in this country and in the world. So it's not strange that there is competition here. 
Secondly, we are in a moment where it's 5G scaling, the economy is strong. So of course, that's the moment where we see a lot of competition. But anyhow, if you look at our numbers, we are competing extremely effectively. We're gaining the high-quality customers regardless of the type of competition we have. 
And not only that, I mean, if you look at our growth of 3.9%, we feel really good about that as well when it comes to our service revenue. And we have been going back and forth on our promos. And the reason is that Ronan and his team on the Consumer side, they look at long-term profitability, high-quality customers when they come in and doing a promo. And right now, we feel very good about how we compete in the market. So we're always going to have promos when we think it's the right timing of it. So we feel really good about it. 
And as you also saw that Matt talked about our increased guidance as well. So all in all, we feel good how we compete in this environment. And if you look at the track record the last couple of quarters, been really strong in Consumer. And Ronan and the whole team are doing a great job. So I feel good about that. 
When it comes to the capital allocation, I'll let -- I can just say that we -- our capital allocation is clear. I mean, we focus #1 on investing in business, and we are investing in the business this year and both in CapEx, the spectrum and all of that. So that's #1. 
But we also have, as I said, our 15th consecutive year of dividend increase. And Matt and I, we constantly see that we have a position for the Board so they can continue to do that, and we will continue to do that. And then we have our debt reduction, which Matt will talk about. 
And finally, we have buybacks that we can do all the time. What I can tell you is that we constantly have a conversation with the Board which is the best way of doing capital allocation, the priorities. And we'll continue to do so to see that our shareholders get the best out of Verizon. Matt?"

Obviously, we said long term, we do believe deleveraging is the right priority. But we're also focused on returning capital to shareholders, and you saw that with the dividend. So Phil, you should expect us to continue to be thoughtful about capital allocation as we go forward."

And also when it comes to the numbers we have, as you said, it's a mix of 4G. It's a millimeter wave in the fixed wireless access right now. And as I said before, when we talk about our 5G fixed wireless access, the usage of the network is very similar as of Fios. So they are even using more gigabytes on the fixed wireless access on 5G than they do on Fios. 
So -- and we have a very, very good performance and quality. And remember, on the fixed wireless access, we are also doing a, I would say, a different model with the self-install and all of that, making optionality for our customers. 
And ultimately, the vision is clear for Verizon. We're going to be a nationwide broadband provider. We're going to have different accesses in different places depending on what is right for the customers and how quickly we can deploy. 
So -- and we are investing in the Fios and you saw the numbers this month. I mean, we're adding 130,000 in this quarter when it -- or 129,000, to be exact, net adds in broadband. So this is a great business for us, and we're just ramping fixed wireless access. 
And then coming back to C-band, as soon as we turn on C-band, we're also going to augment the footprint that we can offer fixed wireless access. So -- and as we said in the opening remarks, we're on track for that to deliver the -- after 1 year, having 100 million POPs covered by the C-band. 
As I said, there are some challenges in supply chain, but I can only say the team is just doing an enormous work. And just to be clear on it, the long-term planning we have with our vendors, the projection of forecasting we have done for all our equipment vendors over 2 years before we start deploying, of course, it's paying off right now that we work very differently with our vendors and how we plan. We have also pooled resources and inventory higher in the network so we can easily see that we have access to it. So we have done a lot of things in the last 2 years, 3 years in supply chain, so we can be in a situation to mitigate challenges we have right now. So all in all, that's where we are. Matt?"

And then the second question on the Fios footprint. We have constantly, of course, deployed Fios, and in this -- in our ILEC to be honest. And what we see right now is very strong demand, and we're winning the business we're deploying. The team is deploying. And as I said, we are heading towards 400,000 open for sale this year.

But also, I'd comment that a good mix, a good split between not just it being in rural areas and so on, but also seeing good traction in suburban and urban areas, too, for those products. 
And when you think about those customers in the first 46 C-band markets that will come online, the customers taking the LTE product there are getting a router that also has C-band in so they can immediately step up to those speeds when -- as soon as we turn C-band on there soon. 
And the Fios expansion, it's -- there's a couple of pieces. We see great opportunity, as Hans mentioned. The other piece, it's a great cost opportunity as well as we continue to upgrade the network technology in that footprint as well. 
So we've been investing in that for a number of years. Maybe haven't spoken about it quite as much, but it continues to be a very good growth driver for the business.

I guess, year-over-year, I think most observers would say that the promotions kind of look very similar as they did a year ago. And if anything, the wireless landscape is probably less competitive now than it's ever been in terms of postpaid phone net add availability. And as we look ahead, I think the things that people wonder about what's going to change are as the EBB and the PPP and the renovated programs all go away, the super normal kind of sport for the postpaid market might ebb. And second, you've got the cable companies coming in with new pricing plans. And then third, we've got the DISH launch coming up. Could you kind of give us your perspective on how comfortable people should be about how the landscape is going to evolve as these things change?"

No, there's a lot of moving parts here, as you talked about again. I mean, I think that what we have -- and now we start with Consumer because remember also our strong position wireless on the Business side. And basically, we are leading in every segment. So sometimes we forget to talk about how strong we're there. 
But let me start with Consumer because I think your question is a little bit more geared to Consumer. Remember how we have built our possibility. First of all, we have the best network. We have kept the best network. We augmented, and we are, of course, adding more spectrum to it right now with C-band. So that's very important. 
The second part is that the value we are doing besides having the best network, of course, with all the offerings we have created over time with Discovery, Disney+, which all of them are giving us profitability and retention. And you see the share numbers in this quarter. 
I think we have found a model with Mix & Match, and the things that we are offering our customers on the wireless side has really paid off with both the loyalty but also the step-ups. And remember, when Matt talked about that we are now 1/3 of all the unlimited, be on unlimited premium, but we still have, let's say, 1/3 on meter plan as well. 
So we have so many steps to continue to move our customers upwards. And that has been a strategy from the beginning. And it's clearly different than anybody else in the market how we can do that and both offer the best network and the experiences that we have as well as the Mix & Match that we have in the network. 
So I feel good about regardless of what type of competition is there and how it changes. We have owners' economics of everything we're doing. That was very clear from the beginning. We build our own fiber. We have the full network, and that's why we can have [ heaven knows ] on the network, which we also are benefiting from. 
So the whole idea with the strategy we laid out is just playing straight into what's happening in the market where mobility and broadband is the essential infrastructure for every individual in the world at the moment. And hey, everybody wants to be here. We have the best assets. That's basically how it looks."

A couple of other points, Dave, if I can. So you mentioned the EBB impact on the marketplace. And certainly, we're supportive of all efforts to make digital connectivity available and accessible to everyone in the country, and we're participating in those programs. 
I would, though, say that in terms of our gross adds and new customers coming in, it's a very small portion of that. The majority of our EBB participation is with existing customers rather than new customers. So it's not a driver of gross adds for us. 
And you also kind of mentioned it. Obviously, in the marketplace, there's been new plans that have come to the market in the past 6 to 9 months. And what I would say is just look at the volumes we've had, especially in the last 2 quarters with those new plans in place. You see the high-quality volumes that we've put on in that environment. So you have to work across both the service revenue and the handset components of the offering to customers. You add in the other values and products and services that we bring to customers, too. 
This is the strategy that we've been working on for 2 to 3 years now. Obviously, it was a bit of a dip when we hit the pandemic, but the strategy was driving revenue growth before the pandemic. And you see it driving revenue growth now as we continue to focus on high-quality customers and increasing the value of our base, and it shows in the results."

We're now lapping that, and those volumes are returning to their pre-pandemic trends. 
The other thing is we've stepped out of some of the wholesale international voice business that had revenue but not significant margins associated with it. So we wanted to focus on value-driving activities. We continue to compete effectively in the enterprise space in wireline. But on the quality and reliability of the service we provide, obviously, we are aim to be competitive there. But I'm not -- I've not seen us do anything out of the ordinary of what we were doing previously.

Second question, just taking the reaffirmation today that Verizon wants to be a national broadband provider for homes, businesses and on the go, how are you evaluating that build-versus-buy decision of using your spectrum and 5G technology to introduce fixed wireless broadband services versus the possibility of acquiring cable and fiber assets in the future?"

When it comes to our rollout of nationwide broadband and playing with that, of course, remember, we are doing a lot of fiber already right now. I mean, we're doing -- remember, we have been reporting on our One Fiber project, which is still ongoing. In the most metropolitan area, we are building on fiber. And of course, that is setting us up to have owners' economics on the broadband. 
And then at the access point, we will do a different type of 4G accesses. That's what new. The reason we do that because they're so much faster when it comes to coming out to the customer. And we want to be innovative as well and having a self-install and all of that combined with it. 
Then we're always on our fiber when it comes from outside our ILEC, we have looked into buy versus build all the time. We have come to the conclusion we want to build. We built our One Fiber network because we wanted the owners' economics on fiber. So that work is already done. So we feel really good about it. 
We're going to have owners' economics nationwide on broadband over time here. And we can work with our wireless offering, our broadband offering. We created the 2 go-to-market Verizon Consumer and Business Group thinking about our customers, how they do products, how to do platforms, the user experience. This all comes into play right now. I mean, I couldn't be more excited right now because the momentum for mobility and broadband is happening. 
We have prepared and worked now for 3 years to get where we are. And yes, we -- I feel really good about what we have. And the strategy is really working. And we look at the last couple of quarters here, when we talk about our net additions, talking about the revenue growth. 
And as I also said when we spoke earlier, I mean, if you look at the second quarter, when everybody has reported, we also take the larger share of industry service and other revenue growth in the market. I mean, that's really what we're focusing on. We're focusing on getting the revenue growth. 
And that's a little bit of the answer to your question on inflation as well that Matt is going to soon take over. Of course, we still have a lot on the wireless side where we can migrate customers up to higher plans. And that's, of course, the best way to see that we are getting incremental revenues from our customers but also give them more value and experiences."

But we're seeing that come across in certainly in labor rates. We're seeing it in commodities, driving utilities and whatnot. So -- but that's why the things we've done on the cost side over the past few years and continue to do are so important because it gives us the opportunity to be able to handle those -- any of those pressures coming in and continue to produce good margins. So we will continue to be focused there. 
And then as Hans said, our opportunity on the pricing side is really to step customers up. If you've got direct costs out there that we can pass through that we certainly will always look for the opportunities to do that. That's why you see kind of the changes in our content model from the legacy linear model where there wasn't clear transparency to the consumer between the increase in the cost from the producer there to what they were paying. What you see and what we're doing in the wireless space with content gives a lot more transparency there. So as costs go up, it's much easier for those to flow through to the end user."

And you have seen that we have made announcements in the quarter with the biggest cloud providers in the market, both on the private 5G mobile edge compute. 
And as you remember, there are basically 3 use cases. One is the public mobile edge compute and then it's a private mobile age compute and then it's private 5G networks. All of them sort of are in execution right now. 
We're working with customers. We have announced a couple of commercial contracts already like Corning, the British ports, et cetera. So that's already happening. And of course, it takes some time because we are actually creating a totally new market, and we are actually alone in this market. Nobody else in the world has launched mobile edge compute at this moment. So of course, we feel really good about that. 
And the team is working through the funnel, all the way from proof of context to new applications. And that's how it works when you create new markets, et cetera. So we will come back as soon as we feel it's time to start reporting it as we have done with 5G fixed wireless access. 
But I'm even more sort of excited automobile edge compute, what I've seen in the last year here with the technology solutions we have and also the customer interaction we have, together with the main partners. I mean, we have the biggest partners you can ever think about in this that are equally much vested as us because that was part of the strategy to bring different partners together. 
So we will continue with that, and we will come back and report. And we will give you new deals and how it is progressing with partners over time. And ultimately, of course, it's going to be financials, and that's going to show up. 
Initially, of course, it's going to be on Verizon Business Group that's going to have that as revenue.

I would say we have really good traction on the Business side on fixed wireless access, small and medium businesses, clearly, where we have our stronghold and being the clear leader. So we see this as a great opportunity for our Verizon Business Group as well. And again, we are now adding products and solution for Verizon Business Group that over time should offset the wireline decline that we have that Matt talked about. 
When we talk about the Verizon Business Group, we haven't talked enough about them, but the momentum on wireless there is really good. I mean, look at the small and medium business are coming back. They're doing a great job. On the enterprise side, the wireless business is doing well as well. 
The only area is a public sector is coming a little bit back. But that's a very natural thing because the sort of the increased demand of home education and et cetera, during the COVID, of course, had a spike in wireless connections, which is just naturally coming down a little bit right now. But the momentum on the wireless side on the Verizon Business Group and then you add the new opportunities, everything from application on top of the network, the mobile edge compute, the fixed wireless access and over time, also opportunities outside the ILEC on Fios or at least on fiber. 
So that's a great opportunity for us, and that's what we outlined already in 2019 when we decided to transform that business to see that we are really well prepared for capturing those opportunities and those transformations that all the enterprise, small and medium companies will do to digitalize over time.

As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. 
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.
As a reminder, we've entered the quiet period for the 3.45 gigahertz spectrum auction, so we will not be able to comment on our spectrum holdings or strategy.
Now let's take a look at the consolidated earnings for the third quarter. In the third quarter, we reported earnings of $1.55 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported results include a net pretax gain on the sale of Verizon Media of $706 million and a net pretax charge of approximately $247 million, which includes a net charge of $144 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment for pension liabilities and $103 million related to a severance charge for voluntary separations under our existing plan. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.41 in the third quarter compared to $1.25 a year ago. Please note, our results include 2 months of Verizon Media as the sale to Apollo Funds closed on September 1.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the third quarter."

We had a solid performance in the third quarter, growing total wireless service revenue by 3.9% year-over-year with earnings growth. This was supported by strong net addition",1000,"Thank you, Brady, and thank you all for joining our third quarter earnings call. We had a solid performance in the third quarter, growing total wireless service revenue by 3.9% year-over-year with earnings growth. This was supported by strong net additions in wireless and broadband, which are both translated to bottom line growth. This definitely confirms our strategy to grow our business with high-quality offerings.
As I said throughout the year, we have all the assets we need to extend our #1 position in the market. Our strategy remains unchanged, and we're delivering on everything we promised. And we're gaining momentum on all 5 vectors of growth.
We have more path to grow than anybody else, and we're confident with our growth targets for outer years based on our third quarter and continued momentum into the fourth quarter. As an evidence, we're updating financial guidance for the full year. We now expect total wireless service revenue growth of around 4%, which is on the high end of our prior guidance and adjusted EPS of $5.35 to $5.40, up from $5.25 to $5.35. We remain on track to achieve our targeted CapEx levels in 2021, assuming no further disruption in the supply chain.
Our team is working diligently and doing a fantastic work with vendors and suppliers to ensure we have adequate equipment to meet our C-Band build and that we have devices that our customers want. 
Our operational excellence and our partnership strategy is the best in the industry, which I have been so impressed by since I joined Verizon. And in times like this, it matters.
Let's talk about business. We continue to provide the best-in-class experience across the board. On the network front, third parties continue to recognize us as the best network experience. This includes RootMetrics for the 16th consecutive time and J.D. Power for the 27th consecutive time. Our network team is doing a great job.
On the commercial front, we've got great momentum in the 5G adoption, with over 25% of our consumer phone base using a 5G-capable device. This is tracking well ahead of the 4G adoption, as I've said before.
For context, 12 months after 4G launch, 10% of the devices were on 4G. Less than 12 months after 5G DSS launch, more than the double were on 5G devices, and it's growing at a rapid pace. This, combined with our millimeter wave strategy, is an important combination, and that is paying off. In the third quarter, the total millimeter wave users more than doubled sequentially. We're doing more gigabit of users in a month now than we did in all of the first quarter. In some of our more established build-outs, we're seeing more than 20% of users on millimeter wave. And we are on track to have 5% to 10% of all traffic in the urban millimeter wave polygons by year-end.
For our Business segment, we continue to add wireless subscribers and take broadband share in our ILEC footprint with Fios. And finally, we delivered significant value creation and strategy refinement with the sale of the Verizon Media Group in September, the pending TracFone acquisition and also the issuance of our third green bond, which is a vital step towards our net zero goal in 2035. All this was accomplished in tandem with a strong quarter results.
When it comes to the financials, we're on track to meet and exceed all our 2021 guidance. We expect to have a strong finish of the year as we approach the launch of C-Band.
We continue to deliver excellent revenue performance in wireless service and within Fios. We have a diversified path of revenue growth with all 5 vectors contributing.
EBITDA was up 3.3% year-over-year. And on an adjusted basis, EPS was up 12.8%. Our capital allocation stands firm. We invest in our business to create shareholder value. We continue to increase our dividend, which we did for the 15th consecutive year. And Matt and team are working diligently on our debt reduction. As we said last quarter, our guidance raise is broad-based and across all our 5 vectors of growth.
Consumer segment EBITDA increased by 2% driven by positive trends in customer acquisition, premium plan adoption, product and services and content as well as prepaid and reseller growth. The service revenue momentum in the third quarter was driven by continued execution of our migration strategy to higher-valued price plans as well as high-quality net adds.
But our growth is more than that. Much of our long-term growth is in fixed wireless access and mobile edge compute. Our strategy is becoming a national broadband provider with the best access to the tech for our customers include Fios, fixed wireless access on 5G, 4G, millimeter wave and C-Band.
When it comes to the mobile edge compute, we are the mobile edge compute leader, both in public and private, thanks to great partnerships. And we just announced a private mobile edge compute partnership with Amazon that we're pleased with. And this just scratches the surface on how we'll continue to utilize our assets. We're confident in our growth opportunities as we move into the investment cycle with C-Band.
Before I hand it over to Matt, I want to briefly touch on our broadband expansion. We are on track to meet our fixed wireless access household coverage targets with an expected 15 million homes passed by the end of the year between 4G and 5G. To date, 5G Home is in 57 markets, and the 4G LTE home in over 200 markets across all 50 states.
In addition to fixed wireless access, we're pleased with the great performance of Fios and continue to grow the open for sales volumes within our footprint. We're on track on exceeding all the commitments for 2021 and on track for long-term growth expectations outlined in our Investor Day earlier this year. You can expect us to provide 2022 guidance during our Q4 '21 earnings call.
And now Matt, over to you."
415798,1683358854,2408165,"Verizon Communications Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Verizon Communications Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to share our Q3 results, another quarter in which we delivered strong financial and operating performance.As we have said previously, our focus is not solely on volume growth",2101,"Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to share our Q3 results, another quarter in which we delivered strong financial and operating performance.
As we have said previously, our focus is not solely on volume growth as a goal in itself but on high-value volume growth that will yield sustainable increases in revenue and profitability going forward. By delivering the best-in-class network experiences to customers with additional services and products like Disney+ that others can't provide, our strategy is focused on increasing the value we receive from every connection.
As you can see from our results, our disciplined approach is driving profitability and strong earnings results. In the third quarter, consolidated total revenue was $32.9 billion, up 4.3% from prior year. Our results are inclusive of 2 months of Media revenue, which approximated $1.4 billion on a segment basis. Excluding Verizon Media, total revenue grew 5.5%.
Our service and other revenue growth rate was 0.5% and 1.6% without Verizon Media. Equipment revenue growth was approximately 30% compared to the prior year mainly due to the timing of iconic device launches and the continued pandemic recovery.
Fios revenue was $3.2 billion, up 4.7% year-over-year driven by continued growth in customers as well as our efforts to increase the value of each customer by encouraging them to step up in speed tiers. Total wireless service revenue, which is the sum of Consumer and Business, was $17.1 billion, an increase of 3.9% over the prior year. The results were driven by higher access revenue, volume growth and products. We are creating more paths to growth with connectivity and nonconnectivity services.
Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $12.3 billion, up 3.3% from prior year. Top line growth and a reduction in non-equipment-related expenses contributed to the year-over-year EBITDA growth. And net EBITDA growth is helping us drive EPS growth. For the quarter, adjusted EPS was $1.41, up year-over-year by 12.8%.  
Now let's take a look at our consolidated metrics. Throughout the quarter, we remained focused on bringing in high-quality net adds, a key component in helping us continue to deliver strong quarter-over-quarter revenue growth.
We are seeing strong demand for connectivity across our Consumer and Business units. Our Mix & Match value propositions, network quality and unique partnerships are resonating with both new and existing customers.
For the quarter, we delivered 429,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net adds, up more than 50% from prior year and in line with 2019 levels. We're seeing growth in new accounts as well as high retention levels, allowing us to grow our base with high-quality net adds.
Phone churn for the quarter was 0.74%, well below pre-pandemic levels. Churn continues to benefit from a number of sustainable factors, including our best-in-class network with unmatched reliability and coverage and overall value propositions within our Consumer and Business unlimited plans. Additionally, consumer payment patterns continue to be better than pre-pandemic norms.
Total broadband net adds, defined here as Fios, DSL and fixed wireless, were 129,000. Fios Internet net adds were 104,000 compared to 144,000 last year. As a reminder, last year's 3Q Fios results included a benefit from a higher backlog entering the quarter as we had largely paused in stores in Q2 2020 due to COVID. Fios has continued momentum driven by our best-in-class value proposition, built on network quality and our Mix and Match pricing structure. This combination is helping us to take share and deliver historically low churn rates.
For the first time, we are providing fixed wireless net adds, which include both Consumer and Business fixed wireless products. We are building momentum and our pre-C-Band success in Q3 demonstrates there is demand for the product from consumers and businesses.
Both our 5G and LTE fixed wireless products are performing very well. We're pleased with what we're seeing around the install process as well as the quality and reliability of the product.
Now let's turn to our Consumer Group results. Our Consumer Group had another strong quarter, continuing the momentum that we've been seeing in wireless and Fios. Total revenue was $23.3 billion, up 7.3% year-over-year. Service and other revenue was $18.8 billion, an improvement of 2.5% versus prior year. These results include strong wireless revenue as well as growth in Fios.
Fios revenue was $2.9 billion, up 4.3% year-over-year mainly driven by growth in our Internet base of approximately 400,000 or 6.2% over the past year and migration to higher speeds. Our actions around Mix and Match, which included broadband-first approach, is helping us to grow Fios revenue and consumer EBITDA. We still see plenty of room for additional growth within Fios as we continue to increase our share, Mix and Match penetration rates and our open-for-sale locations.
Wireless service revenue was $14 billion, up 4% from the prior year. We have been driving access gains, both in growing accounts and phone net adds as well as by continuing to execute on our migration strategy. As a result of migrations and step-ups, over 30% of our account base is now on premium unlimited plans.
Our growth in access is being complemented by product revenue, which includes items such as protection plans, content and others. Our wide range of product offerings helps us to not only grow revenue but provides differentiated experiences and more value to our customers.
For the quarter, EBITDA was $10.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year or more than $200 million driven by our high-quality service and other revenue gains coming from multiple growth vectors. These results show the impact of our strategy to enhance the value of each connection, which we believe will drive continued growth into the future.
The Mix and Match pricing structure for both wireless and Fios provides tremendous opportunity to migrate customers to higher-value tiers and bringing customers on higher-value plans. We are very pleased with how this strategy is working to help us increase value from our base and from new customers. You can see the impact of this strategy throughout our results.
Postpaid phone net adds were 267,000, above our Q3 performance in 2019 and 2020. The performance was consistent during the period as we were able to grow accounts and deliver sustainably low churn throughout the quarter.
Most importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the quality of customers we're adding, with approximately 66% of new accounts taking a premium unlimited plan. And Q3 was another quarter in which we saw a strong acceleration in our 5G penetration, exiting the quarter with over 25% of our phone base now equipped with a 5G-capable device, which is great progress in advance of our launch of 5G service on C-Band spectrum in the coming months.
Fios Internet net adds were 98,000 for the quarter, up slightly from the prior quarter. We continue to be pleased with the results we're seeing, especially on retention.
Now let's move to Slide 11 to review the Business Group results. Our Business segment continues to see strong demand for wireless services across multiple verticals. We are continuing to focus on what we believe will be the highest growth portions of the Business segment: our small and medium business unit, private wireless and MEC space or enterprise customers as well as building momentum for fixed wireless access to serve multiple customer groups.
Total revenues for the Business segment was $7.7 billion. We continue to see growth in wireless revenue being offset by ongoing legacy wireline declines. Wireless service revenue was $3.1 billion, up 3.6% year-over-year. We saw quarter-over-quarter expansion driven by small and medium business, which was partially offset by distance learning pressures in public sector. 
Wireline revenues continue to be pressured by secular trends, while also facing elevated year-over-year comps due to 2020 COVID spending.
Consistent with our focus on driving high-value business, in the wholesale space, we continue to rationalize our international voice traffic, which is contributing to the revenue decline shown on the slide. 
Business segment EBITDA was $1.9 billion, down 2.4% from the same quarter last year, and Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.8% in the quarter.  
While secular trends within wireline will continue to put pressure on margins in the near term, we're encouraged by the growth opportunities associated with our business transformation efforts as they start to gain traction. 
Our market leadership in wireless across all customer groups and our continued investment in primary growth areas for Verizon Business Group will position us to take advantage of the growth opportunities in the future. We are encouraged by the results we delivered for the highest-value portions of the segment in 3Q.
Phone gross add volumes were above pre-pandemic levels, up 11.4% year-over-year and up 3% versus the same quarter in 2019. Total postpaid net adds for the quarter were 276,000. 
To better highlight some of the trends, on this slide, we've broken out the net adds by public sector and our higher-growth commercial businesses, which include small and medium business and enterprise. During 3Q 2020, the commercial space primarily within small and medium business was depressed, while public sector buoyed by distance learning programs saw elevated net adds.
In 3Q '21, we've seen a rebound in the commercial space, while distance learning disconnects have driven public sector volumes to lower levels. We expect these trends to continue into the fourth quarter. A portion of distance learning disconnects also impacted our phone churn and net add performance. Despite this, we delivered postpaid phone net adds of 162,000.
Now let's move to our consolidated cash flow summary. The business continues to generate strong cash flow. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $31.2 billion. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by lower cash taxes last year from a onetime benefit and higher working capital requirements this year due to greater volumes.
Year-to-date capital spending totaled $13.9 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network. C-Band CapEx was more than $1 billion through the third quarter. And we have placed orders for approximately $2 billion of related equipment year-to-date, giving us confidence that we will be within the previously guided incremental CapEx range of $2 billion to $3 billion for the year as we accelerate our C-Band deployment.
The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is $17.3 billion of free cash flow for the 9-month period. Net unsecured debt at quarter end was $131.6 billion, a $5.2 billion decrease versus the prior quarter. In addition to our third green bond issuance, we extended over $4.6 billion of near-term debt into a new 2032 maturity as we continue to optimize borrowing costs and our debt profile. Our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.7x.
Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $9.9 billion, which included the proceeds associated with our sale of Verizon Media Group. We expect lower levels of cash on hand as we progress through the fourth quarter and approach the close of the TracFone acquisition, while continuing to execute  our business strategy within our capital allocation framework.
Let's move on to Slide 14 for an update on guidance for the remainder of the year. We continued our strong first half performance and momentum in the third quarter. Hans and I are very pleased with the hard work our team is putting forth, and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as we prepare for the C-Band launch.
Our strong year-to-date results and momentum heading into the fourth quarter are allowing us to update guidance on both wireless service revenue growth and EPS. Wireless service revenue growth is now expected to be around 4.0%, the high end of the prior guidance.
Adjusted EPS guidance is being increased from $5.35 to $5.40, up from the prior range of $5.25 to $5.35. Our guidance for the effective tax rate is unchanged. CapEx guidance is also unchanged, though I'd note that our assumption for our BAU spend of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion is dependent upon no material changes in the current state of our supply chain.
Our team continues to execute on our strategy and deliver strong operational and financial results. We are attracting high-quality customers that see value in our products and services, evidenced by growth in accounts, migrations and step-ups. I look forward to continued momentum as we wrap up the year and position our base to take full advantage of all the things 5G Built Right has to offer.
With that, I will hand it over to Hans to wrap up our prepared remarks."

Yes, there is, of course, a little bit more competitive landscape right now. But let me remind you on a couple of things.
First of all, as we have learned from the history, broadband and mobilities, 2 of the most important infrastructure for any person in this country and in the world. So it's not strange that there is competition here.
Secondly, we are in a moment where it's 5G scaling, the economy is strong. So of course, that's the moment where we see a lot of competition. But anyhow, if you look at our numbers, we are competing extremely effectively. We're gaining the high-quality customers regardless of the type of competition we have.
And not only that, I mean, if you look at our growth of 3.9%, we feel really good about that as well when it comes to our service revenue. And we have been going back and forth on our promos. And the reason is that Ronan and his team on the Consumer side, they look at long-term profitability, high-quality customers when they come in and doing a promo. And right now, we feel very good about how we compete in the market. So we're always going to have promos when we think it's the right timing of it. So we feel really good about it.
And as you also saw that Matt talked about our increased guidance as well. So all in all, we feel good how we compete in this environment. And if you look at the track record the last couple of quarters, been really strong in Consumer. And Ronan and the whole team are doing a great job. So I feel good about that.
When it comes to the capital allocation, I'll let -- I can just say that we -- our capital allocation is clear. I mean, we focus #1 on investing in business, and we are investing in the business this year and both in CapEx, the spectrum and all of that. So that's #1.
But we also have, as I said, our 15th consecutive year of dividend increase. And Matt and I, we constantly see that we have a position for the Board so they can continue to do that, and we will continue to do that. And then we have our debt reduction, which Matt will talk about.
And finally, we have buybacks that we can do all the time. What I can tell you is that we constantly have a conversation with the Board which is the best way of doing capital allocation, the priorities. And we'll continue to do so to see that our shareholders get the best out of Verizon. Matt?"

And also when it comes to the numbers we have, as you said, it's a mix of 4G. It's millimeter wave in the fixed wireless access right now. And as I said before, when we talk about our 5G fixed wireless access, the usage of the network is very similar as of Fios. So they are even using more gigabytes on the fixed wireless access on 5G than they do on Fios.
So -- and we have a very, very good performance and quality. And remember, on the fixed wireless access, we are also doing a, I would say, a different model with the self-install and all of that, making optionality for our customers.
And ultimately, the vision is clear for Verizon. We're going to be a nationwide broadband provider. We're going to have different accesses in different places depending on what is right for the customers and how quickly we can deploy.
So -- and we are investing in the Fios and you saw the numbers this month. I mean, we're adding 130,000 in this quarter when it -- or 129,000, to be exact, net adds in broadband. So this is a great business for us, and we're just ramping fixed wireless access.
And then coming back to C-Band, as soon as we turn on C-Band, we're also going to augment the footprint that we can offer fixed wireless access. So -- and as we said in the opening remarks, we're on track for that to deliver the -- after 1 year, having 100 million POPs covered by the C-Band.
As I said, there are some challenges in supply chain, but I can only say the team is just doing an enormous work. And just to be clear on it, the long-term planning we have with our vendors, the projection of forecasting we have done for all our equipment vendors over 2 years before we start deploying, of course, it's paying off right now that we work very differently with our vendors and how we plan. We have also pooled resources and inventory higher in the network so we can easily see that we have access to it. So we have done a lot of things in the last 2 years, 3 years in supply chain, so we can be in a situation to mitigate challenges we have right now. So all in all, that's where we are. Matt?"

It looks like you're going to add over 400,000 locations open for sale this year, and it seems like you would expect to be at or above that pace going forward.

And then the second question on the Fios footprint. We have constantly, of course, deployed Fios, and in this -- in our ILEC to be honest. And what we see right now is very strong demand, and we're winning the business we're deploying. The team is deploying. And as I said, we are heading towards 400,000 open for sale this year.

But also, I'd comment that a good mix, a good split between not just it being in rural areas and so on, but also seeing good traction in suburban and urban areas, too, for those products. 
And when you think about those customers in the first 46 C-Band markets that will come online, the customers taking the LTE product there are getting a router that also has C-Band in so they can immediately step-up to those speeds when -- as soon as we turn C-Band on there soon.
And the Fios expansion, it's -- there's a couple of pieces. We see great opportunity, as Hans mentioned. The other piece, it's a great cost opportunity as well as we continue to upgrade the network technology in that footprint as well. 
So we've been investing in that for a number of years. Maybe haven't spoken about it quite as much, but it continues to be a very good growth driver for the business. And we see a very strong line of sight for it to continue to do so. 4.7% growth in Fios revenues this quarter, certainly something we can continue to build on."

I mean, we do long-term planning with our suppliers years back. So we feel really good about that. There's been some challenges in the material. The team is working around them every day, finding new solutions in order for us to deploy, and they will continue to do so.
When it comes to resources, again, we secured our resources years ahead to be prepared for these type of deployments we have. And we're doing more deployment than we've ever done before.
You talk about C-Band. We do millimeter wave, 14,000 this year. We do fiber. We do augmentations on the 4G. We do Fios. The team -- so it's many things they're doing, and we have never done more than this. And I can tell you the team with supply chain and deployment are doing a great job.
When it comes to the 15 million households passed by year-end this year, that includes all the technologies we have. And of course, the second part that we guided for when we had our Investor Day was to get to 50 million households passed later on. So that includes all the technologies, including C-Band, of course, and also how we deal with different type of devices, having all the different technology in them.
So the team has been planning this, creating opportunities for us. And of course, without coming into '22 -- 2022 yet, but with the opening of the C-Band, we see great new opportunities.

No, there's a lot of moving parts here, as you talked about again. I mean, I think that what we have -- and now as we start with Consumer because remember also our strong position on wireless on the Business side. And basically, we are leading in every segment. So sometimes we forget to talk about how strong we're there.
But let me start with Consumer because I think your question is a little bit more geared to Consumer. Remember how we have built our possibility. First of all, we have the best network. We have kept the best network. We augmented, and we are, of course, adding more spectrum to it right now with C-Band. So that's very important.
The second part is that the value we are doing besides having the best network, of course, with all the offerings we have created over time with Discovery, Disney+, which all of them are giving us profitability and retention. And you see the share numbers in this quarter.
I think we have found a model with Mix and Match, and the things that we are offering our customers on the wireless side has really paid off with both the loyalty but also the step-ups. And remember, when Matt talked about that we are now 1/3 of all the unlimited, be on unlimited premium, but we still have, let's say, 1/3 on meter plan as well.
So we have so many steps to continue to move our customers upwards. And that has been a strategy from the beginning. And it's clearly different than anybody else in the market how we can do that and both offer the best network and the experiences that we have as well as the Mix and Match that we have in the network.
So I feel good about regardless of what type of competition is there and how it changes. We have owners' economics of everything we're doing. That was very clear from the beginning. We build our own fiber. We have the full network, and that's why we can have every knows on the network, which we also are benefiting from.
So the whole idea with the strategy we laid out is just playing straight into what's happening in the market where mobility and broadband is the essential infrastructure for every individual in the world at the moment. And hey, everybody wants to be here. We have the best assets. That's basically how it looks."

A couple of other points, Dave, if I can. So you mentioned the EBB impact on the marketplace. And certainly, we're supportive of all efforts to make digital connectivity available and accessible to everyone in the country, and we're participating in those programs.
I would, though, say that in terms of our gross adds and new customers coming in, it's a very small portion of that. The majority of our EBB participation is with existing customers rather than new customers. So it's not a driver of gross adds for us.
And you also kind of mentioned it. Obviously, in the marketplace, there's been new plans that have come to the market in the past 6 to 9 months. And what I would say is just look at the volumes we've had, especially in the last 2 quarters with those new plans in place. You see the high-quality volumes that we've put on in that environment. So you have to work across both the service revenue and the handset components of the offering to customers. You add in the other values and products and services that we bring to customers, too. 
This is the strategy that we've been working on for 2 to 3 years now. Obviously, it was a bit of a dip when we hit the pandemic, but the strategy was driving revenue growth before the pandemic. And you see it driving revenue growth now as we continue to focus on high-quality customers and increasing the value of our base, and it shows in the results."

I mean, we're doing -- remember, we have been reporting on our One Fiber project, which is still ongoing. In the most metropolitan area, we are building on fiber. And of course, that is setting us up to have owner's economics on the broadband.
And then at the access point, we will do a different type of 4G accesses. That's what new. The reason we do that because they're so much faster when it comes to coming out to the customer. And we want to be innovative as well and having a self-install and all of that combined with it.
Then we're always on our fiber when it comes from outside our ILEC, we have looked into buy versus build all the time. We have come to the conclusion we want to build. We built our One Fiber network because we wanted the owner's economics on fiber. So that work is already done. So we feel really good about it.
We're going to have owner's economics nationwide on broadband over time here. And we can work with our wireless offering, our broadband offering. We created the 2 go-to-market Verizon Consumer and Business Group thinking about our customers, how they do products, how to do platforms, the user experience. This all comes into play right now. I mean, I couldn't be more excited right now because the momentum for mobility and broadband is happening.
We have prepared and worked now for 3 years to get where we are. And yes, we -- I feel really good about what we have. And the strategy is really working. And we look at the last couple of quarters here, when we talk about our net additions, talking about the revenue growth.
And as I also said when we spoke earlier, I mean, if you look at the second quarter, when everybody has reported, we also take the larger share of industry service and other revenue growth in the market. I mean, that's really what we're focusing on. We're focusing on getting the revenue growth.
And that's a little bit of the answer to your question on inflation as well that Matt is going to soon take over. Of course, we still have a lot on the wireless side where we can migrate customers up to higher plans.

So we will continue to be focused there.
And then as Hans said, our opportunity on the pricing side is really to step customers up. If you've got direct costs out there that we can pass through that we certainly will always look for the opportunities to do that. That's why you see kind of the changes in our content model from the legacy linear model where there wasn't clear transparency to the consumer between the increase in the cost from the producer there to what they were paying. What you see and what we're doing in the wireless space with content gives a lot more transparency there. So as costs go up, it's much easier for those to flow through to the end user."

First, on the mobile edge compute, we are -- first of all, we're doing great progress in mobile edge compute. And you have seen that we have made announcements in the quarter with the biggest cloud providers in the market, both on the private 5G mobile edge compute.
And as you remember, there are basically 3 use cases. One is the public mobile edge compute and then it's a private mobile age compute and then it's private 5G networks. All of them sort of are in execution right now.
We're working with customers. We have announced a couple of commercial contracts already like Corning, the British ports, et cetera. So that's already happening. And of course, it takes some time because we are actually creating a totally new market, and we are actually alone in this market. Nobody else in the world has launched mobile edge compute at this moment. So of course, we feel really good about that.
And the team is working through the funnel, all the way from proof of context to new applications. And that's how it works when you create new markets, et cetera. So we will come back as soon as we feel it's time to start reporting it as we have done with 5G fixed wireless access.
But I'm even more sort of excited automobile edge compute, what I've seen in the last year here with the technology solutions we have and also the customer interaction we have, together with the main partners. I mean, we have the biggest partners you can ever think about in this that are equally much vested as us because that was part of the strategy to bring different partners together.
So we will continue with that, and we will come back and report. And we will give you new deals and how it is progressing with partners over time. And ultimately, of course, it's going to be financials, and that's going to show up.
Initially, of course, it's going to be on Verizon Business Group that's going to have that as revenue. There is a B2B2C opportunity longer term, which can end up in Consumer, but predominantly in the beginning is a Verizon Business Group opportunity. 
Matt, on guidance, have you thought through what you're going to do next year? He hasn't told me yet."

But as you mentioned, we always look at what year-over-year pressures may be in there, especially things that are accounting-related rather than cash flow-related. We'll make sure we have the appropriate level of transparency around that. 
The important thing for us to be able to demonstrate in that guidance is how our strategy is working, and it's going to show up in revenue growth and cash flow growth. And you see that this year, and we'll find a way to make sure that we could communicate clearly that we're continuing to grow the top line of the business, and that's flowing through into the cash generation of the business as well, which is ultimately what it's all about."

First, maybe you could just update us on your expectations for what exactly do you do differently when you get the TracFone asset? How do you think about the go-to-market strategy in the prepaid market in particular?
And then second, you've started to see some of the -- whether it's open signal or other reports suggesting that T-Mobile's network for 5G is faster and broader coverage. How do you think about maintaining the sort of best network advantage that you've had? And what gives you confidence that you can convey that in the business and consumer markets?"

And without going into my competition because I never talk about them, but clearly, one is always lost.
So if we then talk about the TracFone, which is, of course, an exciting opportunity for us, we're still to be closed. We're not -- we're going to have the go-to-market and the brands that TracFone have. They are so good on prepaid, and they've shown that.
What we will, of course, support them with this all the back-end support all the way from supply chain, IT support, UX, customer care and all of that. But clearly, we want to keep the point of sales. We want to keep the offerings, and we want to serve the value market. So that's where we are. I cannot go further into that because we still have the pending sort of approval of it. But we will give you even more, Craig, as soon as we have closed this one."

So the step-ups give us the increase in ARPA. And then the service revenue is, obviously, a combination of the increase in revenue within the base and then also the impact of the new customers coming in.
So as you do that, we're very, very confident that you continue to add scale to our business, which is already the best in class from a scale standpoint. And that will show up in the margin profile of the business going forward. So I expect us to continue to have a very strong margin profile going forward.
It's built on executing the strategy. You see that in the results this year. You compare the Consumer margin in 3Q this year to 2 years ago, you see that strategy is working and delivering results at both at the top line and the margin line."

If I talk about the fixed wireless access on the Business side, it's called business Internet on that side offering we have. And of course, we started off with our fixed wireless access on the Consumer side, and we later on added in our Business side to actually have access to it as well because that's what -- how we want to restart.
I would say we have really good traction on the Business side on fixed wireless access, small and medium businesses, clearly, where we have our stronghold and being the clear leader. So we see this as a great opportunity for our Verizon Business Group as well. And again, we are now adding products and solution for Verizon Business Group that over time should offset the wireline decline that we have, that Matt talked about.
When we talk about the Verizon Business Group, we haven't talked enough about them, but the momentum on wireless there is really good. I mean, look at the small and medium businesses are coming back. They're doing a great job. On the enterprise side, the wireless business is doing well as well.
The only area is a public sector is coming a little bit back. But that's a very natural thing because the sort of the increased demand of home education and et cetera, during the COVID, of course, had a spike in wireless connections, which is just naturally coming down a little bit right now. But the momentum on the wireless side on the Verizon Business Group and then you add the new opportunities, everything from application on top of the network, the mobile edge compute, the fixed wireless access and over time, also opportunities outside the ILEC on Fios or at least on fiber.
So that's a great opportunity for us, and that's what we outlined already in 2019 when we decided to transform that business to see that we are really well prepared for capturing those opportunities and those transformations that all the enterprise, small and medium companies will do to digitalize over time. So I think we're in a good place. Simon and the team are doing a great job."
