Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
Everyone knows that this past year was full of challenges. We work closely with the independent agents who represent us to react quickly to changing needs of their clients as the pandemic progressed and to keep business flowing. The communities we serve saw an unusually high level of catastrophe activity. While no one likes to witness the pain and destruction these events bring, it is when our field claims representatives shine, delivering support with empathy and warrant. 
Our headquarter's associates remain focused on our key priorities, even though they've had to adapt to working at home, balancing family and business responsibilities in new ways. Despite those challenges, our associates and agents responded with determination and focus, helping us to produce the healthy financial performance we reported today. 
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 rose 68% compared with the fourth quarter a year ago, including increases in the fair value of our equity security portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income increased 29% or $59 million for the quarter despite higher catastrophe losses, reducing it by $19 million more than last year on an after-tax basis. 
Our 87.3% property casualty combined ratio was 4.3 percentage points better than a year ago, even with a catastrophe loss ratio that was 1.4 points worse. The current accident year loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe loss effects continued to improve and was 3.9 percentage points better than last year. Some of that is due to improved underwriting and some of it is attributable to the pandemic, such as fewer auto accidents resulting from reduced driving. 
We believe a major reason that our underwriting performance continues to improve over time is from the ongoing segmentation of our business, retaining more profitable accounts and getting better pricing on less profitable business, while walking away from opportunities when we judge profit margins to be too thin. At the same time, our financial results continue to benefit from efforts to diversify risks by product line and geography. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to maintain the 2020 combined ratio before catastrophe effects for a 2021 GAAP combined ratio in the low to mid-90% range. We also believe our 2021 property casualty growth rate can be 6% or more. We recognize that weather and significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some of the variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report. 
Turning to performance by operating unit. We work to earn new business by offering superior service, a focus on personal relationships and a commitment to helping agents attain success. Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 7% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 6% for the year. We believe our premium growth in each of our insurance segments included underwriting and pricing discipline. 
In 2020, we again managed our business to healthy levels of policy retention and with meaningful average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty segments. Policy retention rates for both commercial and personal lines were similar to a year ago, continuing near the high end of the mid-80% range. The combined ratio for our commercial line segment was 0.4 percentage points higher compared with the fourth quarter a year ago due to an increase of 3.8 points for the catastrophe loss ratio that included 2.3 points for the Nashville bombing. Net written premiums grew 3% for the quarter despite the fact that the pandemic continued to cause adverse economic effects. 
Our personal lines segment grew fourth quarter net written premiums by 5%. Our high net worth business continues to progress as planned and included $3 million in fourth quarter excess and surplus lines homeowners policies we began offering in early 2020. A combined ratio -- the combined ratio for personal lines was 18 percentage points better than the fourth quarter a year ago, including catastrophe losses that were 6.3 points better. 
Our excess and surplus lines segment again performed well, producing an 83.2% fourth quarter combined ratio and growing fourth quarter and full year net written premiums by 15%. 
Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global experienced strong growth in 2020, in excess of 25% on a full year basis. Conditions in markets where they operate improved during the year, and both businesses are well positioned for targeted profitable growth in 2021. While catastrophe and pandemic losses took a toll on both of those businesses, Cincinnati Re had an underwriting profit for the year. Cincinnati Global experienced an underwriting loss in 2020. But looking back since our acquisition, it's only about $3 million shy of an underwriting profit and is profitable if you consider its investment income. 
Our life insurance subsidiary continued its strong performance, with fourth quarter net income up 67% last year -- from last year, and non-GAAP operating income up 30%. Term life insurance earned premiums grew by 6%. 
Fourth quarter was again active regarding developments in the litigation landscape of pandemic-related business interruption claims. We continue to vigorously defend the lawsuits filed against the company that seek coverage for economic losses caused by the pandemic. Recent courts have granted several of our motions to dismiss based on lack of physical loss or damage to property, and plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed others. 
In Ohio, a federal court in the Northern District recently granted our request to certify a question to the Ohio Supreme Court. If accepted, the state Supreme Court will have an opportunity to settle the question under Ohio law of whether the presence of the coronavirus constitutes direct physical loss or damage to property, and thereby, answer the basic question underlying the majority of business interruption claims. 
In those cases that have produced -- that have preceded past initial motions, including North State deli case in North Carolina that is working its way through the appellate process, we continue to believe that business interruption coverage under our policy does not apply. We feel that courts ultimately should decide that economic loss alone without physical alteration of property does not constitute the direct physical loss or damage to property that is required to trigger coverage under a commercial property policy of insurance. We are confident in our legal strategy given our understanding of the law and decisions made in the majority of other BI court cases throughout the country to date. To the extent we have setbacks, we'll continue to pursue the judicial process. 
On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our per risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions for 2021 are fairly similar to 2020, except that they now exclude -- now include exclusions for communicable diseases such as viruses and cyber losses. Keep in mind that parts of these treaties include terms and conditions that cover multiple years. As a result, $114 million of coverage in effect for 2021 does not exclude communicable diseases or cyber losses. 
Rates for our casualty treaty rose in the mid-single-digit percent range, rates rose in the high single-digit percent range for our property treaties, and we expect 2021 seeded premiums for these casualty and property treaties to total -- in total to be approximately $103 million. 
I'll conclude my prepared remarks for now with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Our VCR was 11.7% for the fourth quarter of 2020, including 9.1 percentage points contributed by improved valuation of our investment portfolio. That brought our full year VCR to 14.7%. 
Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight other areas of financial results."

The fourth quarter of 2020 included very good investment performance. Investment income grew 2%, and full year 2020 growth at 4% matched 2019. Dividend income rose 7% for the fourth quarter. Net purchases for the equity portfolio during 2020 totaled $184 million. Interest income for our bond portfolio grew 2% on both a fourth quarter and full year basis. The pretax average yield was 4.11% for the fourth quarter, 1 basis point below the same period a year ago. The average pretax yield for purchase bonds during full year 2020 was 3.97% compared with 4.14% the prior year. We continue to invest in the fixed maturity portfolio with net purchases during the year totaling $291 million. Investment portfolio valuation changes for the fourth quarter of 2020 were again favorable for both our bond and stock portfolios. The overall net gain was just over $1.1 billion before tax effects, including $975 million for our equity portfolio and $149 million for our bond portfolio. We ended the quarter with total investment portfolio of net appreciated value of nearly $6 billion, including almost $5 billion in our equity portfolio. 
Strong cash flow again fueled investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the year 2020 generated nearly $1.5 billion, up 23% from a year ago. 
As always, we work at expense management while also making strategic business investments. Our full year 2020 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.3 percentage points lower than last year. 
During the fourth quarter and much of the year, the pandemic caused lower spending for several items such as business travel. As governmental restrictions ease, we continue to expect some of those expenses will return to levels fairly similar to 2019 as a ratio of earned premiums. Also, if future catastrophe losses are at levels closer to our historical average, agency profit-sharing ratios should return to a more usual level. 
Next, I'll comment on reserves for losses and loss expenses. First, our approach aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a satisfactory 2.8 ratio points for property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. We now have 32 consecutive years of net favorable reserve development. 
Full year 2020 favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 2.3 percentage points, about 1 point lower than the annual average during the past 3 years, but nearly matching the 2.5% ratio for 2017. On an all lines basis by accident year, net favorable reserve development for 2020 included $81 million for 2019, $56 million for 2018, $8 million for 2017. In aggregate, accident years prior to 2017 were unfavorable by $14 million. 
Each quarter, we consider new information and estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. As we obtain and study new data during the year, we update estimates as needed. While we've accrued no material amounts for pandemic-related losses from policies written by Cincinnati Insurance, we added $8 million during the fourth quarter to the reserve for legal expenses in defense of business interruption claims. We reviewed the original assumptions and made adjustments to reflect our experience, including extended motion practice, to respond to amended complaints and generally favorable litigation trends and decisions issued across the country in cases filed against the company and other insurance companies. We also added $3 million to loss reserves for Cincinnati Re and $2 million for Cincinnati Global. As previously disclosed, both have some exposure to affirmative coverage for pandemic-related business interruption. None of Cincinnati Global's policies have language that applies to the U.K. Supreme Court ruling in January on the FCA's business interruption insurance test case. 
Capital management continues to be an important matter to management and shareholders. The events of 2020 tested our financial strength and financial flexibility. We believe both remain strong as we enter 2021, and last year demonstrated the critical nature of our strong capital. 
I'll conclude my prepared remarks with the usual summary of fourth quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. 
Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.92. Life insurance operations increased book value by $0.08. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items added $0.56. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.72. Net investment gains and losses on the equity portfolio increased book value by $4.79, and we declared $0.60 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $6.47 per share during the fourth quarter to a record high $67.04 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

And then there was 3 -- just a little over $3 million for Cincinnati Re and then a little over $2 million for CGU, and those are the ones that have the affirmative coverage. So when you add all that up, the $8 million, $3 million, $2 million, it's about $13 million. So it's about 0.9% on the combined ratio. 
If you want, on a year-to-date basis, in total now for the legal defense, that was $30 million that we had reported. And then for Cinci Re, it was $19 million. For CGU, it was just under $12 million."

Every quarter, as we close the books, we've got to nail the reserves the best we can. So we do go through a process, a lot of folks that are involved in estimating.

There's just multiple factors that go into those estimates, and those estimates are redone each quarter. 
Of course, when you take a look at the Cincinnati Re side, the Cincinnati Global side, they're looking at the policies that they've written that have the affirmative coverage. They know which ones they have. And so they're monitoring those throughout the quarter and then looking at, I'll say, case basis reserves on those and making their best pick. So we are coming and reporting to the ultimate that we believe at the end of each quarter. So that's a great question. Hopefully, I answered the question."

At the same time, it feels like we're in this firming or firm or hard market, however you want to put the terminology around it. But your renewal pricing is up mid-single digits.

I would answer that with the fact that just we're in -- our industry is such a dynamic environment. And some of the classes of business or segments that you see that hit the headlines as far as the highest -- the firming market or hardening market would be maybe in larger D&O policies, larger excess casualty policies, commercial property that would be catastrophe exposed or cat exposed coastal, those are certainly hardening. And it just varies across industry segment and class. When you get into more, I'll call it, Main Street business, we're looking at every single risk on a case-by-case basis. We're trying to determine an adequate price for that business. And I'd say our field underwriters, our agents are working through each of those accounts, again, risk by risk and just doing a great job. We've continued to see the metrics of our pricing on new business, and renewals improve throughout the year. So I think that's part of it. 
Another part of it that I would say that we've gotten a lot of feedback from agencies and talked to enough of them that one of the phenomenons in the pandemic was just that fewer policyholders were going to market with their insurance. And it typically was around -- let's say, there was no pain with the incumbent carrier. They weren't getting a large rate increase. They didn't have prior loss ratio problems or challenges. And so they might just be sitting tight for the year. They've got other things to concern themselves with. So again, it really gets back to adequate pricing."

And so when we think about trends, we think about with everything that would affect loss costs, including what we're doing with loss control, underwriting, the segmentation of our book.

But the 2.3 points just overall is very similar to 2017 and actually 2014. And so last year was probably a little bit on the higher end of the range. This year, a little bit on the lower end. .
Thinking about it on a year-to-date basis where we added reserves, it was unfavorable, was commercial auto. That was up $17 million. That was mainly due to some large losses in 2016. So the incurreds were coming in a little bit higher. So we adjusted the ultimate looking back at that year. 
As it relates to -- we also added a little bit on Cinci Re and also on the surplus. So on the surplus on [indiscernible], that was 2016 and prior, primarily that was coming in. Cinci Re, that was a little bit more of a current accident year. 
Related to commercial casualty, workers' comp, that was actually -- we were just seeing favorable development across several years. And so when you take a look at that on a year-to-date basis, I'm going to say it was kind of evenly spread between accident year '19, '18, '17 and so forth. So just not one specific item that made that jump up with that favorable development, but over the various accident years. 
So as I said in my prepared comments, we follow a consistent approach, and we've got some of the great same professionals that are coming up with the ultimate reserve pick. So we'll follow their guidance. Great question."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
Everyone knows that this past year was full of challenges. We work closely with the independent agents who represent us to react quickly to changing needs of their clients as the pandemic progressed and to keep business flowing. The communities we serve saw an unusually high level of catastrophe activity. While no one likes to witness the pain and destruction these events bring, it is when our field claims representatives shine, delivering support with empathy and warmth. 
Our headquarter's associates remain focused on our key priorities, even though they've had to adapt to working at home, balancing family and business responsibilities in new ways. Despite those challenges, our associates and agents responded with determination and focus, helping us to produce the healthy financial performance we reported today. 
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 rose 68% compared with the fourth quarter a year ago, including increases in the fair value of our equity security portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income increased 29% or $59 million for the quarter despite higher catastrophe losses, reducing it by $19 million more than last year on an after-tax basis. 
Our 87.3% property casualty combined ratio was 4.3 percentage points better than a year ago, even with a catastrophe loss ratio that was 1.4 points worse. The current accident year loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe loss effects continued to improve and was 3.9 percentage points better than last year. Some of that is due to improving -- improved underwriting and some of it is attributable to the pandemic, such as fewer auto accidents resulting from reduced driving. 
We believe a major reason that our underwriting performance continues to improve over time is from the ongoing segmentation of our business, retaining more profitable accounts and getting better pricing on less profitable business, while walking away from opportunities when we judge profit margins to be too thin. At the same time, our financial results continue to benefit from efforts to diversify risks by product line and geography. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to maintain the 2020 combined ratio before catastrophe effects for a 2021 GAAP combined ratio in the low to mid-90% range. We also believe our 2021 property casualty growth rate can be 6% or more. We recognize that weather and significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some of the variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report. 
Turning to performance by operating unit. We work to earn new business by offering superior service, a focus on personal relationships and a commitment to helping agents attain success. Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 7% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 6% for the year. We believe our premium growth in each of our insurance segments included underwriting and pricing discipline. 
In 2020, we again managed our business to healthy levels of policy retention and with meaningful average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty segments. Policy retention rates for both commercial and personal lines were similar to a year ago, continuing near the high end of the mid-80% range. The combined ratio for our commercial line segment was 0.4 percentage points higher compared with the fourth quarter a year ago due to an increase of 3.8 points for the catastrophe loss ratio that included 2.3 points for the Nashville bombing. Net written premiums grew 3% for the quarter despite the fact that the pandemic continued to cause adverse economic effects. 
Our personal lines segment grew fourth quarter net written premiums by 5%. Our high net worth business continues to progress as planned and included $3 million in fourth quarter excess and surplus lines homeowners policies we began offering in early 2020. A combined ratio -- the combined ratio for personal lines was 18 percentage points better than the fourth quarter a year ago, including catastrophe losses that were 6.3 points better. 
Our excess and surplus lines segment again performed well, producing an 83.2% fourth quarter combined ratio and growing fourth quarter and full year net written premiums by 15%. 
Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global experienced strong growth in 2020, in excess of 25% on a full year basis. Conditions in markets where they operate improved during the year, and both businesses are well positioned for targeted profitable growth in 2021. While catastrophe and pandemic losses took a toll on both of those businesses, Cincinnati Re had an underwriting profit for the year. Cincinnati Global experienced an underwriting loss in 2020. But looking back since our acquisition, it's only about $3 million shy of an underwriting profit and is profitable if you consider its investment income. 
Our life insurance subsidiary continued its strong performance, with fourth quarter net income up 67% last year -- from last year, and non-GAAP operating income up 30%. Term life insurance earned premiums grew by 6%. 
Fourth quarter was again active regarding developments in the litigation landscape of pandemic-related business interruption claims. We continue to vigorously defend the lawsuits filed against the company that seek coverage for economic losses caused by the pandemic. Recent courts have granted several of our motions to dismiss based on lack of physical loss or damage to property, and plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed others. 
In Ohio, a federal court in the Northern District recently granted our request to certify a question to the Ohio Supreme Court. If accepted, the state Supreme Court will have an opportunity to settle the question under Ohio law of whether the presence of the coronavirus constitutes direct physical loss or damage to property, and thereby, answer the basic question underlying the majority of business interruption claims. 
In those cases that have produced -- that have preceded past initial motions, including North State Deli case in North Carolina that is working its way through the appellate process, we continue to believe that business interruption coverage under our policy does not apply. We feel that courts ultimately should decide that economic loss alone without physical alteration of property does not constitute the direct physical loss or damage to property that is required to trigger coverage under a commercial property policy of insurance. We are confident in our legal strategy given our understanding of the law and decisions made in the majority of other BI court cases throughout the country to date. To the extent we have setbacks, we'll continue to pursue the judicial process. 
On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our per risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions for 2021 are fairly similar to 2020, except that they now exclude -- now include exclusions for communicable diseases such as viruses and cyber losses. Keep in mind that parts of these treaties include terms and conditions that cover multiple years. As a result, $114 million of coverage in effect for 2021 does not exclude communicable diseases or cyber losses. 
Rates for our casualty treaty rose in the mid-single-digit percent range, rates rose in the high single-digit percent range for our property treaties, and we expect 2021 seeded premiums for these casualty and property treaties to total -- in total to be approximately $103 million. 
I'll conclude my prepared remarks for now with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Our VCR was 11.7% for the fourth quarter of 2020, including 9.1 percentage points contributed by improved valuation of our investment portfolio. That brought our full year VCR to 14.7%. 
Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight other areas of financial results."

The average pretax yield for purchase bonds during full year 2020 was 3.97% compared with 4.14% the prior year. We continue to invest in the fixed maturity portfolio with net purchases during the year totaling $291 million. Investment portfolio valuation changes for the fourth quarter of 2020 were again favorable for both our bond and stock portfolios. The overall net gain was just over $1.1 billion before tax effects, including $975 million for our equity portfolio and $149 million for our bond portfolio. We ended the quarter with total investment portfolio of net appreciated value of nearly $6 billion, including almost $5 billion in our equity portfolio. 
Strong cash flow again fueled investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the year 2020 generated nearly $1.5 billion, up 23% from a year ago. 
As always, we work at expense management while also making strategic business investments. Our full year 2020 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.3 percentage points lower than last year. 
During the fourth quarter and much of the year, the pandemic caused lower spending for several items such as business travel. As governmental restrictions ease, we continue to expect some of those expenses will return to levels fairly similar to 2019 as a ratio of earned premiums. Also, if future catastrophe losses are at levels closer to our historical average, agency profit-sharing ratios should return to a more usual level. 
Next, I'll comment on reserves for losses and loss expenses. First, our approach aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a satisfactory 2.8 ratio points for property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. We now have 32 consecutive years of net favorable reserve development. 
Full year 2020 favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 2.3 percentage points, about 1 point lower than the annual average during the past 3 years, but nearly matching the 2.5% ratio for 2017. On an all lines basis by accident year, net favorable reserve development for 2020 included $81 million for 2019, $56 million for 2018, $8 million for 2017. In aggregate, accident years prior to 2017 were unfavorable by $14 million. 
Each quarter, we consider new information and estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. As we obtain and study new data during the year, we update estimates as needed. While we've accrued no material amounts for pandemic-related losses from policies written by Cincinnati Insurance, we added $8 million during the fourth quarter to the reserve for legal expenses in defense of business interruption claims. We reviewed the original assumptions and made adjustments to reflect our experience, including an extended motion practice to respond to amended complaints and generally favorable litigation trends and decisions issued across the country in cases filed against the company and other insurance companies. We also added $3 million to loss reserves for Cincinnati Re and $2 million for Cincinnati Global. As previously disclosed, both have some exposure to affirmative coverage for pandemic-related business interruption. None of Cincinnati Global's policies have language that applies to the U.K. Supreme Court ruling in January on the FCA's business interruption insurance test case. 
Capital management continues to be an important matter to management and shareholders. The events of 2020 tested our financial strength and financial flexibility. We believe both remain strong as we enter 2021, and last year demonstrated the critical nature of our strong capital. 
I'll conclude my prepared remarks with the usual summary of fourth quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. 
Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.92. Life insurance operations increased book value by $0.08. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items added $0.56. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.72. Net investment gains and losses on the equity portfolio increased book value by $4.79, and we declared $0.60 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $6.47 per share during the fourth quarter to a record high $67.04 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

There's just multiple factors that go into those estimates, and those estimates are redone each quarter. 
Of course, when you take a look at the Cincinnati Re side, the Cincinnati Global side, they're looking at the policies that they've written that have the affirmative coverage. They know which ones they have. And so they're monitoring those throughout the quarter and then looking at, I'll say, case basis reserves on those and making their best pick. So we are coming and reporting to the ultimate that we believe at the end of each quarter. So that's a great question. Hopefully, I answered the question."

At the same time, it feels like we're in this firming or firm or hard market, however you want to put the terminology around it. But your renewal pricing is up mid-single digits.

I would answer that with the fact that just we're in -- our industry is in such a dynamic environment. And some of the classes of business or segments that you see that hit the headlines as far as the highest -- the firming market or hardening market would be maybe in larger D&O policies, larger excess casualty policies, commercial property that would be catastrophe-exposed or cat-exposed coastal, those are certainly hardening. And it just varies across industry segment and class. When you get into more, I'll call it, Main Street business, we're looking at every single risk on a case-by-case basis. We're trying to determine an adequate price for that business. And I'd say our field underwriters, our agents are working through each of those accounts, again, risk by risk and just doing a great job. We've continued to see the metrics of our pricing on new business, and renewals improve throughout the year. So I think that's part of it. 
Another part of it that I would say that we've gotten a lot of feedback from agencies and talked to enough of them that one of the phenomenons in the pandemic was just that fewer policyholders were going to market with their insurance. And it typically was around -- let's say, there was no pain with the incumbent carrier. They weren't getting a large rate increase. They didn't have prior loss ratio problems or challenges. And so they might just be sitting tight for the year. They've got other things to concern themselves with. So again, it really gets back to adequate pricing."

So overall, for the year, 2.3 points, overall, that was a little bit on the -- probably, I'll say, the lower side. We've been running, I'll say, 3 to 5 points in any given year. But the 2.3 points just overall is very similar to 2017 and actually 2014. And so last year was probably a little bit on the higher end of the range. This year, a little bit on the lower end. .
Thinking about it on a year-to-date basis where we added reserves, it was unfavorable, was commercial auto. That was up $17 million. That was mainly due to some large losses in 2016. So the incurreds were coming in a little bit higher. So we adjusted the ultimate looking back at that year. 
As it relates to -- we also added a little bit on Cinci Re and also on the surplus. So on the surplus on the E&S, that was 2016 and prior, primarily that was coming in. Cinci Re, that was a little bit more of a current accident year. 
Related to commercial casualty, workers' comp, that was actually -- we were just seeing favorable development across several years. And so when you take a look at that on a year-to-date basis, I'm going to say it was kind of evenly spread between accident year '19, '18, '17 and so forth. So just not one specific item that made that jump up with that favorable development, but over the various accident years. 
So as I said in my prepared comments, we follow a consistent approach, and we've got some of the great same professionals that are coming up with the ultimate reserve pick. So we'll follow their guidance. Great question. Thank you."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. We were pleased with operating performance, and believe it reflects our proven strategy and careful execution as we seek to continue growing",693,"Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. We were pleased with operating performance, and believe it reflects our proven strategy and careful execution as we seek to continue growing profitably over the long term. Net income for the first quarter of 2021 rose by $1.8 billion compared with the first quarter a year ago, and included increases in the fair value of our equity security portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income was up $85 million or 62% for the quarter despite higher catastrophe losses, reducing it on an after-tax basis by $21 million more than last year. Our 91.2% property casualty combined ratio was 7.3 percentage points better than a year ago, with elevated catastrophe losses this year, causing an increase of 1.3 points. 
The current accident year loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe loss effects continued to improve and was 2.3 percentage points better than the same quarter a year ago. Our results continue to benefit from efforts to diversify risks by product line and geography, and likewise, from segmentation of risks as we underwrite and price policies. While economic effects of the pandemic and pricing discipline continued to slow commercial lines new business premium growth, we believe we are growing our business profitably, and our relationships with the independent agents who represent us are as strong as ever. 
Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 12% in the first quarter of 2021, and we continue to see various indicators of good pricing and underwriting discipline. Renewal pricing during the first quarter continued to be ahead of our estimate for prospective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment. Our commercial and personal lines insurance segments again experienced mid single-digit percent range estimated average price increases, while the excess and surplus lines insurance segment improved to the high single-digit range. The combined ratio for our commercial lines segment improved by 17.1 percentage points compared with the first quarter a year ago, and we grew net written premiums by 5% with an ongoing emphasis on pricing segmentation on a policy-by-policy basis. 
Our personal lines segment grew first quarter net written premiums by 6%, with the high net worth portion of this segment continuing to progress as planned. The combined ratio for personal lines was 6.8 percentage points higher than the first quarter a year ago, with underlying improved performance offset by catastrophe losses that were 9.1 points higher. Our excess and surplus lines segment produced a 92% combined ratio and grew net written premiums by 16%. Cincinnati Re contributed to roughly half of our net written premium growth in the first quarter by taking advantage of improved pricing in the reinsurance market, growing its premiums by $91 million. Losses from winter freeze events hurt its results and caused a modest underwriting loss. 
Cincinnati Global produced another nice underwriting profit and grew its net written premiums by 11%. Our life insurance subsidiary reported first quarter net income at a satisfactory level and grew term life insurance earned premium by 9%. 
Before I close my prepared remarks, I'd like to mention 1 important update with respect to business interruption claims litigation. Earlier this month, the Ohio Supreme Court agreed to answer the question, certified to it by the Federal District Court. That is, does the general presence in the community were on surfaces at a premises of the novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 constitute direct physical loss or damage to property. Or does the presence on a premises of a person infected with COVID-19 constitute direct physical loss or damage to property at that premises. We appreciate the court's decision to hear our case. We believe resolving these questions of law at the state level will create a more efficient judicial process throughout Ohio, benefiting all parties involved. 
I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Our BCR was 4.1% for the first quarter of 2021, including 2.2 percentage points contributed by improved valuation of our investment portfolio. 
Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will add his comments regarding other important areas of our financial results."

Our first quarter 2021 investment performance was quite good as investment income grew 5%.

Our first quarter 2021 investment performance was quite good as investment income grew 5%. Dividend income rose 9% for the first quarter, and net purchases for the equity portfolio totaled $13 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio grew 5% compared with the same quarter a year ago. The pretax average yield was 4.14%, up 10 basis points from the first quarter of last year. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the first quarter was 3.71%. We continue to invest in the fixed maturity portfolio with net purchases during the first 3 months of the year, totaling $137 million. Investment portfolio valuation changes for the first quarter of 2021 were favorable for our stock portfolio, but unfavorable for our bond portfolio. The overall net gain was $308 million before tax effects, including $491 million for our equity portfolio, offsetting a decrease of $193 million for our bond portfolio. We ended the quarter with total investment portfolio net appreciated value of approximately $6.3 billion including $5.4 billion in our equity portfolio. 
Cash flow continues to help boost investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 3 months of 2021 was very strong and generated $354 million, up 112% from a year ago. Expense management is always an important matter, and we aim to balance strategic business investments with expense controls. The first quarter 2021 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 3.0 percentage points lower than last year's first quarter. The pandemic continued to cause lower spending for several items such as business travel. We expect some of those expenses could return to a more normal rate in future quarters as restrictions lift and people feel more comfortable meeting in person. 
In terms of loss reserves, our consistent approach aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the first quarter of 2021, we experienced a fair amount of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. The combined ratio effect was 7.4 percentage points for the quarter, were $110 million, and was higher than a typical quarter. Each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. As we obtain and study new data during the year, we update estimates as needed. Our workers' compensation line of business, which represents 15% of our total gross property casualty loss and loss expense reserves at just over $1 billion at the end of the quarter, had the largest amount of first quarter favorable net reserve development. This line has the longest tail as claims can remain open for many years. While the amount of reserves released for any given accident year was relatively small, the aggregate amount was $25 million. On an all lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 3 months of the year was favorable by $82 million for 2020, $16 million for 2019 and $12 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2019. Regarding capital management, we continue to approach consistent with the past. We believe that our financial strength and financial flexibility were in excellent shape at the end of the quarter. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 284,000 shares at an average price per share of $100.48. 
As I always do, I'll end my prepared remarks with a summary of the first quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property Casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.65. Life insurance operations increased book value by $0.06. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items added $0.57. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $0.94. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $2.41, and we declared $0.63 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $2.12 per share during the first quarter to a record high $69.16 per share. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

And if we can hit the hurdle rate and if it can be diversified the way we want it to be, then we want them to grow. It will -- if things would turn and go in the other direction, that's an area where it could turn and go in the other direction in terms of writings if the market would turn. But in this quarter, really, across the board, Cincinnati Re had opportunity to take advantage of firming prices and improving terms and conditions and to grow the way they did.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. We were pleased with operating performance, and believe it reflects our proven strategy and careful execution as we seek to continue growing",693,"Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. We were pleased with operating performance, and believe it reflects our proven strategy and careful execution as we seek to continue growing profitably over the long term. Net income for the first quarter of 2021 rose by $1.8 billion compared with the first quarter a year ago, and included increases in the fair value of our equity security portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income was up $85 million or 62% for the quarter despite higher catastrophe losses, reducing it on an after-tax basis by $21 million more than last year. Our 91.2% property casualty combined ratio was 7.3 percentage points better than a year ago, with elevated catastrophe losses this year, causing an increase of 1.3 points.
The current accident year loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe loss effects continued to improve and was 2.3 percentage points better than the same quarter a year ago. Our results continue to benefit from efforts to diversify risks by product line and geography, and likewise, from segmentation of risks as we underwrite and price policies. While economic effects of the pandemic and pricing discipline continued to slow commercial lines new business premium growth, we believe we are growing our business profitably, and our relationships with the independent agents who represent us are as strong as ever.
Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 12% in the first quarter of 2021, and we continue to see various indicators of good pricing and underwriting discipline. Renewal pricing during the first quarter continued to be ahead of our estimate for prospective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment. Our commercial and personal lines insurance segments again experienced mid single-digit percent range estimated average price increases, while the excess and surplus lines insurance segment improved to the high single-digit range.
The combined ratio for our commercial lines segment improved by 17.1 percentage points compared with the first quarter a year ago, and we grew net written premiums by 5% with an ongoing emphasis on pricing segmentation on a policy-by-policy basis.
Our personal lines segment grew first quarter net written premiums by 6%, with the high net worth portion of this segment continuing to progress as planned. The combined ratio for personal lines was 6.8 percentage points higher than the first quarter a year ago, with underlying improved performance offset by catastrophe losses that were 9.1 points higher.
Our excess and surplus lines segment produced a 92% combined ratio and grew net written premiums by 16%. Cincinnati Re contributed to roughly half of our net written premium growth in the first quarter by taking advantage of improved pricing in the reinsurance market, growing its premiums by $91 million. Losses from winter freeze events hurt its results and caused a modest underwriting loss.
Cincinnati Global produced another nice underwriting profit and grew its net written premiums by 11%. Our life insurance subsidiary reported first quarter net income at a satisfactory level and grew term life insurance earned premium by 9%.
Before I close my prepared remarks, I'd like to mention 1 important update with respect to business interruption claims litigation. Earlier this month, the Ohio Supreme Court agreed to answer the question certified to it by the Federal District Court. That is, does the general presence in the community or on surfaces at a premises of the novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 constitute direct physical loss or damage to property? Or does the presence on a premises of a person infected with COVID-19 constitute direct physical loss or damage to property at that premises? We appreciate the court's decision to hear our case. We believe resolving these questions of law at the state level will create a more efficient judicial process throughout Ohio, benefiting all parties involved.
I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Our VCR was 4.1% for the first quarter of 2021, including 2.2 percentage points contributed by improved valuation of our investment portfolio.
Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will add his comments regarding other important areas of our financial results."
260681,710499632,2262739,"Cincinnati Financial Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our first quarter 2021 investment performance was quite good as investment income grew 5%, dividend income rose 9% for the first quarter, and net purchases for the equity portfolio totaled $",709,"Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our first quarter 2021 investment performance was quite good as investment income grew 5%, dividend income rose 9% for the first quarter, and net purchases for the equity portfolio totaled $13 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio grew 5% compared with the same quarter a year ago. The pretax average yield was 4.14%, up 10 basis points from the first quarter of last year.
The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the first quarter was 3.71%. We continue to invest in the fixed maturity portfolio with net purchases during the first 3 months of the year totaling $137 million. Investment portfolio valuation changes for the first quarter of 2021 were favorable for our stock portfolio, but unfavorable for our bond portfolio. The overall net gain was $308 million before tax effects, including $491 million for our equity portfolio, offsetting a decrease of $193 million for our bond portfolio. We ended the quarter with total investment portfolio net appreciated value of approximately $6.3 billion including $5.4 billion in our equity portfolio.
Cash flow continues to help boost investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 3 months of 2021 was very strong and generated $354 million, up 112% from a year ago. Expense management is always an important matter and we aim to balance strategic business investments with expense controls. The first quarter 2021 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 3.0 percentage points lower than last year's first quarter. The pandemic continued to cause lower spending for several items such as business travel. We expect some of those expenses could return to a more normal rate in future quarters as restrictions lift and people feel more comfortable meeting in person.
In terms of loss reserves, our consistent approach aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the first quarter of 2021, we experienced a fair amount of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. The combined ratio effect was 7.4 percentage points for the quarter, or $110 million, and was higher than a typical quarter.
Each quarter we consider new information, such as paid losses, and estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. As we obtain and study new data during the year, we update estimates as needed.
Our workers' compensation line of business, which represents 15% of our total gross property casualty loss and loss expense reserves at just over $1 billion at the end of the quarter, had the largest amount of first quarter favorable net reserve development. This line has the longest tail as claims can remain open for many years. While the amount of reserves released for any given accident year was relatively small, the aggregate amount was $25 million.
On an all lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 3 months of the year was favorable by $82 million for 2020, $16 million for 2019 and $12 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2019.
Regarding capital management, we continue to approach consistent with the past. We believe that our financial strength and financial flexibility were in excellent shape at the end of the quarter. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 284,000 shares at an average price per share of $100.48.
As I always do, I'll end my prepared remarks with a summary of the first quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.65. Life insurance operations increased book value by $0.06. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items added $0.57. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $0.94. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $2.41, and we declared $0.63 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $2.12 per share during the first quarter to a record high $69.16 per share.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

When you also look at CGU, there was -- it was really concentrated around 3 items. The first one was Delta, that was in 2020, that was about a $5 million favorable adjustment. Sally, that was also in 2020, that was a $3 million adjustment. And then I think it was the previous year, there was the Australia wildfire, and that was $2 million.

We had another quarter of strong operating performance as we remain focused on steady progress towards profitably growing our insurance business over time. Financial results benefited from several areas, including excellent investment management and ongoing efforts to continually improve insurance operations. 
Net income for the second quarter of 2021 decreased by $206 million compared with the second quarter of last year, primarily due to $439 million less benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio. Equity portfolio fair value changes caused significant earnings volatility for several quarters since early 2020. And net income for the first 6 months of 2021 increased by $1.6 billion from a year ago. 
Non-GAAP operating income was up $221 million or 311% for the quarter, with lower catastrophe losses on an after-tax basis, contributing $136 million of the increase. Our 85.5% property casualty combined ratio was 17.6 percentage points better than a year ago, with decreased catastrophe losses in the second quarter representing 12.6 points of the improvement. 
The current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe loss effects also continued to improve and was 2.0 percentage points better than last year for the second quarter and 3.5 points better on a 6-month basis. Our underwriters emphasize segmentation of risks, working to retain more profitable accounts and obtaining better pricing on business that we identify as less profitable. At the same time, we are diversifying risks by product line and geography while excellent service from our claims operation also helps grow our business. 
Premiums grew at an impressive rate for the second quarter in a row, reflecting expertise and focus by our associates and great production by the premier independent agents who represent Cincinnati Insurance. 
Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 10% in the second quarter of 2021. We continue to believe we are growing profitably by combining data and judgment as we underwrite and price business. We also recognize the importance of remaining disciplined and walking away from opportunities when we determine pricing is inadequate. 
Renewal pricing in the second quarter continued to be ahead of our estimate for prospective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment. our commercial and personal lines insurance segments, again experienced mid-single-digit percentage range estimated average price increases, while the excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range. 
Each insurance segment grew its business and produced improved profit compared with the second quarter a year ago. Our commercial lines segment had superb results with its 84.2% combined ratio improving by 14.9 percentage points compared with the second quarter a year ago and growing net written premiums by 8%.  
For our personal lines segment, second quarter net written premiums grew 4%, continuing to benefit from planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its combined ratio of 92.7% also improved significantly, down 19.6 percentage points from the second quarter a year ago. 
Our excess and surplus line segment produced a combined ratio below 90%, while also growing net written premiums by an impressive 26% and posting favorable reserve development on prior accident years for the third time in the past 4 quarters. 
Cincinnati Re continued its strong diversified and profitable growth as net written premiums grew 62% in the second quarter, with an excellent combined ratio of nearly 80%. Its seasoned, talented team, is taking advantage of firmer reinsurance pricing, while at the same time, maintaining underwriting discipline as they typically decline 3 out of 4 opportunities to write new reinsurance contracts among hundreds that they are routinely submitted in a quarter. 
Cincinnati Global again produced a fine underwriting profit with an exceptional loss and loss expense ratio as favorable reserve development on prior accident year catastrophes offset most of its other losses. Its net written premiums decreased a little as underwriters have been reducing catastrophe loss risk while growing some newer lines of business. 
Our life insurance subsidiary had another good quarter, reporting second quarter net income up 17% from a year ago and growing life insurance earned premiums by 2%. 
I'll conclude with the value-creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Strong operating results and favorable securities markets produced an excellent VCR at 7.3% for the second quarter and 11.6% for the first half of the year. The contribution from operations measured as net income before investment gains was 4.8% for the first 6 months of 2021, up 2.7 percentage points from a year ago. 
Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on a few other important areas of our financial performance."
260681,1673267489,2354318,"Cincinnati Financial Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and thanks for all of you joining us today.

Our investment portfolio continued to perform very well during the second quarter of 2021, including investment income growth of 5%. Dividend income was up 13% for the second quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago. 
For the first half of the year, net purchases for the equity portfolio totaled $42 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio grew 3% and the pretax average yield was 4.02%, down 9 basis points from the second quarter a year ago. The yield on a 6-month basis matched last year's first half. 
The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the second quarter of 2021 was 3.33%. Investing in the fixed maturity portfolio continues to be a priority, with net purchases during the first 6 months of the year totaling $465 million. Investment portfolio valuation changes for the second quarter of 2021 were favorable for both our stock portfolio and our bond portfolio. The overall net gain was $652 million before tax effects, including $489 million for our equity portfolio and $141 million for our bond portfolio. 
At the end of the second quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.9 billion, including $5.9 billion in our equity portfolio. 
We had another quarter of strong cash flow, again, contributing to investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 6 months of 2021 generated $917 million, up 49% from a year ago. Expense management is always an important matter as we work to achieve a good balance between strategic business investments and expense controls. 
The second quarter of 2021 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.6 percentage points lower than last year's second quarter which included a stay-at-home policyholder credit for personal auto policies and higher credit losses due to uncollectible premiums. The second quarter ratio was higher than the first quarter of this year, largely due to higher accruals related to profit sharing in the second quarter and lower expenses in the first quarter that benefited from less business travel. 
Next, I'll highlight a few items regarding loss reserves and reinsurance. Our approach to reserving remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the second quarter of 2021, we experienced $119 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. The combined ratio effect was 7.8% for the quarter. 
As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. Based on our study of new data during the year, we update estimates as needed. Together, our workers' compensation and commercial casualty lines of business represent about half of our $7 billion quarter-end total gross property casualty loss and loss expense reserves and they had the largest amounts of second quarter favorable net reserve development. 
Workers' compensation has the longest tail as claims can remain open for many years. While the amount of reserve release for any given accident year was relatively small, the aggregate amount was $27 million. Commercial casualty paid loss development by accident year over time is an important factor in estimating ultimate losses. Calendar year basis data is not as useful. 
For example, while the second quarter 2021 paid loss total for commercial casualty was higher than a year ago, for the first 6 months of 2021, it was 15% less than what we saw prior to the pandemic in the first half of 2019 despite earned premiums that were 13% higher in 2021. 
Net favorable reserve development during the second quarter was concentrated in the 4 most recent accident years, including a little more than 2/3 for accident years 2017 through 2019. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first half of the year was favorable by $170 million for 2020, $26 million for 2019, $15 million for 2018 and $18 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2018. Nearly 80% of of the 2020 amount was for property or auto lines of business, which have a much shorter tail than workers' compensation or commercial casualty. 
Regarding reinsurance, we disclosed in our 10-Q that we nonrenewed our combined property catastrophe occurrence excess of loss treaty that provided up to $50 million of coverage for business written on a direct basis and by Cincinnati Re. And we restructured the reinsurance program in place for Cincinnati Re only that provides property catastrophe excess of loss coverage now with a total available aggregate limit of $48 million. 
Another reinsurance detail we disclosed pertain to cyber insurance that we offer as an affirmative coverage option on various policies. Some recent industry reports indicate that on a direct written basis -- premium basis, Cincinnati insurance is among the 20 largest insurers in the U.S. Premiums for those policies are ceded to a reinsurer, therefore transferring substantially all of that risk. 
I'll briefly comment on capital management. Our approach remains consistent, and we ended the quarter with outstanding financial strength and financial flexibility. In typical fashion, I'll wrap up my prepared remarks [Technical Difficulty] our value-creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $1.08. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.07. Investment income other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items added $0.80. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.69. 
Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $2.40. And we declared $0.63 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $4.41 per share during the second quarter to a record high $73.57 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

We had another quarter of strong operating performance as we remain focused on steady progress towards profitably growing our insurance business over time. Financial results benefited from several areas, including excellent investment management and ongoing efforts to continually improve insurance operations.
Net income for the second quarter of 2021 decreased by $206 million compared with the second quarter of last year, primarily due to $439 million less benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio. Equity portfolio fair value changes caused significant earnings volatility for several quarters since early 2020. And net income for the first 6 months of 2021 increased by $1.6 billion from a year ago.
Non-GAAP operating income was up $221 million or 311% for the quarter, with lower catastrophe losses on an after-tax basis, contributing $136 million of the increase. Our 85.5% property casualty combined ratio was 17.6 percentage points better than a year ago, with decreased catastrophe losses in the second quarter representing 12.6 points of the improvement.
The current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe loss effects also continued to improve and was 2.0 percentage points better than last year for the second quarter and 3.5 points better on a 6-month basis. Our underwriters emphasize segmentation of risks, working to retain more profitable accounts and obtaining better pricing on business that we identify as less profitable. At the same time, we are diversifying risks by product line and geography while excellent service from our claims operation also helps grow our business.
Premiums grew at an impressive rate for the second quarter in a row, reflecting expertise and focus by our associates and great production by the premier independent agents who represent Cincinnati Insurance.
Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 10% in the second quarter of 2021. We continue to believe we are growing profitably by combining data and judgment as we underwrite and price business. We also recognize the importance of remaining disciplined and walking away from opportunities when we determine pricing is inadequate.
Renewal pricing during the second quarter continued to be ahead of our estimate for prospective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment. Our commercial and personal lines insurance segments, again experienced mid-single-digit percentage range estimated average price increases, while the excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range.
Each insurance segment grew its business and produced improved profit compared with the second quarter a year ago. Our commercial lines segment had superb results with its 84.2% combined ratio improving by 14.9 percentage points compared with the second quarter a year ago and growing net written premiums by 8%.
For our personal lines segment, second quarter net written premiums grew 4%, continuing to benefit from planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its combined ratio of 92.7% also improved significantly, down 19.6 percentage points from the second quarter a year ago.
Our excess and surplus line segment produced a combined ratio below 90%, while also growing net written premiums by an impressive 26% and posting favorable reserve development on prior accident years for the third time in the past 4 quarters.
Cincinnati Re continued its strong, diversified and profitable growth as net written premiums grew 62% in the second quarter, with an excellent combined ratio of nearly 80%. Its seasoned, talented team, is taking advantage of firmer reinsurance pricing, while at the same time, maintaining underwriting discipline as they typically decline 3 out of 4 opportunities to write new reinsurance contracts among hundreds that they are routinely submitted in a quarter.
Cincinnati Global again produced a fine underwriting profit with an exceptional loss and loss expense ratio as favorable reserve development on prior accident year catastrophes offset most of its other losses. Its net written premiums decreased a little as underwriters have been reducing catastrophe loss risk while growing some newer lines of business.
Our life insurance subsidiary had another good quarter, reporting second quarter net income up 17% from a year ago and growing life insurance earned premiums by 2%.
I'll conclude with the value-creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Strong operating results and favorable securities markets produced an excellent VCR at 7.3% for the second quarter and 11.6% for the first half of the year. The contribution from operations measured as net income before investment gains was 4.8% for the first 6 months of 2021, up 2.7 percentage points from a year ago.
Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on a few other important areas of our financial performance."
260681,1673267489,2354404,"Cincinnati Financial Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and thanks for all of you joining us today.

Our investment portfolio continued to perform very well during the second quarter of 2021, including investment income growth of 5%. Dividend income was up 13% for the second quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago.
For the first half of the year, net purchases for the equity portfolio totaled $42 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio grew 3% and the pretax average yield was 4.02%, down 9 basis points from the second quarter a year ago. The yield on a 6-month basis matched last year's first half.
The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the second quarter of 2021 was 3.33%. Investing in the fixed maturity portfolio continues to be a priority, with net purchases during the first 6 months of the year totaling $465 million. Investment portfolio valuation changes for the second quarter of 2021 were favorable for both our stock portfolio and our bond portfolio. The overall net gain was $652 million before tax effects, including $489 million for our equity portfolio and $141 million for our bond portfolio.
At the end of the second quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.9 billion, including $5.9 billion in our equity portfolio. We had another quarter of strong cash flow, again, contributing to investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 6 months of 2021 generated $917 million, up 49% from a year ago. Expense management is always an important matter as we work to achieve a good balance between strategic business investments and expense controls.
The second quarter of 2021 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.6 percentage points lower than last year's second quarter which included a stay-at-home policyholder credit for personal auto policies and higher credit losses due to uncollectible premiums. The second quarter ratio was higher than the first quarter of this year, largely due to higher accruals related to profit sharing in the second quarter and lower expenses in the first quarter that benefited from less business travel.
Next, I'll highlight a few items regarding loss reserves and reinsurance. Our approach to reserving remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the second quarter of 2021, we experienced $119 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. The combined ratio effect was 7.8% for the quarter.
As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. Based on our study of new data during the year, we update estimates as needed. Together, our workers' compensation and commercial casualty lines of business represent about half of our $7 billion quarter-end total gross property casualty loss and loss expense reserves and they had the largest amounts of second quarter favorable net reserve development.
Workers' compensation has the longest tail as claims can remain open for many years. While the amount of reserve release for any given accident year was relatively small, the aggregate amount was $27 million. Commercial casualty paid loss development by accident year over time is an important factor in estimating ultimate losses. Calendar year basis data is not as useful. For example, while the second quarter 2021 paid loss total for commercial casualty was higher than a year ago, for the first 6 months of 2021, it was 15% less than what we saw prior to the pandemic in the first half of 2019 despite earned premiums that were 13% higher in 2021.
Net favorable reserve development during the second quarter was concentrated in the 4 most recent accident years, including a little more than 2/3 for accident years 2017 through 2019. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first half of the year was favorable by $170 million for 2020, $26 million for 2019, $15 million for 2018 and $18 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2018. Nearly 80% of the 2020 amount was for property or auto lines of business, which have a much shorter tail than workers' compensation or commercial casualty.
Regarding reinsurance, we disclosed in our 10-Q that we nonrenewed our combined property catastrophe occurrence excess of loss treaty that provided up to $50 million of coverage for business written on a direct basis and by Cincinnati Re. And we restructured the reinsurance program in place for Cincinnati Re only that provides property catastrophe excess of loss coverage now with a total available aggregate limit of $48 million.
Another reinsurance detail we disclosed pertain to cyber insurance that we offer as an affirmative coverage option on various policies. Some recent industry reports indicate that on a direct written basis -- premium basis, Cincinnati insurance is among the 20 largest cyber insurers in the U.S. Premiums for those policies are ceded to a reinsurer, therefore transferring substantially all of that risk.
I'll briefly comment on capital management. Our approach remains consistent, and we ended the quarter with outstanding financial strength and financial flexibility.
In typical fashion, I'll wrap up my prepared remarks [Technical Difficulty] of our value-creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $1.08. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.07. Investment income other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items added $0.80. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.69.
Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $2.40. And we declared $0.63 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $4.41 per share during the second quarter to a record high $73.57 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. Overall, it was another good quarter. While weather-related catastrophes were lower than a year ago, communities across our country were impacted by hail, wind, flooding and fire. As we send our field claims associates into these communities, they shine, providing excellent service in reassuring affected families and businesses. 
Net income for the third quarter of 2021 fell $331 million compared with the third quarter of last year due to $457 million less benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio. Equity portfolio fair value changes have caused significant earnings volatility for several quarters recently, and net income increased $1.3 billion for the first 9 months of 2021 compared with a year ago, despite the third quarter decrease. 
Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter of 2021 more than tripled, up $146 million or 232% versus a year ago, with lower catastrophe losses on an after-tax basis contributing $31 million of the increase. Our 92.6% third quarter 2021 property casualty combined ratio was 11 percentage points better than last year with decreased catastrophe losses this year, representing 4.1 points of the improvement. Our current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe loss effects also continued to improve and was 2.5 percentage points better than the first 9 months of 2020. 
Premium growth continued at a nice pace during the quarter as a strengthening economy and great relationships we enjoy with our agents helped us grow ahead of industry estimates. Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 10% in the third quarter of 2021. We continue to focus on risk segmentation, giving our underwriters the tools they need to retain and write more profitable accounts while walking away from opportunities when we determine pricing is inadequate. 
Renewal pricing during the third quarter continued to be ahead of our estimate for prospective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment. Our commercial lines insurance segment again experienced mid-single-digit percentage range estimated average renewal price increases, down slightly from the second quarter. Our third quarter personal lines segment average renewal price increases slowed a little compared with the second quarter, including personal auto in the low single-digit range, while the excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range. 
Our commercial lines segment had an outstanding quarter with this 80.6% combined ratio improving by 21.8 percentage points compared with the third quarter a year ago and growing net written premiums by 10%. For our personal lines segment, third quarter net written premiums grew 7% as it continued to benefit from planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its third quarter 2021 combined ratio was higher than a year ago, largely due to driving patterns moving towards pre-pandemic levels, increasing our personal auto loss ratio. Personal auto still produced a small underwriting profit for the third quarter and for the first 9 months of 2021, our personal lines segment in total had an underwriting profit. Our excess and surplus line segment produced a sub-95% combined ratio for the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year and grew third quarter net written premiums by 30%. 
The Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global each grew net written premiums in the third quarter of 2021. While both experienced significant losses from Hurricane Ida leading to underwriting losses for the quarter, we weren't surprised by the level of loss we saw for an event of this magnitude based on our models. Our life insurance subsidiary produced third quarter 2021 net income of $11 million and grew term life insurance earned premiums by 8%. 
I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Strong operating results measured as net income before investment gains were the largest component of our VCR for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. VCR through September 30, 2021, was 12.4%, already reaching our annual average target range of 10% to 13%. 
Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will add perspective on some other areas of our financial performance."

Investment income grew nicely during the third quarter of 2021, up 7% compared with the same period a year ago. Third quarter dividend income was up 11%, and net purchases for the equity portfolio totaled $153 million for the first 9 months of the year. 
Interest income from our bond portfolio grew 7%, and the pretax average yield was 4.06%, up 3 basis points from the third quarter a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the third quarter of 2021 was 3.43%. 
Investing in the fixed maturity portfolio continues to be a priority with net purchases during the first 9 months of the year totaling $694 million. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the third quarter of 2021 were modestly unfavorable for both our stock and bond portfolios. The overall third quarter net loss was $158 million before tax effects, including $105 million for our equity holdings and $80 million for our bond holdings. At the end of the third quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.7 billion, including $5.8 billion for our equity securities. 
Cash flow was very strong in the third quarter, as it has been all year. It contributes to investment income and was a major factor in the 7% increase in interest income we reported for the third quarter. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 9 months of 2021 generated $1.5 billion, a 36% increase compared with a year ago period. 
Expense management is another area we focus, always trying to optimize the balance of strategic business investments and expense controls. The third quarter 2021 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.9 percentage points higher than last year's third quarter, including 1.2 points due to higher accruals for profit sharing commissions for agencies. 
Moving on to loss reserves. Our approach to reserving remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. 
During the third quarter of 2021, we experienced $102 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. It favorably contributed to the combined ratio by 6.4% for the quarter. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 9 months of the year was favorable by $225 million for 2020, $46 million for 2019, $39 million for 2018 and $21 million in aggregate for all accident years prior to 2018. 
Regarding capital management, we also follow a consistent approach, including share repurchases as part of a maintenance intended to offset issuance of shares through equity compensation plans. We believe that our quarter end financial strength was in good shape and provides plenty of financial flexibility. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 100,000 shares at an average price per share of $119.3. 
I'll conclude my prepared remarks as I typically do, with a summary of third quarter contributions to the book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.59. Life insurance operations increased book value by $0.05. Investment income other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items added $0.81. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $0.39. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $0.51, and we declared $0.63 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.08 per share during the third quarter to $73.49 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

So related to, as I mentioned, for the quarterly, it was 6.4 points. There was certain areas that were more on the current more recent accident years, which is probably no surprise when you think about the short tail lines, which would be commercial property, commercial auto, all of the personal lines, so mainly those developments were favorable in accident year 2020. But even with that, I'd be cautious with -- there's a lot of uncertainty with the pandemic and other things going on around there. 
If I look at the workers' compensation, that's one of our longest tails that we have. That one has favorable development that I would say goes over several accident years back a few years. So you're seeing favorable development there. The claims frequency seems to have declined a little bit, but we put a lot of cost control measures in over the years that has really been benefiting the workers' comp line of business. 
And then lastly, commercial casualty, really there, looking at the paid loss, case reserve data over time are important factors for how that -- how those develop. Those have been favorable and some of the more recent accident years, the last couple, not just the last one. But as we look at in total for the property casualty business, you look at paid losses as a percent to incurred. It was up slightly for year-to-date 2021 versus last year, but it is below the 2017 through 2019 averages. So you'll see that in our supplement."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. Overall, it was another good quarter. While weather-related catastrophes were lower than a year ago, communities across our country were impacted by hail, wind, flooding and fire. As we send our field claims associates into these communities, they shine, providing excellent service in reassuring affected families and businesses. 
Net income for the third quarter of 2021 fell $331 million compared with the third quarter of last year due to $457 million less benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio. Equity portfolio fair value changes have caused significant earnings volatility for several quarters recently, and net income increased $1.3 billion for the first 9 months of 2021 compared with a year ago despite the third quarter decrease. 
Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter of 2021 more than tripled, up $146 million or 232% versus a year ago, with lower catastrophe losses on an after-tax basis, contributing $31 million of the increase. 
Our 92.6% third quarter 2021 property casualty combined ratio was 11 percentage points better than last year with decreased catastrophe losses this year, representing 4.1 points of the improvement. 
Our current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe loss effects also continued to improve and was 2.5 percentage points better than the first 9 months of 2020. 
Premium growth continued at a nice pace during the quarter as a strengthening economy and great relationships we enjoy with our agents helped us grow ahead of industry estimates. 
Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 10% in the third quarter of 2021. We continue to focus on risk segmentation, giving our underwriters the tools they need to retain and write more profitable accounts while walking away from opportunities when we determine pricing is inadequate. 
Renewal pricing during the third quarter continued to be ahead of our estimate for prospective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment. 
Our commercial lines insurance segment again experienced mid-single-digit percentage range estimated average renewal price increases, down slightly from the second quarter. Our third quarter personal lines segment average renewal price increases slowed a little compared with the second quarter, including personal auto in the low single-digit range, while the excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range. 
Our commercial lines segment had an outstanding quarter with this 80.6% combined ratio improving by 21.8 percentage points compared with the third quarter a year ago and growing net written premiums by 10%. For our personal lines segment, third quarter net written premiums grew 7% as it continued to benefit from planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its third quarter 2021 combined ratio was higher than a year ago, largely due to driving patterns moving towards pre-pandemic levels, increasing our personal auto loss ratio. Personal auto still produced a small underwriting profit for the third quarter. And for the first 9 months of 2021, our personal lines segment, in total, had an underwriting profit. Our excess and surplus line segment produced a sub-95% combined ratio for the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year and grew third quarter net written premiums by 30%. 
Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global each grew net written premiums in the third quarter of 2021. While both experienced significant losses from Hurricane Ida leading to underwriting losses for the quarter, we weren't surprised by the level of loss we saw for an event of this magnitude based on our models. 
Our life insurance subsidiary produced third quarter 2021 net income of $11 million and grew term life insurance earned premiums by 8%. 
I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Strong operating results, measured as net income before investment gains, were the largest component of our VCR for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. VCR through September 30, 2021, was 12.4%, already reaching our annual average target range of 10% to 13%. 
Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will add perspective on some other areas of our financial performance."

Investment income grew nicely during the third quarter of 2021, up 7% compared with the same period a year ago. Third quarter dividend income was up 11%, and net purchases for the equity portfolio totaled $153 million for the first 9 months of the year. 
Interest income from our bond portfolio grew 7%, and the pretax average yield was 4.06%, up 3 basis points from the third quarter a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the third quarter of 2021 was 3.43%. 
Investing in the fixed maturity portfolio continues to be a priority with net purchases during the first 9 months of the year totaling $694 million. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the third quarter of 2021 were modestly unfavorable for both our stock and bond portfolios. The overall third quarter net loss was $158 million before tax effects, including $105 million for our equity holdings and $80 million for our bond holdings. At the end of the third quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.7 billion, including $5.8 billion for our equity securities. 
Cash flow was very strong in the third quarter, as it has been all year. It contributes to investment income and was a major factor in the 7% increase in interest income we reported for the third quarter. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 9 months of 2021 generated $1.5 billion, a 36% increase compared with the year ago period. 
Expense management is another area we focus, always trying to optimize the balance of strategic business investments and expense controls. The third quarter 2021 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.9 percentage points higher than last year's third quarter, including 1.2 points due to higher accruals for profit sharing commissions for agencies. 
Moving on to loss reserves. Our approach to reserving remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information, such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business.
During the third quarter of 2021, we experienced $102 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. It favorably contributed to the combined ratio by 6.4% for the quarter. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 9 months of the year was favorable by $225 million for 2020, $46 million for 2019, $39 million for 2018 and $21 million, in aggregate, for all accident years prior to 2018. 
Regarding capital management, we also follow a consistent approach, including share repurchases as part of a maintenance intended to offset issuance of shares through equity compensation plans. We believe that our quarter end financial strength was in good shape and provides plenty of financial flexibility. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 100,000 shares at an average price per share of $119.03.
I'll conclude my prepared remarks, as I typically do, with a summary of third quarter contributions to the book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.59. Life insurance operations increased book value by $0.05. Investment income, other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items, added $0.81. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $0.39. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $0.51, and we declared $0.63 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.08 per share during the third quarter to $73.49 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

So related to -- as I mentioned, for the quarterly, it was 6.4 points. There was certain areas that were more on the current more recent accident years, which is probably no surprise when you think about the short tail lines, which would be commercial property, commercial auto, all of the personal lines. So mainly those developments were favorable in accident year 2020. But even with that, I'd be cautious with -- there's a lot of uncertainty with the pandemic and other things going on around there. 
If I look at the workers' compensation, that's one of our longest tails that we have. That one has favorable development that I would say goes over several accident years, back a few years. So you're seeing favorable development there. The claims frequency seems to have declined a little bit, but we put a lot of cost control measures in over the years that has really been benefiting the workers' comp line of business.
And then lastly, commercial casualty, really, there, looking at the paid loss, case reserve data over time are important factors for how that -- how those develop. Those have been favorable and some of the more recent accident years, the last couple, not just the last one. 
But as we look at, in total, for the property casualty business, you look at paid losses as a percent to incurred, it was up slightly for year-to-date 2021 versus last year, but it is below the 2017 through 2019 averages. So you'll see that in our supplement."
