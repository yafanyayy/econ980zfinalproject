In the press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the 12 weeks ended February 14, as well as February retail sales results for the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, February 28. Reported net income for the quarter was $951 million or $2.14 per share compared to $931 million or $2.10 per diluted share last year. This year's results included $246 million pretax or $0.41 per diluted share in costs incurred primarily from COVID-19 premium wages. 
Net sales for the quarter increased 14.7% to $43.89 billion from $38.26 billion a year ago in the second quarter. Comparable sales for the second quarter of fiscal '21 were as follows: for the 12-week period, U.S. comps were reported at 11.4%; and excluding gas deflation and FX, 12.6%. Canada reported at 13.4%; ex gas deflation and FX, 10.6%. Other international reported at 21.5%; ex gas deflation and FX, 17.7%. Our total company reported at 13.0%; and ex gas deflation and FX, 12.9%. E-commerce on a reported basis was 75.8%; and ex FX, 74.8%.
In terms of the second quarter comp sales metrics, our traffic or shopping frequency increased 1% worldwide and up 2.7% in the U.S. on a year-over-year basis during the quarter. Our average transaction or ticket was up 11.9% total company and 8.5% in the U.S. during the second quarter. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted sales by approximately 110 basis points, and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 100 basis points. 
I'll review our February sales results a little bit later in the call. Going down the income statement, membership fee income came in reported at $881.5 million or 2.01% compared to $816.4 million or 2.13% in the quarter a year ago, so up $65 million or 8%. Excluding the impact of FX, the $65 million increase would be $56 million, which would represent a 6.9% increase excluding the impact of FX. No openings occurred in fiscal -- in the second fiscal quarter, both this year and last year in the fiscal quarter.
In terms of renewal rates, the U.S. and Canadian renewal rate came in as for Q2 at 91.0% as of Q2 end. This was up 0.1% from the 90.9% at the end of the prior fiscal quarter. Worldwide, our total company renewal rates were 88.5% as of Q2 end, also up 0.1% from the prior quarter's number of 88.4%. 
In terms of number of members as of Q2 end both member households and cardholders, in terms of households at Q2 end, we came in at 59.7 million, up from 59.1 million 12 weeks earlier; and total cardholders 108.3 million, up from 107.1 million 12 weeks earlier. As of Q2, paid executive members were 23.8 million, an increase of 506,000 during the 12 weeks since Q1 end. 
Moving down the income statement to the gross margin. This year's gross margin came in at 10.96%, 2 basis points lower than last year's second quarter on a reported basis of 10.98%. Excluding gas deflation, it would have been 11 basis points lower. 
As I always ask you, we'll do a little chart here to show some of the components of margin. 2 columns, reported and the second column without gas deflation. First line item would be core merchandise. On a reported basis, core merchandise margin year-over-year was -- came in at plus 71 basis points; ex gas deflation, plus 63 basis points. Second line item, ancillary businesses, minus 53 basis points; and then without gas, minus 55. 2% reward, minus 6 and minus 5. Other, minus 14 and minus 14. So all told on a reported basis, year-over-year minus 2 basis points; and again ex gas deflation, minus 11 basis points. 
So as you can see from this chart, the core merchandise component was higher by ex gas deflation by 63 basis points. Similar to the last several fiscal quarters, sales penetration has shifted to the core business, resulting in higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core operations versus a year earlier.
Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation only to their own sales, core and core if you will, margins year-over-year were higher by 71 basis points. Fresh foods was again the biggest driver here. With strong sales in fresh, we benefited from the efficiency gains in labor productivity and significantly lower spoilage. That being said, the other 3 major merchandise categories, food and sundries, soft lines and hard lines all had higher-margin percentages year-over-year in the quarter as well. 
Ancillary and other business gross margin was lower by 53 basis points and by 55 ex gas deflation in the quarter, with most of the negative impact coming from gas; and to a lesser extent from the aggregate of travel, hearing aids, pharmacy and food courts; offset a little bit by a positive impact from e-com. Costco Logistics, which was our Innovel acquisition a year ago, impacted ancillary margins by 6 basis points to the negative. 
2% reward you can see was impacted negatively by 5 basis points, implying that more of -- higher penetration of our sales are coming from the executive membership group. And other is the minus 14 basis points. All of this is attributable to the cost of COVID-19 or about $60 million of the $246 million previously mentioned. These are the direct costs for incremental wages allocated to our manufacturing, production and fulfillment operations.
Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the second quarter was higher or worse year-over-year by 11 basis points on a reported basis, coming in at 9.89% versus 9.78% a year earlier. The minus 11 ex gas deflation, that would have been a minus 3. 
Again, doing a little chart of comparison with 2 columns, both reported and then without gas deflation. First line item would be operations, a plus 31, so lower or better by 31 basis points. Core operations was on a reported basis without gas deflation, plus 38, so lower or better by 38 basis points. Central, minus 3 basis points and minus 2. Stock compensation, plus 3 and plus 3. And other, minus 42 and minus 42. 
Yet those columns up on a reported basis again, SG&A was higher year-over-year by 11 basis points; and ex gas deflation, higher by 3. The core operations component, when you look at that, was better by 31 or 38 excluding the impact from deflation. SG&A in the core, excluding the COVID-related expenses which I'll discuss in a moment, was significantly leveraged with the strong core merchandise sales increases. Central again minus 2 ex gas deflation, stock comp plus 3, both small year-over-year basis points changes together, pretty much a wash. And other was a minus 42 basis points hit to SG&A, which were incremental wage and benefit costs related to COVID or $186 million of that $246 million total amount. So 60 of the million of the 246 hits the margin, and 186 of the 246 hits SG&A. 
I'd like to take a minute here and discuss our COVID-related expenses and how they are changing effective this past Monday, March 1. Over the past 12-month period, March 2020 through February 2021, company-wide we expended approximately $1.060 billion pretax on COVID-related items. Of this amount, approximately $825 million related specifically to the $2 an hour extra hourly pay. The remaining $200 million-plus was made up of several other items, including the few month period where employees 65 and older were paid to stay home. This was early on during the original lockdowns. Cleaning and masks supplies, paying wages to several -- for several weeks to our third-party demo service employees; and assisting employees with pay child care leave, which continues. 
With the $2 an hour extra pay having been paid in for full year, that extra amount has been discontinued as of this past Sunday, February 28. And effective March 1, a few days ago, we have implemented a permanent wage increase for hourly employees as well as most salaried warehouse employees. In the U.S. and Canada, we are permanently increasing our starting wage and most wage steps above that by $1 an hour; and increasing our top of scale hourly wage by $0.45 an hour on top of the previously planned $0.55 an hour increase for top of scale. 
With these changes, our entry-level hourly wages will increase from $15 and $15.50 an hour to $16 and $16.50 an hour. Similar type increases are occurring in other countries where we operate. 
With this change, along with the reduction and/or elimination of several components of the $200 million-plus expenses I just discussed, on a going-forward basis, this $1 billion-plus expense over the past 12 months will be reduced by a little over 1/2 starting March 1, which is we -- the beginning of week 3 in the current fiscal third quarter.
Next on the income statement is preopening expense. Pretty much the same year-over-year. This year came in at $9 million compared to last year's $7 million, so $2 million higher. In both fiscal quarters, there were 0 openings, although this relates to upcoming openings as well. 
All told, reported operating income for the second quarter of 2021, including the $246 million mentioned earlier, showed an increase of 5.8%, coming in at $1.34 billion this year compared to $1.266 billion last year. 
Below the operating income line, interest expense was $40 million this year versus $34 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $26 million year-over-year. Interest income itself was lower by $19 million due to lower interest rates. Additionally, FX and other was lower by $7 million. Overall reported pretax income in the second quarter was up 3.3%, coming in at $1.319 billion this year compared to $1.277 billion a year earlier.
In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the second quarter was 26.4%, a little higher than the 25.9% recorded in Q2 of last year. For all of '21 based on our current estimates, which of course these are always subject to change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate for the fiscal year to be in the 26% to 27% range. 
A few other items to note in terms of warehouse expansion. As I mentioned, there were no openings in Q2. There were 8 net new openings in Q1, so we're 8 year-to-date. In the second half of the fiscal year [indiscernible] quarter in the fourth fiscal quarter, we plan to open 13 more net new units. 5 of those will be in the U.S., 3 will be in Canada, and 5 will be in overseas. 
Regarding Capex, in the second quarter of fiscal '21, we spent approximately $573 million. Our full year CapEx spend is still estimated in the $3 billion to $3.2 billion range.
Moving on to e-commerce. E-commerce sales overall for the quarter ex FX increased 75% year-over-year. A few of the stronger departments: over-the-counter pharmacy, garden and patio, small electrics, health and beauty, and majors including consumer electronics. 
Total online grocery grew at a very strong rate in the second quarter. The comp numbers just mentioned follow our usual convention, which excludes our third-party same-day grocery program, which was up 450% year-over-year in the quarter. If we include the third-party same-day in our e-com comps, the 76% reported comp number would have been 96%. 
Costco Logistics, formerly known as Innovel, continues to fulfill a greater percentage of our delivery and delivery items and has steadily increased since its acquisition a year ago in March. In Q2, we made it a priority to enhance our white glove service, which includes assembly or complex installation. It's now standard on many items and offered as an upgrade on many others.
Turning to COVID-19 and some of the issues and impact surrounding it. We continue to enjoy strong core merchandise sales. I think our buying teams have done a great job keeping our buildings in stock, despite outsized demand on some items and some supply chain challenges as well. 
From a supply chain perspective, overseas freight has continued to be an issue in regards to container shortage and port delays. This has caused timing delays on certain categories, including furniture, sporting goods, lawn and garden and even some food and sundries items like seafood, imported cheeses, and oils. We expect these pressures to ease in the coming months, but it's impacting everyone, of course. 
Regarding the pressures from high consumer demand, examples of areas where we have some supply issues on the nonfood side: certain electronics due to chip and component shortages like TVs, computers and smart home related items; exercise equipment, bikes and outdoor activity items; lawn and garden items; and appliances. 
On the food side, canned beverages have some shortages due mostly to the aluminum can issue of shortages. Bacon is up 45% in pounds. And so for whatever reason, there's a lot of demand there, so there's a little bit of challenge there. Gloves, surface cleaning wipes and sanitizing sprays and some paper goods. Fresh foods overall is looking pretty good. 
Our 3 warehouse curbside pickup test next -- our 3 warehouse curbside pickup test in Albuquerque is ongoing. We don't really have a lot to add at this time as a test is recent and continuing. The pilot is going well, members have responded to it, and basket size have actually surpassed our expectations. Our focus of course is how can we be more efficient at doing it to determine if this offering can become scalable and make economic sense for us.
Turning to our February sales results, the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, February 28, compared to the same period last year. As reported in our release, net sales for the month of February came in at $14.05 billion, an increase of 15.2% from $12.2 billion last year. Again, going down to the numbers that were in the release, on a U.S. on a reported basis were up -- on a same-store sales basis were up 10.3%. That's both reported and without gas and FX. Canada reported 21.6%; ex FX, 15.7%. And other international  25.7, ex FX at 20.6. Total company 13.8 reported; ex gas and FX, 12.3. 
Within those numbers, e-com, 91.1% reported; and without gas and FX, 89.4%. As with the quarter, these numbers would -- the e-com numbers would be higher if we included the third-party same-day fresh. 
When we discussed last year's February sales results, we pointed out that the fourth week last year had a big uptick in sales. That kind of was the beginning of what we felt was a little bit of consumer -- pressure for consumers to buy in for fear of lockdown, again primarily related to consumers buying ahead of the anticipated COVID lockdowns and closures. That positively impacted last year's February sales by approximately 3 percentage points. 
Similarly, sales in week 4 of this February -- this week, week 4 of this year, February, were lower as we anniversaried that unusually strong week from a year ago. The estimated negative impact to the February month was approximately 3.5 percentage points. So the reported numbers of 13.8% and ex gas and FX of 12.3% would have been higher excluding that impact. 
Our comp traffic or frequency for February was flat to last year worldwide and up 0.7% in the U.S., again with some impact of that last week. Worldwide, the average transaction was up 13.8%, which included positive impacts of 140 basis points from FX and 10 basis points of gas inflation. 
Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar benefited February comps in Canada by 540 basis points, other international by approximately 570 basis points and total company by 140 basis points. Gas price inflation, again positively impacted total reported comp sales by about 10 basis points, whereas the average selling price was about 1 percentage point higher year-over-year.
In terms of regional and merchandising categories, the general highlights U.S. regions with strong results are Southeast, Midwest and Texas. Internationally, in local currencies, we saw the strongest results in Korea, U.K. and Japan.
Moving to merchandise highlights. The following comp sales results by category for the month, and these exclude the positive impact of FX. Food and sundries were in the positive high single digits. Departments with the strongest results were liquor, frozen foods and cooler. Hard lines were positive in the high 20s. Better-performing departments were toys and seasonal, sporting goods, hardware and majors, which again is both white goods and consumer electronics for the most part. 
Soft lines were up and also up in the low 20s. Better-performing departments included housewares, small appliances and home furnishings. 
And finally, fresh foods were up in the low 20s. Better-performing departments included meat and deli. 
Ancillary business sales, as mentioned earlier, were down. And they were down in terms of sales in the mid-single digits in February, primarily due to lower year-over-year sales in food court, hearing aids and gasoline. 
Overall, a relatively good fiscal second quarter, impacted of course by COVID expenses, impacted both plus and minus by various aspects of our business due to COVID. And certainly, as I mentioned, in the ancillary gas had the biggest of the ancillary hits.
Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our March sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, April 4, on Wednesday, April 7, after the market close.
With that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back to Buena."

We're not going to do anything dramatically different. I mean we're already pretty aggressive on a lot of things, and of course we're always trying to drive sales with aggressive value and pricing. 
Probably the one area which can be a challenge or will be a challenge at some point is fresh. The particular strength in fresh foods for the last several quarters on a year-over-year basis has been the strong fresh has led to higher labor productivity, which is part of the cost component of that, if you will, manufacturing businesses as well as lower spoilage or what we call damage and destroyed. In many cases, given the strength, you're not throwing away as much stuff at the end of the day or week, and you're again being much more productive from a labor efficiency standpoint. 
At some point, that will subside is my guess.  Beyond that, we feel pretty good about our ability to be very competitive and price along that way."

A simple guess would be you could take that type of percentage of these numbers and apply it quarterly, maybe a little bit more to SG&A than those percentages. 
And so yes, if you look to the $1.060 billion that we talked about and we say a little over half, so simple math would suggest that a little over half of that should come back, although we'll stop talking about COVID-related expenses too as we've now anniversaried it."

I was looking back at last year what we call, again what we call warehouse and other businesses, which again gas I mean. When there are big swings, it tends to be gas is the biggest component of that. 
A year ago in Q1 versus a year earlier, that will be Q1 '20 versus '19, that number I don't have the detail on gas, but it was 19 basis points to the positive. In Q2 year-over-year, it was 2 to the negative. In Q3, it was 21 to the positive. In Q4, it was 71 to the negative. So you can see it fluctuates.

We're frankly thrilled with our sales numbers and our -- and how we've done over the course of last year. As you look at both March and our fiscal third quarter, March, this giant step-up in sales and traffic and hoarding, if you will, by customers started in week 4 of February and lasted through about 2.5 weeks into March. So we'll talk about it specifically when we report March sales. 
As it relates to the fiscal quarter, which is essentially mid-February to mid-May, I don't have the exact dates in front of me, but that 12-week period. It included not only that tough comparison for those 3, 3.5 weeks, which include week 4 of February, and weeks 1, 2 and part of 3 in March. But also when there was a lockdown and an offset that in kind of late March into April and even early May, we had some very tough compares. 
And so that will make it, in our view, all things being equal on easier comparisons. So I think there's going to be a plus and a minus that probably add up to about even. We'll see. 
The next challenge of course will be Q4, which is mid-May through the end of August. That's when we enjoyed comps in the 12% to 15% range on an ongoing basis into September and October as well. But for where we saw a lot of strength, not only on the food side, but on the nonfood side as people were buying things for the home as they weren't traveling going to sporting events and the like."

There aren't any giant billion-dollar ones, items like there's a handful of items like paper towels and toilet paper water that are huge. There's the K-cups and those things that are in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But there's lots of 20s to hundreds out there, and we continue to do that with all kinds of quality organic packaged food items as well. 
I think one of the things that we've seen from some of our vertical integration is starting to pay off. We've got the chicken facility at full capacity now. We've got a great bakery commissary. We -- 2 years ago, we opened a second meat plant. We're seeing some improvement from that. 
We're also starting to identify items that historically we manufactured in one place, generally in the United States and then ship all over the world, whether it's roasting nuts and cashews and doing -- and bringing all that product from where it's grown to the U.S. for roasting and packaging and shipping out worldwide. We now have a supplier in Asia that is doing all the needs for Asia, Australia. And dramatically, we're able to dramatically reduce the price and drive sales and drive bottom line dollars for us. We're doing that with all -- we're looking at all kinds of avenues to do that with, from paper goods to things like that as well. So I think these are long-term opportunities, but there should be a lot of them over the next several years. 
Also, e-comm notwithstanding our start back in the early 2000s, we -- like everybody has, that's become more important over the last year in particular. It's approaching 10% of our business and continue to grow nicely. And we're driving -- we're getting better at doing it and getting more clicks and the like in that regard. 
So I think e-commerce and then the big [event] our acquisition of Innovel last March, all you see now and we've pointed out I think for the last 3 fiscal quarters, 6 or 7 basis point hit to gross margin as it relates to the -- it's like a manufacturing, it's a service business that goes in ultimately back into our cost of sales with that ethane costs. 
Notwithstanding the fact that, that has helped drive sales of bigger bulky items, and in fact lowered the prices to our members on some of those items. So we think that that's as expected. It was going to be earnings dilutive at the operations standpoint for the first couple of years and be fine there. But more -- as importantly if not more importantly, growing big and bulky as part of our business. We're seeing big -- continued big increases from mattresses to white goods to exercise equipment, notwithstanding the fact that there's been some shortages in some of those items."

And the -- I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought, right? oh renewal rate. In terms of improving renewal rate, as we do add people to the credit card and to executive membership, both of those things tend to increase -- provide for more lower or customer or a higher renewal rate. Also, we're doing more things to get you to auto renew, whether it's on the Citi Visa card or working on some other areas right now as well. To the extent we get you to renew by almost de facto, there's going to be a higher renewal rate on those as well.

At some point, when you have your tougher year-over-year compares, you're not going to get those big basis point improvements from spoilage and labor productivity. 
Now some of it though at these new levels, you have more productivity. We're not going to necessarily lose at all. But if it's a tough compare, you a little -- you'll lose some of it. So yes, on some of the other categories, particularly as we increase Kirkland Signature, as we sell certain things within fresh that are specialty items, where we can get a full margin show even greater savings in some cases. 
Some of the vertical integration, some of the things I mentioned, like the nuts and cashews. These are all little things, but those tend to offset some of those things. I'm not suggesting we're going to keep it all, but I think that we're going to do better than people -- than the question has a concern about.

In the press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the 12 weeks ended February 14 as well as February retail sales results for the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, February 28. Reported net income for the quarter was $951 million or $2.14 per share compared to $931 million or $2.10 per diluted share last year. This year's results included $246 million pretax or $0.41 per diluted share in costs incurred primarily from COVID-19 premium wages. 
Net sales for the quarter increased 14.7% to $43.89 billion from $38.26 billion a year ago in the second quarter. Comparable sales for the second quarter of fiscal '21 were as follows: For the 12-week period, U.S. comps were reported at 11.4%, and excluding gas deflation and FX, 12.6%; Canada reported at 13.4%, ex gas deflation and FX, 10.6%; Other international reported at 21.5%, ex gas deflation and FX, 17.7%; Our total company reported at 13.0%, and ex gas deflation and FX, 12.9%; E-commerce on a reported basis was 75.8%, and ex FX, 74.8%.
In terms of the second quarter comp sales metrics, our traffic or shopping frequency increased 1% worldwide and up 2.7% in the U.S. on a year-over-year basis during the quarter. Our average transaction or ticket was up 11.9% total company and 8.5% in the U.S. during the second quarter. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted sales by approximately 110 basis points, and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 100 basis points. 
I'll review our February sales results a little bit later in the call. Going down the income statement, membership fee income came in reported at $881.5 million or 2.01% compared to $816.4 million or 2.13% in the quarter a year ago, so up $65 million or 8%. Excluding the impact of FX, the $65 million increase would be $56 million, which would represent a 6.9% increase excluding the impact of FX. No openings occurred in fiscal -- in the second fiscal quarter, both this year and last year in the fiscal quarter.
In terms of renewal rates, the U.S. and Canadian renewal rate came in as for Q2 at 91.0% as of Q2 end. This was up 0.1% from the 90.9% at the end of the prior fiscal quarter. Worldwide, our total company renewal rates were 88.5% as of Q2 end, also up 0.1% from the prior quarter's number of 88.4%. 
In terms of number of members as of Q2 end both member households and cardholders, in terms of households at Q2 end, we came in at 59.7 million, up from 59.1 million 12 weeks earlier; and total cardholders 108.3 million, up from 107.1 million 12 weeks earlier. As of Q2, paid executive members were 23.8 million, an increase of 506,000 during the 12 weeks since Q1 end. 
Moving down the income statement to the gross margin. This year's gross margin came in at 10.96%, 2 basis points lower than last year's second quarter on a reported basis of 10.98%. Excluding gas deflation, it would have been 11 basis points lower. 
As I always ask you, we'll do a little chart here to show some of the components of margin. Two columns, reported and the second column without gas deflation. First line item would be core merchandise. On a reported basis, core merchandise margin year-over-year was -- came in at plus 71 basis points; ex gas deflation, plus 63 basis points. Second line item, ancillary businesses, minus 53 basis points; and then without gas, minus 55. 2% reward, minus 6 and minus 5. Other, minus 14 and minus 14. So all told on a reported basis, year-over-year minus 2 basis points; and again ex gas deflation, minus 11 basis points. 
So as you can see from this chart, the core merchandise component was higher by ex gas deflation by 63 basis points. Similar to the last several fiscal quarters, sales penetration has shifted to the core business, resulting in higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core operations versus a year earlier.
Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation only to their own sales, core and core, if you will, margins year-over-year were higher by 71 basis points. Fresh foods was again the biggest driver here. With strong sales in fresh, we benefited from the efficiency gains in labor productivity and significantly lower spoilage. That being said, the other 3 major merchandise categories, food and sundries, softlines and hardlines all had higher-margin percentages year-over-year in the quarter as well. 
Ancillary and other business gross margin was lower by 53 basis points and by 55 ex gas deflation in the quarter, with most of the negative impact coming from gas; and to a lesser extent from the aggregate of travel, hearing aids, pharmacy and food courts; offset a little bit by a positive impact from e-com. Costco Logistics, which was our Innovel acquisition a year ago, impacted ancillary margins by 6 basis points to the negative. 
2% reward you can see was impacted negatively by 5 basis points, implying that more of -- higher penetration of our sales are coming from the executive membership group. And other is the minus 14 basis points. All of this is attributable to the cost of COVID-19 or about $60 million of the $246 million previously mentioned. These are the direct costs for incremental wages allocated to our manufacturing, production and fulfillment operations.
Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the second quarter was higher or worse year-over-year by 11 basis points on a reported basis, coming in at 9.89% versus 9.78% a year earlier. The minus 11 ex gas deflation, that would have been a minus 3. 
Again, doing a little chart of comparison with 2 columns, both reported and then without gas deflation. First line item would be operations, a plus 31, so lower or better by 31 basis points. Core operations was on a reported basis without gas deflation, plus 38, so lower or better by 38 basis points. Central, minus 3 basis points and minus 2. Stock compensation, plus 3 and plus 3. And other, minus 42 and minus 42. 
Yet those columns up on a reported basis again, SG&A was higher year-over-year by 11 basis points; and ex gas deflation, higher by 3. The core operations component, when you look at that, was better by 31 or 38 excluding the impact from deflation. SG&A in the core, excluding the COVID-related expenses which I'll discuss in a moment, was significantly leveraged with the strong core merchandise sales increases. Central again minus 2 ex gas deflation, stock comp plus 3, both small year-over-year basis points changes together, pretty much a wash. And other was a minus 42 basis points hit to SG&A, which were incremental wage and benefit costs related to COVID or $186 million of that $246 million total amount. So 60 of the million of the 246 hits the margin, and 186 of the 246 hits SG&A. 
I'd like to take a minute here and discuss our COVID-related expenses and how they are changing effective this past Monday, March 1. Over the past 12-month period, March 2020 through February 2021, company-wide we expended approximately $1.060 billion pretax on COVID-related items. Of this amount, approximately $825 million related specifically to the $2 an hour extra hourly pay. The remaining $200 million-plus was made up of several other items, including the few month period where employees 65 and older were paid to stay home. This was early on during the original lockdowns. Cleaning and masks supplies, paying wages to several -- for several weeks to our third-party demo service employees; and assisting employees with pay child care leave, which continues. 
With the $2 an hour extra pay having been paid in for full year, that extra amount has been discontinued as of this past Sunday, February 28. And effective March 1, a few days ago, we have implemented a permanent wage increase for hourly employees as well as most salaried warehouse employees. In the U.S. and Canada, we are permanently increasing our starting wage and most wage steps above that by $1 an hour; and increasing our top of scale hourly wage by $0.45 an hour on top of the previously planned $0.55 an hour increase for top of scale. 
With these changes, our entry-level hourly wages will increase from $15 and $15.50 an hour to $16 and $16.50 an hour. Similar type increases are occurring in other countries where we operate. 
With this change, along with the reduction and/or elimination of several components of the $200 million-plus expenses I just discussed, on a going-forward basis, this $1 billion-plus expense over the past 12 months will be reduced by a little over 1/2 starting March 1, which is we -- the beginning of week 3 in the current fiscal third quarter.
Next on the income statement is preopening expense. Pretty much the same year-over-year. This year came in at $9 million compared to last year's $7 million, so $2 million higher. In both fiscal quarters, there were 0 openings, although this relates to upcoming openings as well. 
All told, reported operating income for the second quarter of 2021, including the $246 million mentioned earlier, showed an increase of 5.8%, coming in at $1.34 billion this year compared to $1.266 billion last year. 
Below the operating income line, interest expense was $40 million this year versus $34 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $26 million year-over-year. Interest income itself was lower by $19 million due to lower interest rates. Additionally, FX and other was lower by $7 million. Overall reported pretax income in the second quarter was up 3.3%, coming in at $1.319 billion this year compared to $1.277 billion a year earlier.
In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the second quarter was 26.4%, a little higher than the 25.9% recorded in Q2 of last year. For all of '21 based on our current estimates, which of course these are always subject to change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate for the fiscal year to be in the 26% to 27% range. 
A few other items to note in terms of warehouse expansion. As I mentioned, there were no openings in Q2. There were 8 net new openings in Q1, so we're 8 year-to-date. In the second half of the fiscal year [indiscernible] quarter in the fourth fiscal quarter, we plan to open 13 more net new units. 5 of those will be in the U.S., 3 will be in Canada, and 5 will be in overseas. 
Regarding Capex, in the second quarter of fiscal '21, we spent approximately $573 million. Our full year CapEx spend is still estimated in the $3 billion to $3.2 billion range.
Moving on to e-commerce. E-commerce sales overall for the quarter ex FX increased 75% year-over-year. A few of the stronger departments: over-the-counter pharmacy, garden and patio, small electrics, health and beauty, and majors including consumer electronics. 
Total online grocery grew at a very strong rate in the second quarter. The comp numbers just mentioned follow our usual convention, which excludes our third-party same-day grocery program, which was up 450% year-over-year in the quarter. If we include the third-party same-day in our e-com comps, the 76% reported comp number would have been 96%. 
Costco Logistics, formerly known as Innovel, continues to fulfill a greater percentage of our delivery and delivery items and has steadily increased since its acquisition a year ago in March. In Q2, we made it a priority to enhance our white glove service, which includes assembly or complex installation. It's now standard on many items and offered as an upgrade on many others.
Turning to COVID-19 and some of the issues and impact surrounding it. We continue to enjoy strong core merchandise sales. I think our buying teams have done a great job keeping our buildings in stock, despite outsized demand on some items and some supply chain challenges as well. 
From a supply chain perspective, overseas freight has continued to be an issue in regards to container shortage and port delays. This has caused timing delays on certain categories, including furniture, sporting goods, lawn and garden and even some food and sundries items like seafood, imported cheeses, and oils. We expect these pressures to ease in the coming months, but it's impacting everyone, of course. 
Regarding the pressures from high consumer demand, examples of areas where we have some supply issues on the nonfood side: certain electronics due to chip and component shortages like TVs, computers and smart home related items; exercise equipment, bikes and outdoor activity items; lawn and garden items; and appliances. 
On the food side, canned beverages have some shortages due mostly to the aluminum can issue of shortages. Bacon is up 45% in pounds. And so for whatever reason, there's a lot of demand there, so there's a little bit of challenge there. Gloves, surface cleaning wipes and sanitizing sprays and some paper goods. Fresh foods overall is looking pretty good. 
Our 3 warehouse curbside pickup test next -- our 3 warehouse curbside pickup test in Albuquerque is ongoing. We don't really have a lot to add at this time as a test is recent and continuing. The pilot is going well, members have responded to it, and basket size have actually surpassed our expectations. Our focus of course is how can we be more efficient at doing it to determine if this offering can become scalable and make economic sense for us.
Turning to our February sales results, the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, February 28, compared to the same period last year. As reported in our release, net sales for the month of February came in at $14.05 billion, an increase of 15.2% from $12.2 billion last year. Again, going down to the numbers that were in the release, on a U.S. on a reported basis were up -- on a same-store sales basis were up 10.3%. That's both reported and without gas and FX. Canada reported 21.6%; ex FX, 15.7%. And other international  25.7, ex FX at 20.6. Total company 13.8 reported; ex gas and FX, 12.3. 
Within those numbers, e-com, 91.1% reported; and without gas and FX, 89.4%. As with the quarter, these numbers would -- the e-com numbers would be higher if we included the third-party same-day fresh. 
When we discussed last year's February sales results, we pointed out that the fourth week last year had a big uptick in sales. That kind of was the beginning of what we felt was a little bit of consumer -- pressure for consumers to buy in for fear of lockdown, again primarily related to consumers buying ahead of the anticipated COVID lockdowns and closures. That positively impacted last year's February sales by approximately 3 percentage points. 
Similarly, sales in week 4 of this February -- this week, week 4 of this year, February, were lower as we anniversaried that unusually strong week from a year ago. The estimated negative impact to the February month was approximately 3.5 percentage points. So the reported numbers of 13.8% and ex gas and FX of 12.3% would have been higher excluding that impact. 
Our comp traffic or frequency for February was flat to last year worldwide and up 0.7% in the U.S., again with some impact of that last week. Worldwide, the average transaction was up 13.8%, which included positive impacts of 140 basis points from FX and 10 basis points of gas inflation. 
Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar benefited February comps in Canada by 540 basis points, other international by approximately 570 basis points and total company by 140 basis points. Gas price inflation, again positively impacted total reported comp sales by about 10 basis points, whereas the average selling price was about 1 percentage point higher year-over-year.
In terms of regional and merchandising categories, the general highlights U.S. regions with strong results are Southeast, Midwest and Texas. Internationally, in local currencies, we saw the strongest results in Korea, U.K. and Japan.
Moving to merchandise highlights. The following comp sales results by category for the month, and these exclude the positive impact of FX. Food and sundries were in the positive high single digits. Departments with the strongest results were liquor, frozen foods and cooler. Hard lines were positive in the high 20s. Better-performing departments were toys and seasonal, sporting goods, hardware and majors, which again is both white goods and consumer electronics for the most part. 
Soft lines were up and also up in the low 20s. Better-performing departments included housewares, small appliances and home furnishings. 
And finally, fresh foods were up in the low 20s. Better-performing departments included meat and deli. 
Ancillary business sales, as mentioned earlier, were down. And they were down in terms of sales in the mid-single digits in February, primarily due to lower year-over-year sales in food court, hearing aids and gasoline. 
Overall, a relatively good fiscal second quarter, impacted of course by COVID expenses, impacted both plus and minus by various aspects of our business due to COVID. And certainly, as I mentioned, in the ancillary gas had the biggest of the ancillary hits.
Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our March sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, April 4, on Wednesday, April 7, after the market close.
With that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back to Buena."

I mean we're already pretty aggressive on a lot of things and, of course, we're always trying to drive sales with aggressive value and pricing. 
Probably the one area which can be a challenge or will be a challenge at some point is fresh. The particular strength in fresh foods for the last several quarters on a year-over-year basis has been -- the strong fresh has led to higher labor productivity, which is part of the cost component of that, if you will, manufacturing businesses as well as lower spoilage or what we call damage and destroyed. In many cases, given the strength, you're not throwing away as much stuff at the end of the day or week, and you're again being much more productive from a labor efficiency standpoint. 
At some point, that will subside, is my guess.  Beyond that, we feel pretty good about our ability to be very competitive in price along that way."

A simple guess would be if you could take that type of percentage of these numbers and apply it quarterly, maybe a little bit more to SG&A than those percentages. 
And so yes, if you look to the $1.060 billion that we talked about, and we say a little over half, so simple math would suggest that a little over half of that should come back. Although we'll stop talking about COVID-related expenses, too, as we've now anniversaried it."

I was looking back at last year what we call -- again, what we call warehouse and other businesses, which again gas is a -- when there are big swings, it tends to be gas is the biggest component of that. 
A year ago in Q1 versus a year earlier, that will be Q1 '20 versus '19, that number -- I don't have the detail on gas, but it was 19 basis points to the positive. In Q2 year-over-year, it was 2 to the negative. In Q3, it was 21 to the positive. In Q4, it was 71 to the negative. So you can see it fluctuates. This year in the first quarter, it was 20 to the negative, and now, 55 to the negative. And again, there's a lot of components of that number, not just gas, but gas generally tends to be the big mover there."

You'll have easier comparisons because the premium stuff starts coming up in the back half, but is there any reason why you structurally stepped up in the first half of this year?"

We're frankly thrilled with our sales numbers and our -- and how we've done over the course of last year. As you look at both March and our fiscal third quarter, March, this giant step-up in sales and traffic and hoarding, if you will, by customers started in week 4 of February and lasted through about 2.5 weeks into March. So we'll talk about it specifically when we report March sales. 
As it relates to the fiscal quarter, which is essentially mid-February to mid-May, I don't have the exact dates in front of me, but that 12-week period, it included not only that tough comparison for those 3, 3.5 weeks, which include week 4 of February and weeks 1, 2 and part of 3 in March. But also when there was a lockdown and an offset that -- in kind of late March into April and even early May, we had some very tough compares. And so that will make it, in our view, all things being equal, easier comparisons. So I think there's going to be a plus and a minus that probably add up to about even. We'll see. 
The next challenge, of course, will be Q4, which is mid-May through the end of August. That's when we enjoy comps in the 12% to 15% range on an ongoing basis into September and October as well. But for Q4, where we saw a lot of strength, not only on the food side, but on the nonfood side as people were buying things for the home as they weren't traveling, going to sporting events and the like."

Kirkland Signature continues to be something that we'll continue to increase the offerings that we do. There aren't any giant billion-dollar ones, items like -- there's a handful of items like paper towels and toilet paper water that are huge. There's the K-cups and those things that are in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But there's lots of 20s to hundreds out there, and we continue to do that with all kinds of quality organic packaged food items as well. 
I think one of the things that we've seen from some of our vertical integration is starting to pay off. We've got the chicken facility at full capacity now. We've got a great bakery commissary. We -- 2 years ago, we opened a second meat plant. We're seeing some improvement from that. 
We're also starting to identify items that historically we manufactured in one place, generally in the United States, and then shipped all over the world, whether it's roasting of nuts and cashews and doing -- and bringing all that product from where it's grown to the U.S. for roasting and packaging and shipping out worldwide, we now have a supplier in Asia that is doing all the needs for Asia, Australia. And dramatically -- we're able to dramatically reduce the price and drive sales and drive bottom line dollars for us. We're doing that with all -- we're looking at all kinds of avenues to do that with, from paper goods to things like that as well. So I think these are long-term opportunities, but there should be a lot of them over the next several years. 
Also, e-comm, notwithstanding our start back in the early 2000s, we -- like everybody has, that's become more important over the last year, in particular, it's approaching 10% of our business and continue to grow nicely. And we're driving -- we're getting better at doing it and getting more clicks and the like in that regard. 
So I think e-commerce. And then the big and bulky here, our acquisition of Innovel last March, all you see now, and we've pointed out, I think, for the last 3 fiscal quarters, 6 or 7 basis point hit to gross margin as it relates to the -- it's like a manufacturing -- it's a service business that goes in ultimately back into our cost of sales with that ethane costs. Notwithstanding the fact that, that has helped drive sales of bigger bulky items, and in fact, lowered the prices to our members on some of those items. 
So we think that that's as expected. It was going to be earnings dilutive at the operations standpoint for the first couple of years and be fine there. But more -- as importantly, if not more importantly, growing big and bulky as part of our business, we're seeing big -- continued big increases from mattresses to white goods to exercise equipment, notwithstanding the fact that there's been some shortages in some of those items."

And the -- I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought, right? Oh, renewal rate.

Also, we're doing more things to get you to auto renew, whether it's on the Citi Visa card or working on some other areas right now as well.

And what we find is that we're always able to -- because we've got a great employee base that are hard-working and loyal and know that we care -- we, as a company, they're cared about, I think that we feel that we've seen over the years, everything from inventory shrink to labor productivity. Certainly, we measure these things, too, but labor productivity. And a lot of it has to do with coming up with ideas, many of which are -- these ideas come from our employees that are on the ground, if you will. working in the meat department, figured out how to be more efficient with pounds per hour -- per labor hour.  
So we've always figured out ways -- not worried about, let's figure out how to save it and then we can give it -- pass it on to them. Let's pass it on, and we'll get there from an efficiency standpoint. And it seems to have worked for us.
Yes. Other things like we now have self-checkout in 60% or 70% of our 558 Costcos in the U.S. It will be in virtually all of them, and we'll see it in other countries as well. That's the savings that took us a while to believe part of it and to figure out. I think we're on the third format of it -- version of it, but it's working in our environment the way we want it to, and we see savings there. 
So we're constantly figuring those things out. And we attribute a lot of that to -- many of these good ideas don't come from the rooms here at the office, they come from the people out on the floor."

And that's kind of the net improvement -- or pretax improvement in margin from that. 
But I'm sure if there's other outliers, we'll explain them to you as we go into each quarter. Some of the things -- that's the easy one because it's big, and we know what we're doing with it. The unknowns are how quickly will travel come back. Travel is a very high-margin, low SG&A business. Food Courts it will improve dramatically once we get tables out there everywhere.

So yes, on some of the other categories, particularly as we increase Kirkland Signature, as we sell certain things within fresh that are specialty items, where we can get a full margin and show an even greater savings in some cases. Some of the vertical integration, some of the things I mentioned, like the nuts and cashews. These are all little things, but those tend to offset some of those things. I'm not suggesting we're going to keep it all, but I think that we're going to do better than people -- than the question has a concern about.

In today's press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 to 12 weeks ended this past May 9. Reported net income for the quarter was $1.22 billion or $2.75 per diluted share. Last year's third quarter net income was -- came in at $838 million or $1.89 per share. This year's third quarter included $57 million pretax or $0.09 per share in COVID-19-related costs. Last year's third quarter included $283 million pretax or $0.47 per share of COVID-19-related costs. 
Net sales for the quarter increased year-over-year in the quarter by 21.7% from $44.38 billion -- to $44.38 billion this year from $36.45 billion a year ago. Comparable sales for the third quarter of fiscal '21 were as follows: in the U.S., on a reported basis, sales -- comparable sales were up 18%, ex gas inflation, up 15.2%; Canada, on a reported basis, up 32.3%, ex both gas and strong Canadian dollar, ex gas and FX, up 16.7%; other international reported plus 22.9%, ex gas and FX, plus 13.1%; all told, company reported comp sales of 20.6% and again, ex gas and FX, 15.1% up; e-commerce, on a reported basis, was 41.2%, ex FX was up 38.2%, and that's on top of a year ago in the third quarter when it was up 66.1% in Q3 a year ago versus the prior year to that. 
In terms of Q3 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 12.5% worldwide and plus 11.9% in the U.S. Our average transaction or ticket was up 7.3% worldwide and up 5.7% U.S. during the third quarter. And these numbers include the positive impact, both of gas inflation and FX. So adjusting for that, they would be in the 1.8% and 2.7% in the U.S. adjusted for those. 
Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted sales by approximately 290 basis points, and gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 260 basis points. 
Going down the income statement. Membership fee income reported for the third quarter, $901 million or 2.03% of sales. Again, we had strong FX and so adjusting for that out, the $86 million reported increase would have been up $67 million, so FX up 8.2%, on a reported basis, up 10.6%. 
In terms of renewal rates, the U.S. and Canadian rate of -- came in at 91.0%, the same as it was at Q2 end. Worldwide, our total company renewal rate was 88.4% at Q3 end or 0.1% lower during the prior quarter end. China entered the renewal calculation for the first time this fiscal quarter. First year renewal rates generally lag those of later years. And excluding China, the worldwide rate would have actually improved 1% versus the prior quarter. 
In terms of number of members at Q3 end, both member households and total cardholders. At the end of third quarter, total paid households 60.6 million, up from 59.7 million 12 weeks earlier. Total cardholders, 109.8 million, up from 108.3 million at the end of the second quarter 12 weeks ago. At Q3 end, paid executive membership totaled 24.6 million members, an increase of 817,000 during the 12 weeks since Q2 end. 
Moving down to gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the third quarter was lower year-over-year by 35 basis points, coming in at 11.18% compared to a year ago at 11.53%. 
As I usually do, I ask you to jot down a few numbers, 2 columns, both the reported year-over-year change in gross margin and the second column, ex gas inflation. Merchandise core, reported minus 52 basis points year-over-year and ex gas inflation, minus 29 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses reported plus 2 basis points and ex gas inflation plus 7 basis points. 2% Reward, plus 1 basis point and minus 2 basis points. Other, plus 14 basis points in both columns. Total, therefore, reported gross margin, again, year-over-year was reported down 35 basis points and ex gas inflation down 10 basis points. The core merchandise component, as you show here was, as I mentioned here, was down 52 basis points year-over-year on -- and down 29% on ex gas inflation. This is primarily a function of sales shifting from core to ancillary versus last year as we begin to revert back to more historical sales penetrations. Recall, last year, we saw a significant shift of sales out of ancillary and other businesses and into the core. 
In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in third quarter, the core and core margin were better by plus 27 basis points, with nonfood up significantly, rebounding from last year's lows. Food and sundries flat year-over-year and fresh foods down from last year, the latter still strong by historical standards. Fresh, as we've mentioned over the last few quarters, is lapping exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outsized sales that began a year ago in Q3 with the onset of COVID. 
Ancillary and other business gross margins, again, ex gas inflation was up 7 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. We have a lot going on here as last year, we had closed the hearing aid and optical departments and had severely limited the service and selection at our food courts for most of Q3 last year. 
Gas had a particularly good quarter a year ago, which had helped offset some of those closures a year ago. This year, we're showing margin improvement in optical, food court, e-com and hearing aids, somewhat offset by yes. 
The 2% reward was, again, on excluding gas inflation, it was lower by 2 basis points, indicating higher sales penetration to our executive members and the rewards associated with it. And other is plus 14 basis points, 9 of the 14 basis points is attributable to lower COVID-19 costs year-over-year. $4 million hit to margin in Q3 a year ago versus a $14 million hit to margin this year in the third quarter. 
Last year, we incurred 10 weeks of the incremental $2 an hour premium wage. This -- that portion you see here relates to the labor associated with our fulfillment manufacturing businesses. This year, we incurred 2 weeks of the incremental 2 hour -- the incremental $2 an hour premium wage as the program was discontinued at the end of the second week of Q3 after 52 weeks in place. 
The other plus 5 basis points or $19.7 million came from accruing a reserve last year in Q3 for certain third-party gift cards and ticket programs that were adversely impacted by the onset of COVID. One other comment, as I discussed during our March 4, Q2 earnings conference call. In conjunction with the discontinuing of the $2 an hour premium pay, we implemented a permanent wage increase for our hourly employees as well as most of our salaried manager employees, which took effect in week 3 of this fiscal quarter. Since it's a permanent wage increase going forward, its impact is simply in our reported numbers and not separated out as COVID-related. 
Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the third quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 107 basis points. Again to jot down these following 2 columns and numbers, first column is reported, and second column, excluding gas inflation. In terms of operations, year-over-year, plus 37 basis points, meaning lower or better by 37 basis points, ex gas inflation, plus 20 basis points. Central plus 4 basis points and plus 1 basis point; stock compensation, plus 5 and plus 4; other, plus 61 and plus 61. For a total, on a reported basis, again, SG&A year-over-year was lower or better by 107 basis points on a reported basis and excluding gas inflation, better by -- or lower by 86 basis points. 
Again, looking here, the core operation was better by 37 and plus -- better by 20, excluding the impact of gas inflation. A good result, particularly given that we implemented a permanent $1 an hour wage increase for the last 10 of the 12 weeks that comprise Q3. Central, nothing surprising there. Same with stock comp, and other, the plus 61 basis points ex gas inflation, 56 of the 61 was attributable to the lower cost from COVID. $239 million hits SG&A in Q3 a year ago compared to $44 million in Q3 this year. The balance or plus 5 basis points lower by 5 basis points was $18.5 million were cost associated with the acquisition and integration of Innovel a year ago. 
Next on the income statement is preopening expense. Basically, this year, it was -- it came in at $10 million, $2 million higher than the $8 million in Q3 of fiscal '20. Nothing out of the ordinary with the preopening this quarter. 
All told, reported operating income in Q3 '21 and increased 41%, coming in at $1.663 billion this year compared to $1.179 billion a year ago in the quarter. 
Below the operating income line, interest expense was $40 million this year versus $37 million a year ago. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $6 million or better by $6 million. Interest income was actually lower by $2 million year-over-year due to lower interest rates. Additionally, FX and other was higher by $8 million year-over-year. 
Overall, reported pretax income in the third quarter was up -- reported pretax income was up 42% and coming in at $1.65 billion this year compared to $1.163 billion a year ago. In terms of e-commerce, our e-commerce sales, as I mentioned earlier -- I'm sorry, before I go to e-commerce. Our tax rate in the third quarter came in at 25.2% compared to 26.7% a year earlier. This quarter benefited from onetime discrete tax item that benefited our number. 
For all of '21, based on our estimates, which, of course, are solely subject to change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate for the year to be in the 26% to 27% range. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion. In Q3, we opened 6 new warehouses, one in the U.S., 3 in Canada and 2 internationally. We also have plans in Q4 to open 7 additional ones, 5 in the U.S. and 2 others internationally. And that would put us in a total of 21 net new warehouses for the fiscal year, 23 -- which included 2 relocations, so 21 net. In addition to the 21 planned openings for fiscal '21, we are looking to open about 25 new units, net new units in each of the next 2 fiscal years, including a second warehouse in China in fiscal '22, which would be the end of -- towards the end of calendar '21 and a third expected to open in late calendar '22, which would be early fiscal year '23. 
Regarding CapEx, the third quarter fiscal '21 spend was approximately $1.03 billion. Our full year CapEx spend is now estimated to be in the $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion range, increased a little from our estimate made 12 weeks earlier to include the recent $340 million purchase of a distribution facility on the West Coast to support our big and bulky delivery activities. 
Now going -- turning to e-commerce. Again, e-commerce sales in the third quarter ex FX increased 38.2% year-over-year. Stronger departments included jewelry, home furnishings, sporting goods, hardware and majors, which, of course, includes both everything from appliances to consumer electronics. 
In terms of Costco Logistics and an update there, we anniversary-ed the purchase of Innovel, now called Costco Logistics this fiscal quarter. Costco Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales with the U.S. e-com sales on these items up 53% during the quarter. 
Costco Logistics fulfilled about 70% of all U.S. big and bulky orders, and we also continue to add some new big and bulky vendors. Overall, we've improved delivery time on many items from up to 2 weeks to in many -- in several cases, now 5 to 7 days. As well, we've taken several items that were previously vendor dropshipped that are now and are now being direct imported allowing us to not only speed up delivery but reduce prices to our members. 
From a supply chain perspective, port delays are continuing to have an impact. We are utilizing additional carriers, in some cases, to help deviate some of that. Containers and pallets are also facing shortages anecdotally, 35% to 50% increase in incoming containers this year versus a year ago. Some of that's pent-up demand, but just from the low points a year ago. The turnaround of a container hitting the U.S., delivering its contents and being back at the U.S. port to head back overseas has gone from approximately 25 days to 50 days. So a combination of things in terms of delays. 
Chip shortages are impacting many items from an inflation standpoint, some items more than others. And again, as I mentioned, with regard to containers and shipping, transportation costs have increased as well. Despite these issues, we continue to work to mitigate cost increases and supply chain delays in a variety of different ways as best we can. The biggest way we've handled -- the biggest way we've handled supply chain delays is adjusted ordering and front-loading, if you will, orders of many items. And we think we've got that pretty well under control. This will continue -- the feeling is that this will continue for the most part of this calendar year. 
We've had a lot of questions about inflation over the past few months. There have been -- there have been and are a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing. inflationary factors abound. These include higher labor costs, higher freight costs, higher transportation demand, along with the container shortage and port delays that I mentioned, increased demand in various product categories some shortages, various shortages of everything from chips to oils and chemical supplies by facilities hit by the Gulf freeze and storms and in some cases, higher commodity prices. 
Some inflationary sound bites, if you will. Price increases on items shipped across the ocean with suppliers paying up to double for containers and shipping. Price increases of pulp, paper goods, some things up 4% to 8%. And plastic and resin increases from trash bags to plastic cups, plates, et cetera, and plastic wraps. Metals, aluminum foil, mid-single-digit cost increases also cans for sodas and other beverages. Higher import prices on cheeses, the combination of the product itself as well as some FX strength of some foreign currencies as well as freight, anywhere from 3% to 10% increases on certain apparel items, not all. 
In terms of fresh, higher protein prices, for example, meat overall year-over-year is up 7%. Beef in the last month has been up as much as 20%. Some of that is due to feed labor and transportation costs as well as restocking some of the additional increased demand coming now from institutional needs as restaurants start to reopen. And the list, we go on and on. 
Now all this being said, I was asked back on our March 4 -- second quarter call. At what level we felt inflation was running overall at that time with our goods. I stated that our best guess was somewhere in the 1% to 1.5% range. As of today, we guess that overall price inflation at the selling level and excluding our gasoline sales, would be estimated to be probably more in the 2.5% to 3.5% range. So items are up more and some items, the sale prices haven't yet changed. And some items are even down a little bit. We think -- again, we've done pretty well in terms of controlling that as best as we can, but the inflation pressures abound. 
In terms of sampling and demos in the warehouse, as you all know, we eliminated our popular food sampling and demo activities in our warehouses last March at the onset of the pandemic. As various states opened and closed last summer and fall, we tried a few sampling events. A few single-serve items like cookies and crackers, take-out only, no cook to prepared sample items and a few enhanced talking demos such as items for display only. 
I'm happy to report that over the next couple of weeks, we're beginning a phased return to full sampling. This will come in waves. The first wave of locations, about 170 of our 550-ish locations in the U.S. will be activated by the first week of June, with most of the remaining locations returning towards the near -- towards the end of June. The first wave will actually determine how fast we roll out and what and when restrictions are lifted. I'm sure there will be a few states that with unique restrictions as well. Increased safety protocols are and will be in place, including all samples prepared behind Plexiglass prepared in smaller batches for better safety control and distribute it to members one at a time. 
Food courts, same thing as well. I'm pleased to report that our food courts are also coming back over the next few weeks in a bigger way. Last March, again in 2020 as the pandemic took hold. We pared back menu basically to hotdogs and pizza and soda and smoothies, and we eliminated all seating, those takeout only. We began several weeks ago adding back tables and seating and -- at a handful of outdoor food courts in a few states. Over the past few months, we've also added back a few more food items, including bringing back a new and improved churros, which will be at all U.S. locations by the 4th of July, and adding a high-end soft ice cream to replace our frozen yogurt. 
And by June 7, we plan to have tables in seating back at most locations, but with more physical separation, tables are 4 instead of 6 and 8 and about half the seating capacity as we had before. Again, these are still subject to doing this in waves and see how it goes and subject to any additional state rules or restrictions in a few cases. 
Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results. For the 4 weeks ending the Sunday, May 30 on next Thursday, June 4 after market closes. With that, I will open up to questions and answers, and I'll turn it back over to Sarah. Sarah?"

Some of the inflationary pressures, some very simple examples might be things like our $4.99 rotisserie chicken and our $2.99 40-packet of water. Those have stayed the same, notwithstanding there's been some pressure on some cost components of these items. So those are already impacting our margins a little.

Amazon is enhancing the value of its membership with more media content. Walmart continues to focus on the value of its membership offering. Do you think these factors are influencing the pricing power that Costco has to read the scenes associated with either the gold or executive membership? And do you feel like there has been a sharp increase in the value of a coastal membership over the last 4 years is that as you approach the normal cadence of when you would typically raise your fees, you could do it this time again?"

And I would like to think that Some of the benefits that we've had in terms of strong business over the last -- not only the last year with COVID, certainly, we've been helped by the fact that we've been deemed an essential business and the strength in fresh and food items has helped quite a bit as well and things for the home. 
But I think we've gained market share on top of that, and that's all about value. I mean our model is -- our view is our model is intact as it relates to the best prices on the best quality goods and services. And certainly, our buying power keeps improving in that regard. 
We've added things as it relates to different forms of procuring the merchandise, whether it's in-store or a big increase like many people with e-commerce. Certainly, our acquisition of what's now called Costco Logistics has been a big boom for our -- we believe, for our sales strength and competitiveness in those areas. So we think from a value proposition standpoint, the value of what we offer our members keeps going up. 
As it relates to fee increases, historically, we've done it about every 5 years, so we would expect now to start getting questions since this is a year before that, and our answer is pretty straightforward. We'll have to wait and see. But we certainly feel good about our competitive position."

While",352,"Sure. Well, there's always different pieces to that equation. As I mentioned, one of the things that we mentioned over the last few quarters was particularly strong fresh foods margins with higher labor productivity and much lower products spoilage. While, again, we're still above where we were pre-COVID, it's come down a little from its peak a year ago in Q3, but still nonetheless better than historical numbers. 
One of the things that I mentioned picked up was nonfood. Again, the strength that we've seen in nonfoods has continued. It really started in the summer when people buying things for their home. Outside of that, certainly, I would expect on an ancillary business, taking gas out of it for a minute because that goes up and down at -- with a lot of factors causing it who the heck knows. But at the end of the day, if you look at some of the other ancillary businesses, I would expect to see, of course, margin improvement with optical and hearing aid relative to a year ago, for sure, even in Q4. 
Same thing with travel. Travel is coming back as we see on the news every night. Travel is coming back in a big way with the improvement with COVID as well as probably a lot of pent-up demand. And we're seeing that ourselves in our travel business. And that's a high-margin business, although a small piece of the total sales action for the company. 
So I think, overall, we seem to figure out how to get there in different ways, even something like Costco Logistics that in the last 3-or-so quarters, I pointed out, it was a 5 to 7 basis point hit to margin. It's finally anniversary-ed some of that, and hopefully, we'll start to show some improvement. But there's little things like that, that might show you a little improvement in the future. 
So -- but overall, it gets back to our ability to price our goods for great value and being competitive and still hopefully improving the bottom line will continue. But we'll let you know each quarter."

And also doing ourselves 2-day dry grocery and some other items. 
And again, anecdotally, we know that we garnered some additional members that way. On the 2-day, since that is done via mostly UPS, you may have -- we've gotten some members that are outside of our geographic market areas of physical warehouses. but not a big giant number. So overall, I think if anything, we've seen our continued strength of adding net new members to existing warehouses. 
Certainly, opening new warehouses helps and perhaps getting a few related to the online next-day delivery of fresh and things like that. Beyond that, again, when we see who from -- again, from an age demographic, we're getting -- we think that we're getting our good share of younger people as we did in previous. That was -- historically, that was sometimes a concern of some on Wall Street. Is this for the older generation? And what we're finding is, as long as we keep changing our product mix to  gear towards our -- who the member is. And in our case, when you see what we've done with organics over the last 10 years or more now. And summer sporting equipment and you name it, we get our fair share of those people."

But even in states that have been a little bit more closed, I mean the U.S., in particular, has opened up quite a bit in the last 1 month, 1.5 months as evidenced by new CDC guidelines and I think the spring weather in general. And so -- and just the pent up interest in doing that. So I think a lot of that's already in there. 
And in other countries, in Canada, there's still some -- for much of the last fiscal quarter, And about 38 of the 101 or 102 Costcos in Canada, one of the main provinces, there was limitations on -- we had to cordon off nonessential items or so nonfood items.

But at the end of the day, we're improving in a big way. We actually were aggressive on pricing immediately. It's kind of like when we went into a new country like France or Spain, we're pricing in low volume, less efficient departments like fresh as if we were doing a lot of volume. And so those are examples where it's hurting us to start with as it relates to -- we're going to price the goods or lower the price of a mattress or a furniture set delivery based on what we can do before we actually do it. 
Now that's thankfully catching up for itself with itself. In terms of capacity, it has a lot of capacity. As I mentioned, right now, about 70% of our big and bulky is now delivered through Cross to logistics. Some of it was being delivered by third parties that we're doing fine, but now we're doing it ourselves. That business, as I mentioned, is continuing to grow very handily not only for us but industry-wide with furniture and things for the home exercise equipment TVs and the like. And we think that we have tremendous capacity available. What we bought was at a capacity of less than 50% of what it had been doing itself a few years before. But again, those aren't completely -- you can't completely compare those two. 
What we just bought was a huge facility and acreage that allow us to do more big and bulking and recognizing so many things come in from overseas and big and bulky, and it's again on the West Coast in California. And so it's going to help us continue to grow that business. 
We think we have a lot of growth. Way before COVID and more big and bulky and everything else. Recall in the U.S., what we saw over the last 5 years, I think it was 5 years ago, we said in just white goods when all we did was sell them in store. We did about $50 million. And the year pre-COVID, 3 years hence, we did about 7 50 or something. We're well beyond that now, both natural growth as well as what COVID has done in terms of people buying things for the home and then us being able to become more competitive on pricing. We've seen items not across the board, but items where we've lowered the price by 10% and 15% or more, greatly improved the delivery time and are driving that business."

Yes. So bookings, they're not revenue yet, but bookings are particularly strong now.

Beyond that, when all is said and done, will some of it still be sticky? Our view is probably.

And so you have a lower-than-average renewal rate to start with. When I look back at the 7 or 8 countries outside of the U.S. and Canada, I mean, there's 10-or-so. But what we've seen is that instead of -- in the U.S. or Canada, we might add anywhere from 5,000 to 20,000 members in the first year, recognizing in some of these are existing markets. So you've got people shopping more often because they're the new opening. We've enjoyed in Korea, Taiwan, Japan and even more so in China. 50 to 100,000 new member sign-ups when we open up. And then a year later, 1.5 years later, when they're renewing -- when that first batch is renewing for the first time to get to that 88-plus worldwide renewal rate and the 90.1 in the U.S. and Canada, it starts off, it could be anywhere from the high 50s to the mid-60s in that first year. And I don't have in front of me what China is. But China is also outsized in that regard. I think we have close to 400,000 members in that 1 location. Remind you, it's a very large city and Costco entered as a well-known entity, notwithstanding the fact that it was our first one. So for all those reasons, it alone affected that worldwide renewal rate. 
We're not surprised. And by the way, even whatever renewals, nonrenewals we've been -- that have been incurred, we've gotten more than that in terms of new sign-ups. I think at the end of about 3 months after we opened in China, which was August of '19, we had around 300,000 members, and I think now we have about 400,000.

I think the big one that has, again, that has surprised us in the sense that we think there's lots of opportunity there is the whole Costco Logistics side. For a variety of reasons, not only handling it ourselves and controlling the destiny of delivery times. But actually, there's a number of items that we historically have dropshipped, if you will. The supplier carries the inventory, the supplier sends it and needless to say, there's a cost associated with that. As we get bigger and higher volume and do some of those things direct, we're able to basically improve the delivery time and lower the price, and we've seen that. 
And then we're getting better in insulation. That's something that we will continue to improve on as well. So I think that's probably the 1 area. I don't see -- there's nothing currently planned in terms of the next big chicken plant, if you will.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.  
In today's press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 to 12 weeks ended this past May 9. Reported net income for the quarter was $1.220 billion or $2.75 per diluted share. Last year's third quarter net income was -- came in at $838 million or $1.89 per share. This year's third quarter included $57 million pretax or $0.09 per share in COVID-19-related costs. Last year's third quarter included $283 million pretax or $0.47 per share of COVID-19-related costs.  
Net sales for the quarter increased year-over-year in the quarter by 21.7% from $44.38 billion -- to $44.38 billion this year from $36.45 billion a year ago. Comparable sales for the third quarter of fiscal '21 were as follows: in the U.S., on a reported basis, sales or comparable sales were up 18%, ex gas inflation, up 15.2%; Canada, on a reported basis, up 32.3%, ex both gas and strong Canadian dollar, ex gas and FX, up 16.7%; other international reported plus 22.9%, ex gas and FX, plus 13.1%. All told, company reported comp sales of 20.6% and, again, ex gas and FX, 15.1% up; e-commerce, on a reported basis, was 41.2%, ex FX was up 38.2%, and that's on top of a year ago in the third quarter when it was up 66.1% in Q3 a year ago versus the prior year to that.  
In terms of Q3 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 12.5% worldwide and plus 11.9% in the U.S. Our average transaction or ticket was up 7.3% worldwide and up 5.7% U.S. during the third quarter. And these numbers include the positive impact both of gas inflation and FX. So adjusting for that, they would be in the 1.8% and 2.7% in the U.S. adjusted for those.  
Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted sales by approximately 290 basis points. And gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 260 basis points.  
Going down the income statement. Membership fee income reported for the third quarter, $901 million or 2.03% of sales. Again, we had strong FX and so adjusting for that out, the $86 million reported increase would have been up $67 million, so FX up 8.2%, on a reported basis up 10.6%.  
In terms of renewal rates, the U.S. and Canadian rate of -- came in at 91.0%, the same as it was at Q2 end. Worldwide, our total company renewal rate was 88.4% at Q3 end or 0.1% lower during the prior quarter end. China entered the renewal calculation for the first time this fiscal quarter. First year renewal rates generally lag those of later years. And excluding China, the worldwide rate would have actually improved 0.1% versus the prior quarter.  
In terms of number of members at Q3 end, both member households and total cardholders, At the end of third quarter, total paid households 60.6 million,  up from 59.7 million 12 weeks earlier. Total cardholders, 109.8 million, up from 108.3 million at the end of the second quarter 12 weeks ago. At Q3 end, paid executive membership totaled 24.6 million members, an increase of 817,000 during the 12 weeks since Q2 end.  
Moving down to gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the third quarter was lower year-over-year by 35 basis points, coming in at 11.18% compared to a year ago at 11.53%.  
As I usually do, I ask you to jot down a few numbers, 2 columns, both the reported year-over-year change in gross margin and the second column, ex gas inflation. Merchandise core, reported minus 52 basis points year-over-year and ex gas inflation, minus 29 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses reported plus 2 basis points and ex gas inflation plus 7 basis points. 2% Reward, plus 1 basis point and minus 2 basis points. Other, plus 14 basis points in both columns. Total, therefore, reported gross margin, again, year-over-year was reported down 35 basis points and ex gas inflation down 10 basis points. 
The core merchandise component, as you show here was -- as I mentioned here, was down 52 basis points year-over-year on -- and down 29% on ex gas inflation. This is primarily a function of sales shifting from core to ancillary versus last year as we begin to revert back to more historical sales penetrations. Recall, last year, we saw a significant shift of sales out of ancillary and other businesses and into the core.  
In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in third quarter, the core and core margin were better by plus 27 basis points, with nonfood up significantly, rebounding from last year's lows. Food and sundries flat year-over-year and fresh foods down from last year, the latter still strong by historical standards.  
Fresh, as we've mentioned over the last few quarters, is lapping exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outsized sales that began a year ago in Q3 with the onset of COVID.  
Ancillary and other business gross margins, again, ex gas inflation was up 7 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. We have a lot going on here as last year we had closed the hearing aid and optical departments and had severely limited the service and selection at our food courts for most of Q3 last year.  
Gas had a particularly good quarter a year ago, which had helped to offset some of those closures a year ago. This year, we're showing margin improvement in optical, food court, e-com and hearing aids, somewhat offset by gas.  
The 2% Reward was, again, on excluding gas inflation, was lower by 2 basis points, indicating higher sales penetration to our executive members and the rewards associated with it. And other is plus 14 basis points. 9 of the 14 basis points is attributable to lower COVID-19 costs year-over-year. $44 million hit to margin in Q3 a year ago versus a $14 million hit to margin this year in the third quarter.  
Last year, we incurred 10 weeks of the incremental $2 an hour premium wage. This -- that portion you see here relates to the labor associated with our fulfillment manufacturing businesses. This year, we incurred 2 weeks of the incremental 2 hour -- the incremental $2 an hour premium wage as the program was discontinued at the end of the second week of Q3 after 52 weeks in place.  
The other plus 5 basis points or $19.7 million came from accruing a reserve last year in Q3 for certain third-party gift cards and ticket programs that were adversely impacted by the onset of COVID. One other comment, as I discussed during our March 4 Q2 earnings conference call. In conjunction with the discontinuing of the $2 an hour premium pay, we implemented a permanent wage increase for our hourly employees as well as most of our salaried manager employees, which took effect in week 3 of this fiscal quarter. Since it's a permanent wage increase going forward, its impact is simply in our reported numbers and not separated out as COVID-related.  
Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the third quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 107 basis points. Again to jot down these following 2 columns and numbers, first column is reported, and second column, excluding gas inflation. In terms of operations, year-over-year, plus 37 basis points, meaning lower or better by 37 basis points, ex gas inflation, plus 20 basis points. Central plus 4 basis points and plus 1 basis point; stock compensation, plus 5 and plus 4; other, plus 61 and plus 61. For a total, on a reported basis, again, SG&A year-over-year was lower or better by 107 basis points on a reported basis and excluding gas inflation, better by -- or lower by 86 basis points.  
Again, looking here, the core operation was better by 37 and plus -- better by 20, excluding the impact of gas inflation. A good result, particularly given that we implemented a permanent $1 an hour wage increase for the last 10 of the 12 weeks that comprise Q3. Central, nothing surprising there. Same with stock comp, and other, the plus 61 basis points ex gas inflation, 56 of the 61 was attributable to the lower cost from COVID. $239 million hits SG&A in Q3 a year ago compared to $44 million in Q3 this year. The balance or plus 5 basis points, lower by 5 basis points, was $18.5 million were cost associated with the acquisition and integration of Innovel a year ago.  
Next on the income statement is preopening expense. Basically, this year, it was -- it came in at $10 million, $2 million higher than the $8 million in Q3 of fiscal '20. Nothing out of the ordinary with the preopening this quarter.  
All told, reported operating income in Q3 '21 increased 41%, coming in at $1.663 billion this year compared to $1.179 billion a year ago in the quarter.  
Below the operating income line, interest expense was $40 million this year versus $37 million a year ago. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $6 million or better by $6 million. Interest income was actually lower by $2 million year-over-year due to lower interest rates. Additionally, FX and other was higher by $8 million year-over-year.  
Overall, reported pretax income in the third quarter was up -- reported pretax income was up 42%, coming in at $1.650 billion this year compared to $1.163 billion a year ago. In terms of e-commerce, our e-commerce sales, as I mentioned earlier -- I'm sorry, before I go to e-commerce, our tax rate in the third quarter came in at 25.2% compared to 26.7% a year earlier. This quarter benefited from onetime discrete tax item that benefited our number.  
For all of '21, based on our estimates, which, of course, are, sadly, subject to change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate for the year to be in the 26% to 27% range. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, in Q3, we opened 6 new warehouses, 1 in the U.S.; 3 in Canada; and 2 internationally. We also have plans in Q4 to open 7 additional ones, 5 in the U.S. and 2 others internationally. And that would put us in a total of 21 net new warehouses for the fiscal year, 23 -- which included 2 relocations, so 21 net. 
In addition to the 21 planned openings for fiscal '21, we are looking to open about 25 new units, net new units in each of the next 2 fiscal years, including a second warehouse in China in fiscal '22, which would be the end of -- towards the end of calendar '21 and a third expected to open in late calendar '22, which would be early fiscal year '23.  
Regarding CapEx, the third quarter fiscal '21 spend was approximately $1.03 billion. Our full year CapEx spend is now estimated to be in the $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion range, increased a little from our estimate made 12 weeks earlier to include the recent $340 million purchase of a distribution facility on the West Coast to support our big and bulky delivery activities.  
Now going -- turning to e-commerce. Again, e-commerce sales in the third quarter ex FX increased 38.2% year-over-year. Stronger departments included jewelry, home furnishings, sporting goods, hardware and majors, which, of course, includes both everything from appliances to consumer electronics.  
In terms of Costco Logistics and an update there, we anniversary-ed the purchase of Innovel, now called Costco Logistics this fiscal quarter. Costco Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales with the U.S. e-com sales on these items up 53% during the quarter.  
Costco Logistics fulfilled about 70% of all U.S. big and bulky orders, and we also continue to add some new big and bulky vendors. Overall, we've improved delivery time on many items from up to 2 weeks to in many -- in several cases, now 5 to 7 days. As well, we've taken several items that were previously vendor-drop shipped that are now -- and are now being direct imported allowing us to not only speed up delivery but reduce prices to our members.  
From a supply chain perspective, port delays are continuing to have an impact. We are utilizing additional carriers, in some cases, to help alleviate some of that. Containers and pallets are also facing shortages anecdotally, 35% to 50% increase in incoming containers this year versus a year ago. Some of that's pent-up demand, but just from the low points a year ago. The turnaround of a container hitting the U.S., delivering its contents and being back at the U.S. port to head back overseas has gone from approximately 25 days to 50 days. So a combination of things in terms of delays.  
Chips shortages are impacting many items from an inflation standpoint, some items more than others. And again, as I mentioned, with regard to containers and shipping, transportation costs have increased as well. Despite these issues, we continue to work to mitigate cost increases and supply chain delays in a variety of different ways as best we can. The biggest way we've handled supply chain delays is adjusted ordering and front-loading, if you will, orders of many items. And we think we've got that pretty well under control.  
This will continue -- the feeling is that this will continue for the most part of this calendar year. We've had a lot of questions about inflation over the past few months. There have been and are a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing. Inflationary factors abound. These include higher labor costs, higher freight costs, higher transportation demand, along with the container shortage and port delays that I mentioned, increased demand in various product categories some shortages, various shortages of everything from chips to oils and chemical supplies by facilities hit by the Gulf freeze and storms and, in some cases, higher commodity prices.  
Some inflationary sound bites, if you will. Price increases on items shipped across the ocean with suppliers paying up to double for containers and shipping. Price increases of pulp, paper goods, some things up 4% to 8%, plastic and resin increases from trash bags to plastic cups, plates, et cetera, and plastic wraps. Metals, aluminum foil, mid-single-digit cost increases also cans for sodas and other beverages. Higher import prices on cheeses, the combination of the product itself as well as some FX strength of some foreign currencies as well as freight, anywhere from 3% to 10% increases on certain apparel items, not all.  
In terms of fresh, higher protein prices, for example, meat overall year-over-year is up 7%. Beef in the last month has been up as much as 20%. Some of that is due to feed labor and transportation costs as well as restocking some of the additional increased demand coming now from institutional needs as restaurants start to reopen. And the list could go on and on.  
Now all this being said, I was asked back on our March 4 -- second quarter call. At what level we felt inflation was running overall at that time with our goods. I stated that our best guess was somewhere in the 1% to 1.5% range. As of today, we guess that overall price inflation at the selling level, and excluding our gasoline sales, would be estimated to be probably more in the 2.5% to 3.5% range. 
Some items are up more and some items, the sale prices haven't yet changed. And some items are even down a little bit. We think, again, we've done pretty well in terms of controlling that as best as we can, but the inflation pressures abound.  
In terms of sampling and demos in the warehouse, as you all know, we eliminated our popular food sampling and demo activities in our warehouses last March at the onset of the pandemic. As various states opened and closed last summer and fall, we tried a few sampling events. A few single-serve items like cookies and crackers, take-out only, no cook to prepared sample items and a few enhanced talking demos such as items for display only.  
I'm happy to report that over the next couple of weeks, we're beginning a phased return to full sampling. This will come in waves. The first wave of locations, about 170 of our 550-ish locations in the U.S. will be activated by the first week of June, with most of the remaining locations returning towards the near -- or towards the end of June. The first wave will actually determine how fast we roll out and what and when restrictions are lifted. I'm sure there will be a few states with unique restrictions as well. 
Increased safety protocols are and will be in place, including all samples prepared behind plexiglass, prepared in smaller batches for better safety control and distribute it to members one at a time.  
Food courts, same thing as well. I'm pleased to report that our food courts are also coming back over the next few weeks in a bigger way. Last March, again in 2020 as the pandemic took hold, we pared back menu basically to hotdogs and pizza and soda and smoothies, and we eliminated all seating, those takeout only. We began several weeks ago adding back tables and seating and -- at a handful of outdoor food courts in a few states. 
Over the past few months, we've also added back a few more food items, including bringing back a new and improved churros, which will be at all U.S. locations by the 4th of July, and adding a high-end soft ice cream to replace our frozen yogurt.  
And by June 7, we plan to have tables in seating back at most locations, but with more physical separation, tables of 4 instead of 6 and 8 and about half the seating capacity as we had before. Again, these are still subject to doing this in waves and see how it goes and subject to any additional state rules or restrictions in a few cases.  
Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results. For the 4 weeks ending the Sunday, May 30, on next Thursday, June 4 after market closes. With that, I will open up to questions and answers, and I'll turn it back over to Sarah. Sarah?"

From a competitive standpoint, our view is it has not really impacted our margins in any big way. Some of the inflationary pressures, some very simple examples might be things like our $4.99 rotisserie chicken and our $2.99 40-packet of water. Those have stayed the same, notwithstanding there's been some pressure on some cost components of these items. So those are already impacting our margins a little. And I don't -- I think overall, relative to competition, that's not going to be an impact -- a big impact of where we go margin-wise."

But I think we've gained market share on top of that, and that's all about value. I mean our model is -- our view is our model is intact as it relates to the best prices on the best quality goods and services. And certainly, our buying power keeps improving in that regard. 
We've added things as it relates to different forms of procuring the merchandise, whether it's in-store or a big increase like many people with e-commerce. Certainly, our acquisition of what's now called Costco Logistics has been a big boom for our -- we believe, for our sales strength and competitiveness in those areas. So we think from a value proposition standpoint, the value of what we offer our members keeps going up. 
As it relates to fee increases, historically, we've done it about every 5 years, so we would expect now to start getting questions since this is a year before that, and our answer is pretty straightforward. We'll have to wait and see. But we certainly feel good about our competitive position."

As I mentioned, one of the things that we mentioned over the last few quarters was particularly strong fresh foods margins with higher labor productivity and much lower products spoilage. While, again, we're still above where we were pre-COVID, it's come down a little from its peak a year ago in Q3, but still nonetheless better than historical numbers. 
One of the things that I mentioned picked up was nonfood. Again, the strength that we've seen in nonfoods has continued. It really started in the summer when people buying things for their home. Outside of that, certainly, I would expect on an ancillary business, taking gas out of it for a minute because that goes up and down at -- with a lot of factors causing it who the heck knows. But at the end of the day, if you look at some of the other ancillary businesses, I would expect to see, of course, margin improvement with optical and hearing aid relative to a year ago, for sure, even in Q4. 
Same thing with travel. Travel is coming back as we see on the news every night. Travel is coming back in a big way with the improvement with COVID as well as probably a lot of pent-up demand. And we're seeing that ourselves in our travel business. And that's a high-margin business, although a small piece of the total sales action for the company. 
So I think, overall, we seem to figure out how to get there in different ways, even something like Costco Logistics that in the last 3-or-so quarters, I pointed out, it was a 5 to 7 basis point hit to margin. It's finally -- anniversary-ed some of that, and hopefully, we'll start to show some improvement. But there's little things like that that might show you a little improvement in the future. 
So -- but overall, it gets back to our ability to price our goods for great value and being competitive and still hopefully improving the bottom line will continue. But we'll let you know each quarter."

We did see over the -- as COVID hit, there was, of course, a spike not only -- there was a big spike, a big increase with same-day fresh delivery in many -- in most cases, with us with our relationship with Instacart. And also doing ourselves 2-day dry grocery and some other items. 
And again, anecdotally, we know that we garnered some additional members that way. On the 2-day, since that is done via mostly UPS, you may have -- we've gotten some members that are outside of our geographic market areas of physical warehouses, but not a big giant number. So overall, I think if anything, we've seen our continued strength of adding net new members to existing warehouses. 
Certainly, opening new warehouses helps and perhaps getting a few related to the online next-day delivery of fresh and things like that. Beyond that, again, when we see who from -- again, from an age demographic, we're getting -- we think that we're getting our good share of younger people as we did in previous. That was -- historically, that was sometimes a concern of some on Wall Street. Is this for the older generation? And what we're finding is as long as we keep changing our product mix to gear towards our -- who the member is, and in our case, when you see what we've done with organics over the last 10 years or more now, and summer sporting equipment and you name it, we get our fair share of those people."

What we saw is the states that opened a little early, we started seeing a little bit more shopping frequency a little earlier like Texas and Florida, but not in a meaningful discernible way. Trend-wise, yes, but not like let's wait for that everywhere. 
But even in states that have been a little bit more closed, I mean the U.S., in particular, has opened up quite a bit in the last 1 month, 1.5 months as evidenced by new CDC guidelines and I think the spring weather in general, and so -- and just the pent up interest in doing that. So I think a lot of that's already in there. 
And in other countries, in Canada, there's still some -- for much of the last fiscal quarter, in about 38 of the 101 or 102 Costcos in Canada, one of the main provinces, there was limitations on -- we had to cordon off nonessential items or so nonfood items.

And we said that if you added back the stuff that we don't put in there like same-day fresh since third parties come in and buy it in the warehouse and take it to you, that 86% -- that 85% or 86% was up towards 100%.

But at the end of the day, we're improving in a big way. We actually were aggressive on pricing immediately. It's kind of like when we went into a new country like France or Spain, we're pricing in low volume, less efficient departments like fresh as if we were doing a lot of volume. And so those are examples where it's hurting us to start with as it relates to -- we're going to price the goods or lower the price of a mattress or a furniture set delivery based on what we can do before we actually do it. 
Now that's thankfully catching up for itself -- with itself. In terms of capacity, it has a lot of capacity. As I mentioned, right now, about 70% of our big and bulky is now delivered through Costco Logistics. Some of it was being delivered by third parties that we're doing fine, but now we're doing it ourselves. That business, as I mentioned, is continuing to grow very handily not only for us but industry-wide with furniture and things for the home, exercise equipment, TVs and the like. And we think that we have tremendous capacity available. What we bought was at a capacity of less than 50% of what it had been doing itself a few years before. But again, those aren't completely -- you can't completely compare those two. 
What we just bought was a huge facility and acreage that allow us to do more big and bulky and recognizing so many things come in from overseas in big and bulky, and it's again on the West Coast in California. And so it's going to help us continue to grow that business. 
We think we have a lot of growth. Way before COVID and more big and bulky and everything else, recall in the U.S., what we saw over the last 5 years, I think it was 5 years ago, we said in just white goods when all we did was sell them in store, we did about $50 million. And the year pre-COVID, 3 years hence, we did about $750 million or something. We're well beyond that now, both natural growth as well as what COVID has done in terms of people buying things for the home and then us being able to become more competitive on pricing. 
We've seen items, not across the board, but items where we've lowered the price by 10% and 15% or more, greatly improved the delivery time and are driving that business."

We did a big push starting several months ago to negotiate and offer some great deals on other, what I'll call, U.S., Mexico and Hawaii-type trips -- vacation trips. 
Yes. So bookings, they're not revenue yet, but bookings are particularly strong now. And hearing aid, you had a little bit of the same issue when they were essentially closed down because of direct one-to-one contact, when you're getting fitted for a hearing aid. There was a lot of pent-up demand that we've seen and we continue to see, the same with optical. We think that will continue to be normalized, but we'll have to wait and see.

And so you have a lower-than-average renewal rate to start with. When I look back at the 7 or 8 countries outside of the U.S. and Canada, I mean, there's 10 or so, but what we've seen is that instead of -- in the U.S. or Canada, we might add anywhere from 5,000 to 20,000 members in the first year, recognizing in some of these are existing markets. So you've got people shopping more often because they're closer to the new opening. 
We've enjoyed in Korea, Taiwan, Japan and even more so in China 50,000 to 100,000 new member sign-ups when we open up. And then a year later, 1.5 years later, when they're renewing -- when that first batch is renewing for the first time to get to that 88-plus worldwide renewal rate and the 90.1 in the U.S. and Canada, it starts off, it could be anywhere from the high 50s to the mid-60s in that first year. 
And I don't have in front of me what China is. But China is also outsized in that regard. I think we have close to 400,000 members in that 1 location. Remind you, it's a very large city and Costco entered as a well-known entity, notwithstanding the fact that it was our first one. So for all those reasons, it alone affected that worldwide renewal rate. 
We're not surprised. And by the way, even whatever renewals, nonrenewals we've been -- that have been incurred, we've gotten more than that in terms of new sign-ups. I think at the end of about 3 months after we opened in China, which was August of '19, we had around 300,000 members, and I think now we have about 400,000. So even if we've lost a bunch, we've gained a bunch plus some more."

In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 to [ 16 ] weeks ended August 29. 
Reported net income for the quarter came in at $1.67 billion or $3.76 per share. Last year's fourth quarter net income came in at $1.389 billion or $3.13 per diluted share. This year's fourth quarter included an $84 million pretax or $0.14 a share charge for the write-off of certain IT assets. Last year's fourth quarter included $281 million pretax charge or $0.47 a share of COVID-related costs, as well included a $36 million or $0.06 a share pretax charge related to the prepayment of $1.5 billion of debt, partially offset by an $84 million or $0.15 per share benefit for the partial reversal of a reserve related to a product tax assessment taken in the fiscal year 2019. 
Net sales for the quarter increased 17.5% to $61.44 billion, up from $52.28 billion a year earlier in the fourth quarter. Comparable sales for the fourth quarter, as reported an hour ago, for the 16 weeks on a reported basis, the U.S. was 14.9%. Excluding gas inflation and FX, the 14.9% would be 10.3% positive. Canada reported 19.5% plus; ex gas inflation and FX, 6.7%. Other international reported 15%. Without gas inflation and FX, 7.3%; total company, 15.5% reported, 9.4% ex gas inflation and FX. E-commerce, by the way, reported was 11.2% positive; ex gas inflation and FX 8.9%. 
In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 9.2% worldwide and 8.8% in the U.S. Our average transaction or basket was up 5.8% worldwide and 5.6% in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. Those numbers including the positive impact from gas inflation and FX. 
Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impact sales by approximately 230 basis points, whereas gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 385 basis points. 
Moving down the income statement to the membership line. Membership fee income for the fourth quarter came in at $1.234 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. That's up $128 million from the prior year's fourth quarter membership fee income of $1.106 billion. The $128 million represents an 11.7% increase year-over-year. Excluding the benefit from positive FX, the $128 million positive number would have been $107 million positive or a 9.7% effective increase. 
In terms of renewal rates, at the fourth quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 91.3%, up three-tenths of a percentage point from [ 16-week ] earlier number at Q3 end. And worldwide rate came in -- renewal rate came in at 88.7%, also up three-tenths of a percentage point from Q3 and 16 weeks earlier. 
Renewal rates are benefiting, we believe, for more members auto renewing as well as increased penetration of executive members who, on average, renew at a higher rate than nonexecutive members. Our first year renewal rates have also improved as well during this time. 
In terms of number of members at Q4 end, member households and total cardholders, at Q4 -- fiscal year-end a few weeks ago, total paid households were 61.7 million. That's up 1.1 million from the 60.6 million figure we shared with you 16 weeks earlier. Total cardholders came in at 111.6 million or 1.8 million higher than the 109.8 million we had as of Q3 end. 
At Q4 end, paid executive members were -- came in at 25.6 million, an increase of a little over 1 million new executive members, and that's during the 16-week period as well. 
Moving down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was lower year-over-year by 32 basis points. And actually, excluding gas deflation, it was higher by 5 basis points. 
As I usually do, I ask you jot down 2 columns of numbers, a little gross margin matrix, if you will. The line items will be core merchandise, ancillary -- second line item would be ancillary and other businesses. Third line item would be 2% reward. Fourth line item would be LIFO. And last line item would be other. And then the -- finally, the last line item would be total. 
2 columns. The first one being reported year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and the second column, excluding gas inflation. So core merchandise on a reported basis was lower year-over-year by 90 basis points. Ex gas inflation, it was lower, minus 57 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, plus 44 on a reported basis and plus 53 ex gas inflation. 2% reward, plus 1 basis point and minus 3 year-over-year on ex gas inflation. LIFO, minus 5 and minus 5 basis points. And other, plus 18 and plus 17. If you add up to 2 columns, you get the total for reported the 32 basis points that I just mentioned. And again, ex gas inflation, plus 5 basis points. 
Now the core merchandise component you see here are lower by 90 year-over-year and lower by 57 ex gas inflation. Similar to last quarter, this is primarily a function of sales shifting from core to ancillary versus the last year as we begin to revert back to more historical sales penetrations. Recall last year, we saw a significant shift of sales out of ancillary and other businesses and into the core. 
In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in the fourth quarter, the core on core margins were lower by 40 basis points, with nonfoods slightly up, food and sundries slightly lower year-over-year. Fresh foods was down and was the fundamental driver of the core, and core being lower in the quarter. Now fresh foods is lapping exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outsized sales a year ago in Q4. We retained some of that productivity gains -- some of those productivity gains as volumes have remained high. However, we've also elected to hold delay and/or mitigate some of the price increases in this increasingly inflationary environment over the last few months. 
Ancillary and other business gross margin, as you see in the chart in the matrix, was higher by 44 basis points and higher by 53 ex gas inflation in the quarter. Gasoline had a good quarter as we are lapping year-over-year a softer quarter due to the pandemic. We also showed improvement in food court, optical travel, all of which were benefited by easy compares versus last year also due to the impacts of COVID on those businesses. 
Now LIFO, this is a gross margin charge that we haven't seen in this matrix for about 7 years. LIFO was lower by 5 basis points, both with and without gas inflation. We had a $30 million LIFO charge in the quarter, the first such charge since 2014. This is a result of the continued inflationary cost pressures, which I'll discuss more in a few minutes.  
2% reward higher by 1 basis point on a reported basis, but more importantly, lower by 3 basis points ex gas inflation, again, implying a slightly higher penetration of sales going to the executive member and the associated rewards would come with it. And other is up 18 basis points and then up 17 ex gas inflation. This is primarily related to COVID-related costs from a year ago. 
Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the fourth quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 45 basis points and lower or better by 13 basis points, excluding gas inflation. 
Second matrix of the day, the 2 columns reported and ex gas inflation and 5 line items: operations. Second line item, central; third line item, stock compensation; fourth line item, other; and then total. On a reported basis, core operations was lower or better by plus 19 basis points and ex gas inflation higher by 8 basis points or minus 8 basis points. Central, plus 12 and plus 8%. Stock compensation, plus 2 and plus 2. And other, plus 12 and plus 11. Adding up the columns again, SG&A on a reported basis was better or lower by 45 basis points and lower ex gas inflation by 13. 
As you can see in the matrix, the core operations component again was better by 19 and higher by -- lower by 19 and then -- or higher by [ 8 ], excluding the impact from gas inflation. Keep in mind, this result includes the permanent $1 an hour wage increase that we implemented in March of this year. This higher by 8 basis point year-over-year expense result includes the 14 basis point cost of the dollar and hour wage increase. 
Central again improved by 8 basis points ex gas inflation. And stock compensation also with strong sales helped by 2 basis points. Now the other of plus 12 or plus 11 without gas inflation, so lower -- that was [indiscernible] basis points. Included in other last year was the COVID expense of $217 million or 42 basis points and the reversal of a product tax assessment reserve of $84 million or 16 basis points. This year includes the write-off of the IT assets totaling $84 million or 14 basis points. So you add all those up, that's where you get the 11. 
Next on the income statement is preopening. Preopening this year was $35 million. Last year, $26 million, so higher by $9 million. Preopening is up year-over-year in part due to the timing of openings and given a different amount of preopening on a given location but within the quarter and in the following quarter. 
All told, reported operating income in the fourth quarter increased by 18%, coming in at $2.275 billion this year compared to $1.929 billion a year earlier. 
Below the operating income line, interest expense was $52 million this year, essentially the same at $51 million a year ago. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $77 million year-over-year. Roughly half of that is due to favorable FX, and the other half is related to last year's fourth quarter charge for the make whole debt prepayment. Overall, reported pretax earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021 came in up 23%, coming in at $2.291 billion compared to last year's $1.869 billion. 
Now our tax rate in the fourth quarter was 26.1% higher than last year's fourth quarter rate of 24.9%. For fiscal '22, based on our current estimates, which, of course, can always change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate to be similar to fiscal '21, somewhere in the 26% to 27% range. Unless, of course, there are changes to the U.S. corporate tax rates, we'll have to see -- wait and see. 
A few other items of note, warehouse expansion. For fiscal '21, we just ended, we opened net openings of 20. We actually had 22 openings, including 2 relocations, but a total increase of 20 net units. This year, we're looking to open at least 25 net new units, including second warehouses in each of China and France and our first location in New Zealand. As well, we plan to relocate 5 locations. 
Regarding capital expenditures, our fourth quarter 2021 spend, capital expenditure was approximately $1.09 billion. Our full year CapEx spend was $3.59 billion. As I mentioned in the last quarter's call, this included a relatively recent $340 million purchase of a distribution facility on the West Coast to support our big and bulky delivery activities. 
For e-commerce, e-commerce sales in the fourth quarter ex FX increased by 8.9% year-over-year. That's on top of last year's Q4 e-commerce sales increase of 91%. 
Stronger departments, jewelry. We actually sold a couple of rings in the $100,000 range. Home furnishings was strong. Pharmacy was strong. And sporting goods was strong. A couple of other large departments like majors and electronics, while very good sales, we had really outsized sales a year ago in the fourth quarter during COVID. 
Update on Costco Logistics. Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales. For the quarter, Costco Logistics sales within -- our delivery was up 130%, and in the quarter, represented 24% of all sales on our U.S. e-commerce site. That compares to -- that 24% compared to 11% of e-commerce sales last year. Remind you, much of that relates to moving things from other third parties to our own internal logistics department. 
Approximately -- currently, approximately 7,000 to 10,000 daily deliveries via Costco Logistics are occurring and continuing to grow. 
In terms of our e-comm app, we have over 10 million downloads. It's continually improving, with additional features coming soon. Digital payment using the Costco credit card, it's in pilot in several locations with full rollout by the middle of next month. The ability to view warehouse receipts online also next month. More detail on online purchases as well. And by October end, we -- an improved mobile site, improved look and feel, a new landing page and expanded information both for dot-com use and for enhanced warehouse information. 
From a supply chain perspective -- I want to go back to 2 things, supply chain and inflation. From a supply chain perspective, the factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays, container shortages, COVID disruptions, shortages on various components, raw materials and ingredients, labor cost pressures and trucker and driver shortages -- trucks and driver shortages. 
Domestically, anecdotally rather, from -- even on the domestic side, various major brands are requesting longer lead times, some cases, difficulty in finding drivers and trucks on short notice. Lead times on ingredients and packaging have been extended in some cases. So planning is crucial, which I feel we -- our people have done a great job with that over the last several months. 
Also, we're putting some limitations on key items, like bath tissues, roll towels, Kirkland Signature water, high-demand cleaning-related SKUs related to the uptick in Delta-related demand. 
Furniture, delays and some shortages have caused traditional rollout times to go from 8 to 12 weeks -- from 8 to 12 weeks up to 16 to 18 weeks. In some ways, we think that's an advantage. We're selling out generally merchandise once it's received within 2 weeks on most items. And we've ordered more and earlier. 
Same thing with toys and [indiscernible], we're bringing in some of the items early. Chip shortages impacting many items, as I mentioned in the last call. Examples of impacted items, computers, tablets, video games, major appliances. Feeling is from the buyers as this will likely extend into 2022. Again, we're ordering as much as we can and getting it in earlier. And I think as evidenced by the most recent sales results, we're doing okay with this. 
Despite these issues -- sorry, in terms of transportation costs, they're increasing. We're reading about it every day. Containers, trucks and drivers all are impacting the timing of deliveries and higher freight costs. Despite all these issues, we continue to work to mitigate cost increases in a variety of different ways and hold down and/or mitigate our price increases passed on to the members. 
We've also chartered 3 ocean vessels for the next year to transport containers between Asia and the U.S. and Canada. And we've leased several thousand containers for use on these ships. Every ship can carry 800 to 1,000 containers at a time, and we'll make approximately 10 deliveries during the course of the next year. 
Moving to inflation. Again, there have been many -- there have been a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing, and more of it. As I discussed on last quarter's call, inflationary factors abound higher labor costs, higher freight costs, higher transportation demand, along with container shortages and port delays, increased demand in certain product categories, various shortages of everything from computer ships to oils and chemicals, higher commodities prices. It's a lot of fun right now. 
Some inflationary soundbites, if you will. Price increases on items shipped across the oceans, some suppliers or us paying to 6x for containers and shipping. Price increases of pulp and paper goods, some items up 4% to 8%. Again, we're trying to mitigate those where we can, and we think we've done a decent job of mitigating some of it. 
Plastics, resin increases on things like trash bags, the flux SKUs, pet products, including resin or a pet products, plastic cups, plates, plastic wrap, many items up in the 5% to 11% range. 
Metals, again, aluminum foil, mid-single-digit cost increases as well as cans for sodas and other beverages. I mentioned commodities earlier, oil, coffee, nuts, they remain generally according to our buyers at 5-year highs and so on. Higher import prices on things from Europe like cheeses, but the combination of freight and FX. 3% to 10% increases on certain but not all apparel items. And fresh foods, inflation is up in the mid- to high single digits, with meat leading the way, up high single to low double digits due to feed, labor and transportation costs. 
Now I was asked back in March at our second quarter earnings call, at what level we felt inflation was running overall on the sell price side? I stated that our best guess at the time was somewhere between 1% and 1.5%. I updated that 16 weeks earlier -- 16 weeks ago on our May 26 third quarter call, and we estimate to be in the 2.5% to 3.5% range. As of today and talking with our senior merchants, we would estimate overall price inflation of the products we're selling to be in the 3.5% to 4.5% range. 
As I discussed earlier, this inflation was the driver of the $30 million LIFO charge that we took in the quarter. But all of this said, I feel very good with the job that our merchants, our traffic department and our operators have all been doing and able to -- in order to get the products that we need, pivot when and where necessary and keep our warehouses full while keeping prices as low as we can for our members and continue to show incredible value versus our competitors. I think this is reflected in our strong reported sales and profits that we've achieved despite challenges and our typical aggressive pricing. 
Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, October 3, on Wednesday, October 6, after the market close. 
And with that, I will open it up for questions with Ann. Ann? Thank you."

Well, first of all, as it relates to all the anecdotal comments I made about supply chain and inflation, I think overall, we feel that we're doing a heck of a job in that stuff. And I think some of the advantage we have is, is that we certainly have the financial ability to bring in things early or to order early and to mitigate whatever delay may have occurred. We certainly have the space to keep some of this stuff, most particularly because of our Costco Logistics acquisition a year ago, 2 additional storage space, if you will. Not that we're having an issue with that because it's turning pretty fast. And the fact that we're able to pivot. We're bringing in new items. We're bringing in items off season. For Christmas, not -- pre-COVID, it was not -- it was toys and trimer home and electronics. Today, it's all those things, plus things for the house from barbecue grills, even summer items, but anything you can get your hands on. And again, I think we've done a very good job of adding suppliers where we can and also making sure we're coming up with new items and being creative and innovative on -- even on the food and sundry side. 
So I think from that standpoint, despite sometimes looking at each other, the merchants and the traffic people, everybody is saying, boy, this -- when is this going to end? The fact is I think we're doing a very good job with that. 
So from an inventory standpoint, I think for those of you who -- several of you do go in and visit our locations on a random basis, they're full. They look good compared to some of the pictures we see from others sometimes. And so I feel from that standpoint, we have a good issue. 
With inflation -- to the extent that there's permanent inflationary items like freight costs or even somewhat permanent for the next year, we can't hold on to all those. Some of that has to be passed on, and it is being passed on. We're pragmatic about it. But we recognize that since things have been so successful and our sales have been strong, we can hold the line on some of those things and do a little better job -- hopefully do a better job than some of our competitors have and be even that more extreme than the value.

But on the other hand, your ancillary businesses are doing really well. So is that dynamic where you're making up for the pressure on the fresh with strong ancillary, is that sustainable?

Knock on wood, always profitable, but it's still quite a range of gross margin. And that's more reflective of what's going on with competition in the retail gasoline market. 
We feel that sometimes other large retailers of gasoline are looking to make a little more, which gives us the ability to be quite profitable but still show an even bigger savings. So there's lots of puts and takes. 
Certainly, from last year, you had -- I mean I think there was a 16-week -- roughly a 16-week period where our optical and our hearing aid centers were outright closed. Travel went to literally having negative revenue because it was not having new business, and it was refunding previously booked business at the trough of COVID.

And by the way, the other thing there is that online, while we're constantly putting on what I'll call greater frequency, traffic building items for velocity items like apparel and health and beauty aids and things like that, the fact of the matter is, is more and more big and bulky items are bought online. Years ago, if you wanted to buy a mattress or a refrigerator, you had to go buy it and pick it up, take it home. We didn't deliver. We didn't install. That's, of course, changed in the last many years. And we have an appliance business in the U.S. that's well over $1 billion and growing fast -- continue to grow fast, helped by the Costco Logistics.

In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 to 16 weeks ended August 29.  
Reported net income for the quarter came in at $1.67 billion or $3.76 per share. Last year's fourth quarter net income came in at $1.389 billion or $3.13 per diluted share. This year's fourth quarter included an $84 million pretax or $0.14 a share charge for the write-off of certain IT assets. Last year's fourth quarter included $281 million pretax charge or $0.47 a share of COVID-related costs, as well included a $36 million or $0.06 a share pretax charge related to the prepayment of $1.5 billion of debt, partially offset by an $84 million or $0.15 per share benefit for the partial reversal of a reserve related to a product tax assessment taken in the fiscal year 2019.  
Net sales for the quarter increased 17.5% to $61.44 billion, up from $52.28 billion a year earlier in the fourth quarter. Comparable sales for the fourth quarter, as reported an hour ago, for the 16 weeks on a reported basis, U.S. was 14.9%. Excluding gas inflation and FX, the 14.9% would be 10.3% positive. Canada reported 19.5% plus; ex gas inflation and FX, 6.7%. Other international reported 15%. Without gas inflation and FX, 7.3%; total company, 15.5% reported, 9.4% ex gas inflation and FX. E-commerce, by the way, reported was 11.2% positive; ex gas inflation and FX, 8.9%.  
In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 9.2% worldwide and 8.8% in the U.S. Our average transaction or basket was up 5.8% worldwide and 5.6% in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. Those numbers including the positive impact from gas inflation and FX.  
Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impact sales by approximately 230 basis points, whereas gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 385 basis points.  
Moving down the income statement to the membership line. Membership fee income for the fourth quarter came in at $1.234 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. That's up $128 million from the prior year's fourth quarter membership fee income of $1.106 billion. The $128 million represents an 11.7% increase year-over-year. Excluding the benefit from positive FX, the $128 million positive number would have been $107 million positive or a 9.7% effective increase.  
In terms of renewal rates, at the fourth quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 91.3%, up 0.3 percentage point from 16-week earlier number at Q3 end. And worldwide rate came in -- renewal rate came in at 88.7%, also up 0.3 percentage point from Q3 and 16 weeks earlier. Renewal rates are benefiting, we believe, for more members auto renewing as well as increased penetration of executive members who, on average, renew at a higher rate than nonexecutive members. Our first year renewal rates have also improved as well during this time. 
In terms of number of members at Q4 end, member households and total cardholders, at Q4 -- fiscal year-end a few weeks ago, total paid households were 61.7 million. That's up 1.1 million from the 60.6 million figure we shared with you 16 weeks earlier. Total cardholders came in at 111.6 million or 1.8 million higher than the 109.8 million we had as of Q3 end. At Q4 end, paid executive members were -- came in at 25.6 million, an increase of a little over 1 million new executive members, and that's during the 16-week period as well.  
Moving down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was lower year-over-year by 32 basis points. And actually, excluding gas inflation, it was higher by 5 basis points. As I usually do, I ask you jot down 2 columns of numbers, a little gross margin matrix, if you will. The line items will be core merchandise, ancillary -- second line item would be ancillary and other businesses. Third line item would be 2% reward. Fourth line item would be LIFO. And last line item would be other. And then the -- finally, the last line item would be total. 
Two columns. The first one being reported year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and the second column, excluding gas inflation. So core merchandise on a reported basis was lower year-over-year by 90 basis points. Ex gas inflation, it was lower, minus 57 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, plus 44 on a reported basis and plus 53 ex gas inflation. 2% reward, plus 1 basis point and minus 3 year-over-year on ex gas inflation. LIFO, minus 5 and minus 5 basis points. And other, plus 18 and plus 17. If you add up to 2 columns, you get the total for reported, the 32 basis points that I just mentioned. And again, ex gas inflation, plus 5 basis points.  
Now the core merchandise component you see here are lower by 90 year-over-year and lower by 57 ex gas inflation. Similar to last quarter, this is primarily a function of sales shifting from core to ancillary versus the last year as we begin to revert back to more historical sales penetrations. Recall last year, we saw a significant shift of sales out of ancillary and other businesses and into the core.  
In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in the fourth quarter, the core-on-core margins were lower by 40 basis points with nonfood slightly up, food and sundries slightly lower year-over-year. Fresh foods was down and was the fundamental driver of the core, and core being lower in the quarter. Now fresh foods is lapping exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outsized sales a year ago in Q4. We retained some of that productivity gains -- some of those productivity gains as volumes have remained high. However, we've also elected to hold, delay and/or mitigate some of the price increases in this increasingly inflationary environment over the last few months.  
Ancillary and other business gross margin, as you see in the chart in the matrix, was higher by 44 basis points and higher by 53 ex gas inflation in the quarter. Gasoline had a good quarter as we are lapping year-over-year a softer quarter due to the pandemic. We also showed improvement in food court, optical, travel, all of which were benefited by easy compares versus last year, also due to the impacts of COVID on those businesses.  
Now LIFO, this is a gross margin charge that we haven't seen in this matrix for about 7 years. LIFO was lower by 5 basis points, both with and without gas inflation. We had a $30 million LIFO charge in the quarter, the first such charge since 2014. This is a result of the continued inflationary cost pressures, which I'll discuss more in a few minutes.   
2% reward, higher by 1 basis point on a reported basis, but more importantly, lower by 3 basis points ex gas inflation, again, implying a slightly higher penetration of sales going to the executive member and the associated rewards that come with it. And other is up 18 basis points and then up 17 ex gas inflation. This is primarily related to COVID-related costs from a year ago.  
Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the fourth quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 45 basis points and lower or better by 13 basis points, excluding gas inflation.  
Second matrix of the day, the 2 columns reported and ex gas inflation and 5 line items: operations; second line item, central; third line item, stock compensation; fourth line item, other; and then total. On a reported basis, core operations was lower or better by plus 19 basis points and ex gas inflation higher by 8 basis points or minus 8 basis points. Central, plus 12 and plus 8. Stock compensation, plus 2 and plus 2. And other, plus 12 and plus 11. Adding up the columns again, SG&A on a reported basis was better or lower by 45 basis points and lower ex gas inflation by 13.  
As you can see in the matrix, the core operations component again was better by 19 and higher by -- lower by 19 and then -- or higher by 8, excluding the impact from gas inflation. Keep in mind, this result includes the permanent $1 an hour wage increase that we implemented in March of this year. This higher by 8 basis point year-over-year expense result includes the 14 basis point cost of the $1 an hour wage increase. Central, again, improved by 8 basis points ex gas inflation. And stock compensation, also with strong sales, helped by 2 basis points. 
Now the other of plus 12 or plus 11 without gas inflation, so lower -- that was [ another ] basis points. Included in other last year was the COVID expense of $217 million or 42 basis points and the reversal of a product tax assessment reserve of $84 million or 16 basis points. This year includes the write-off of the IT assets totaling $84 million or 14 basis points. So you add all those up, that's where you get the 11.  
Next on the income statement is preopening. Preopening this year was $35 million. Last year, $26 million, so higher by $9 million. Preopening is up year-over-year in part due to the timing of openings and given different amount of preopening on a given location but within the quarter and in the following quarter. All told, reported operating income in the fourth quarter increased by 18%, coming in at $2.275 billion this year compared to $1.929 billion a year earlier. 
Below the operating income line, interest expense was $52 million this year, essentially the same at $51 million a year ago. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $77 million year-over-year. Roughly half of that is due to favorable FX, and the other half is related to last year's fourth quarter charge for the make-whole debt prepayment. Overall, reported pretax earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021 came in up 23%, coming in at $2.291 billion compared to last year's $1.869 billion. 
Now our tax rate in the fourth quarter was 26.1%, higher than last year's fourth quarter rate of 24.9%. For fiscal '22, based on our current estimates, which, of course, can always change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate to be similar to fiscal '21, somewhere in the 26% to 27% range. Unless, of course, there are changes to the U.S. corporate tax rates, we'll have to see -- wait and see. 
A few other items of note, warehouse expansion. For fiscal '21 we just ended, we opened net openings of 20. We actually had 22 openings, including 2 relocations, but a total increase of 20 net units. This year, we're looking to open at least 25 net new units, including second warehouses in each of China and France and our first location in New Zealand. As well, we plan to relocate 5 locations. 
Regarding capital expenditures, our fourth quarter 2021 spend, capital expenditure was approximately $1.09 billion. Our full year CapEx spend was $3.59 billion. As I mentioned in last quarter's call, this included a relatively recent $340 million purchase of a distribution facility on the West Coast to support our big and bulky delivery activities. 
For e-commerce, e-commerce sales in the fourth quarter ex FX increased by 8.9% year-over-year. That's on top of last year's Q4 e-commerce sales increase of 91%. 
Stronger departments, jewelry. We actually sold a couple of rings in the $100,000 range. Home furnishings was strong. Pharmacy was strong. And sporting goods was strong. A couple of other large departments like majors and electronics, while very good sales, we had really outsized sales a year ago in the fourth quarter during COVID. 
Update on Costco Logistics. Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales. For the quarter, Costco Logistics sales within -- our delivery was up 130%, and in the quarter, represented 24% of all sales on our U.S. e-commerce site. That compares to -- that 24% compared to 11% of e-commerce sales last year. Remind you, much of that relates to moving things from other third parties to our own internal logistics department. Approximately -- currently, approximately 7,000 to 10,000 daily deliveries via Costco Logistics are occurring and continuing to grow. 
In terms of our e-comm app, we have over 10 million downloads. It's continually improving, with additional features coming soon. Digital payment using the Costco credit card, it's in pilot in several locations with full rollout by the middle of next month. The ability to view warehouse receipts online, also next month. More detail on online purchases as well. And by October end, we -- an improved mobile site, improved look and feel, a new landing page and expanded information both for dot-com use and for enhanced warehouse information. 
From a supply chain perspective -- I want to go back to 2 things, supply chain and inflation. From a supply chain perspective, the factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays, container shortages, COVID disruptions, shortages on various components, raw materials and ingredients, labor cost pressures and trucker and driver shortages -- trucks and driver shortages. Domestically, anecdotally rather, from -- even on the domestic side, various major brands are requesting longer lead times, some cases, difficulty in finding drivers and trucks on short notice. Lead times on ingredients and packaging have been extended in some cases. So planning is crucial, which I feel we -- our people have done a great job with that over the last several months. 
Also, we're putting some limitations on key items, like bath tissues, roll towels, Kirkland Signature water, high-demand cleaning-related SKUs related to the uptick in Delta-related demand. 
Furniture delays and some shortages have caused traditional rollout times to go from 8 to 12 weeks -- from 8 to 12 weeks up to 16 to 18 weeks. In some ways, we think that's an advantage. We're selling out generally merchandise once it's received within 2 weeks on most items. And we've ordered more and earlier. Same thing with toys in season, we're bringing in some of the items early. 
Chip shortages impacting many items, as I mentioned in the last call. Examples of impacted items: computers, tablets, video games, major appliances. Feeling is from the buyers is this will likely extend into 2022. Again, we're ordering as much as we can and getting it in earlier. And I think as evidenced by the most recent sales results, we're doing okay with this. Despite these issues -- sorry, in terms of transportation costs, they're increasing. We're reading about it every day. Containers, trucks and drivers all are impacting the timing of deliveries and higher freight costs. Despite all these issues, we continue to work to mitigate cost increases in a variety of different ways and hold down and/or mitigate our price increases passed on to the members. 
We've also chartered 3 ocean vessels for the next year to transport containers between Asia and the U.S. and Canada. And we've leased several thousand containers for use on these ships. Every ship can carry 800 to 1,000 containers at a time, and we'll make approximately 10 deliveries during the course of the next year. 
Moving to inflation. Again, there have been many -- there have been a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing, and more of it. As I discussed on last quarter's call, inflationary factors abound: higher labor costs, higher freight costs, higher transportation demand, along with container shortages and port delays, increased demand in certain product categories, various shortages of everything from computer chips to oils and chemicals, higher commodities prices. It's a lot of fun right now. 
Some inflationary soundbites, if you will. Price increases on items shipped across the oceans, some suppliers or us paying to 6x for containers and shipping. Price increases of pulp and paper goods, some items up 4% to 8%. Again, we're trying to mitigate those where we can, and we think we've done a decent job of mitigating some of it. 
Plastics, resin increases on things like trash bags, Ziploc SKUs, pet products -- resin or [indiscernible] PET products, plastic cups, plates, plastic wrap, many items up in the 5% to 11% range. Metals, again, aluminum foil, mid-single-digit cost increases as well as cans for sodas and other beverages. 
I mentioned commodities earlier, oil, coffee, nuts, they remain generally according to our buyers at 5-year highs and so on. Higher import prices on things from Europe like cheeses, but the combination of freight and FX. 3% to 10% increases on certain but not all apparel items. And fresh foods, inflation is up in the mid- to high single digits, with meat leading the way, up high single to low double digits due to feed, labor and transportation costs. 
Now I was asked back in March at our second quarter earnings call, at what level we felt inflation was running overall on the sell price side. I stated that our best guess at the time was somewhere between 1% and 1.5%. I updated that 16 weeks earlier -- 16 weeks ago on our May 26 third quarter call, and we estimate to be in the 2.5% to 3.5% range. As of today and talking with our senior merchants, we would estimate overall price inflation of the products we're selling to be in the 3.5% to 4.5% range. 
As I discussed earlier, this inflation was the driver of the $30 million LIFO charge that we took in the quarter. But all of this said, I feel very good with the job that our merchants, our traffic department and our operators have all been doing and able to -- in order to get the products that we need, pivot when and where necessary and keep our warehouses full while keeping prices as low as we can for our members and continue to show incredible value versus our competitors. I think this is reflected in our strong reported sales and profits that we've achieved despite challenges and our typical aggressive pricing. 
Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, October 3, on Wednesday, October 6, after the market close. 
And with that, I will open it up for questions with Ann. Ann? Thank you."

Well, first of all, as it relates to all the anecdotal comments I made about supply chain and inflation, I think overall, we feel that we're doing a heck of a job in that stuff. And I think some of the advantage we have is, is that we certainly have the financial ability to bring in things early or to order early and to mitigate whatever delay may have occurred. We certainly have the space to keep some of this stuff, most particularly because of our Costco Logistics acquisition a year ago or 2, additional storage space, if you will. 
Not that we're having an issue with that because it's turning pretty fast. And the fact that we're able to pivot. We're bringing in new items. We're bringing in items off season. For Christmas, not -- pre-COVID, it was not -- it was toys and [ trimmer ], home and electronics. Today, it's all those things, plus things for the house from barbecue grills, even summer items, but anything you can get your hands on. And again, I think we've done a very good job of adding suppliers where we can and also making sure we're coming up with new items and being creative and innovative on -- even on the food and sundry side. 
So I think from that standpoint, despite sometimes looking at each other, the merchants and the traffic people, everybody is saying, boy, this -- when is this going to end? The fact is I think we're doing a very good job with that. So from an inventory standpoint, I think for those of you who -- several of you do go in and visit our locations on a random basis, they're full. They look good compared to some of the pictures we see from others sometimes. And so I feel from that standpoint, we have a good issue. 
With inflation -- to the extent that there's permanent inflationary items like freight costs or even somewhat permanent for the next year, we can't hold on to all those. Some of that has to be passed on, and it is being passed on. We're pragmatic about it. But we recognize that since things have been so successful and our sales have been strong, we can hold the line on some of those things and do a little better job -- hopefully do a better job than some of our competitors have and be even that more extreme than the value. So I think all those things so far, at least despite the challenges, have worked in our favor a little bit."

But specifically, you're giving back some of the core-on-core gross margin gains that you experienced from really strong fresh sales last year. But on the other hand, your ancillary businesses are doing really well. So is that dynamic where you're making up for the pressure on the fresh with strong ancillary, is that sustainable? And as part of that, the perception is that Costco tends to raise prices at a slower rate than others in the retail landscape, which tends to pressure its margins as inflation is heating up. What would be different this time to make that not happen?"

If you look at gasoline, which is a -- is 10-plus percent of our sales, it's a huge business, which can have huge variations of gross margin. Knock on wood, always profitable, but it's still quite a range of gross margin. And that's more reflective of what's going on with competition in the retail gasoline market. We feel that sometimes other large retailers of gasoline are looking to make a little more, which gives us the ability to be quite profitable but still show an even bigger savings. So there's lots of puts and takes. 
Certainly, from last year, you had -- I mean I think there was a 16-week -- roughly a 16-week period where our optical and our hearing aid centers were outright closed. Travel went to literally having negative revenue because it was not having new business, and it was refunding previously booked business at the trough of COVID. And so there's those kind of anomalies. 
Again, I get back to thinking that due to the unfortunate thing called COVID, some businesses have benefited in the sense that we were essential, in the sense that our cavernous places, we feel that people felt comfortable coming in. To the extent that we are able merchandise-wide to have pivoted and maintain, notwithstanding supply chain issues, maintain exciting full warehouses of merchandise. So I think those are the things that help us."

In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the 16 weeks ended August 29.  
Reported net income for the quarter came in at $1.67 billion or $3.76 per share. Last year's fourth quarter net income came in at $1.389 billion or $3.13 per diluted share. This year's fourth quarter included an $84 million pretax or $0.14 a share charge for the write-off of certain IT assets. Last year's fourth quarter included $281 million pretax charge or $0.47 a share of COVID-related costs, as well included a $36 million or $0.06 a share pretax charge related to the prepayment of $1.5 billion of debt, partially offset by an $84 million or $0.15 per share benefit for the partial reversal of a reserve related to a product tax assessment taken in the fiscal year 2019.  
Net sales for the quarter increased 17.5% to $61.44 billion, up from $52.28 billion a year earlier in the fourth quarter. Comparable sales for the fourth quarter, as reported an hour ago, for the 16 weeks on a reported basis, U.S. was 14.9%. Excluding gas inflation and FX, the 14.9% would be 10.3% positive. Canada reported 19.5% plus; ex gas inflation and FX, 6.7%. Other international reported 15%. Without gas inflation and FX, 7.3%; total company, 15.5% reported, 9.4% ex gas inflation and FX. E-commerce, by the way, reported was 11.2% positive; ex gas inflation and FX, 8.9%.  
In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 9.2% worldwide and 8.8% in the U.S. Our average transaction or basket was up 5.8% worldwide and 5.6% in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. Those numbers including the positive impact from gas inflation and FX.  
Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impact sales by approximately 230 basis points, whereas gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 385 basis points.  
Moving down the income statement to the membership line. Membership fee income for the fourth quarter came in at $1.234 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. That's up $128 million from the prior year's fourth quarter membership fee income of $1.106 billion. The $128 million represents an 11.7% increase year-over-year. Excluding the benefit from positive FX, the $128 million positive number would have been $107 million positive or a 9.7% effective increase.  
In terms of renewal rates, at the fourth quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 91.3%, up 0.3 percentage point from 16-week earlier number at Q3 end. And worldwide rate came in -- renewal rate came in at 88.7%, also up 0.3 percentage point from Q3 and 16 weeks earlier. Renewal rates are benefiting, we believe, for more members auto renewing as well as increased penetration of executive members who, on average, renew at a higher rate than nonexecutive members. Our first year renewal rates have also improved as well during this time. 
In terms of number of members at Q4 end, member households and total cardholders, at Q4 -- fiscal year-end a few weeks ago, total paid households were 61.7 million. That's up 1.1 million from the 60.6 million figure we shared with you 16 weeks earlier. Total cardholders came in at 111.6 million or 1.8 million higher than the 109.8 million we had as of Q3 end. At Q4 end, paid executive members were -- came in at 25.6 million, an increase of a little over 1 million new executive members, and that's during the 16-week period as well.  
Moving down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was lower year-over-year by 32 basis points. And actually, excluding gas inflation, it was higher by 5 basis points. As I usually do, I ask you jot down 2 columns of numbers, a little gross margin matrix, if you will. The line items will be core merchandise, ancillary -- second line item would be ancillary and other businesses. Third line item would be 2% Reward. Fourth line item would be LIFO. And last line item would be other. And then the -- finally, the last line item would be total. 
Two columns. The first one being reported year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and the second column, excluding gas inflation. So core merchandise on a reported basis was lower year-over-year by 90 basis points. Ex gas inflation, it was lower, minus 57 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, plus 44 on a reported basis and plus 53 ex gas inflation. 2% Reward, plus 1 basis point and minus 3 year-over-year on ex gas inflation. LIFO, minus 5 and minus 5 basis points. And other, plus 18 and plus 17. If you add up the 2 columns, you get the total for reported, the 32 basis points that I just mentioned. And again, ex gas inflation, plus 5 basis points.  
Now the core merchandise component you see here are lower by 90 year-over-year and lower by 57 ex gas inflation. Similar to last quarter, this is primarily a function of sales shifting from core to ancillary versus the last year as we begin to revert back to more historical sales penetrations. Recall last year, we saw a significant shift of sales out of ancillary and other businesses and into the core.  
In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in the fourth quarter, the core-on-core margins were lower by 40 basis points with nonfood slightly up, food and sundries slightly lower year-over-year. Fresh foods was down and was the fundamental driver of the core on core being lower in the quarter. Now fresh foods is lapping exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outsized sales a year ago in Q4. We retained some of that productivity gains -- some of those productivity gains as volumes have remained high. However, we've also elected to hold, delay and/or mitigate some of the price increases in this increasingly inflationary environment over the last few months.  
Ancillary and other business gross margin, as you see in the chart in the matrix, was higher by 44 basis points and higher by 53 ex gas inflation in the quarter. Gasoline had a good quarter as we are lapping year-over-year a softer quarter due to the pandemic. We also showed improvement in food court, optical, travel, all of which were benefited by easy compares versus last year, also due to the impacts of COVID on those businesses.  
Now LIFO, this is a gross margin charge that we haven't seen in this matrix for about 7 years. LIFO was lower by 5 basis points, both with and without gas inflation. We had a $30 million LIFO charge in the quarter, the first such charge since 2014. This is a result of the continued inflationary cost pressures, which I'll discuss more in a few minutes.   
2% Reward, higher by 1 basis point on a reported basis, but more importantly, lower by 3 basis points ex gas inflation, again, implying a slightly higher penetration of sales going to the executive member and the associated rewards that come with it. And other is up 18 basis points and then up 17 ex gas inflation. This is primarily related to COVID-related costs from a year ago.  
Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the fourth quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 45 basis points and lower or better by 13 basis points, excluding gas inflation.  
Second matrix of the day, the 2 columns reported and ex gas inflation and 5 line items: operations; second line item, central; third line item, stock compensation; fourth line item, other; and then total. On a reported basis, core operations was lower or better by plus 19 basis points and ex gas inflation higher by 8 basis points or minus 8 basis points. Central, plus 12 and plus 8. Stock compensation, plus 2 and plus 2. And other, plus 12 and plus 11. Adding up the columns again, SG&A on a reported basis was better or lower by 45 basis points and lower ex gas inflation by 13.  
As you can see in the matrix, the core operations component again was better by 19 and higher by -- lower by 19 and then -- or higher by 8, excluding the impact from gas inflation. Keep in mind, this result includes the permanent $1 an hour wage increase that we implemented in March of this year. This higher by 8 basis point year-over-year expense result includes the 14 basis point cost of the $1 an hour wage increase. Central, again, improved by 8 basis points ex gas inflation. And stock compensation, also with strong sales, helped by 2 basis points. 
Now the other of plus 12 or plus 11 without gas inflation, so lower -- that was [ another ] basis points. Included in other last year was the COVID expense of $217 million or 42 basis points and the reversal of a product tax assessment reserve of $84 million or 16 basis points. This year includes the write-off of the IT assets totaling $84 million or 14 basis points. So you add all those up, that's where you get the 11.  
Next on the income statement is preopening. Preopening this year was $35 million. Last year, $26 million, so higher by $9 million. Preopening is up year-over-year in part due to the timing of openings and given different amount of preopening on a given location both within the quarter and in the following quarter. All told, reported operating income in the fourth quarter increased by 18%, coming in at $2.275 billion this year compared to $1.929 billion a year earlier. 
Below the operating income line, interest expense was $52 million this year, essentially the same at $51 million a year ago. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $77 million year-over-year. Roughly half of that is due to favorable FX, and the other half is related to last year's fourth quarter charge for the make-whole debt prepayment. Overall, reported pretax earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021 came in up 23%, coming in at $2.291 billion compared to last year's $1.869 billion. 
Now our tax rate in the fourth quarter was 26.1%, higher than last year's fourth quarter rate of 24.9%. For fiscal '22, based on our current estimates, which, of course, can always change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate to be similar to fiscal '21, somewhere in the 26% to 27% range. Unless, of course, there are changes to the U.S. corporate tax rates, we'll have to see -- wait and see. 
A few other items of note, warehouse expansion. For fiscal '21 which just ended, we opened net openings of 20. We actually had 22 openings, including 2 relocations, but a total increase of 20 net units. This year, we're looking to open at least 25 net new units, including second warehouses in each of China and France and our first location in New Zealand. As well, we plan to relocate 5 locations. 
Regarding capital expenditures, our fourth quarter 2021 spend, capital expenditure was approximately $1.09 billion. Our full year CapEx spend was $3.59 billion. As I mentioned in last quarter's call, this included a relatively recent $340 million purchase of a distribution facility on the West Coast to support our big and bulky delivery activities. 
For e-commerce, e-commerce sales in the fourth quarter ex FX increased by 8.9% year-over-year. That's on top of last year's Q4 e-commerce sales increase of 91%. 
Stronger departments, jewelry. We actually sold a couple of rings in the $100,000 range. Home furnishings was strong. Pharmacy was strong. And sporting goods was strong. A couple of other large departments like majors and electronics, while very good sales, we had really outsized sales a year ago in the fourth quarter during COVID. 
Update on Costco Logistics. Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales. For the quarter, Costco Logistics sales within -- our delivery was up 130%, and in the quarter, represented 24% of all sales on our U.S. e-commerce site. That compares to -- that 24% compares to 11% of e-commerce sales last year. Mind you, much of that relates to moving things from other third parties to our own internal logistics department. Approximately -- currently, approximately 7,000 to 10,000 daily deliveries via Costco Logistics are occurring and continuing to grow. 
In terms of our e-comm app, we have over 10 million downloads. It's continually improving, with additional features coming soon. Digital payment using the Costco credit card, it's in pilot in several locations with full rollout by the middle of next month. The ability to view warehouse receipts online, also next month. More detail on online purchases as well. And by October end, we -- an improved mobile site, improved look and feel, a new landing page and expanded information both for dot-com use and for enhanced warehouse information. 
From a supply chain perspective -- I want to go back to 2 things, supply chain and inflation. From a supply chain perspective, the factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays, container shortages, COVID disruptions, shortages on various components, raw materials and ingredients, labor cost pressures and trucker and driver shortages -- trucks and driver shortages. Domestically, anecdotally rather, from -- even on the domestic side, various major brands are requesting longer lead times, some cases, difficulty in finding drivers and trucks on short notice. Lead times on ingredients and packaging have been extended in some cases. So planning is crucial, which I feel we -- our people have done a great job with that over the last several months. 
Also, we're putting some limitations on key items, like bath tissues, roll towels, Kirkland Signature water, high-demand cleaning-related SKUs related to the uptick in Delta-related demand. 
Furniture delays and some shortages have caused traditional rollout times to go from 8 to 12 weeks up to 16 to 18 weeks. In some ways, we think that's an advantage. We're selling out generally merchandise once it's received within 2 weeks on most items. And we've ordered more and earlier. Same thing with toys in season, we're bringing in some of the items early. 
Chip shortages impacting many items, as I mentioned in the last call. Examples of impacted items: computers, tablets, video games, major appliances. Feeling is from the buyers is this will likely extend into 2022. Again, we're ordering as much as we can and getting it in earlier. And I think as evidenced by the most recent sales results, we're doing okay with this. Despite these issues -- sorry, in terms of transportation costs, they're increasing. We're reading about it every day. Containers, trucks and drivers all are impacting the timing of deliveries and higher freight costs. Despite all these issues, we continue to work to mitigate cost increases in a variety of different ways and hold down and/or mitigate our price increases passed on to the members. 
We've also chartered 3 ocean vessels for the next year to transport containers between Asia and the U.S. and Canada. And we've leased several thousand containers for use on these ships. Every ship can carry 800 to 1,000 containers at a time, and we'll make approximately 10 deliveries during the course of the next year. 
Moving to inflation. Again, there have been many -- there have been a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing, and more of it. As I discussed on last quarter's call, inflationary factors abound: higher labor costs, higher freight costs, higher transportation demand, along with container shortages and port delays, increased demand in certain product categories, various shortages of everything from computer chips to oils and chemicals, higher commodities prices. It's a lot of fun right now. 
Some inflationary soundbites, if you will. Price increases on items shipped across the oceans, some suppliers or us paying 2 to 6x for containers and shipping. Price increases of pulp and paper goods, some items up 4% to 8%. Again, we're trying to mitigate those where we can, and we think we've done a decent job of mitigating some of it. 
Plastics, resin increases on things like trash bags, Ziploc SKUs, pet products -- resin or [indiscernible] PET products, plastic cups, plates, plastic wrap, many items up in the 5% to 11% range. Metals, again, aluminum foil, mid-single-digit cost increases as well as cans for sodas and other beverages. 
I mentioned commodities earlier, oil, coffee, nuts, they remain generally according to our buyers at 5-year highs and so on. Higher import prices on things from Europe like cheeses, for the combination of freight and FX. 3% to 10% increases on certain but not all apparel items. And fresh foods, inflation is up in the mid- to high single digits, with meat leading the way, up high single to low double digits due to feed, labor and transportation costs. 
Now I was asked back in March at our second quarter earnings call, at what level we felt inflation was running overall on the sell price side. I stated that our best guess at the time was somewhere between 1% and 1.5%. I updated that 16 weeks earlier -- 16 weeks ago on our May 26 third quarter call, and we estimate to be in the 2.5% to 3.5% range. As of today and talking with our senior merchants, we would estimate overall price inflation of the products we're selling to be in the 3.5% to 4.5% range. 
As I discussed earlier, this inflation was the driver of the $30 million LIFO charge that we took in the quarter. But all of this said, I feel very good with the job that our merchants, our traffic department and our operators have all been doing and able to -- in order to get the products that we need, pivot when and where necessary and keep our warehouses full while keeping prices as low as we can for our members and continuing to show incredible value versus our competitors. I think this is reflected in our strong reported sales and profits that we've achieved despite challenges and our typical aggressive pricing. 
Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, October 3, on Wednesday, October 6, after the market close. 
And with that, I will open it up for questions with Ann. Ann? Thank you."

We do have the dollar increase that started in March that will anniversary next February, so at the end of Q2 next year.

Well, first of all, as it relates to all the anecdotal comments I made about supply chain and inflation, I think overall, we feel that we're doing a heck of a job in that stuff. And I think some of the advantage we have is, is that we certainly have the financial ability to bring in things early or to order early and to mitigate whatever delay may have occurred. We certainly have the space to keep some of this stuff, most particularly because of our Costco Logistics acquisition a year ago, 2 additional storage space, if you will. 
Not that we're having an issue with that because it's turning pretty fast. And the fact that we're able to pivot. We're bringing in new items. We're bringing in items off season. For Christmas, not -- pre-COVID, it was not -- it was toys and Trim A Home and electronics. Today, it's all those things, plus things for the house from barbecue grills, even summer items, but anything you can get your hands on. And again, I think we've done a very good job of adding suppliers where we can and also making sure we're coming up with new items and being creative and innovative on -- even on the food and sundry side. 
So I think from that standpoint, despite sometimes looking at each other, the merchants and the traffic people, everybody is saying, boy, this -- when is this going to end? The fact is I think we're doing a very good job with that. So from an inventory standpoint, I think for those of you who -- several of you do go in and visit our locations on a random basis, they're full. They look good compared to some of the pictures we see from others sometimes. And so I feel from that standpoint, we have a good issue. 
With inflation -- to the extent that there's permanent inflationary items like freight costs or even somewhat permanent for the next year, we can't hold on to all those. Some of that has to be passed on, and it is being passed on. We're pragmatic about it. But we recognize that since things have been so successful and our sales have been strong, we can hold the line on some of those things and do a little better job -- hopefully do a better job than some of our competitors have and be even that more extreme in the value. So I think all those things so far, at least despite the challenges, have worked in our favor a little bit."

But on the other hand, your ancillary businesses are doing really well. So is that dynamic where you're making up for the pressure on the fresh with strong ancillary, is that sustainable? And as part of that, the perception is that Costco tends to raise prices at a slower rate than others in the retail landscape, which tends to pressure its margins as inflation is heating up. What would be different this time to make that not happen?"

If you look at gasoline, which is a -- is 10-plus percent of our sales, it's a huge business, which can have huge variations of gross margin. Knock on wood, always profitable, but it's still quite a range of gross margin. And that's more reflective of what's going on with competition in the retail gasoline market. We feel that sometimes other large retailers of gasoline are looking to make a little more, which gives us the ability to be quite profitable but still show an even bigger savings. So there's lots of puts and takes. 
Certainly, from last year, you had -- I mean I think there was a 16-week -- roughly a 16-week period where our optical and our hearing aid centers were outright closed. Travel went to literally having negative revenue because it was not having new business, and it was refunding previously booked business at the trough of COVID. And so there's those kind of anomalies. 
Again, I get back to thinking that due to the unfortunate thing called COVID, some businesses have benefited in the sense that we were essential, in the sense that our cavernous places, we feel that people felt comfortable coming in. To the extent that we are able merchandise wise to have pivoted and maintain, notwithstanding supply chain issues, maintain exciting full warehouses of merchandise.

As it relates to the other aspect of that, that's coming. We made a big investment in what I'll call data analytics for us because we went from darn near 0 to something, but brought on a VP of Data Analytics a year ago March. There's been a lot of progress. A lot of focus to date has been on the merchandising side, providing better tools to buy and to project and things like that. I think you'll see more of that over the next year.

In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the 16 weeks ended August 29.  
Reported net income for the quarter came in at $1.67 billion or $3.76 per share. Last year's fourth quarter net income came in at $1.389 billion or $3.13 per diluted share. This year's fourth quarter included an $84 million pretax or $0.14 a share charge for the write-off of certain IT assets. Last year's fourth quarter included $281 million pretax charge or $0.47 a share of COVID-related costs, as well included a $36 million or $0.06 a share pretax charge related to the prepayment of $1.5 billion of debt, partially offset by an $84 million or $0.15 per share benefit for the partial reversal of a reserve related to a product tax assessment taken in the fiscal year 2019.  
Net sales for the quarter increased 17.5% to $61.44 billion, up from $52.28 billion a year earlier in the fourth quarter. Comparable sales for the fourth quarter, as reported an hour ago, for the 16 weeks on a reported basis, U.S. was 14.9%. Excluding gas inflation and FX, the 14.9% would be 10.3% positive. Canada reported 19.5% plus; ex gas inflation and FX, 6.7%. Other international reported 15%. Without gas inflation and FX, 7.3%; total company, 15.5% reported, 9.4% ex gas inflation and FX. E-commerce, by the way, reported was 11.2% positive; ex gas inflation and FX, 8.9%.  
In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 9.2% worldwide and 8.8% in the U.S. Our average transaction or basket was up 5.8% worldwide and 5.6% in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. Those numbers including the positive impact from gas inflation and FX.  
Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impact sales by approximately 230 basis points, whereas gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 385 basis points.  
Moving down the income statement to the membership line. Membership fee income for the fourth quarter came in at $1.234 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. That's up $128 million from the prior year's fourth quarter membership fee income of $1.106 billion. The $128 million represents an 11.7% increase year-over-year. Excluding the benefit from positive FX, the $128 million positive number would have been $107 million positive or a 9.7% effective increase.  
In terms of renewal rates, at the fourth quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 91.3%, up 0.3 percentage point from 16-week earlier number at Q3 end. And worldwide rate came in -- renewal rate came in at 88.7%, also up 0.3 percentage point from Q3 and 16 weeks earlier. Renewal rates are benefiting, we believe, for more members auto renewing as well as increased penetration of executive members who, on average, renew at a higher rate than nonexecutive members. Our first year renewal rates have also improved as well during this time. 
In terms of number of members at Q4 end, member households and total cardholders, at Q4 -- fiscal year-end a few weeks ago, total paid households were 61.7 million. That's up 1.1 million from the 60.6 million figure we shared with you 16 weeks earlier. Total cardholders came in at 111.6 million or 1.8 million higher than the 109.8 million we had as of Q3 end. At Q4 end, paid executive members were -- came in at 25.6 million, an increase of a little over 1 million new executive members, and that's during the 16-week period as well.  
Moving down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was lower year-over-year by 32 basis points. And actually, excluding gas inflation, it was higher by 5 basis points. As I usually do, I ask you jot down 2 columns of numbers, a little gross margin matrix, if you will. The line items will be core merchandise, ancillary -- second line item would be ancillary and other businesses. Third line item would be 2% Reward. Fourth line item would be LIFO. And last line item would be other. And then the -- finally, the last line item would be total. 
Two columns. The first one being reported year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and the second column, excluding gas inflation. So core merchandise on a reported basis was lower year-over-year by 90 basis points. Ex gas inflation, it was lower, minus 57 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, plus 44 on a reported basis and plus 53 ex gas inflation. 2% Reward, plus 1 basis point and minus 3 year-over-year on ex gas inflation. LIFO, minus 5 and minus 5 basis points. And other, plus 18 and plus 17. If you add up the 2 columns, you get the total for reported, the 32 basis points that I just mentioned. And again, ex gas inflation, plus 5 basis points.  
Now the core merchandise component you see here are lower by 90 year-over-year and lower by 57 ex gas inflation. Similar to last quarter, this is primarily a function of sales shifting from core to ancillary versus the last year as we begin to revert back to more historical sales penetrations. Recall last year, we saw a significant shift of sales out of ancillary and other businesses and into the core.  
In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in the fourth quarter, the core-on-core margins were lower by 40 basis points with nonfood slightly up, food and sundries slightly lower year-over-year. Fresh foods was down and was the fundamental driver of the core on core being lower in the quarter. Now fresh foods is lapping exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outsized sales a year ago in Q4. We retained some of that productivity gains -- some of those productivity gains as volumes have remained high. However, we've also elected to hold, delay and/or mitigate some of the price increases in this increasingly inflationary environment over the last few months.  
Ancillary and other business gross margin, as you see in the chart in the matrix, was higher by 44 basis points and higher by 53 ex gas inflation in the quarter. Gasoline had a good quarter as we are lapping year-over-year a softer quarter due to the pandemic. We also showed improvement in food court, optical, travel, all of which were benefited by easy compares versus last year, also due to the impacts of COVID on those businesses.  
Now LIFO, this is a gross margin charge that we haven't seen in this matrix for about 7 years. LIFO was lower by 5 basis points, both with and without gas inflation. We had a $30 million LIFO charge in the quarter, the first such charge since 2014. This is a result of the continued inflationary cost pressures, which I'll discuss more in a few minutes.   
2% Reward, higher by 1 basis point on a reported basis, but more importantly, lower by 3 basis points ex gas inflation, again, implying a slightly higher penetration of sales going to the executive member and the associated rewards that come with it. And other is up 18 basis points and then up 17 ex gas inflation. This is primarily related to COVID-related costs from a year ago.  
Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the fourth quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 45 basis points and lower or better by 13 basis points, excluding gas inflation.  
Second matrix of the day, the 2 columns reported and ex gas inflation and 5 line items: operations; second line item, central; third line item, stock compensation; fourth line item, other; and then total. On a reported basis, core operations was lower or better by plus 19 basis points and ex gas inflation higher by 8 basis points or minus 8 basis points. Central, plus 12 and plus 8. Stock compensation, plus 2 and plus 2. And other, plus 12 and plus 11. Adding up the columns again, SG&A on a reported basis was better or lower by 45 basis points and lower ex gas inflation by 13.  
As you can see in the matrix, the core operations component again was better by 19 and higher by -- lower by 19 and then -- or higher by 8, excluding the impact from gas inflation. Keep in mind, this result includes the permanent $1 an hour wage increase that we implemented in March of this year. This higher by 8 basis point year-over-year expense result includes the 14 basis point cost of the $1 an hour wage increase. Central, again, improved by 8 basis points ex gas inflation. And stock compensation, also with strong sales, helped by 2 basis points. 
Now the other of plus 12 or plus 11 without gas inflation, so lower -- that was [ another ] basis points. Included in other last year was the COVID expense of $217 million or 42 basis points and the reversal of a product tax assessment reserve of $84 million or 16 basis points. This year includes the write-off of the IT assets totaling $84 million or 14 basis points. So you add all those up, that's where you get the 11.  
Next on the income statement is preopening. Preopening this year was $35 million. Last year, $26 million, so higher by $9 million. Preopening is up year-over-year in part due to the timing of openings and given different amount of preopening on a given location both within the quarter and in the following quarter. All told, reported operating income in the fourth quarter increased by 18%, coming in at $2.275 billion this year compared to $1.929 billion a year earlier. 
Below the operating income line, interest expense was $52 million this year, essentially the same at $51 million a year ago. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $77 million year-over-year. Roughly half of that is due to favorable FX, and the other half is related to last year's fourth quarter charge for the make-whole debt prepayment. Overall, reported pretax earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021 came in up 23%, coming in at $2.291 billion compared to last year's $1.869 billion. 
Now our tax rate in the fourth quarter was 26.1%, higher than last year's fourth quarter rate of 24.9%. For fiscal '22, based on our current estimates, which, of course, can always change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate to be similar to fiscal '21, somewhere in the 26% to 27% range. Unless, of course, there are changes to the U.S. corporate tax rates, we'll have to see -- wait and see. 
A few other items of note, warehouse expansion. For fiscal '21 which just ended, we opened net openings of 20. We actually had 22 openings, including 2 relocations, but a total increase of 20 net units. This year, we're looking to open at least 25 net new units, including second warehouses in each of China and France and our first location in New Zealand. As well, we plan to relocate 5 locations. 
Regarding capital expenditures, our fourth quarter 2021 spend, capital expenditure was approximately $1.09 billion. Our full year CapEx spend was $3.59 billion. As I mentioned in last quarter's call, this included a relatively recent $340 million purchase of a distribution facility on the West Coast to support our big and bulky delivery activities. 
For e-commerce, e-commerce sales in the fourth quarter ex FX increased by 8.9% year-over-year. That's on top of last year's Q4 e-commerce sales increase of 91%. 
Stronger departments, jewelry. We actually sold a couple of rings in the $100,000 range. Home furnishings was strong. Pharmacy was strong. And sporting goods was strong. A couple of other large departments like majors and electronics, while very good sales, we had really outsized sales a year ago in the fourth quarter during COVID. 
Update on Costco Logistics. Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales. For the quarter, Costco Logistics sales within -- our delivery was up 130%, and in the quarter, represented 24% of all sales on our U.S. e-commerce site. That compares to -- that 24% compares to 11% of e-commerce sales last year. Mind you, much of that relates to moving things from other third parties to our own internal logistics department. Approximately -- currently, approximately 7,000 to 10,000 daily deliveries via Costco Logistics are occurring and continuing to grow. 
In terms of our e-comm app, we have over 10 million downloads. It's continually improving, with additional features coming soon. Digital payment using the Costco credit card, it's in pilot in several locations with full rollout by the middle of next month. The ability to view warehouse receipts online, also next month. More detail on online purchases as well. And by October end, we -- an improved mobile site, improved look and feel, a new landing page and expanded information both for dot-com use and for enhanced warehouse information. 
From a supply chain perspective -- I want to go back to 2 things, supply chain and inflation. From a supply chain perspective, the factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays, container shortages, COVID disruptions, shortages on various components, raw materials and ingredients, labor cost pressures and trucker and driver shortages -- trucks and driver shortages. Domestically, anecdotally rather, from -- even on the domestic side, various major brands are requesting longer lead times, some cases, difficulty in finding drivers and trucks on short notice. Lead times on ingredients and packaging have been extended in some cases. So planning is crucial, which I feel we -- our people have done a great job with that over the last several months. 
Also, we're putting some limitations on key items, like bath tissues, roll towels, Kirkland Signature water, high-demand cleaning-related SKUs related to the uptick in Delta-related demand. 
Furniture delays and some shortages have caused traditional rollout times to go from 8 to 12 weeks up to 16 to 18 weeks. In some ways, we think that's an advantage. We're selling out generally merchandise once it's received within 2 weeks on most items. And we've ordered more and earlier. Same thing with toys in season, we're bringing in some of the items early. 
Chip shortages impacting many items, as I mentioned in the last call. Examples of impacted items: computers, tablets, video games, major appliances. Feeling is from the buyers is this will likely extend into 2022. Again, we're ordering as much as we can and getting it in earlier. And I think as evidenced by the most recent sales results, we're doing okay with this. Despite these issues -- sorry, in terms of transportation costs, they're increasing. We're reading about it every day. Containers, trucks and drivers all are impacting the timing of deliveries and higher freight costs. Despite all these issues, we continue to work to mitigate cost increases in a variety of different ways and hold down and/or mitigate our price increases passed on to the members. 
We've also chartered 3 ocean vessels for the next year to transport containers between Asia and the U.S. and Canada. And we've leased several thousand containers for use on these ships. Every ship can carry 800 to 1,000 containers at a time, and we'll make approximately 10 deliveries during the course of the next year. 
Moving to inflation. Again, there have been many -- there have been a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing, and more of it. As I discussed on last quarter's call, inflationary factors abound: higher labor costs, higher freight costs, higher transportation demand, along with container shortages and port delays, increased demand in certain product categories, various shortages of everything from computer chips to oils and chemicals, higher commodities prices. It's a lot of fun right now. 
Some inflationary soundbites, if you will. Price increases on items shipped across the oceans, some suppliers or us paying 2 to 6x for containers and shipping. Price increases of pulp and paper goods, some items up 4% to 8%. Again, we're trying to mitigate those where we can, and we think we've done a decent job of mitigating some of it. 
Plastics, resin increases on things like trash bags, Ziploc SKUs, pet products -- resin or [indiscernible] PET products, plastic cups, plates, plastic wrap, many items up in the 5% to 11% range. Metals, again, aluminum foil, mid-single-digit cost increases as well as cans for sodas and other beverages. 
I mentioned commodities earlier, oil, coffee, nuts, they remain generally according to our buyers at 5-year highs and so on. Higher import prices on things from Europe like cheeses, for the combination of freight and FX. 3% to 10% increases on certain but not all apparel items. And fresh foods, inflation is up in the mid- to high single digits, with meat leading the way, up high single to low double digits due to feed, labor and transportation costs. 
Now I was asked back in March at our second quarter earnings call, at what level we felt inflation was running overall on the sell price side. I stated that our best guess at the time was somewhere between 1% and 1.5%. I updated that 16 weeks earlier -- 16 weeks ago on our May 26 third quarter call, and we estimate to be in the 2.5% to 3.5% range. As of today and talking with our senior merchants, we would estimate overall price inflation of the products we're selling to be in the 3.5% to 4.5% range. 
As I discussed earlier, this inflation was the driver of the $30 million LIFO charge that we took in the quarter. But all of this said, I feel very good with the job that our merchants, our traffic department and our operators have all been doing and able to -- in order to get the products that we need, pivot when and where necessary and keep our warehouses full while keeping prices as low as we can for our members and continuing to show incredible value versus our competitors. I think this is reflected in our strong reported sales and profits that we've achieved despite challenges and our typical aggressive pricing. 
Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, October 3, on Wednesday, October 6, after the market close. 
And with that, I will open it up for questions with Ann. Ann? Thank you."

We do have the dollar increase that started in March that will anniversary next February, so at the end of Q2 next year.

Well, first of all, as it relates to all the anecdotal comments I made about supply chain and inflation, I think overall, we feel that we're doing a heck of a job in that stuff. And I think some of the advantage we have is, is that we certainly have the financial ability to bring in things early or to order early and to mitigate whatever delay may have occurred. We certainly have the space to keep some of this stuff, most particularly because of our Costco Logistics acquisition a year ago, 2 additional storage space, if you will. 
Not that we're having an issue with that because it's turning pretty fast. And the fact that we're able to pivot. We're bringing in new items. We're bringing in items off season. For Christmas, not -- pre-COVID, it was not -- it was toys and Trim A Home and electronics. Today, it's all those things, plus things for the house from barbecue grills, even summer items, but anything you can get your hands on. And again, I think we've done a very good job of adding suppliers where we can and also making sure we're coming up with new items and being creative and innovative on -- even on the food and sundry side. 
So I think from that standpoint, despite sometimes looking at each other, the merchants and the traffic people, everybody is saying, boy, this -- when is this going to end? The fact is I think we're doing a very good job with that. So from an inventory standpoint, I think for those of you who -- several of you do go in and visit our locations on a random basis, they're full. They look good compared to some of the pictures we see from others sometimes. And so I feel from that standpoint, we have a good issue. 
With inflation -- to the extent that there's permanent inflationary items like freight costs or even somewhat permanent for the next year, we can't hold on to all those. Some of that has to be passed on, and it is being passed on. We're pragmatic about it. But we recognize that since things have been so successful and our sales have been strong, we can hold the line on some of those things and do a little better job -- hopefully do a better job than some of our competitors have and be even that more extreme in the value. So I think all those things so far, at least despite the challenges, have worked in our favor a little bit."

But on the other hand, your ancillary businesses are doing really well. So is that dynamic where you're making up for the pressure on the fresh with strong ancillary, is that sustainable? And as part of that, the perception is that Costco tends to raise prices at a slower rate than others in the retail landscape, which tends to pressure its margins as inflation is heating up.

If you look at gasoline, which is a -- is 10-plus percent of our sales, it's a huge business, which can have huge variations of gross margin. Knock on wood, always profitable, but it's still quite a range of gross margin. And that's more reflective of what's going on with competition in the retail gasoline market. We feel that sometimes other large retailers of gasoline are looking to make a little more, which gives us the ability to be quite profitable but still show an even bigger savings. So there's lots of puts and takes. 
Certainly, from last year, you had -- I mean I think there was a 16-week -- roughly a 16-week period where our optical and our hearing aid centers were outright closed. Travel went to literally having negative revenue because it was not having new business, and it was refunding previously booked business at the trough of COVID. And so there's those kind of anomalies. 
Again, I get back to thinking that due to the unfortunate thing called COVID, some businesses have benefited in the sense that we were essential, in the sense that our cavernous places, we feel that people felt comfortable coming in. To the extent that we are able merchandise wise to have pivoted and maintain, notwithstanding supply chain issues, maintain exciting full warehouses of merchandise.

Years ago, if you wanted to buy a mattress or a refrigerator, you had to go buy it and pick it up and take it home. We didn't deliver. We didn't install.

In today's press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal '22, the 12 weeks ended November 21. Net income for the quarter came in at $1.324 billion or $2.98 per diluted share compared to $1.166 billion or $2.62 per diluted share last year. This year included a tax benefit of $91 million or $0.21 a share related to stock-based compensation and a write-off of certain IT assets of $118 million pretax or $0.20 per share. Last year included tax benefits of $145 million or $0.33 per diluted share, $0.16 of which was due to the deductibility of the $10 per share special cash dividend received by the company's 401(k) plan participants and $0.17 related to stock-based compensation as well an incremental expenses for COVID-19 premium wages of $212 million pretax, which was hit last year in the quarter of $0.35 per share. 
Net sales for the quarter increased 16.7% to $49.42 billion, up from $42.35 billion a year earlier in the first quarter. Same-store sales for the first quarter were as follows. In the U.S., on a reported basis for the 12 weeks, up 14.9%; and excluding gas inflation and the impacts of FX, up 9.9%. Canada reported 17.2%; ex gas and FX, plus 8.3%. Other International, reported, 13.4%; ex gas inflation and FX, up 10.9%. All told, the company reported a 15% increase on a comp basis and 9.8% up ex gas and FX. In e-commerce, which was reported at 14.3%, ex FX, was 13.3%. 
In terms of Q1 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.8% worldwide and up 5.9% in the U.S. during the quarter. Our average transaction or ticket was up 7.7% worldwide and 8.5% in the U.S. during the quarter. Excluding the positive impact from gas inflation and FX, the average ticket was up ex that plus 2.5% worldwide and plus 3.5% in the U.S. 
Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impact sales by about 90 basis points. And gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 430 basis points. 
Next on the income statement, membership fee income reported in the quarter, $946 million, up $85 million or 9.9% from last year's $861 million figure. ex FX, the $85 million increase would have been $80 million and the 9.9% increase would be 9.3%. 
In terms of renewal rates, at first quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate came in at 91.6%, up three-tenths of a percent from the 12-week earlier figure at Q4 end. As well, the worldwide rate came in at 89.0%, also up three-tenths of a percent from 12 weeks ago at Q4 quarter end -- at Q4 end. The renewal rates are continuing to benefit from more members' auto renewing as well as increased penetration of executive members who, on average, renew at a higher rate than the nonexecutive members and first year renewal rates, which have improved a little. 
In terms of number of members at end of first quarter -- in terms of member households as well as total cardholders, at Q1 end, total paid households was 62.5 million, up 800,000 from 61 7 a quarter ago. And total cardholders 113.1 million, up 1.5 million from the 111.6 million 12 weeks ago. 
At Q1 end, paid executive members totaled 26.5 million, an increase of 836,000 during the 12 weeks since Q4 end. Executive members represent 42% of our members and a little over 70% of our sales. 
Moving down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin for the first quarter was lower year-over-year by 49 basis points, and excluding gas inflation, lower year-over-year by 6 basis points. 
As I normally do, I ask you a jot down a few numbers. The 2 columns, both reported year-over-year in Q1 and then without gas inflation year-over-year in Q1. First line item would be core merchandise, minus 63 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis and minus 26 basis points without gas inflation. Ancillary and other businesses, plus 2 on a reported basis and plus 12 ex gas inflation; 2% Reward, plus 3 and minus 1 basis point; LIFO, minus 3 in both columns; other, plus 12 basis points in both columns. Total then on a reported basis, margins were down 49 basis points year-over-year; and ex gas inflation, down 6 basis points. 
In terms of the core merchandise component of gross margin being lower by 63% year-over-year and 26 basis points ex gas inflation. Recall last year in Q1, the core reported was up 83 basis points; and ex gas, up 66 basis points. So we retained a good portion of the improvement from 2 years ago in the quarter. 
In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in the first quarter, our core and core margins were lower by 18 basis points, with non-foods slightly up and food and sundries slightly lower year-over-year. Also lower year-over-year, fresh foods was the primary driver of the core being lower in the quarter. Fresh continues to lap exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outside sales that began the year -- that were -- that happened a year ago in the quarter. 
Ancillary and other business gross margin was higher by 2 basis points on a reported basis and, again, plus 12 basis points ex gas inflation. Gas and travel were better year-over-year as they anniversary a softer quarter a year ago, offset by e-comm, which was particularly strong a year ago and also related to the pandemic. 
LIFO, we had a 3 basis point or $14 million LIFO charge in the quarter. 2% Reward, higher by 3 on a reported basis and lower by 1, excluding gas inflation, a reflection of slightly higher sales penetration going to the increased number of executive members. And other was up 12 basis points. This is related to COVID-related costs from a year ago. That portion of the COVID-related wages that go into the cost of sales like many of our manufacturing businesses and our meat and bakery departments. 
Given the inflationary pressures and our ongoing efforts to mitigate price increases to our members in the face of inflation as best we can, our Q1 gross margin's results, all in all, I think were pretty good. 
Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the first quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 66 basis points and 29 basis points, excluding gas inflation. Again, jotting down 2 columns of numbers, first column being reported and the second column being ex gas inflation. Operations was better or lower by 40 basis points; and ex gas inflation, better or lower by 11 basis points. 
Central, reported better by 10; without inflation -- gas inflation, better by 6; stock compensation, better by 2 and worse by 1 in the 2 columns; and other, better by 14 and better by 13 year-over-year. Total then, again, on a reported basis, our SG&A was better or lower by 66 basis points; and ex gas inflation, lower or better by 29 basis points. 
The -- keep in mind in terms of the core, again, better by 40 or better by 11 ex gas inflation. Keep in mind, this result includes the permanent dollar an hour wage increase that began in March of 2021 and 4 weeks of additional starting wage increases that we just took this past October going from $16 to $17 and from $16.50 to $18 for our 2 main categories of hourly employees. These latest changes in the starting wages went into effect October 25, just 6 weeks ago, and 4 weeks of those 6 weeks were included in Q1. 
Central, that's -- no surprises there. Again, on an ex gas inflation basis, better by 6; stock comp, as I mentioned, a little better, a little worse by 1 ex gas inflation; and other, the 14 and the 13 basis points numbers. This consisted of the COVID expense of $159 million last year and the $118 million write-off of the impacted IT assets that I mentioned earlier. 
Next on the income statement is preopening expense. This year in the quarter, $28 million; last year in the quarter, $22 million or $6 million higher. All told, reported operating income in the first quarter increased 18%, coming in at $1.693 billion this year in the quarter compared to $1.43 billion last year. 
Below the operating income line, interest expense was $39 million, each of the first quarters of fiscal '21 and '22. Interest income -- interest expense, rather. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $13 million year-over-year, primarily due to favorable FX. Overall, reported pretax income in the first quarter was up 19%, coming in at $1.696 billion this year compared in the first quarter last year of $1.42 billion. 
In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter of '22 was 20.7% compared to 16.8% in Q1 last year. Again, both years' tax rates benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation, as mentioned earlier, at $91 million this year and $75 million last year in the quarter. Additionally, last year's tax rate benefited from the tax deductibility of the special dividend, that portion payable to the company's 401(k) plan participants. The fiscal '22 effective tax rate, excluding these discrete items, is currently projected to be between 26% and 27%. 
A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, as you know, for fiscal '21, we opened 22 units, including 2 relos, so a net increase of 20 units during fiscal '21. And this quarter that ended a couple of weeks ago, we opened 9 units, including 1 relo, so net openings of 8. For the remainder of the year, we plan to open 23 new units and also -- plan to open 23 units, 4 of which would be relocations, so a net of 19, if all goes as planned. 
It's been a busy past 7 days. We opened our second Costco in France last Saturday on December 4, followed by our second building in China, which opened yesterday, as well as 2 buildings opening this morning -- opening today, 1 in the U.S. and Florida and our fourth unit in Spain. 
Regarding CapEx, our first quarter fiscal '22 spend was approximately $1.05 billion. Our full year CapEx spend is estimated to be just about $4 billion. This would represent an increase of more than $400 million over last year's entire CapEx figure of $3.6 billion. The largest areas of increase coming from international spending for new warehouse expansion and increased investment in our logistics and e-comm fulfillment operations. 
In terms of e-commerce sales in the quarter, ex FX increased 13.3% year-over-year, and that's, of course, on top of an 86% plus increase a year ago in the first quarter. Stronger apartments in terms of [indiscernible] percentages include jewelry, tires and home furnishings. Our largest merchandise department in terms of sales majors, which is everything from consumer electronics and TVs to appliances, et cetera, was up in the high single digits, also on a very strong sales increase a year earlier. 
In terms of an update on Costco Logistics, it continues to drive our big and bulky sales. For the quarter, Costco Logistics deliveries were up over 50% and now represent about 70% of our U.S. e-comm big and bulky shipments. 
Average, we've averaged during the quarter more than 50,000 stops per week. And for the year, we project more than 3 million stops, which would be anything from dropping something off to installing and taking away the old appliance for logistics in the full year. 
Our e-comm mobile app, we continue to improve the site with additional features. Thus far, as I've talked about in the last few quarters -- quarterly calls, we redesigned the app header and footer. We've updated and improved the menu layout. Our members now have the ability to view warehouse receipts online via both the app and desktop. Our co-brand Citi/Visa card is now linked -- can now be linked to the digital membership card and can be used for payment. Our members are now able to much more easily reschedule e-comm deliveries in the U.S. and Canada, same goes for rescheduling returns, returns pickups. And delivering in the first half of the new upcoming new calendar year, labeling a fulfillment -- a better labeling of fulfillment methods, members will be able to easily see fulfillment options, be it e-comm, same day and even nearby warehouse availability of a particular item -- at a particular level. 
We're rolling out new e-comm kiosks in the warehouse, with video signage and easy touchscreen ordering. As well, we're rolling out e-commerce lockers. Currently in the U.S., we have 112 locations with more -- and we plan to more than double that number during calendar year 2022. 
In terms of e-commerce, there's a program that received some press just yesterday called Costco Next. In a way, it's like our warehouse roadshows but online. Currently, there are 34 suppliers and growing, but it's still quite small, offering just under 1,000 items, curated items with Costco value. So please check it out when you have a chance. 
From a supply chain perspective, similar issues that we outlined in 12 weeks ago on the last quarterly call. Each issue ebbs and flows a little bit. But overall, the factors pressuring supply chains, and inflation include port delays container challenges, COVID disruptions, shortages of very components, raw materials, ingredients and even packaging supplies, labor cost pressures and truck and driver challenges. Overall, we feel we've built pretty well with the supply chain challenges in terms of delayed container arrivals on the Pacific Coast. About 79% of our import containers are late by an average of 51 days, a few percentage of those are actually a few days early, and many of them are a few days more than 51 late. Virtually, all departments are impacted. We've ordered early in many cases, as I mentioned, I think, earlier -- on earlier calls given the longer lead times. Less product and packaging challenges, but still quite a bit. Still some limitations on key items, but improving. Again, it ebbs and flows. Chip shortage is still impacting many items, some more than others. In some instances, delayed inventory simply extends the season. An example might be lawn and garden and patio. As soon as the product arrives, it sells pretty quickly, but it may extend into -- beyond the normal seasonal time. 
Toys and seasonal, in fact, same thing, some inventory, in fact, won't make it before Christmas, but we've mitigated that as best as possible and feel pretty good about it. 
And in terms of -- moving on to -- despite all the supply chain issues, again, we're pretty -- feel pretty good about staying in stock and continuing to work to mitigate cost and price increases as best we can. 
Moving on to inflation. Again, it's pretty much the same story that we told during each of the last 2 quarters. There have been a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing from labor costs to freight costs, to higher demand, to container shortages and port delays, to increased demand on certain product categories, much of what you see and read out there, various shortages on everything from chips to oils and chemicals full supply by facilities hit by the gulf storms a while back, higher commodities prices. 
For Q1 '22 and talking with our merchants -- senior merchants, we estimate that overall year-over-year price inflation to be in the 4.5% to 5% range. That's a little bit higher of an estimated inflation rate that I discussed a quarter ago, but I think pretty consistent with what you read out there. All this said, much kudos to the job that our merchants and our traffic department and our operators have all been able to do in order to get the products that we need, pivot when and where necessary, and keep our warehouses full, while keeping prices low for our members and continuing to show value versus our competitors. 
Look, I think overall, this reflect -- this is best reflected in the operating results that we continue to achieve despite these many challenges. 
Anecdotally, on merchandising, holiday stuff has been strong. Again, sometimes it depends on when the merchandise gets in. Banking items, more people seem to be getting together are strong. Gift cards are up dramatically from a year ago, but it was weak a year ago. Pet products, as you might expect, are strong with the benefit of increasing pet population over the past couple of years. Alcohol and spirits are strong, including gift boxes of various items. And, of course, continued strength in consumer electronics, appliances, furniture and mattresses and the like. Apparel actually has enjoyed much stronger sales growth this year, albeit compared to a relatively flat apparel sales a year ago.

Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, January 2, on Wednesday, January 5, after market close. 
With that, I will open it up to questions and turn it back over to Sadie. Thank you."

First and foremost, I think because of our relative purchasing power and our relationships with vendors, we, with our suppliers, work to mitigate those increases in any way, shape or form we can. Ultimately, that may include us taking a little less markup and maybe them taking a little less markup. There's no complete consistent answer throughout, as you might expect. But overall, I think we've done a relatively good job with that, and there is inflation in those numbers. 
Those numbers are kind of a combination of our cost increases as well as our -- some price increases. And again, it fluctuates. There -- for every few examples of something going up, there may be an example of something flat or going down a little bit for unrelated reasons. And so again, it's a best guess. It's fluid. We saw inflation starting several months ago in a bigger way, I think, in our fiscal Q4 this summer and continuing into this fiscal year and as we all have read articles -- general articles out there about certain different major consumer product manufacturers announcing increases and continuing to do so. So I think it's going to continue. Hopefully, we're getting towards the top, and it'll start flattening out and subsiding. But we'll see."

Look, I think at the end of the day, I think we, in many ways, have benefited from market share gains. Hopefully, some or most of which will be sticky. The biggest thing that impacts margins many often is not only on the buying power side. And arguably, I can't think of any company that has the buying power per item that we do because we do our roughly $200 billion in sales with 4,000-ish items versus anybody else that's doing it with hundreds of thousands of items or 50,000 items. But I think that having higher levels of sales productivity, particularly in things like fresh foods, helps your margin. We'll keep some of that, and we'll use some of it to be even more competitive and hopefully build a bigger moat a little bit. But I think that some of it is probably structurally there. But as some famous TV actress said, once -- it's always going to be something, and we'll keep fighting that battle out there.

That may all change a little bit. But I feel -- we feel pretty good around here that one of the things that we've shown over the years that in both in good and bad times, we tend to do well. In good times because people want to spend more. And even in less good times, people want to save more. 
And so I think from a merchandising -- and in tougher times, there's additional products and services that might be willing to sell us for the first time. So in our own perverse way, we sometimes benefit from good and bad. And right now, we're feeling pretty good about what the future looks like. 
By the way, the other thing that -- Bob just mentioned that even if certain things head south in some way, shape or form like a reduction or elimination of certain stimulus items, supply chain at some point is going to get better. As good as our numbers are, we could do better if we had more supply of certain of those items. Even in some categories in nonfood that are up 20% and 30-plus percent, the buyer's view -- we're still running out of stuff or could do better if we had more. And that's not just us.

The pickup from things like Instacart for same-day fresh skyrocketed during the lockdowns in mid- to summer -- mid- to late summer 2020. It came down from those peaks, but it's still way above where it was pre COVID. E-commerce is, as you know, because we talk about every quarter, is 8% or 9% of our sales on a company that is $192 billion in sales for the year ended this last August. So that's a lot bigger than it was 2 years ago. 
I think the last 3 or 4 quarters, the 2-year stack is 100-plus percent. But notwithstanding that -- and part of that is the big and bulky that has helped that number, which we really weren't driving that kind of business in store anyway. 
The fact that I think that as we've heard occasionally that notwithstanding some people don't like our mask requirements when we first put them back in May of 2020, I think overall, people felt if I got to go out, I'm going to go out to one place and bulk up on stuff. And with taller ceilings and wider aisles and all those things, I got to believe that psychologically, that's helped a little bit. 
At the end of the day, we were all surprised by -- if you go back to March of 2020, we're surprised by the strength in non-foods categories. Summer and fall of 2020, much less now -- much the same now. And it was because people weren't traveling, and they weren't going to games and concerts, but they were buying things for their home. And we certainly had, on top of all the food items, all the other things they could buy for their homes. So that was a pleasant surprise to us, and that's continued. 
In terms of other tests, not a whole lot. I mean we did have that small test in New Mexico with buy online, pick up in-store. We are, as I mentioned on the call, have over -- a year from now have over 200 of our U.S. warehouses with lockers. 
In terms of buying online and pick up in-store, we're not quite sure about that. We have very busy locations. There's not a lot of room for it. And it doesn't seem to be a lot of people clamoring for a fact over half the people that come in and do that on a few things that we buy online and the lockers. They come in and shop while they're there. And so -- and that's what we want. 
So beyond that, I don't think -- I think some of the things we're doing that I mentioned briefly about mobile and digital, some of these things everybody else have. We are sometimes late to the game on some of these things, but those should be all net additive to what we do."

And recognizing -- we start with -- we are somewhat seasonal, but historically, you've always brought things in early anyway.

And so I think there's -- if you said, what are the big things taking you from the low 3s to the low 4s over a few years of period, it's more international expansions, which tends to be a little more expensive for location. More expansion. And we in fiscal '20, we were down to 13 net new units because some delays with COVID. I think we were 20 in 21, and we're going to be 27 net new units this fiscal year, plus 5 relos, which is -- 6 relos planned. We might miss that a little bit. But at the end of the day, so there's more warehouses. Clearly more in the whole fulfillment concept, starting with the $1 billion acquisition a year ago of what's now Costco Logistics, starting with adding additional square footage to that as well as the international things. 
And even on the distribution side or what we call our cross-dock depots, spending money overseas now in some of these countries to do some of that in a better way. Actually, building a mini depot in Hawaii where we have 5 locations -- 7 -- I'm sorry, 7 locations, but 7 huge volume locations and with -- so we've gotten to the volume and efficiency there that these are good investments.

We were going out to additional suppliers to see what we can get, recognizing from their perspective it creates a new relationships, which will honor going forward, not just for the 3 months that we needed it then. And so I think there are opportunities to just expand product brands by necessity to some things. 
And with, I think, the -- going into last summer and fall with that advent of all the things for the home, both patio furniture and lawn and garden and barbecue grills and indoor furniture and electronics and gadgets for the kitchen, we took advantage of that and brought in additional items. And so it's more of that than anything. And the treasure hunt, yes. So it's still a small piece, but I think it's -- when I -- sometimes when I go into some retailers, I'm not going to name names, but you'll see a shelf half empty or some spaces. First of all, why don't you put something there. And -- but at the end of the day, I think our buyers have done a very good job of keeping the warehouses full."

In today's press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal '22, the 12 weeks ended November 21. Net income for the quarter came in at $1.324 billion or $2.98 per diluted share compared to $1.166 billion or $2.62 per diluted share last year. This year included a tax benefit of $91 million or $0.21 a share related to stock-based compensation and a write-off of certain IT assets of $118 million pretax or $0.20 per share. 
Last year included tax benefits of $145 million or $0.33 per diluted share, $0.16 of which was due to the deductibility of the $10 per share special cash dividend received by the company's 401(k) plan participants and $0.17 related to stock-based compensation as well an incremental expenses for COVID-19 premium wages of $212 million pretax, which was hit last year in the quarter of $0.35 per share. 
Net sales for the quarter increased 16.7% to $49.42 billion, up from $42.35 billion a year earlier in the first quarter. Same-store sales for the first quarter were as follows. In the U.S., on a reported basis for the 12 weeks, up 14.9%; and excluding gas inflation and the impacts of FX, up 9.9%. Canada reported 17.2%; ex gas and FX, plus 8.3%. Other International, reported, 13.4%; ex gas inflation and FX, up 10.9%. All told, the company reported a 15% increase on a comp basis and 9.8% up ex gas and FX. In e-commerce, which was reported at 14.3%, ex FX, was 13.3%.
In terms of Q1 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.8% worldwide and up 5.9% in the U.S. during the quarter. Our average transaction or ticket was up 7.7% worldwide and 8.5% in the U.S. during the quarter. Excluding the positive impact from gas inflation and FX, the average ticket was up ex that plus 2.5% worldwide and plus 3.5% in the U.S. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impact sales by about 90 basis points. And gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 430 basis points.
Next on the income statement, membership fee income reported in the quarter, $946 million, up $85 million or 9.9% from last year's $861 million figure. Ex FX, the $85 million increase would have been $80 million and the 9.9% increase would be 9.3%.
In terms of renewal rates, at first quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate came in at 91.6%, up 0.3% from the 12-week earlier figure at Q4 end. As well, the worldwide rate came in at 89.0%, also up 0.3% from 12 weeks ago at Q4 quarter end -- at Q4 end. The renewal rates are continuing to benefit from more members auto renewing as well as increased penetration of executive members who, on average, renew at a higher rate than the nonexecutive members and first year renewal rates, which have improved a little.
In terms of number of members at end of first quarter -- in terms of member households as well as total cardholders, at Q1 end, total paid households was 62.5 million, up 800,000 from 61.7 million a quarter ago. And total cardholders 113.1 million, up 1.5 million from the 111.6 million 12 weeks ago. At Q1 end, paid executive members totaled 26.5 million, an increase of 836,000 during the 12 weeks since Q4 end. Executive members represent 42% of our members and a little over 70% of our sales. 
Moving down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin for the first quarter was lower year-over-year by 49 basis points, and excluding gas inflation, lower year-over-year by 6 basis points. As I normally do, I ask you a jot down a few numbers. The 2 columns, both reported year-over-year in Q1 and then without gas inflation year-over-year in Q1. 
First line item would be core merchandise, minus 63 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis and minus 26 basis points without gas inflation. Ancillary and other businesses, plus 2 on a reported basis and plus 12 ex gas inflation; 2% Reward, plus 3 and minus 1 basis point; LIFO, minus 3 in both columns; other, plus 12 basis points in both columns. Total then on a reported basis, margins were down 49 basis points year-over-year; and ex gas inflation, down 6 basis points. 
In terms of the core merchandise component of gross margin being lower by 63% year-over-year and 26 basis points ex gas inflation. Recall last year in Q1, the core reported was up 83 basis points; and ex gas, up 66 basis points. So we retained a good portion of the improvement from 2 years ago in the quarter. 
In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in the first quarter, our core-on-core margins were lower by 18 basis points, with non-foods slightly up and food and sundries slightly lower year-over-year. Also lower year-over-year, fresh foods was the primary driver of the core-on-core being lower in the quarter. Fresh continues to lap exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outside sales that began the year -- that happened a year ago in the quarter. 
Ancillary and other business gross margin was higher by 2 basis points on a reported basis and, again, plus 12 basis points ex gas inflation. Gas and travel were better year-over-year as they anniversary a softer quarter a year ago, offset by e-comm, which was particularly strong a year ago and also related to the pandemic. 
LIFO, we had a 3 basis point or $14 million LIFO charge in the quarter. 2% Reward, higher by 3 on a reported basis and lower by 1, excluding gas inflation, a reflection of slightly higher sales penetration going to the increased number of executive members. And other was up 12 basis points. This is related to COVID-related costs from a year ago. That portion of the COVID-related wages that go into the cost of sales like many of our manufacturing businesses and our meat and bakery departments. Given the inflationary pressures and our ongoing efforts to mitigate price increases to our members in the face of inflation as best we can, our Q1 gross margin's results, all in all, I think were pretty good. 
Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the first quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 66 basis points and 29 basis points, excluding gas inflation. Again, jotting down 2 columns of numbers, first column being reported and the second column being ex gas inflation. Operations was better or lower by 40 basis points, and ex gas inflation, better or lower by 11 basis points.
Central, reported better by 10; without inflation -- gas inflation, better by 6; stock compensation, better by 2 and worse by 1 in the 2 columns; and other, better by 14 and better by 13 year-over-year. Total then, again, on a reported basis, our SG&A was better or lower by 66 basis points, and ex gas inflation, lower or better by 29 basis points. 
Keep in mind, the terms of the core, again, better by 40 or better by 11 ex gas inflation. Keep in mind, this result includes the permanent $1 an hour wage increase that began in March of 2021 and 4 weeks of additional starting wage increases that we just took this past October, going from $16 to $17 and from $16.50 to $18 for our 2 main categories of hourly employees. These latest changes in the starting wages went into effect October 25, just 6 weeks ago, and 4 weeks of those 6 weeks were included in Q1.
Central, and that's -- no surprises there. Again, on an ex gas inflation basis, better by 6; stock comp, as I mentioned, a little better, a little worse by 1 ex gas inflation; and other, the 14 and the 13 basis points numbers. This consisted of a COVID expense of $159 million last year and the $118 million write-off of the impacted IT assets that I mentioned earlier.
Next on the income statement is preopening expense. This year in the quarter, $28 million; last year in the quarter, $22 million or $6 million higher. All told, reported operating income in the first quarter increased 18%, coming in at $1.693 billion this year in the quarter compared to $1.43 billion last year.
Below the operating income line, interest expense was $39 million each of the first quarters of fiscal '21 and '22. Interest income -- interest expense, rather. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $13 million year-over-year, primarily due to favorable FX. Overall, reported pretax income in the first quarter was up 19%, coming in at $1.696 billion this year compared in the first quarter last year of $1.42 billion. 
In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter of '22 was 20.7% compared to 16.8% in Q1 last year. Again, both years' tax rates benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation, as mentioned earlier, at $91 million this year and $75 million last year in the quarter. Additionally, last year's tax rate benefited from the tax deductibility of the special dividend, that portion payable to the company's 401(k) plan participants. The fiscal '22 effective tax rate, excluding these discrete items, is currently projected to be between 26% and 27%.
A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, as you know, for fiscal '21, we opened 22 units, including 2 relos, so a net increase of 20 units during fiscal '21. And this quarter that ended a couple of weeks ago, we opened 9 units, including one relo, so net openings of 8. For the remainder of the year, we plan to open 23 new units and also -- plan to open 23 units, 4 of which would be relocations. So a net of 19, if all goes as planned. 
It's been a busy past 7 days. We opened our second Costco in France last Saturday on December 4, followed by our second building in China, which opened yesterday, as well as 2 buildings opening this morning -- opening today, one in the U.S. and Florida and our fourth unit in Spain.
Regarding CapEx, our first quarter fiscal '22 spend was approximately $1.05 billion. Our full year CapEx spend is estimated to be just about $4 billion. This would represent an increase of more than $400 million over last year's entire CapEx figure of $3.6 billion. The largest areas of increase coming from international spending for new warehouse expansion and increased investment in our logistics and e-comm fulfillment operations. 
In terms of e-commerce sales in the quarter, ex FX increased 13.3% year-over-year, and that's, of course, on top of an 86% plus increase a year ago in the first quarter. Stronger apartments in terms of year of percentages include jewelry, tires and home furnishings. Our largest merchandise department in terms of sales majors, which is everything from consumer electronics and TVs to appliances, et cetera, was up in the high single digits, also on a very strong sales increase a year earlier.
In terms of an update on Costco Logistics, it continues to drive our big and bulky sales. For the quarter, Costco Logistics deliveries were up over 50% and now represent about 70% of our U.S. e-comm big and bulky shipments. 
Average, we've averaged during the quarter more than 50,000 stops per week. And for the year, we project more than 3 million stops, which would be anything from dropping something off to installing and taking away the old appliance for logistics in the full year.
Our e-comm mobile app, we continue to improve the site with additional features. Thus far, as I've talked about in the last few quarters -- quarterly calls, we redesigned the app header and footer. We've updated and improved the menu layout. Our members now have the ability to view warehouse receipts online via both the app and desktop. Our co-brand Citi/Visa card is now linked -- can now be linked to the digital membership card and can be used for payment. 
Our members are now able to much more easily reschedule e-comm deliveries in the U.S. and Canada, same goes for rescheduling returns, returns pickups. And delivering in the first half of the new -- upcoming new calendar year, labeling a fulfillment -- a better labeling of fulfillment methods, members will be able to easily see fulfillment options, be it e-comm, same day and even nearby warehouse availability of a particular item -- at a particular level. 
We're rolling out new e-comm kiosks in the warehouse, with video signage and easy touch screen ordering. As well, we're rolling out e-commerce lockers. Currently in the U.S., we have 112 locations with more -- and we plan to more than double that number during calendar year 2022. 
In terms of e-commerce, there's a program that received some press just yesterday called Costco Next. In a way, it's like our warehouse road shows but online. Currently, there are 34 suppliers and growing, but it's still quite small, offering just under 1,000 items, curated items with Costco value. So please check it out when you have a chance. 
From a supply chain perspective, similar issues that we outlined in 12 weeks ago on the last quarterly call. Each issue ebbs and flows a little bit. But overall, the factors pressuring supply chains, and inflation include port delays container challenges, COVID disruptions, shortages of varying components, raw materials, ingredients and even packaging supplies, labor cost pressures and truck and driver challenges. 
Overall, we feel we've dealt pretty well with the supply chain challenges in terms of delayed container arrivals on the Pacific Coast. About 79% of our import containers are late by an average of 51 days, a few percentage of those are actually a few days early, and many of them are a few days more than 51 late. 
Virtually all departments are impacted. We've ordered early in many cases, as I mentioned, I think, earlier -- on earlier calls, given the longer lead times. Less product and packaging challenges, but still quite a bit. Still some limitations on key items, but improving. Again, it ebbs and flows. Chip shortage is still impacting many items, some more than others. In some instances, delayed inventory simply extends the season. An example might be lawn and garden and patio. As soon as the product arrives, it sells pretty quickly, but it may extend into -- beyond the normal seasonal time. 
Toys and seasonal, in fact, same thing, some inventory, in fact, won't make it before Christmas, but we've mitigated that as best as possible and feel pretty good about it. And in terms of -- moving on to -- despite all the supply chain issues, again, we're pretty -- feel pretty good about staying in stock and continuing to work to mitigate cost and price increases as best we can. 
Moving on to inflation. Again, it's pretty much the same story that we told during each of the last 2 quarters. There have been a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing from labor costs to freight costs, to higher demand, to container shortages and port delays, to increased demand on certain product categories, much of what you see and read out there, various shortages on everything from chips to oils and chemicals still supplied by facilities hit by the gulf storms a while back, higher commodities prices.
For Q1 '22 and talking with our merchants -- senior merchants, we estimate that overall year-over-year price inflation to be in the 4.5% to 5% range. That's a little bit higher of an estimated inflation rate that I discussed a quarter ago, but I think pretty consistent with what you read out there. 
All this said, much kudos to the job that our merchants and our traffic department and our operators have all been able to do in order to get the products that we need, pivot when and where necessary, and keep our warehouses full, while keeping prices low for our members and continuing to show value versus our competitors. Look, I think overall, this is best reflected in the operating results that we continue to achieve despite these many challenges.
Anecdotally, on merchandising, holiday stuff has been strong. Again, sometimes it depends on when the merchandise gets in. Banking items, more people seem to be getting together are strong. Gift cards are up dramatically from a year ago, but it was weak a year ago. Pet products, as you might expect, are strong with the benefit of increasing pet population over the past couple of years.
Alcohol and spirits are strong, including gift boxes of various items. And, of course, continued strength in consumer electronics, appliances, furniture and mattresses and the like. Apparel actually has enjoyed much stronger sales growth this year, albeit compared to a relatively flat apparel sales a year ago. 
One last comment. Our sustainability commitment website received a major refresh this week. So please feel free to visit the site. It's linked directly from our home page under the column About Us and then click on Sustainability Commitment. 
Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, January 2, on Wednesday, January 5, after market close. 
With that, I will open it up to questions and turn it back over to Sadie. Thank you."

That seems to be a number that's in line with others across the retail sector. 
So has the posture changed with respect to passing along price increases? Why is that the case? And does Costco have more pricing power today than it ever has in the past given the pricing gaps between you and others in the market?"

First and foremost, I think because of our relative purchasing power and our relationships with our vendors, we, with our suppliers, work to mitigate those increases in any way, shape or form we can. 
Ultimately, that may include us taking a little less markup and maybe them taking a little less markup. There's no complete consistent answer throughout, as you might expect. But overall, I think we've done a relatively good job with that, and there is inflation in those numbers. Those numbers are kind of a combination of our cost increases as well as our -- some price increases. And again, it fluctuates. There's -- for every few examples of something going up, there may be an example of something flat or going down a little bit for unrelated reasons. 
And so again, it's a best guess. It's fluid. We saw inflation starting several months ago in a bigger way, I think, in our fiscal Q4 this summer and continuing into this fiscal year and as we all have read articles -- general articles out there about certain different major consumer product manufacturers announcing increases and continuing to do so. So I think it's going to continue. Hopefully, we're getting towards the top, and it'll start flattening out and subsiding. But we'll see."

Look, I think at the end of the day, I think we, in many ways, have benefited from market share gains. Hopefully, some or most of which will be sticky. The biggest thing that impacts margins many often is not only on the buying power side. And arguably, I can't think of any company that has the buying power per item that we do because we do our roughly $200 billion in sales with 4,000-ish items versus anybody else that's doing it with hundreds of thousands of items or 50,000 items. 
But I think that having higher levels of sales productivity, particularly in things like fresh foods, helps your margin. We'll keep some of that, and we'll use some of it to be even more competitive and hopefully build a bigger moat a little bit. But I think that some of it is probably structurally there. But as some famous TV actress said once, it's always going to be something. And we'll keep fighting that battle out there. 
But we feel pretty good about some of the structural things that have occurred that hopefully will help us in the future. But we'll have to wait and see."

But just when it comes -- is reduced a little, the next day, it's better than you expected. So I think the one thing that I feel good about is our in-stocks. Our senior merchant just the other day had indicated that his view is, is that -- his feeling is, is that we're better in-stock than anybody out there. And I think part of that is the fact of limited selection. We are an item business. We could put something else in place or something. But we've done a pretty good job. 
I mean I had -- it was a little bit of a chuckle at a call just yesterday from a reporter asking about how are we doing on cream cheese.

Look, if next year, there's a reduction in stimulus, Lord knows what's going to happen with the stock market in general and how people feel about where the -- how they feel financially. That may all change a little bit. But I feel -- we feel pretty good around here that one of the things that we've shown over the years that in both in good and bad times, we tend to do well. In good times because people want to spend more. And even in less good times, people want to save more.
And so I think from a merchandising -- and in tougher times, there's additional products and services that might be willing to sell us for the first time. So in our own perverse way, we sometimes benefit from good and bad. And right now, we're feeling pretty good about what the future looks like. 
By the way, the other thing -- Bob just mentioned that even if certain things head south in some way, shape or form like a reduction or elimination of certain stimulus items, supply chain at some point is going to get better. As good as our numbers are, we could do better if we had more supply of certain of those items. Even in some categories in nonfood that are up 20% and 30-plus percent, the buyer's view -- we're still running out of stuff or could do better if we had more. 
And that's not just us. I mean it rains on everybody. But I think some improvement in supply chain will be an offset to any other things that are detrimental to that thought."

The pickup from things like Instacart for same-day fresh skyrocketed during the lockdowns in mid- to summer -- mid- to late summer 2020. It came down from those peaks, but it's still way above where it was pre-COVID. E-commerce is, as you know, because we talk about every quarter, is 8% or 9% of our sales on a company that did $192 billion in sales for the year ended this last August. So that's a lot bigger than it was 2 years ago. 
I think the last 3 or 4 quarters, the 2-year stack is 100-plus percent. But notwithstanding that -- and part of that is the big and bulky that has helped that number, which we really weren't driving that kind of business in store anyway. 
The fact that I think that as we've heard occasionally that notwithstanding some people don't like our mask requirements when we first put them back in May of 2020, I think overall, people felt if I got to go out, I'm going to go out to one place and bulk up on stuff. And with taller ceilings and wider aisles and all those things, I got to believe that psychologically, that's helped a little bit. 
At the end of the day, we were all surprised by -- if you go back to March of 2020, we're surprised by the strength in non-foods categories. Summer and fall of 2020, much less now -- much the same now. And it was because people weren't traveling, and they weren't going to games and concerts, but they were buying things for their home. And we certainly had, on top of all the food items, all the other things they could buy for their homes. So that was a pleasant surprise to us, and that's continued. 
In terms of other tests, not a whole lot. I mean we did have that small test in New Mexico with buy online, pick up in-store. We are -- as I mentioned on the call, have over -- a year from now have over 200 of our U.S. warehouses with lockers. 
In terms of buying online and pick up in-store, we're not quite sure about that. We have very busy locations. There's not a lot of room for it. And it doesn't seem to be a lot of people clamoring for a fact over half the people that come in and do that on a few things that we buy online and the lockers. They come in and shop while they're there. And so -- and that's what we want. 
So beyond that, I don't think -- I think some of the things we're doing that I mentioned briefly about mobile and digital, some of these things everybody else have. We are sometimes late to the game on some of these things, but those should be all net additive to what we do."

And we essentially slightly more than doubled that with the Innovel acquisition. Aside from other things, that helps us with a little storage if we needed or bringing in things early. 
And recognizing -- we start with -- we are somewhat seasonal, but historically, we've always brought things in early anyway. So we -- whatever it may be, we certainly have the cash, as somebody mentioned earlier, to have some extra billion dollars invested in inventory, even if it hangs around for a little bit.

I think you previously as it relates to this year, we had talked about, I think, ""3 8 to 4 2."" Now we're saying about 4. These numbers are up from the mid-3s over the last couple of year -- low to mid-3s over the last couple of years. In fact, last year's 3 6 included a $340 million or $345 million asset purchase that I mentioned earlier in the Southwest and Southern California, which is basically 1.5 million-plus square foot facility with lots of acreage to help with our fulfillment as well as our import stuff. 
And so I think there's -- if you said, what are the big things taking you from the low 3s to the low 4s over a few years of period, it's more international expansions, which tends to be a little more expensive for location. More expansion. And in fiscal '20, we were down to 13 net new units because some delays with COVID. I think we were 20 in '21, and we're going to be 27 net new units this fiscal year, plus 5 relos, which is -- 6 relos planned. We might miss that a little bit. But at the end of the day, so there's more warehouses. Clearly more in the whole fulfillment concept, starting with the $1 billion acquisition a year ago of what's now Costco Logistics, starting with adding additional square footage to that as well as the international things. 
And even on the distribution side or what we call our cross-dock depots, spending money overseas now in some of these countries to do some of that in a better way. Actually, building a mini depot in Hawaii where we have 5 locations?  7, I'm sorry, 7 locations, but 7 huge volume locations and with -- so we've gotten to the volume and efficiency there that these are good investments. So it's a lot of those things. Mind you, we still spend all in close to $1 billion a year in IT."

And with, I think, the -- going into last summer and fall with that advent of all the things for the home, both patio furniture and lawn and garden and barbecue grills and indoor furniture and electronics and gadgets for the kitchen, we took advantage of that and brought in additional items.

In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the 16 weeks ended August 29.  
Reported net income for the quarter came in at $1.67 billion or $3.76 per share. Last year's fourth quarter net income came in at $1.389 billion or $3.13 per diluted share. This year's fourth quarter included an $84 million pretax or $0.14 a share charge for the write-off of certain IT assets. Last year's fourth quarter included $281 million pretax charge or $0.47 a share of COVID-related costs, as well included a $36 million or $0.06 a share pretax charge related to the prepayment of $1.5 billion of debt, partially offset by an $84 million or $0.15 per share benefit for the partial reversal of a reserve related to a product tax assessment taken in the fiscal year 2019.  
Net sales for the quarter increased 17.5% to $61.44 billion, up from $52.28 billion a year earlier in the fourth quarter. Comparable sales for the fourth quarter, as reported an hour ago, for the 16 weeks on a reported basis, U.S. was 14.9%. Excluding gas inflation and FX, the 14.9% would be 10.3% positive. Canada reported 19.5% plus; ex gas inflation and FX, 6.7%. Other international reported 15%. Without gas inflation and FX, 7.3%; total company, 15.5% reported, 9.4% ex gas inflation and FX. E-commerce, by the way, reported was 11.2% positive; ex gas inflation and FX, 8.9%.  
In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 9.2% worldwide and 8.8% in the U.S. Our average transaction or basket was up 5.8% worldwide and 5.6% in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. Those numbers including the positive impact from gas inflation and FX.  
Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impact sales by approximately 230 basis points, whereas gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 385 basis points.  
Moving down the income statement to the membership line. Membership fee income for the fourth quarter came in at $1.234 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. That's up $128 million from the prior year's fourth quarter membership fee income of $1.106 billion. The $128 million represents an 11.7% increase year-over-year. Excluding the benefit from positive FX, the $128 million positive number would have been $107 million positive or a 9.7% effective increase.  
In terms of renewal rates, at the fourth quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 91.3%, up 0.3 percentage point from 16-week earlier number at Q3 end. And worldwide rate came in -- renewal rate came in at 88.7%, also up 0.3 percentage point from Q3 and 16 weeks earlier. Renewal rates are benefiting, we believe, for more members auto renewing as well as increased penetration of executive members who, on average, renew at a higher rate than nonexecutive members. Our first year renewal rates have also improved as well during this time. 
In terms of number of members at Q4 end, member households and total cardholders, at Q4 -- fiscal year-end a few weeks ago, total paid households were 61.7 million. That's up 1.1 million from the 60.6 million figure we shared with you 16 weeks earlier. Total cardholders came in at 111.6 million or 1.8 million higher than the 109.8 million we had as of Q3 end. At Q4 end, paid executive members were -- came in at 25.6 million, an increase of a little over 1 million new executive members, and that's during the 16-week period as well.  
Moving down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was lower year-over-year by 32 basis points. And actually, excluding gas inflation, it was higher by 5 basis points. As I usually do, I ask you jot down 2 columns of numbers, a little gross margin matrix, if you will. The line items will be core merchandise, ancillary -- second line item would be ancillary and other businesses. Third line item would be 2% Reward. Fourth line item would be LIFO. And last line item would be other. And then the -- finally, the last line item would be total. 
Two columns. The first one being reported year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and the second column, excluding gas inflation. So core merchandise on a reported basis was lower year-over-year by 90 basis points. Ex gas inflation, it was lower, minus 57 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, plus 44 on a reported basis and plus 53 ex gas inflation. 2% Reward, plus 1 basis point and minus 3 year-over-year on ex gas inflation. LIFO, minus 5 and minus 5 basis points. And other, plus 18 and plus 17. If you add up the 2 columns, you get the total for reported, the 32 basis points that I just mentioned. And again, ex gas inflation, plus 5 basis points.  
Now the core merchandise component you see here are lower by 90 year-over-year and lower by 57 ex gas inflation. Similar to last quarter, this is primarily a function of sales shifting from core to ancillary versus the last year as we begin to revert back to more historical sales penetrations. Recall last year, we saw a significant shift of sales out of ancillary and other businesses and into the core.  
In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in the fourth quarter, the core-on-core margins were lower by 40 basis points with nonfood slightly up, food and sundries slightly lower year-over-year. Fresh foods was down and was the fundamental driver of the core on core being lower in the quarter. Now fresh foods is lapping exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outsized sales a year ago in Q4. We retained some of that productivity gains -- some of those productivity gains as volumes have remained high. However, we've also elected to hold, delay and/or mitigate some of the price increases in this increasingly inflationary environment over the last few months.  
Ancillary and other business gross margin, as you see in the chart in the matrix, was higher by 44 basis points and higher by 53 ex gas inflation in the quarter. Gasoline had a good quarter as we are lapping year-over-year a softer quarter due to the pandemic. We also showed improvement in food court, optical, travel, all of which were benefited by easy compares versus last year, also due to the impacts of COVID on those businesses.  
Now LIFO, this is a gross margin charge that we haven't seen in this matrix for about 7 years. LIFO was lower by 5 basis points, both with and without gas inflation. We had a $30 million LIFO charge in the quarter, the first such charge since 2014. This is a result of the continued inflationary cost pressures, which I'll discuss more in a few minutes.   
2% Reward, higher by 1 basis point on a reported basis, but more importantly, lower by 3 basis points ex gas inflation, again, implying a slightly higher penetration of sales going to the executive member and the associated rewards that come with it. And other is up 18 basis points and then up 17 ex gas inflation. This is primarily related to COVID-related costs from a year ago.  
Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the fourth quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 45 basis points and lower or better by 13 basis points, excluding gas inflation.  
Second matrix of the day, the 2 columns reported and ex gas inflation and 5 line items: operations; second line item, central; third line item, stock compensation; fourth line item, other; and then total. On a reported basis, core operations was lower or better by plus 19 basis points and ex gas inflation higher by 8 basis points or minus 8 basis points. Central, plus 12 and plus 8. Stock compensation, plus 2 and plus 2. And other, plus 12 and plus 11. Adding up the columns again, SG&A on a reported basis was better or lower by 45 basis points and lower ex gas inflation by 13.  
As you can see in the matrix, the core operations component again was better by 19 and higher by -- lower by 19 and then -- or higher by 8, excluding the impact from gas inflation. Keep in mind, this result includes the permanent $1 an hour wage increase that we implemented in March of this year. This higher by 8 basis point year-over-year expense result includes the 14 basis point cost of the $1 an hour wage increase. Central, again, improved by 8 basis points ex gas inflation. And stock compensation, also with strong sales, helped by 2 basis points. 
Now the other of plus 12 or plus 11 without gas inflation, so lower -- that was [ another ] basis points. Included in other last year was the COVID expense of $217 million or 42 basis points and the reversal of a product tax assessment reserve of $84 million or 16 basis points. This year includes the write-off of the IT assets totaling $84 million or 14 basis points. So you add all those up, that's where you get the 11.  
Next on the income statement is preopening. Preopening this year was $35 million. Last year, $26 million, so higher by $9 million. Preopening is up year-over-year in part due to the timing of openings and given different amount of preopening on a given location both within the quarter and in the following quarter. All told, reported operating income in the fourth quarter increased by 18%, coming in at $2.275 billion this year compared to $1.929 billion a year earlier. 
Below the operating income line, interest expense was $52 million this year, essentially the same at $51 million a year ago. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $77 million year-over-year. Roughly half of that is due to favorable FX, and the other half is related to last year's fourth quarter charge for the make-whole debt prepayment. Overall, reported pretax earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021 came in up 23%, coming in at $2.291 billion compared to last year's $1.869 billion. 
Now our tax rate in the fourth quarter was 26.1%, higher than last year's fourth quarter rate of 24.9%. For fiscal '22, based on our current estimates, which, of course, can always change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate to be similar to fiscal '21, somewhere in the 26% to 27% range. Unless, of course, there are changes to the U.S. corporate tax rates, we'll have to see -- wait and see. 
A few other items of note, warehouse expansion. For fiscal '21 which just ended, we opened net openings of 20. We actually had 22 openings, including 2 relocations, but a total increase of 20 net units. This year, we're looking to open at least 25 net new units, including second warehouses in each of China and France and our first location in New Zealand. As well, we plan to relocate 5 locations. 
Regarding capital expenditures, our fourth quarter 2021 spend, capital expenditure was approximately $1.09 billion. Our full year CapEx spend was $3.59 billion. As I mentioned in last quarter's call, this included a relatively recent $340 million purchase of a distribution facility on the West Coast to support our big and bulky delivery activities. 
For e-commerce, e-commerce sales in the fourth quarter ex FX increased by 8.9% year-over-year. That's on top of last year's Q4 e-commerce sales increase of 91%. 
Stronger departments, jewelry. We actually sold a couple of rings in the $100,000 range. Home furnishings was strong. Pharmacy was strong. And sporting goods was strong. A couple of other large departments like majors and electronics, while very good sales, we had really outsized sales a year ago in the fourth quarter during COVID. 
Update on Costco Logistics. Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales. For the quarter, Costco Logistics sales within -- our delivery was up 130%, and in the quarter, represented 24% of all sales on our U.S. e-commerce site. That compares to -- that 24% compares to 11% of e-commerce sales last year. Mind you, much of that relates to moving things from other third parties to our own internal logistics department. Approximately -- currently, approximately 7,000 to 10,000 daily deliveries via Costco Logistics are occurring and continuing to grow. 
In terms of our e-comm app, we have over 10 million downloads. It's continually improving, with additional features coming soon. Digital payment using the Costco credit card, it's in pilot in several locations with full rollout by the middle of next month. The ability to view warehouse receipts online, also next month. More detail on online purchases as well. And by October end, we -- an improved mobile site, improved look and feel, a new landing page and expanded information both for dot-com use and for enhanced warehouse information. 
From a supply chain perspective -- I want to go back to 2 things, supply chain and inflation. From a supply chain perspective, the factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays, container shortages, COVID disruptions, shortages on various components, raw materials and ingredients, labor cost pressures and trucker and driver shortages -- trucks and driver shortages. Domestically, anecdotally rather, from -- even on the domestic side, various major brands are requesting longer lead times, some cases, difficulty in finding drivers and trucks on short notice. Lead times on ingredients and packaging have been extended in some cases. So planning is crucial, which I feel we -- our people have done a great job with that over the last several months. 
Also, we're putting some limitations on key items, like bath tissues, roll towels, Kirkland Signature water, high-demand cleaning-related SKUs related to the uptick in Delta-related demand. 
Furniture delays and some shortages have caused traditional rollout times to go from 8 to 12 weeks up to 16 to 18 weeks. In some ways, we think that's an advantage. We're selling out generally merchandise once it's received within 2 weeks on most items. And we've ordered more and earlier. Same thing with toys in season, we're bringing in some of the items early. 
Chip shortages impacting many items, as I mentioned in the last call. Examples of impacted items: computers, tablets, video games, major appliances. Feeling is from the buyers is this will likely extend into 2022. Again, we're ordering as much as we can and getting it in earlier. And I think as evidenced by the most recent sales results, we're doing okay with this. Despite these issues -- sorry, in terms of transportation costs, they're increasing. We're reading about it every day. Containers, trucks and drivers all are impacting the timing of deliveries and higher freight costs. Despite all these issues, we continue to work to mitigate cost increases in a variety of different ways and hold down and/or mitigate our price increases passed on to the members. 
We've also chartered 3 ocean vessels for the next year to transport containers between Asia and the U.S. and Canada. And we've leased several thousand containers for use on these ships. Every ship can carry 800 to 1,000 containers at a time, and we'll make approximately 10 deliveries during the course of the next year. 
Moving to inflation. Again, there have been many -- there have been a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing, and more of it. As I discussed on last quarter's call, inflationary factors abound: higher labor costs, higher freight costs, higher transportation demand, along with container shortages and port delays, increased demand in certain product categories, various shortages of everything from computer chips to oils and chemicals, higher commodities prices. It's a lot of fun right now. 
Some inflationary soundbites, if you will. Price increases on items shipped across the oceans, some suppliers or us paying 2 to 6x for containers and shipping. Price increases of pulp and paper goods, some items up 4% to 8%. Again, we're trying to mitigate those where we can, and we think we've done a decent job of mitigating some of it. 
Plastics, resin increases on things like trash bags, Ziploc SKUs, pet products -- resin or [indiscernible] PET products, plastic cups, plates, plastic wrap, many items up in the 5% to 11% range. Metals, again, aluminum foil, mid-single-digit cost increases as well as cans for sodas and other beverages. 
I mentioned commodities earlier, oil, coffee, nuts, they remain generally according to our buyers at 5-year highs and so on. Higher import prices on things from Europe like cheeses, for the combination of freight and FX. 3% to 10% increases on certain but not all apparel items. And fresh foods, inflation is up in the mid- to high single digits, with meat leading the way, up high single to low double digits due to feed, labor and transportation costs. 
Now I was asked back in March at our second quarter earnings call, at what level we felt inflation was running overall on the sell price side. I stated that our best guess at the time was somewhere between 1% and 1.5%. I updated that 16 weeks earlier -- 16 weeks ago on our May 26 third quarter call, and we estimate to be in the 2.5% to 3.5% range. As of today and talking with our senior merchants, we would estimate overall price inflation of the products we're selling to be in the 3.5% to 4.5% range. 
As I discussed earlier, this inflation was the driver of the $30 million LIFO charge that we took in the quarter. But all of this said, I feel very good with the job that our merchants, our traffic department and our operators have all been doing and able to -- in order to get the products that we need, pivot when and where necessary and keep our warehouses full while keeping prices as low as we can for our members and continuing to show incredible value versus our competitors. I think this is reflected in our strong reported sales and profits that we've achieved despite challenges and our typical aggressive pricing. 
Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, October 3, on Wednesday, October 6, after the market close. 
And with that, I will open it up for questions with Ann. Ann? Thank you."

Well, first of all, as it relates to all the anecdotal comments I made about supply chain and inflation, I think overall, we feel that we're doing a heck of a job in that stuff. And I think some of the advantage we have is, is that we certainly have the financial ability to bring in things early or to order early and to mitigate whatever delay may have occurred. We certainly have the space to keep some of this stuff, most particularly because of our Costco Logistics acquisition a year ago, 2 additional storage space, if you will. 
Not that we're having an issue with that because it's turning pretty fast. And the fact that we're able to pivot. We're bringing in new items. We're bringing in items off season. For Christmas, not -- pre-COVID, it was not -- it was toys and Trim A Home and electronics. Today, it's all those things, plus things for the house from barbecue grills, even summer items, but anything you can get your hands on. And again, I think we've done a very good job of adding suppliers where we can and also making sure we're coming up with new items and being creative and innovative on -- even on the food and sundry side. 
So I think from that standpoint, despite sometimes looking at each other, the merchants and the traffic people, everybody is saying, boy, this -- when is this going to end? The fact is I think we're doing a very good job with that. So from an inventory standpoint, I think for those of you who -- several of you do go in and visit our locations on a random basis, they're full. They look good compared to some of the pictures we see from others sometimes. And so I feel from that standpoint, we have a good issue. 
With inflation -- to the extent that there's permanent inflationary items like freight costs or even somewhat permanent for the next year, we can't hold on to all those. Some of that has to be passed on, and it is being passed on. We're pragmatic about it. But we recognize that since things have been so successful and our sales have been strong, we can hold the line on some of those things and do a little better job -- hopefully do a better job than some of our competitors have and be even that more extreme in the value. So I think all those things so far, at least despite the challenges, have worked in our favor a little bit."

But on the other hand, your ancillary businesses are doing really well. So is that dynamic where you're making up for the pressure on the fresh with strong ancillary, is that sustainable? And as part of that, the perception is that Costco tends to raise prices at a slower rate than others in the retail landscape, which tends to pressure its margins as inflation is heating up.

If you look at gasoline, which is a -- is 10-plus percent of our sales, it's a huge business, which can have huge variations of gross margin. Knock on wood, always profitable, but it's still quite a range of gross margin. And that's more reflective of what's going on with competition in the retail gasoline market. We feel that sometimes other large retailers of gasoline are looking to make a little more, which gives us the ability to be quite profitable but still show an even bigger savings. So there's lots of puts and takes. 
Certainly, from last year, you had -- I mean I think there was a 16-week -- roughly a 16-week period where our optical and our hearing aid centers were outright closed. Travel went to literally having negative revenue because it was not having new business, and it was refunding previously booked business at the trough of COVID. And so there's those kind of anomalies. 
Again, I get back to thinking that due to the unfortunate thing called COVID, some businesses have benefited in the sense that we were essential, in the sense that our cavernous places, we feel that people felt comfortable coming in. To the extent that we are able merchandise wise to have pivoted and maintain, notwithstanding supply chain issues, maintain exciting full warehouses of merchandise.

I remember years ago, somebody had asked when the economy had softened and our comps had weakened a little bit, and we're coming up on kind of that fifth anniversary-ish of a pending increase and somebody said, given the economy is weaker, you -- and your sales have weakened a little bit, still a positive number, but weakened a little bit, would you still do it?

We're going to do what we do as merchants and look at competitive prices and see how low we can mark something up. And the old saying from years ago, we want to improve margins by lowering -- and lower prices at the same time by buying better and doing those things. So I don't see that happening at all. 
As it relates to the other aspect of that, that's coming. We made a big investment in what I'll call data analytics for us because we went from darn near 0 to something, but brought on a VP of Data Analytics a year ago March. There's been a lot of progress. A lot of focus to date has been on the merchandising side, providing better tools to buy and to project and things like that. I think you'll see more of that over the next year. But again, we're getting there. 
I always look at it as some of the things that others are doing that will help. It's low-hanging fruit for us because we haven't done it yet, but we'll keep going. But that's where a lot of the data analytics function to date in this past year as we built a department around it has been just that."
