I'll start our discussion with a few high-level thoughts on our progress so far this year, and then Jason will review our second quarter results and our updated fiscal '21 outlook. I'll close by sharing updates regarding our growth areas. We continue to make progress on our strategic plan as we navigate the rapidly changing global environment. Overall, second quarter operating results came in better than our expectations, led by the medical segment. In addition,  we saw some favorability, including timing below the operating line, enabling us to deliver EPS growth of 14% in the quarter. Due to our solid first half performance and our improved visibility into the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing and narrowing our EPS guidance to a range of $5.85 to $6.10 per share. In the second quarter, we saw varying effects of the pandemic on our business. Our medical segment saw a net positive impact related to COVID-19 as our lab business and PPE products continue to experience strong demand. And in pharma, although the pandemic continued to adversely impact volumes, mainly in generics and nuclear imaging, areas like specialty and consumer health are recovering and performing very well. Across the company, we remain focused on doing our part to support ongoing pandemic release efforts. In pharma, we partnered with the CDC to act as a network administrator, enabling retail independent, small chain and long-term care pharmacy customers to participate in the vaccination effort. And in medical, we partnered with the state of Ohio to support vaccine distribution through our OptiFreight logistics business. Regarding PPE, we are utilizing our supply assurance program to manage costs for our customers and provide consistent long-range supply in key product categories. We are seeing improving supply in some of these product categories such as gowns and masks, but continue to see a challenging market with exam gloves. 
Looking ahead, we remain committed to supporting our customers, patients, government and communities through the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, and we are ready and willing to help in any way possible. Before I provide some updates on our strategic growth areas, I'll turn it over to Jason to share more details on our second quarter and outlook for the year."
172207,700099205,2194383,"Cardinal Health, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2021",2021-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Cardinal Health, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with total company results, second quarter EPS was $1.74, reflecting a 14% increase driven by discrete tax items and strong medical results. Total second quarter revenue increased 5% to $41.5 billion, dr",1153,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with total company results, second quarter EPS was $1.74, reflecting a 14% increase driven by discrete tax items and strong medical results. Total second quarter revenue increased 5% to $41.5 billion, driven primarily by sales growth from existing customers. Total gross margin was flat at $1.8 million. SG&A increased 2% to $1.1 billion due to IT investments. The net result for the quarter was consolidated operating earnings of $628 million, a decrease of 3%, which reflects a modest net negative impact for the enterprise from COVID-19. The pharma segment was adversely affected by COVID-19 during the quarter, and this was partially offset by a net positive impact in Medical. I will discuss this segment impact shortly. 
Interest and other expense decreased 33% versus the prior year to $34 million, driven primarily by lower interest expense as a result of prior year debt reduction as well as an increase in the value of our company's deferred compensation plan investments. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 13%, which reflects the impact of certain discrete items. Now a quick note on the GAAP tax impact during the quarter, primarily due to a self-insurance loss in our fiscal '20 federal tax return, we will carry back and recover previously paid federal taxes at rates that were in effect at that time. As such, in the quarter, we recorded a net GAAP tax benefit of $420 million associated with the recovery of prior taxes. Additionally, we have recorded a corresponding receivable of approximately $1 billion, which we expect to receive within the next 12 months. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We generated robust operating cash flow of $1.2 billion during the quarter. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends, affects point in time cash flows. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $3.7 billion and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. We remain focused on taking appropriate action to maintain our investment-grade balance sheet. Our next debt maturity is in June 2022 with approximately $1.4 billion coming due. By the end of fiscal '22, we intend to reduce long-term debt by that amount so the exact timing and method may vary as we continue to evaluate the economics associated with early retirement of debt. 
Now turning to the segments, beginning with medical on Slide 5. Medical revenue increased 7% in the second quarter to $4.3 billion, driven by a net positive revenue impact from COVID-19 and solid execution by our team. As we have previously discussed, we saw higher selling prices and volumes regarding PPE and higher volumes in our lab business, partially offset by reduced surgical products demand resulting from deferred and canceled elective procedures. Segment profit increased 21% to $236 million, driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 and cost savings, which includes global manufacturing efficiencies. The net positive segment profit impact from COVID-19 was primarily due to higher lab volumes as well as increased contributions from PPE that were offset by the previously mentioned elective procedure impacts. 
As it relates to lab, we continue to experience a tailwind from increased demand for COVID-19 testing products. While difficult to predict, we expect this demand to remain elevated for at least the balance of fiscal '21. Regarding PPE, we saw both higher volumes and timing favorability related to our cost mitigation efforts. As previously mentioned, we have incurred significantly higher procurement costs for select PPE products during the pandemic, and we expect the timing of selling the higher cost products to vary as we continue to manage our supply assurance program for our customers. 
On electives, although procedure volumes continue to be choppy and still below prior year levels, second quarter volumes were generally consistent with our first quarter exit rate, down mid-single digits versus our pre COVID-19 baseline. Finally, as in the first quarter, we continue to see savings resulting from cost containment measures during the pandemic. And outside of COVID-19 impacts, we continue to realize benefits from our efficiency initiatives like our global manufacturing and supply chain transformation, which we expect will continue to deliver strong savings. 
Transitioning to the pharma segment on Slide 6. Revenue increased 4% to $37.2 billion, driven by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty Solutions customers. Pharma segment profit decreased 11% to $413 million. This was driven by COVID-19 related volume declines in our generics program and nuclear business, and was partially offset by a higher contribution from brand sales mix in the quarter. Our Specialty Solutions business continues to demonstrate resilience, both downstream with providers and upstream with biopharma manufacturers and again achieved strong overall growth in the quarter. Also, our generics program, when excluding the previously mentioned volume impact of COVID-19, continue to see generally consistent market dynamics. 
Next, on Slide 8, I will review the updates to our fiscal '21 outlook. Due to our solid first half performance and better visibility into the back half of fiscal '21, we are raising and narrowing our EPS guidance range to $5.85 to $6.10 per share, which at the midpoint represents 10% year-over-year EPS growth. This improvement is driven by strong performance in our medical segment as well as updates below the operating line. Regarding updates to other corporate assumptions, we now expect interest and other in the range of $165 million to $185 million, with the improvement primarily driven by the impact of our deferred compensation plan adjustments. As a reminder, deferred compensation adjustments are fully offset in corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line. We are lowering our non-GAAP ETR range for the year to 23% to 25%, which reflects our year-to-date effective tax rate of 18% and higher expected effective tax rates in the back half of the fiscal year due to the timing of discrete items. We also now expect dilutive weighted average shares outstanding to finish the year in the range of 294 million to 295 million. Regarding the segment outlook on Slide 9. For medical, due to the previously discussed drivers, we now expect segment profit percentage growth in the low to mid-20s and revenue growth for the year in the range of high single to low double digits. 
Regarding the pharma segment, we are maintaining our current guidance ranges of mid- single-digit revenue growth and low single-digit profit growth. To conclude, some comments on our enterprise COVID-19 assumptions for the back half of the fiscal year as we begin to lap the initial impact of the pandemic in the prior year. We continue to expect utilization to be choppy and to exit the fiscal year at or near prepandemic levels. And for the enterprise in fiscal '21, we continue to expect the year-over-year net negative impact from COVID-19 though less than originally anticipated due to improved medical expectations. I'll now turn it back over to Mike."

I'd now like to take a moment to elaborate on how this unprecedented time has reinforced our critical role in health care and how we see this role evolving as we look toward and beyond the second half of the fiscal year. I said last quarter",874,"Thanks, Jason. I'd now like to take a moment to elaborate on how this unprecedented time has reinforced our critical role in health care and how we see this role evolving as we look toward and beyond the second half of the fiscal year. I said last quarter that we aspire to be health care's most trusted partner and create the greatest value for our customers, shareholders, communities and employees. We create this value by efficiently operating resilient business models, deploying capital with discipline and investing for growth. All while prioritizing the health, safety and development of our teams. First, as we've seen throughout the pandemic, we operate resilient business models that can address today's challenges and adapt for the future. 
For example, as Jason highlighted, our lab business continues to enhance its offerings throughout the pandemic. Through our Cardinal Health brand portfolio, and our distribution relationships, we supply instrumentation, reagents and consumables, enabling both independent and acute laboratories to support the health of patients. We are also enhancing our core medical and pharmaceutical distribution and product capabilities as we continue to adapt these models for the future. We are making strong progress in both segments on our supply chain work streams and generating near and long-term efficiencies. For example, we began work this quarter on a new 1 million square foot medical segment replenishment center near Chicago that we expect to be operational in the fourth quarter. This facility is the second of its kind in the last year and is part of our multiyear plan to improve the customer experience, consolidate our network and increased capacity to meet customers' request for pandemic storage. We are also making strategic investments in our IT infrastructure to enhance our customer experience and digital capabilities. At the same time, we are investing in our differentiated portfolio to drive strategic, long-term growth in key areas and not only support, but also anticipate our customers' needs. 
Our investments in the areas of specialty, at home, medical services, nuclear and connected care will enable us to capture benefits from favorable industry trends and to develop specialized customer solutions, utilizing our breadth and scale. Recall, I noted at a recent conference that these 5 businesses represent $25 billion in total revenue. And together, they have a double-digit historical 3-year revenue CAGR. 
Let me highlight a few of these areas in greater detail. In medical services, which includes our OptiFreight logistics and WaveMark businesses, we are investing in technologies to drive continued innovation that will meet the evolving needs of our customers. For example, with our recently announced total view analytics tool in our OptiFreight business, we are using data to help our customers drive insights and savings in their health care supply chain logistics management. And in WaveMark, which, as a reminder, is a software as a service platform, optimizing supply chain and clinical workflow processes for acute care, we have seen growth in both our installations and our pipeline as we continue to go live with additional customers. Wavemark has also recently initiated partnership opportunities to explore solutions to help lab managers and supply chain leaders manage the increased demand for critical test kits and lab supplies. 
As our nuclear business continues its recovery related to the pandemic, our team remains focused on long-term plans to further strengthen our leading industry position. We continue to build out our center for Theranostics advancements in Indianapolis and are excited about the pharmaceutical innovators coming on board. From supporting manufactured development of radiopharmaceuticals to commercialization and distribution, we are working together to change the way patient care is delivered. In addition, our recent customer loyalty survey results were excellent, showcasing our differentiated value proposition in the market. Our efforts over the past 6 years to transform our selling model strengthen our world-class service levels and launch new products and services are deeply appreciated by our customers, and we are excited about the mid- to long-term future of this business. 
And finally, in connected care, we are making additional investments in technology solutions and actionable data tools to take advantage of the double-digit growth we are seeing and to enable more meaningful cost-effective and outcomes driven connections between payers, manufacturers, pharmacists and patients. Demand for these solutions continues to increase with our services currently reaching 60,000 pharmacies, 23 million patients and 60 payers. We are sending more than 400 million texts annually to support medication management. And in the last quarter, we have designed, developed and implemented tools to help our pharmacy customers administer the COVID-19 vaccine with more than 2,500 locations already engaged. We will continue to share progress in each of these growth areas and in our core capability initiatives as they materialize over the coming year. 
Before I close, I want to thank the team here at Cardinal Health, who continue to do a tremendous job adapting and responding to the changing needs of our customers as we navigate the pandemic. Finally, I will reiterate that what we do matters to our customers, shareholders, employees and communities. As we move forward, we are using our breadth, scale and expertise to provide products and solutions that create value and improve lives. With that, I'll pause to open it up for questions."

Appreciate it. I guess, really a couple of things to keep in mind. We're really pleased with the resiliency of our pharma segment both in the pharma distribution as well as the specialty and nuclear business. We do continue to see really COVID-19 being the main driver of any headwinds we're seeing there. It's good so far that a lot of the things that might affect the segments such as brand inflation. That's kind of off the table from what we've seen in January. We feel like we're executing really well on our initiatives and also from a cost saving standpoint, we're on track. And then generics, which is always one of the -- could be one of the swing factors we're not seeing anything inconsistent there from what we've seen in prior quarters. So a lot of those swing factors are really off the table when we look at the rest of the year for Pharma but what we really see is COVID being the main swing factor. The things I would say there is that we saw a lot of choppiness in the quarter. We would expect it to continue to be choppy for the second half of the year. But we still are expecting to exit at or near pre-COVID levels. And as we said, our guidance continues to be low single-digit growth for the segment."

Maybe on the medical business, I think we all understand that COVID is having significant impact across the segment. But I was hoping maybe you could help us with what you're assuming in the back half in medical, particularly on the EBIT line. It just seems, based on the results to date and the updated guidance, you have to see kind of mid-20 declines in the back half versus the front half. And I know there's a lot of moving pieces related to COVID. But I think at a high level, Mike, I would think as you maybe see some of the drivers of the front half potentially fade, you would obviously see the legacy kind of surgery recovery product lines pick up. Just trying to get a better sense of what you're assuming that could really drive this kind of back half decline versus what you've seen in the front half?"

Certainly, 2 good quarters here now as well as on top of last year's double-digit growth as well. And then still guiding to low to mid-20s for the year we feel very good about. To the point about the trends first half versus second half, as we stated in the remarks, we did see some Q2 favorability as it relates to our cost mitigation efforts on certain PPE products. So that's an element that was a component in addition to the volume strength that we saw in lab and the volume strength that we saw in PPE that drove medical to actually have a net tailwind associated with COVID in the quarter. And so that's just one thing that will continue to vary quarter-to-quarter as we go forward. 
The other item that we talked about last quarter as well is that we continue to be very aggressive with our cost control over the first half of the year here, a lot of uncertainty in the underlying volumes. And so we wanted to make certain that we had a lot of flexibility going into the second half of the year. And then the third point I'd make is just that we do continue to make long-term investments in our business. As we've highlighted as our #1 capital deployment priority is to invest in our strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities, and so we always trade off our level of spend in that regard as well."

Because there's certainly the overall demand dynamic here, obviously, continues to be quite strong. And we are seeing certain components get a little bit more in balance between supply and demand. But certainly, cost remains elevated across all categories. It's probably even more extreme in terms of that supply and demand imbalance remaining in exam gloves. So we continue to see that demand just far outstripping that supply, which has created some -- just some supply chain inconsistencies. Not only -- so now we're dealing with just the timing of supply, but we're also dealing with all the different timing elements of the cost increases and price increases. So it just becomes a bit of an uncertain combination of different influences that have driven some of these cost increases to be delayed then until later quarters. So overall, our key objective remains the same to make sure we're mitigating all these cost increases and working with our customers with the supply assurance program. But the timing is going to vary, as we said last quarter, and we'll continue to manage that as appropriate."

I guess, first of all, it's important to know that sequentially there's really not a lot of difference between what we saw in volumes between Q1 and Q2 for our pharma business. And also, I would say that all the impact that we're seeing on volumes and generics is really, from our view, just related to COVID-19. So we're not seeing any other dynamics such as buying groups or other challenges like that impacting our generics program. It's really just the volumes as it relates to COVID-19. So -- and as we said, we expect that to continue to be choppy. We saw a lot of up and down over the last 6 months. We would expect that for the second half of the year, but do expect to still get back to at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the year. 
As it relates to flu as you know, this has become less and less of a driver in general for us. It can be a small driver. And as far as the flu goes, we've hardly seen much at all. So in terms of vaccine distribution, it has been a little higher, but all of the other type of ancillary products, such as the Tamiflu and those types of things, they have been down, obviously. But again, it's an incredibly tiny driver for us and was not something that is driving any of the concern or any challenges that we might be looking at in pharma, which, again, we just are focused on COVID."

As consistent with my comments, it's the deferred comp element is driving the guidance change. And as I highlighted, that's entirely a flip-flop between interest and other and corporate SG&A. So there's no net EPS change associated with that. And of course, interest rates, although low, we have a substantial part of our capital structure fixed. So we just don't see a lot of variation as it relates to where rates have been. And so then -- I'm sorry, there are 3 parts. What was the second part? Share count. Okay. So the share count we were still within the guidance range of what we had before. It is slightly at the high end, to your point, as you can see, in the first quarter, we didn't do any share repo. We didn't do any in the second quarter as well. But the high end of that share count would imply no repo. The low end of this new range would be moderate -- modest amount of repo. So that's what's baked within that assumption. As it relates to the capital deployment, certainly, we haven't changed our priorities. Of course, we work within those priorities. And just to reinforce that, we continue to invest in our business, first and foremost, as we are really confident with that strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities. And you saw that this quarter with the medical global manufacturing and supply chain work, we're making some great progress there, and we want to continue to feed those activities. 
The other point that I referenced in my commentary is consistent with the second priority, which is to maintain our strong investment-grade balance sheet. So I did highlight that we intend to reduce our debt by about $1.4 billion as it comes due at the end of our fiscal '22. And we think that's consistent with that priority. And then, of course, we return the cash to shareholders primarily through the dividend as our third priority. After that, it is repo and other bolt-on strategic M&A. But we'll continue to look at that opportunistically as we get more confidence on variables such as opioids is certainly one of the elements we look at all the time. And as our confidence increases, we make more progress, understanding what the framing of that looks like. Then we'll continue to evaluate if we can be more aggressive on any of those other components. But we continue to balance all those each and every day."

We did, however, say, in our last guidance update in Q1, that the vast majority of that revenue guidance increase for medical was due to pricing, which was due to that cost that was increasing. With this update, it's definitely more balanced, more weighted towards volume increases in the lab business as well as volume increases in PPE and then to a lesser extent, any type of price changes. So it's -- I would just go back to the last guidance increase, and it gives you a better understanding of what that PPE pricing dynamic is being driven by."

We -- obviously, we can't talk about it at this time, '22 but you're right on those components, first of all, we would expect if we exit at or near pre-COVID levels that our nuclear business would continue to improve sequentially as it goes forward. And we have a lot of confidence in that business. As you know, I highlighted it in my comments, around not only how they're performing well in the current situation, but also the investments we've made to be able to see growth in that business over the mid and long-term on the -- in the Theranostics space. And then again, as far as generics go, yes, the main reason that we have seen that our generic volumes are off is because of COVID. And so rest of the program continues to to be as we expected, we continue to see that program. All the various components that we have in it are essentially working as we expected with just COVID being the driver.

I think you're on the right point that, as we talked, especially in Q4 of last year, when the volumes were declining quickly. Nuclear is a high-margin business. It is also a high fixed cost business. So it creates a very high contribution margins that we saw certainly create a headwind in that fourth quarter. And so as we anniversary that in this fourth quarter, especially if our guidance is accurate with the at or near pre-COVID levels by the time we exit the fiscal year. Then you would expect there to be -- for that piece of it, an improvement in earnings relative to revenue as one of the key components that probably needs to be plugged into your model to make that whole thing make sense."

First of all, the last thing you said is important is that we would intend to be a properly compensated for that to make sure with any investment or working with customers to make sure that the services that we provide, we're getting compensated for not only from an income statement, but appropriately looking at our balance sheet and the return. So that's important to note. To give you specifically on how it would work, that's a little more complicated because I think it's we're going to see inventory changes across the entire supply chain. I think you're obviously, one, going to see supply changes in the way that probably the manufacturers work and the amount of inventory they're carrying to be able to get through these types of things; the location of our supply chain and where we have the percentage of what we sell manufacture versus what we source we continue to increase our capacity, for instance, to manufacture our own drapes and gowns. And so the ability to ramp that up store inventory and managing it that way would be one. And then as I mentioned, we are building some larger distribution centers. So we have the capacity to do that on our end, both to make sure our service levels are where our customers expect them to be, but also, in certain cases, carry that inventory for customers. 
But I also believe that customers are looking at what they warehouse and don't warehouse and that mix of what the warehouse may be more towards these PPE-related items versus other ones. So that can create some different opportunities for us to work with them. So I do think the entire supply chain will adjust over the next couple of years as it relates to inventory. But the important thing to note is that as we work with our customers on this, we would -- and suppliers, we would expect to get compensated from both in order to provide that type of service."

I'll start our discussion with a few high-level thoughts on our progress so far this year, and then Jason will review our second quarter results and our updated fiscal '21 outlook.

I'll start our discussion with a few high-level thoughts on our progress so far this year, and then Jason will review our second quarter results and our updated fiscal '21 outlook. I'll close by sharing updates regarding our growth areas. 
We continue to make progress on our strategic plan as we navigate the rapidly changing global environment. Overall, second quarter operating results came in better than our expectations, led by the Medical segment. In addition, we saw some favorability, including timing below the operating line, enabling us to deliver EPS growth of 14% in the quarter. 
Due to our solid first half performance and our improved visibility into the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing and narrowing our EPS guidance to a range of $5.85 to $6.10 per share. 
In the second quarter, we saw varying effects of the pandemic on our business. Our Medical segment saw a net positive impact related to COVID-19 as our lab business and PPE products continued to experience strong demand. And in Pharma, although the pandemic continued to adversely impact volumes, mainly in generics and nuclear imaging, areas like specialty and consumer health are recovering and performing very well. 
Across the company, we remain focused on doing our part to support ongoing pandemic release efforts. In Pharma, we partnered with the CDC to act as a network administrator, enabling retail independent, small chain and long-term care pharmacy customers to participate in the vaccination effort. And in Medical, we partnered with the state of Ohio to support vaccine distribution through our OptiFreight Logistics business. 
Regarding PPE, we are utilizing our supply assurance program to manage costs for our customers and provide consistent, long-range supply in key product categories. We are seeing improving supply in some of these product categories such as gowns and masks, but continue to see a challenging market with exam gloves. 
Looking ahead, we remain committed to supporting our customers, patients, government and communities through the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, and we are ready and willing to help in any way possible. 
Before I provide some updates on our strategic growth areas, I'll turn it over to Jason to share more details on our second quarter and outlook for the year."
172207,700099205,2194434,"Cardinal Health, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2021",2021-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Cardinal Health, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with total company results, second quarter EPS was $1.74, reflecting a 14% increase driven by discrete tax items and strong Medical results. Total second quarter revenue increased 5% to $41.5 billion,",1149,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. 
Beginning with total company results, second quarter EPS was $1.74, reflecting a 14% increase driven by discrete tax items and strong Medical results. Total second quarter revenue increased 5% to $41.5 billion, driven primarily by sales growth from existing customers. Total gross margin was flat at $1.8 billion. SG&A increased 2% to $1.1 billion due to IT investments. The net result for the quarter was consolidated operating earnings of $628 million, a decrease of 3%, which reflects a modest net negative impact for the enterprise from COVID-19. The Pharma segment was adversely affected by COVID-19 during the quarter, and this was partially offset by a net positive impact in Medical. I will discuss this segment impact shortly. 
Interest and other expense decreased 33% versus the prior year to $34 million, driven primarily by lower interest expense as a result of prior year debt reduction as well as an increase in the value of our company's deferred compensation plan investments. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 13%, which reflects the impact of certain discrete items. 
Now a quick note on the GAAP tax impact during the quarter. Primarily due to a self-insurance loss in our fiscal '20 federal tax return, we will carry back and recover previously paid federal taxes at rates that were in effect at that time. As such, in the quarter, we recorded a net GAAP tax benefit of $420 million associated with the recovery of prior taxes. Additionally, we have recorded a corresponding receivable of approximately $1 billion, which we expect to receive within the next 12 months. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We generated robust operating cash flow of $1.2 billion during the quarter. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $3.7 billion and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. 
We remain focused on taking appropriate action to maintain our investment-grade balance sheet. Our next debt maturity is in June 2022 with approximately $1.4 billion coming due. By the end of fiscal '22, we intend to reduce long-term debt by that amount though the exact timing and method may vary as we continue to evaluate the economics associated with early retirement of debt. 
Now turning to the segments, beginning with Medical on Slide 5. Medical revenue increased 7% in the second quarter to $4.3 billion, driven by a net positive revenue impact from COVID-19 and solid execution by our team. As we have previously discussed, we saw higher selling prices and volumes regarding PPE and higher volumes in our lab business, partially offset by reduced surgical products demand resulting from deferred and canceled elective procedures. 
Segment profit increased 21% to $236 million, driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 and cost savings, which includes global manufacturing efficiencies. The net positive segment profit impact from COVID-19 was primarily due to higher lab volumes as well as increased contributions from PPE that were offset by the previously mentioned elective procedure impacts. 
As it relates to lab, we continue to experience a tailwind from increased demand for COVID-19 testing products. While difficult to predict, we expect this demand to remain elevated for at least the balance of fiscal '21. 
Regarding PPE, we saw both higher volumes and timing favorability related to our cost mitigation efforts. As previously mentioned, we have incurred significantly higher procurement costs for select PPE products during the pandemic, and we expect the timing of selling the higher cost products to vary as we continue to manage our supply assurance program for our customers. 
On electives, although procedure volumes continue to be choppy and still below prior year levels, second quarter volumes were generally consistent with our first quarter exit rate, down mid-single digits versus our pre-COVID-19 baseline. 
Finally, as in the first quarter, we continue to see savings resulting from cost containment measures during the pandemic. And outside of COVID-19 impacts, we continue to realize benefits from our efficiency initiatives like our global manufacturing and supply chain transformation, which we expect will continue to deliver strong savings. 
Transitioning to the Pharma segment on Slide 6. Revenue increased 4% to $37.2 billion, driven by sales growth from Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers. Pharma segment profit decreased 11% to $413 million. This was driven by COVID-19-related volume declines in our generics program and nuclear business, and was partially offset by a higher contribution from brand sales mix in the quarter. 
Our Specialty Solutions business continues to demonstrate resilience, both downstream with providers and upstream with biopharma manufacturers and again achieved strong overall growth in the quarter. Also, our generics program, when excluding the previously mentioned volume impact of COVID-19, continue to see generally consistent market dynamics. 
Next, on Slide 8, I will review the updates to our fiscal '21 outlook. Due to our solid first half performance and better visibility into the back half of fiscal '21, we are raising and narrowing our EPS guidance range to $5.85 to $6.10 per share, which at the midpoint, represents 10% year-over-year EPS growth. This improvement is driven by strong performance in our Medical segment as well as updates below the operating line. 
Regarding updates to other corporate assumptions. We now expect interest and other in the range of $165 million to $185 million, with the improvement primarily driven by the impact of our deferred compensation plan adjustments. As a reminder, deferred compensation adjustments are fully offset in corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line. 
We are lowering our non-GAAP ETR range for the year to 23% to 25%, which reflects our year-to-date effective tax rate of 18% and higher expected effective tax rates in the back half of the fiscal year due to the timing of discrete items. 
We also now expect dilutive weighted average shares outstanding to finish the year in the range of 294 million to 295 million. 
Regarding the segment outlook on Slide 9. For Medical, due to the previously discussed drivers, we now expect segment profit percentage growth in the low to mid-20s and revenue growth for the year in the range of high single to low double digits. 
Regarding the Pharma segment, we are maintaining our current guidance ranges of mid single-digit revenue growth and low single-digit profit growth. 
To conclude, some comments on our enterprise COVID-19 assumptions for the back half of the fiscal year as we begin to lap the initial impact of the pandemic in the prior year. We continue to expect utilization to be choppy and to exit the fiscal year at or near pre-pandemic levels. And for the enterprise in fiscal '21, we continue to expect the year-over-year net negative impact from COVID-19 though less than originally anticipated due to improved Medical expectations. 
I'll now turn it back over to Mike."

I'd now like to take a moment to elaborate on how this unprecedented time has reinforced our critical role in health care and how we see this role evolving as we look toward and beyond the second half of the fiscal year. I said last quart",868,"Thanks, Jason. I'd now like to take a moment to elaborate on how this unprecedented time has reinforced our critical role in health care and how we see this role evolving as we look toward and beyond the second half of the fiscal year. 
I said last quarter that we aspire to be health care's most trusted partner and create the greatest value for our customers, shareholders, communities and employees. We create this value by efficiently operating resilient business models, deploying capital with discipline and investing for growth, all while prioritizing the health, safety and development of our teams. 
First, as we've seen throughout the pandemic, we operate resilient business models that can address today's challenges and adapt for the future. For example, as Jason highlighted, our lab business continues to enhance its offerings throughout the pandemic. Through our Cardinal Health brand portfolio and our distribution relationships, we supply instrumentation, reagent and consumables, enabling both independent and acute laboratories to support the health of patients. 
We are also enhancing our core Medical and Pharmaceutical distribution and product capabilities as we continue to adapt these models for the future. We are making strong progress in both segments on our supply chain work streams and generating near and long-term efficiencies. For example, we began work this quarter on a new 1 million square foot Medical segment replenishment center near Chicago that we expect to be operational in the fourth quarter. This facility is the second of its kind in the last year and is part of our multiyear plan to improve the customer experience, consolidate our network and increased capacity to meet customers' request for pandemic storage. We are also making strategic investments in our IT infrastructure to enhance our customer experience and digital capabilities. At the same time, we are investing in our differentiated portfolio to drive strategic, long-term growth in key areas and not only support but also anticipate our customers' needs. 
Our investments in the areas of Specialty, at-Home, Medical Services, Nuclear and connected care will enable us to capture benefits from favorable industry trends and to develop specialized customer solutions, utilizing our breadth and scale. Recall, I noted at a recent conference that these 5 businesses represent $25 billion in total revenue. And together, they have a double-digit historical 3-year revenue CAGR. 
Let me highlight a few of these areas in greater detail. In Medical Services, which includes our OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark businesses, we are investing in technologies to drive continued innovation that will meet the evolving needs of our customers. For example, with our recently announced TotalVue Analytics tool in our OptiFreight business, we are using data to help our customers drive insights and savings in their health care supply chain logistics management. 
And in WaveMark, which, as a reminder, is a software-as-a-service platform, optimizing supply chain and clinical workflow processes for acute care, we have seen growth in both our installations and our pipeline as we continue to go live with additional customers. WaveMark has also recently initiated partnership opportunities to explore solutions to help lab managers and supply chain leaders manage the increased demand for critical test kits and lab supplies. 
As our Nuclear business continues its recovery related to the pandemic, our team remains focused on long-term plans to further strengthen our leading industry position. We continue to build out our Center for Theranostics Advancements in Indianapolis and are excited about the pharmaceutical innovators coming on board. From supporting manufacture development of radiopharmaceuticals to commercialization and distribution, we are working together to change the way patient care is delivered. In addition, our recent customer loyalty survey results were excellent, showcasing our differentiated value proposition in the market. Our efforts over the past 6 years to transform our selling model, strengthen our world-class service levels and launch new products and services are deeply appreciated by our customers, and we are excited about the mid- to long-term future of this business. 
And finally, in connected care, we are making additional investments in technology solution and actionable data tools to take advantage of the double-digit growth we are seeing and to enable more meaningful, cost-effective and outcomes-driven connections between payers, manufacturers, pharmacists and patients. Demand for these solutions continues to increase with our services currently reaching 60,000 pharmacies, 23 million patients and 60 payers. We are sending more than 400 million texts annually to support medication management. And in the last quarter, we have designed, developed and implemented tools to help our pharmacy customers administer the COVID-19 vaccine with more than 2,500 locations already engaged. We will continue to share progress in each of these growth areas and in our core capability initiatives as they materialize over the coming year. 
Before I close, I want to thank the team here at Cardinal Health, who continue to do a tremendous job adapting and responding to the changing needs of our customers as we navigate the pandemic. 
Finally, I will reiterate that what we do matters to our customers, shareholders, employees and communities. As we move forward, we are using our breadth, scale and expertise to provide products and solutions that create value and improve lives. 
With that, I'll pause to open it up for questions."

Appreciate it. I guess, really a couple of things to keep in mind. We're really pleased with the resiliency of our Pharma segment both in the Pharma Distribution as well as the Specialty and Nuclear business. 
We do continue to see really COVID-19 being the main driver of any headwinds we're seeing there. It's good so far that a lot of the things that might affect the segments such as brand, inflation, that's kind of off the table from what we've seen in January. We feel like we're executing really well on our initiatives. And also, from a cost saving standpoint, we're on track. And then generics, which is always one of the -- could be one of the swing factors, we're not seeing anything inconsistent there from what we've seen in prior quarters. So a lot of those swing factors are really off the table when we look at the rest of the year for Pharma. But what we really see is COVID being the main swing factor. 
The things I would say there is that we saw a lot of choppiness in the quarter. We would expect it to continue to be choppy for the second half of the year. But we still are expecting to exit at or near pre-COVID levels. And as we said, our guidance continues to be low single-digit growth for the segment."

But I was hoping maybe you could help us with what you're assuming in the back half in Medical, particularly on the EBIT line. It just seems, based on the results to date and the updated guidance, you have to see kind of mid-20 declines in the back half versus the front half. 
And I know there's a lot of moving pieces related to COVID. But -- and I think at a high level, Mike, I would think as you maybe see some of the drivers of the front half potentially fade, you would obviously see the legacy kind of surgery recovery product lines pick up. 
Just trying to get a better sense of what you're assuming that could really drive this kind of back half decline versus what you've seen in the front half."

Certainly, 2 good quarters here now as well as on top of last year's double-digit growth as well. And then, still guiding to low to mid-20s for the year we feel very good about. 
To the point about the trends, first half versus second half. As we stated in the remarks, we did see some Q2 favorability as it relates to our cost mitigation efforts on certain PPE products. So that's an element that was a component in addition to the volume strength that we saw in lab and the volume strength that we saw in PPE that drove Medical to actually have a net tailwind associated with COVID in the quarter. And so that's just one thing that will continue to vary quarter-to-quarter as we go forward. 
The other item that we talked about last quarter as well is that we continue to be very aggressive with our cost control over the first half of the year here, a lot of uncertainty in the underlying volumes. And so we wanted to make certain that we had a lot of flexibility going into the second half of the year. 
And then the third point I'd make is just that we do continue to make long-term investments in our business. As we've highlighted as our #1 capital deployment priority is to invest in our strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities. And so we always trade off our level of spend in that regard as well."

Because certainly, the overall demand dynamic here, obviously, continues to be quite strong. And we are seeing certain components get a little bit more imbalance between supply and demand. 
But certainly, cost remains elevated across all categories. It's probably even more extreme in terms of that supply and demand imbalance remaining in exam gloves. So we continue to see that demand just far outstripping that supply, which has created some -- just some supply chain inconsistencies. Not only -- so now we're dealing with just the timing of supply, but we're also dealing with all the different timing elements of the cost increases and price increases. So it just becomes a bit of an uncertain combination of different influences that have driven some of these cost increases to be delayed then until later quarters. 
So overall, our key objective remains the same, to make sure we're mitigating all these cost increases and working with our customers with the supply assurance program. But the timing is going to vary, as we said last quarter, and we'll continue to manage that as appropriate."

I guess, first of all, it's important to know that sequentially, there's really not a lot of difference between what we saw in volumes between Q1 and Q2 for our Pharma business. And also, I would say that all the impact that we're seeing on volumes in generics is really, from our view, just related to COVID-19. So we're not seeing any other dynamics such as buying groups or other challenges like that impacting our generics program. It's really just the volumes as it relates to COVID-19. So -- and as we said, we expect that to continue to be choppy. We saw a lot of up and down over the last 6 months. We would expect that for the second half of the year, but do expect to still get back to at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the year. 
As it relates to flu, as you know, this has become less and less of a driver in general for us. It can be a small driver. And as far as the flu goes, we've hardly seen much at all. So in terms of vaccine distribution, it has been a little higher. But all of the other type of ancillary products, such as the Tamiflus and those types of things, they have been down, obviously. But again, it's an incredibly tiny driver for us and was not something that is driving any of the concern or any challenges that we might be looking at in Pharma, which, again, we just are focused on COVID."

As consistent with my comments, it's the deferred comp element is driving the guidance change. And as I highlighted, that's entirely a flip-flop between interest and other and corporate SG&A. So there's no net EPS change associated with that. And of course, interest rates, although low, we have a substantial part of our capital structure fixed. So we just don't see a lot of variation as it relates to where rates have been. 
And so then -- I'm sorry, there are 3 parts. What was the second part? Share count. Okay. So the share count, we're still within the guidance range of what we had before. It is slightly at the high end, to your point. As you can see, in the first quarter, we didn't do any share repo. We didn't do any in the second quarter as well. But the high end of that share count would imply no repo. The low end of this new range would be moderate -- modest amount of repo. So that's what's baked within that assumption. 
As it relates to the capital deployment, certainly, we haven't changed our priorities. Of course, we work within those priorities. And just to reinforce that, we continue to invest in our business, first and foremost, as we are really confident with that strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities. And you saw that this quarter with the Medical global manufacturing and supply chain work. We're making some great progress there, and we want to continue to feed those activities. 
The other point that I referenced in my commentary is consistent with the second priority, which is to maintain our strong investment-grade balance sheet. So I did highlight that we intend to reduce our debt by about $1.4 billion as it comes due at the end of our fiscal '22. And we think that's consistent with that priority. And then, of course, we return the cash to shareholders primarily through the dividend as our third priority. After that, it is repo and other bolt-on strategic M&A. But we'll continue to look at that opportunistically as we get more confidence on variables such as opioids is certainly one of the elements we look at all the time. And as our confidence increases and we make more progress, understanding it, what the framing of that looks like. Then we'll continue to evaluate if we can be more aggressive on any of those other components. But we continue to balance all those each and every day."

We did, however, say, in our last guidance update in Q1, that the vast majority of that revenue guidance increase for Medical was due to pricing, which was due to that cost that was increasing. With this update, it's definitely more balanced, more weighted towards volume increases in the lab business as well as volume increases in PPE and then to a lesser extent, any type of price changes. So it's -- I would just go back to the last guidance increase, and it gives you a better understanding of what that PPE pricing dynamic is being driven by."

As far as on the Pharma guidance goes or thoughts there. We -- obviously, we can't talk about it at this time, '22. But you're right on those components. First of all, we would expect, if we exit at or near pre-COVID levels, that our Nuclear business would continue to improve sequentially as it goes forward. And we have a lot of confidence in that business. As you know, I highlighted it in my comments, around not only how they're performing well in the current situation, but also the investments we've made to be able to see growth in that business over the mid and long term on the -- in the Theranostics space. 
And then again, as far as generics go, yes, the main reason that we have seen that our generic volumes are off is because of COVID. And so rest of the program continues to be as we expected, we continue to see that program. All the various components that we have in it are essentially working as we expected with just COVID being the driver. So again, as COVID begins to be less and less of an impact, we would expect to see our volumes on our generics program to grow."

The other thing I'll add is relative to the Nuclear comment, Ricky, as it relates to the revenue and margin balance here. I think you're on the right point that, as we talked, especially in Q4 of last year, when the volumes were declining quickly. Nuclear is a high-margin business. It is also a high fixed cost business. So it creates a very high contribution margins that we saw certainly create a headwind in that fourth quarter. And so as we anniversary that in this fourth quarter, especially if our guidance is accurate with the at or near pre-COVID levels. By the time we exit the fiscal year, then you would expect there to be -- for that piece of it, an improvement in earnings relative to revenue as one of the key components that probably needs to be plugged into your model to make that whole thing make sense."

So that's important to note. 
To give you specifically on how it would work, that's a little more complicated because I think it's -- we're going to see inventory changes across the entire supply chain. I think you're obviously, one, going to see supply changes in the way that probably the manufacturers work and the amount of inventory they're carrying to be able to get through these types of things; the location of our supply chain and where we -- the percentage of what we self-manufacture versus what we source, we continue to increase our capacity, for instance, to manufacture our own drapes and gowns. And so the ability to ramp that up, store inventory and managing it that way would be one. And then as I mentioned, we are building some larger distribution centers so we have the capacity to do that on our end, both to make sure our service levels are where our customers expect them to be, but also, in certain cases, carry that inventory for customers. 
But I also believe that customers are looking at what they warehouse and don't warehouse and that mix of what they warehouse may be more towards these PPE-related items versus other ones. And that can create some different opportunities for us to work with them. 
So I do think the entire supply chain will adjust over the next couple of years as it relates to inventory. But the important thing to note is that as we work with our customers on this, we would -- and suppliers, we would expect to get compensated from both in order to provide that type of service."

We remain focused on serving our customers and their patients and continue to advance our strategic priorities. With our resilient business model, we are navigating the effects of the pandemic on our businesses. In the quarter, we continued to see strong demand for lab and PPE products and volume recovery in our nuclear business. Medical elective procedure utilization experienced some volatility, and we saw our ongoing COVID-19 related softness in generics volumes, which we now expect to extend into the next fiscal year. With this Business fundamentals are strong, demonstrated by the underlying growth we are seeing in both segments, and we continue to advance our strategic priorities including optimizing our supply chain and

Our customer focus remains central to our activities. We deeply appreciate that it is our responsibility to serve health care providers, their patients and those on the front lines. 
Although the operating environment remains

from accelerated pharmaceutical sales and increased PPE demand due to the onset of COVID-19 Now for our consolidated third quarter results, total company revenue of $39.3 billion was increased nearly 4% to $1.1 billion, demonstrating our enterprise-wide commitment to disciplined expense management. 
The net result for the quarter

customers compared against the previously mentioned COVID-19-related sales acceleration in the prior year. Segment profit decreased 4% to $511 million, primarily due to COVID-19-related volume declines in our generics program, which was partially offset by a 
[Audio Gap] 
market dynamics. Additionally, we were encouraged to see our Nuclear business continued its recovery as we saw an improvement in volume wins in our 3PL and Hub business. And the pharma team remains focused on diligent expense management, delivering strong  cost savings in the quarter. 
[Audio Gap] 
Also offering digital solutions in the Connected Care businesses that we recently branded collectively as outcomes. Each year, medication nonadherence cost, the U.S. health care system over $500 billion and contributes to around 275,000 avoidable patient death. With Outcomes, we've created a digital ecosystem that unites pharmacists, payers and pharmaceutical companies to improve medication adherence, drive better outcomes and lower the cost of care. Outcomes currently supports a network of 23 million patients and more than 60,000 pharmacy sites nationwide and through continued growth is positioned to address the challenge of medication adherence. As I look towards the future, I am excited about these innovations across the segment that combine our heritage and strengths with new technologies to create unique solutions that support our customers' ever-changing needs and create long-term value across the continuum of care. 
Turning to Medical. We continue to enhance our operations to better serve our customers and their patients. For example, we continue to diversify the geographic concentration of our sourcing and invest in our self-manufacturing capabilities. This includes producing 15 million more safety needles and syringes, 20 million more isolation gowns and 150 million more surgical and procedure masks annually in our own North American facilities. We are also supporting customers' inventory needs with stockpile as-a-service storage solution in partnering with the strategic national stockpile to store and distribute 80,000 pallets of critical PPE. We are incorporating robotics, automation and data analytics across our warehouse and distribution process. We are piloting various technologies and being thoughtful about how and where to scale them across our network. 
We also continue to invest in key areas across the segment. For example, we are expanding our lab kitting services to support home collection for a broad array of lab tests from wellness to infectious disease, and we are coupling these services with capabilities in our Cardinal Health at Home and Opto Freight businesses to maximize value and create differentiated solutions. By meeting the patient where they are, our lab kitting supports testing protocol adherence and detection of early onset disease, ultimately, lowering the cost of care. 
And in Medical Services, our OptiFreight Logistics business is launching innovative and comprehensive health care logistics offerings like our same-day solutions, which is being scaled nationally to support the time-critical logistics of our customers. Together, these work streams across medical position us to support our customers and drive long-term growth. Along with these work streams in each segment, we are also focused on enterprise-wide investments as well as advancing our capital allocation, portfolio optimization and ESG priorities. We continue to invest in our delivery networks, cold chain capabilities and supply chain capacity and visibility. For example, We are partnering with 4 Kite, the largest predictive supply chain visibility platform to create a cognitive network spanning both pharma and medical that combines real-time supply chain visibility, machine learning and artificial intelligence. This network facilitates inventory flow and gives our customers end-to-end visibility to see products in transit, enabling us to make any necessary adjustments for our customers in real time so they can better serve their patients. 
Regarding our capital allocation priorities, we have strong momentum. We remain committed to investing for future growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. We are on track to exceed our savings targets and are continuing to use some of these savings to reinvest in the business. 
We also remain focused on optimizing our portfolio. The pending sale of Cordis is progressing as expected and this divestiture enables us to simplify our operating model, further optimize our infrastructure and focus on our strategic growth areas where we are an advantaged owner. We are committed to our strategy as a global medical products and distribution leader and are focused on conducting business in markets and areas that align with our priorities. 
Finally, we're also advancing our environmental, social and governance activities. We recently partnered with AEP to power our global headquarters and our National Logistics Center with clean energy. And we remain deeply committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion at every level to ensure all of our employees can bring 100% of themselves to work every day. 
To close, I want to thank each of our employees whose commitment and ingenuity enable us to support our customers, their patients and our collective communities. With that, I'll pause to open it up for questions."

The only thing that has any real material impact on the program right now is generic volumes in certain therapeutic classes related to COVID-19. And it's probably not hard to think about if you've been following the IQVIA data. In the other day, there are certain classes, particularly around acute scripts where we don't see those getting back to pre-COVID levels prior to our fiscal year-end. 
We think as kids get back to school, more people are masking and all those types of things. We would expect the environment to generally return, but we don't now seeing that set of certain therapeutic classes within generics, returning to more pre-COVID levels until the end of the calendar year.

We've been seeing this in monitoring all the categories. And we've been saying since the beginning of the year, our assumption for guidance for both pharma and the overall company has been about getting back to pre-COVID -- at or near pre-COVID levels by June 30. And it's good to note that we're seeing that in brand. We're still expecting that. We're seeing that in the majority of generics, particularly the chronic generics. Those are coming back.

As I mentioned in my prior answer, overall, for the quarter, there was an insignificant impact in the quarter related to COVID, a lot of moving pieces, and I'll get into a couple of the key drivers. As a reminder, just like the pharma comment earlier, there was a prior year pull forward for PPE volume that we sold out of inventory. So we do have a slight negative year-over-year impact, which is related to the prior year tailwind that did not repeat in the current quarter. So the pieces within the quarter that we saw was ongoing elective volume headwinds. And what we did see in the quarter was a little bit of a deterioration from the prior quarter. So we saw -- in my comments in the prepared remarks, We saw that the utilization went down from 95% in the second quarter to closer to 90% in the third. But as I highlighted, it did improve at a tail end and back to the 90%. And that was very consistent with what we saw with the surge in the virus. And so we feel better about how we exited that quarter. 
And why we did not change our guidance for the medical business as it relates to this topic as well just that we expected to be at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the year. We did continue to see strength in our lab business, although it was a little bit less than what we had in the prior quarter, but still strength. And that was an offset. And then we continue to see strong volumes with PPE. But again, you're comparing against a strong volume quarter last year. And we did have some favorability still for the timing of the recognition of the pricing cost associated with the much higher cost with PPE. And those dynamics continue to be somewhat fluid, but we do definitely still see higher costs, higher prices for some of the PPE products, especially gloves, some moderation, but generally still elevated. And anything else to add, Mike?"

Yes. And to enable -- let me just start with to enable those types of growth areas, we are making investments in our business, and we'll continue to make investments in those businesses. One thing to highlight is, as we've invested more capital over the last couple or several years, that will ultimately result in increased the depreciation that we would expect to flow through. But of course, we would also expect the benefits of the programs, but we'll have some varying pieces there going forward. Beyond that element, again, investing our business being our highest capital deployment priority. We have the other areas like debt reduction and returning capital to shareholders, some of which will be through share repurchases that should have a tailwind associated with it also. Getting into your question around COVID. That is, of course, where we'll see a lot of movement from a year-over-year perspective. 
As a reminder, we highlighted in fiscal '20 that we had roughly $100 million headwind associated with COVID, which was more than all in the fourth quarter. Now this year, and then just in today's script, today's prepared remarks, we commented that it was a relatively consistent flat impact year-over-year from a COVID perspective now in this update. So that implies roughly $100 million included in fiscal '21. 
Now the key question is exactly how does that roll off down to '22. And I would first go back and highlight that a number of the areas we anticipate getting at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the fiscal year, like the medical elective volumes nuclear to a similar extent. The brand volumes we've highlighted are also similar. It's those very specific therapeutic drugs within generics will be deferred then until more like the middle of our fiscal '22. So there will be some offset there that will continue on into the next year. 
Now there's going to be a lot of other moving pieces with COVID. We would expect there still to be some elevated demand for areas like PPE and the lab business. But we also have the timing elements associated with PPE pricing costs that we continue to track very closely, and it will really be a function of those pricing and cost dynamics as we go forward. So when I think about the 2 different segments, what that really comes down to is that certainly, the greatest impact, we have a headwind built into this guidance and that $100 million associated with the pharma business, and we have now more of a tailwind for the medical business. 
And so we highlighted that from a year-over-year perspective as well in the prepared remarks that it's a meaningful impact in both this year. And so they will behave then differently next year. And then, of course, the other key piece to think about the puts and takes is the announcement of the sale of Cordis. So we do anticipate that being in the first quarter, hopefully, earlier in the first quarter. And we disclosed prior that, that business carries about a $60 million to $70 million annualized earnings rate. And so as we get more specific to exact timing and other details around that, we will provide more color as to what the impact will be for our fiscal '22."

The supply assurance program that we've referenced was created to do exactly that, to provide certainty to supply for our customers, but working with them closely to ensure that we're able to cover those costs. What I have referenced, I think, fairly consistently the last couple of quarters is that the timing of when that cost is recognized versus to look at and to manage. But the overall economics of the program are as expected and intended, which is to cover that cost. And then as it relates to -- I think your question was about access to the products. It continues to improve, but especially on the glove side, it's still constrained, but improving day by day. There's clearly capacity that's being worked in to provide more supply. But especially in gloves, it just takes -- it's a longer process to get that supply to market. 
As it relates to Cordis and any dissynergies, I wouldn't call it dissynergies. There are -- certainly, when we look at just our overall cost structure and stranded costs, there's things of that nature. But when we estimate the $60 million to $70 million, that's the all-in impact that's associated with that. We would not anticipate that there are other issues. In fact, I'd go the opposite way. Part of what we've highlighted before about this transaction is that it allows us to focus and to simplify our operating structure around the remaining businesses. And so we think it will create some opportunities for additional synergies more of -- than more of a dissynergies by being more focused on the cost efficiencies of what remains."

We remain focused on serving our customers and their patients and continue to advance our strategic priorities. With our resilient business model, we are navigating the effects of the pandemic on our businesses. In the quarter, we continued to see strong demand for lab and PPE products and volume recovery in our nuclear business. Medical elective procedure utilization experienced some volatility, and we saw ongoing COVID-19 related softness in generics volumes, which we now expect to extend into the next fiscal year. With these updated assumptions, we have revised our Pharma segment outlook. 
Despite the impacts of COVID-19, our business fundamentals are strong, demonstrated by the underlying growth we are seeing in both segments, and we continue to advance our strategic priorities including optimizing our supply chain and portfolio as you saw in our recently announced agreement to sell the Cordis business.

Now for our consolid",1379,"Thanks, Mike. Before I dive into the current quarter, as a reminder we are now comparing against a prior year quarter that included a benefit from accelerated pharmaceutical sales and increased PPE demand due to the onset of COVID-19. Now for our consolidated third quarter results, total company revenue of $39.3 billion was inline with the prior year. Consolidated gross margin for the period was $1.8 billion. SG&A decreased nearly 4% to $1.1 billion, demonstrating our enterprise-wide commitment to disciplined expense management. 
The net result for the quarter was operating earnings of $689 million, a decrease of 4% due to the impact of COVID-19, primarily concentrated in the Pharma segment. Adjusted for COVID-19, we estimate operating earnings would have grown mid-single digits in the quarter. Moving below the line, interest and other income and expense decreased significantly in the quarter, driven by multiple items, including an increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan investments, lower interest expense from prior period debt reduction or one-time investment gains. As we previously mentioned, deferred compensation gains or losses reported in interest and other are fully offset in corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line. Average diluted shares outstanding were $294 million. Of note, during the quarter, we repurchased $200 million of shares. 
Third quarter EPS was $1.53, which reflects an effective tax rate of 31.2%, approximately 5.5 percentage points above the prior year, due to the timing of discreet items. This includes adjustments for the resolution of all and issues with the IRS for fiscal years 2008 to 2010 as well as certain transfer pricing matters for fiscal years 2011 to 2014, which also impacted results for later years. Turning to cash and the balance sheet, we generated operating cash flow of $277 million, bringing our year-to-date operating cash flow to $1.8 billion. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.5 billion and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. Now for the segment results, beginning with Pharma on Slide 5. Pharma segment revenue was flat $35.1 billion. This reflects sales growth from Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers, compared against the previously mentioned COVID-19-related sales acceleration in the prior year. Segment profit decreased 4% to $511 million, primarily due to COVID-19-related volume declines in our generics program, which was partially offset by a higher contribution for brand sales mix. Excluding the volume impacts, our generics program continued to see generally consistent market dynamics. 
Additionally, we were encouraged to see our Nuclear business continue its recovery as we saw an improvement in volumes as we exited the quarter. In Specialty, we continue to see year-over-year growth and are excited about recent wins in our 3PL and Hub business. And the pharma team remains focused on diligent expense management, delivering strong  cost savings in the quarter. 
Now, I'm transitioning to Medical on Slide 6. Medical segment revenue increased 3% to $4.2 billion, driven primarily by the impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution. As in prior quarters, we saw higher selling prices and volumes in PPE as well as higher volumes in our lab business, partially offset by lower demand for surgical products resulting from reduced elective procedures. Segment profit decreased 2% to $174 million. During the quarter, cost savings including global manufacturing efficiencies were offset by a decline in products and distribution. Additionally, segment profit experienced a slight net negative impact due to COVID-19, driven by the sell-through of PPE safety stock in the prior year.
Now, let me step back to help frame our performance sequentially within the context of the previously-discussed factors. During the third quarter, demand for surgical products used in elective procedures averaged approximately 90% of pre-COVID-19 compared to the 95% average in the prior quarter. We saw choppiness especially early in the quarter, consistent with the evolution of the virus in various geographies, but as we exited the third quarter, elective volumes rebounded back to around 95%. Our lab business continued to experience the tailwind from increased demand for COVID-19 testing products, though as expected, not quite at the peak level seen last quarter. 
Regarding PPE, we continue to see elevated volumes. In the quarter, we were successful in managing the significant cost increases that we've incurred to procure select PPE products. As we previously mentioned, many of our customers have chosen to leverage our supply assurance program to manage market uncertainties, and we continue to expect timing variability as we support our customers through this dynamic environment. 
Next, on Slide 8, I will review updates to our fiscal '21 outlook. Based on our performance to date and increase visibility for the balance of the fiscal year, we are narrowing our EPS guidance to $5.90 to $6.05, which continues to reflect 10% EPS growth at the mid-point. We are making the following changes to our corporate assumptions. We now expect interest and other in the range of $145 million to $160 million, driven primarily by the deferred compensation favorability to date, which as a reminder, is offset above the line. We are narrowing our effective tax rate to 23.5% to 25%, reflecting the previously mentioned IRS resolutions. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 294 million shares, which includes the repurchases completed during the quarter. Additionally, capital expenditures are now expected in the range of $400 million to $430 million. 
Moving to the segment outlook on Slide 9. We are updating our Pharma segment profit outlook to flat to down low single digits due to updated expectations for COVID-19. Based on our third quarter exit rates and what we saw in April, we still expect brand pharmaceutical volumes to be at or near pre-COVID-19 levels as we exit the fiscal year, but we now expect the volume recovery of certain therapeutic classes within generics to extend into the end of calendar year 2021. 
As for the Medical segment, we continue to expect elective procedures to be at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the fiscal year as well as segment profit growth in the low to mid-20s percentage range for fiscal '21. With respect to the enterprise, we now expect COVID-19 to be a minimal net year-over-year driver. This guidance assumes a meaningful year-over-year COVID-19 headwind for the Pharma segment and a similar tailwind for the Medical segment. 
Before I conclude, let me take a moment to provide an update on capital allocation. We continue to manage our portfolio and the balance sheet in a prudent manner consistent with our priorities while at the same time driving improved financial flexibility. We expect the sale of Cordis to close in the first quarter of our fiscal '22. This transaction, along with the previously announced tax receivable, is expected to generate nearly $2 billion of incremental proceeds in the first half of our fiscal '22. We expect to utilize these proceeds in a manner consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. 
With respect to our first priority, investing in the business to enable our strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities, we continue to be excited by the projects in flight. We expect this to remain our highest focus for capital deployment and to continue to prioritize investment in these areas. Regarding the balance sheet, as previously communicated, we expect to repay $1.4 billion of debt on or before June 2022. Combined with prior repayments, this would represent a total debt reduction of nearly $5 billion over 5 years. While we will continue to evaluate additional opportunities to reduce debt, we anticipate our future repayments will be more modest as we approach our leverage target. 
At the same time, we are committed to our dividend, which remains an important component of our capital allocation strategy. With that in mind, our Board recently approved a 1% dividend increase for fiscal '22. Outside of these 3 key priorities, we'll continue to evaluate tuck-in M&A within our strategic growth areas and opportunistic share repurchases. As I mentioned, our improving financial flexibility enabled the deployment of capital for share repurchases during the third quarter. With that, I'll turn it back over to Mike."

As I mentioned earlier, the last year has highlighted certain opportunities for growth, transformation and innovation, and we're confident that our strategic direction will deliver both short- and long-term success. In Pharma, we are excited about the mid- to long-term trajectory of the segment. Our business model is resilient. We're expecting strong long-term growth in key areas like specialty and nuclear, both of which are rebounding well from prior COVID-related impacts, and we are executing a robust pipeline of initiatives in PD to support our customers' evolving needs. We also continue to invest in new technology solutions that enhance the customer experience and improve patient care. 
In Specialty, our recently launched Navista Tech Solutions uses artificial intelligence to identify and match cancer patients to clinical trials. These insights enable oncologists to improve outcomes and reduce cost as they transition to value-based care. We are also offering digital solutions in the connected care businesses that we recently branded collectively as outcomes. 
Each year, medication non-adherence cost, the U.S. health care system over $500 billion and contributes to around 275,000 avoidable patient death. With Outcomes, we've created a digital ecosystem that unites pharmacists, payers and pharmaceutical companies to improve medication adherence, drive better outcomes and lower the cost of care. Outcomes currently supports a network of 23 million patients and more than 60,000 pharmacy sites nationwide and through continued growth, it's positioned to address the challenge of medication adherence. 
As I look towards the future, I am excited about these innovations across the segment that combine our heritage and strengths with new technologies to create unique solutions that support our customers' ever-changing needs and create long-term value across the continuum of care.
Turning to Medical. We continue to enhance our operations to better serve our customers and their patients. For example, we continue to diversify the geographic concentration of our sourcing and invest in our self-manufacturing capabilities. This includes producing 15 million more safety needles and syringes, 20 million more isolation gowns and 150 million more surgical and procedure masks annually in our own North American facilities. 
We are also supporting customers' inventory needs with stockpile as-a-service storage solution in partnering with the Strategic National Stockpile to store and distribute 80,000 pallets of critical PPE. We are incorporating robotics, automation and data analytics across our warehouse and distribution process. We are piloting various technologies and being thoughtful about how and where to scale them across our network. We also continue to invest in key areas across the segment. For example, we are expanding our lab kitting services to support home collection for a broad array of lab tests from wellness to infectious disease, and we are coupling these services with capabilities in our Cardinal Health at-Home and OptiFreight businesses to maximize value and create differentiated solutions. By meeting the patient where they are, our lab kitting supports testing protocol adherence and detection of early onset disease, ultimately, lowering the cost of care.  
And in Medical Services, our OptiFreight Logistics business is launching innovative and comprehensive health care logistics offerings like our same-day solutions, which is being scaled nationally to support the time-critical logistics of our customers. Together, these work streams across medical position us to support our customers and drive long-term growth. Along with these work streams in each segment, we are also focused on enterprise-wide investments as well as advancing our capital allocation, portfolio optimization and ESG priorities. 
We continue to invest in our delivery networks, cold chain capabilities and supply chain capacity and visibility. For example, we are partnering with FourKites, the largest predictive supply chain visibility platform to create a cognitive network spanning both pharma and medical that combines real-time supply chain visibility, machine learning and artificial intelligence. This network facilitates inventory flow and gives our customers end-to-end visibility to see products in transit, enabling us to make any necessary adjustments for our customers in real time so they can better serve their patients.  
Regarding our capital allocation priorities, we have strong momentum. We remain committed to investing for future growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. We are on track to exceed our savings targets and are continuing to use some of these savings to reinvest in the business. We also remain focused on optimizing our portfolio. The pending sale of Cordis is progressing as expected and this divestiture enables us to simplify our operating model, further optimize our infrastructure and focus on our strategic growth areas where we are an advantaged owner. We are committed to our strategy as a global medical products and distribution leader and are focused on conducting business in markets and areas that align with our priorities.  
Finally, we're also advancing our environmental, social and governance activities. We recently partnered with AEP to power our global headquarters and our National Logistics Center with clean energy. And we remain deeply committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion at every level to ensure all of our employees can bring 100% of themselves to work every day.  
To close, I want to thank each of our employees whose commitment and ingenuity enable us to support our customers, their patients and our collective communities. With that, I'll pause to open it up for questions."

And it's probably not hard to think about if you've been following the IQVIA data and the other day. There are certain classes, particularly around acute scripts where we don't see those getting back to pre-COVID levels prior to our fiscal year-end. 
We think as kids get back to school, more people are masking and all those types of things. We would expect the environment to generally return, but we don't now seeing that set of certain therapeutic classes within generics returning to more pre-COVID levels until the end of the calendar year.

We've been seeing this in monitoring all the categories.

And it's good to note that we're seeing that in brands. We're still expecting that. We're seeing that in the majority of generics, particularly the chronic generics. Those are coming back.

Within -- let's just kind of step back from a COVID perspective overall for the medical business. As I mentioned in my prior answer, overall, for the quarter, there was an insignificant impact in the quarter related to COVID, a lot of moving pieces, and I'll get into a couple of the key drivers. As a reminder, just like the pharma comment earlier, there was a prior year pull-forward for PPE volume that we sold out of inventory. 
So we do have a slight negative year-over-year impact, which is related to the prior year tailwind that did not repeat in the current quarter. So the pieces within the quarter that we saw was ongoing elective volume headwinds. And what we did see in the quarter was a little bit of a deterioration from the prior quarter. So we saw -- in my comments in the prepared remarks, we saw that the utilization went down from 95% in the second quarter to closer to 90% in the third. But as I highlighted, it did improve the tail end and back to the 90%. And that was very consistent with what we saw with the surge in the virus. And so we feel better about how we exited that quarter. 
And why we did not change our guidance for the medical business as it relates to this topic as well just that we expected to be at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the year. We did continue to see strength in our lab business, although it was a little bit less than what we had in the prior quarter, but still strength. And that was an offset. And then we continue to see strong volumes with PPE. But again, you're comparing against a strong volume quarter last year. And we did have some favorability still for the timing of the recognition of the pricing cost associated with the much higher cost with PPE. And those dynamics continue to be somewhat fluid, but we do definitely still see higher costs, higher prices for some of the PPE products, especially gloves, some moderation, but generally still elevated.

As you know, our practice is that we're not -- we don't provide formal guidance on '22 until August, but we'll try to give you a little bit of color to be helpful. I'll start with the fact that we still feel really good about our growth areas. So when we think about specialty, at-home, nuclear, medical services and Outcomes, we feel really good about all of these businesses. We think they all have strong industry trends, strong outlooks, complementary capabilities to our businesses and our -- we continue to adapt their offerings to focus on our customers' needs. So I would say we would still expect all of those growth areas to be positive drivers for next year. And then let me have Jason give you a little bit of color on maybe a few of the other dynamics."
172207,709675654,2272645,"Cardinal Health, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Cardinal Health, Inc.","Executives","Sure. Thanks, Mike. Yes.

And to enable -- let me just start with, to enable those types of growth areas, we are making investments in our business, and we'll continue to make investments in those businesses. One thing to highlight is, as we've invested more capital over the last couple or several years, that will ultimately result in increased the depreciation that we would expect to flow through. But of course, we would also expect the benefits of the programs, but we'll have some varying pieces there going forward. Beyond that element, again, investing our business being our highest capital deployment priority, we have the other areas like debt reduction and returning capital to shareholders, some of which will be through share repurchases that should have a tailwind associated with it also. Getting into your question around COVID. That is, of course, where we'll see a lot of movement from a year-over-year perspective. 
As a reminder, we highlighted in fiscal '20 that we had roughly $100 million headwind associated with COVID, which was more than all in the fourth quarter. Now this year, and then just in this today's script, today's prepared remarks, we commented that it was a relatively consistent flat impact year-over-year from a COVID perspective now in this update. So that implies roughly $100 million included in fiscal '21. 
Now the key question is exactly how does that roll off down to '22. And I would first go back and highlight that a number of the areas we anticipate getting at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the fiscal year, like the medical elective volumes, nuclear to a similar extent. The brand volumes we've highlighted are also similar. It's those very specific therapeutic drugs within generics will be deferred then until more like the middle of our fiscal '22. So there will be some offset there that will continue on into the next year. 
Now there's going to be a lot of other moving pieces with COVID. We would expect there still to be some elevated demand for areas like PPE and the lab business. But we also have the timing elements associated with PPE pricing costs that we continue to track very closely, and it will really be a function of those pricing and cost dynamics as we go forward. So when I think about the 2 different segments, what that really comes down to is that certainly, the greatest impact -- we have a headwind built into this guidance and that $100 million associated with the pharma business, and we have now more of a tailwind for the medical business. 
And so we highlighted that from a year-over-year perspective as well in the prepared remarks that it's a meaningful impact in both this year. And so they will behave then differently next year. And then, of course, the other key piece to think about the puts and takes is the announcement of the sale of Cordis. So we do anticipate that being in the first quarter, hopefully, earlier in the first quarter. And we disclosed prior that, that business carries about a $60 million to $70 million annualized earnings rate. And so as we get more specific to exact timing and other details around that, we will provide more color as to what the impact will be for our fiscal '22."

Yes. So yes, we have captured the cost increases. The Supply Assurance Program that we've referenced was created to do exactly that, to provide certainty to supply for our customers, but working with them closely to ensure that we're able to cover those costs. What I have referenced, I think, fairly consistently the last couple of quarters is that the timing of when that cost is recognized versus when the price is recognized can be uncertain, can be relatively volatile and that's what we continue to look at and to manage. But the overall economics of the program are as expected and intended, which is to cover that cost. 
And then as it relates to -- I think your question was about access to the products. It continues to improve, but especially on the gloves side, it's still constrained, but improving day by day. There's clearly capacity that's being worked in to provide more supply. But especially in gloves, it just takes -- it's a longer process to get that supply to market. As it relates to Cordis and any dissynergies, I wouldn't call it dissynergies. There are -- certainly, when we look at just our overall cost structure and stranded costs, there's things of that nature. But when we estimate the $60 million to $70 million, that's the all-in impact that's associated with that. 
We would not anticipate that there are other issues. In fact, I'd go the opposite way. Part of what we've highlighted before about this transaction is that it allows us to focus and to simplify our operating structure around the remaining businesses. And so we think it will create some opportunities for additional synergies more of -- than more of dissynergies by being more focused on the cost efficiencies of what remains."

This reserve adjustment w",500,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will start my comments today by acknowledging that our fourth quarter results were below our expectations and yours primarily due to an inventory reserve adjustment of $197 million. This reserve adjustment was driven by changing market conditions related to COVID-19 on certain highly commoditized PPE products.
To meet our customer commitments during the pandemic, we carried higher levels of inventory in certain PPE categories during a period of significantly increased demand, higher prices and longer-than-normal supply chains. Our analysis at the quarter end of both the anticipated customer demand and projected future sale prices for these products resulted in a sizable inventory reserve that affected a subset of our medical products inventory.
In addition, there were a few other unexpected items that affected our results, which Jason will cover in his remarks. Throughout the past year, we have been taking action to drive performance, and we will continue to move forward with urgency. For example, we divested the Cordis business, extended our Red Oak Sourcing agreement with CVS Health, identified $250 million of additional cost savings opportunities, restructured parts of our organization to increase accountability and made important leadership changes. We are continually reviewing our business and seeking areas to improve.
With the actions we've taken to date and our plans for FY '22, we feel confident in our strategy and are encouraged by the tailwinds behind our growth areas and strong cash flow generation.
In FY '21, we grew revenue 6% versus the prior year and despite an estimated $200 million year-over-year operating earnings headwind related to COVID-19, we grew EPS. We continue to aggressively streamline our cost structure and surpassed our enterprise cost savings target for the third consecutive year. We generated strong operating cash flow, prioritized returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and took actions to further strengthen our balance sheet.
As I reflect on the unprecedented events of the past year, our team has prioritized our customers, maintained continuous operations, partnered with governmental agencies to support vaccine administration and protect patients, and further improve the resiliency of our supply chain.
Before turning it over to Jason, I want to highlight last week's announcement that we have negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement and settlement process designed to achieve broad resolution of governmental opioid claims. If all conditions are satisfied, this agreement would result in the settlement of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities, and depending on the level of state and subdivision participation, we would pay up to $6.4 billion over 18 years. This is an important step forward for our company. As we've consistently said, we remain committed to being part of the solution for the U.S. opioid epidemic and believe the settlement would be a prudent way to provide necessary leads to our communities and certainty for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jason to further discuss our results and FY '22 guidance."
172207,1671807472,2364370,"Cardinal Health, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Cardinal Health, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we delivered EPS of $0.77, which as Mike mentioned, included a $197 million inventory reserve on certain PPE in the Medical segment.Turning to the Pharma segment on Slide 6. Fourth quarter",1836,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we delivered EPS of $0.77, which as Mike mentioned, included a $197 million inventory reserve on certain PPE in the Medical segment.
Turning to the Pharma segment on Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue increased 15% to $38 billion, driven primarily by sales growth from large Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 included reduced pharmaceutical demand related to COVID-19, which, to a lesser extent, contributed to the growth in the quarter.
Pharma segment profit was flat in the fourth quarter at $358 million. This reflects COVID-19-related volume recovery in our Nuclear business, offset by Pharmaceutical Distribution customer contract renewals. This impact from renewals was in line with our expectations and generally consistent with prior quarters. However, there were some other items, including inventory adjustments and opioid-related legal costs that were higher than previously assumed.
As we've mentioned, we continue to prioritize investing for growth and optimizing our core operations. In the fourth quarter, the deployment of some of these technology enhancements resulted in incremental costs for implementation and depreciation, which we also expect the next several quarters as we continue to deploy new capabilities.
I will further discuss our investments as we look to fiscal year '22.
As we highlighted last quarter, we continued to experience softer volumes in certain therapeutic classes within our generics program. Our generics program continued to see generally consistent market dynamics.
With respect to other product types, including brand, specialty and consumer health, we largely saw volumes at or above pre-pandemic levels during the fourth quarter.
In Medical, depicted on Slide 7, revenue increased 23% to $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter. This revenue increase was driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution, primarily due to a recovery in elective procedure volumes and a positive PPE pricing impact. Medical segment loss of $63 million in the fourth quarter was due to an adverse impact from COVID-19, primarily due to the previously mentioned inventory reserve, partially offset by a recovery in elective procedure volumes. Additionally, benefits from cost savings initiatives were offset by elevated supply chain costs.
During the quarter, we were encouraged to see elective procedure volumes effectively return to near pre-COVID-19 levels. While our team continued to execute on our cost savings and efficiency initiatives within our global manufacturing and supply chain, we did experience elevated supply chain costs, particularly in the areas of freight, labor and commodities. We are taking actions to help mitigate these impacts. But as we look forward, we do expect some of these higher costs to continue into next year.
Now I'll transition to full year results, beginning with the Enterprise. Total company revenue increased 6% to $162 billion with strong top line growth in both segments. Consolidated gross margin decreased 2% to $6.8 billion. Despite sales growth, SG&A decreased 1%, reflecting the benefits of our enterprise-wide cost savings measures. Operating earnings decreased 5%, reflecting a headwind of approximately $200 million year-over-year related to COVID-19, which was split fairly evenly between the segments. Excluding COVID-19, operating earnings would have grown in the low single digits in fiscal '21.
Moving below the line, interest and other decreased 44% to $133 million, driven by multiple items, including lower interest expense from debt reduction actions and increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan and onetime investment gains. As a reminder, deferred compensation gains or losses reported in interest and other are fully offset in corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line.
Our annual effective tax rate finished at 22.8%, benefiting from discrete items. We finished the year with EPS of $5.57, reflecting growth of 2% despite the net COVID-19 headwind.
Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to operate with high net working capital efficiency, generating robust operating cash flow of $2.4 billion for the full year. We finished the year with a strong cash position of $3.4 billion, with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities.
As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. We continue to deploy capital according to our priorities, investing $400 million back into the business in CapEx to drive organic growth, strengthening our balance sheet to approximately $550 million in debt paydown, which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter and returning nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
As for the segment's full year results, beginning with Pharma on Slide 10. Pharma revenue increased 6% to $146 billion, driven by sales growth from Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers. Pharma segment profit decreased 4% to $1.7 billion due to volume declines in the company's generics program, including the impact of COVID-19. This was partially offset by favorable brand sales mix. Excluding COVID-19, we estimate the Pharma segment would have grown low single digits in fiscal '21. 
Turning to Medical on Slide 11. Full year Medical revenue increased 8% to $16.7 billion, driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution. As we saw throughout the year, this increase was primarily due to the impact of PPE sales and higher volumes in our Lab business. Medical segment profit decreased 13% to $577 million due to an adverse impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution. This was primarily due to the fourth quarter inventory reserve on certain PPE products, partially offset by higher volumes in our Lab business. Additionally, the team delivered strong cost savings, including global manufacturing efficiencies on the year.
When adjusting for COVID-19-related impacts in Medical, we estimate the segment would have grown mid-single digits for the full year. While our fiscal '21 results fell short of our expectations, the underlying growth we saw in both segments, excluding COVID-19, gives us confidence as we move into next year and the pandemic effects in our businesses continue to dissipate.
Turning to our guidance for fiscal '22 on Slide 13. We expect earnings per share in the range of $5.60 to $5.90. This reflects incremental technology investments of approximately $120 million to drive growth and efficiencies across the enterprise, the Cordis divestiture and other assumptions that we will detail momentarily. We expect interest and other in the range of $150 million to $180 million. We anticipate continued reduction in interest expense with the increase over the prior year, primarily a result of the fiscal '21 capability in deferred compensation not expected to repeat.
We are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of $287 million to $292 million, and CapEx of $400 million to $450 million.
Transitioning to the segments, beginning with Pharma on Slide 14. We expect high single-digit revenue growth driven by growth from large customers and continued COVID-19 recovery and mid-single-digit segment profit growth. We anticipate COVID-19 will be an overall tailwind of approximately $100 million to Pharma segment profit compared to the prior year. While we will likely continue to see some choppiness, we expect volume recovery in certain generic therapeutic classes by the end of the calendar year. As mentioned, we are investing in technology enhancements to drive growth and efficiencies, which we expect will lead to an $80 million segment profit headwind in fiscal '22, including the annualization of the investments made in the fourth quarter.
Adjusting for the COVID-19-related impacts and the incremental technology investments, we see Pharma normalized growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. We believe normalizing for these impacts provides a better approximation for the long-range growth trajectory of the business.
As for other assumptions, we continue to expect consistent market dynamics in our generics program. We expect increased contributions from our growth areas, specialty, including biosimilars, nuclear and outcomes. We anticipate a similar contingent brand inflation rate as in fiscal '21 with continued less dollar contribution each year. And we expect opioid-related legal costs of approximately $125 million, an increase of $10 million versus fiscal '21.
For Medical on Slide 15. We expect revenue to be approximately flat in fiscal '22, primarily due to the prior year COVID-19 comparison with low double-digit segment profit growth. With respect to COVID-19, we expect an approximate $100 million year-over-year tailwind to Medical segment profit. We are assuming elective procedures to remain at or near pre-COVID levels for the duration of the year. We expect moderate headwinds in fiscal '22 related to timing of selling higher-cost PPE products and lower lab testing utilization versus the prior year. And we anticipate a year-over-year comparison benefit related to the PPE inventory reserve.
Outside of COVID-19, we expect an approximate $80 million impact segment profit due to the Cordis divestiture. Note, the anticipated reported impact for fiscal '22 is higher than previously communicated, primarily due to exchange rate favorability and other operating improvements within the business in the prior year. Additionally, we expect to invest an incremental $20 million in technology enhancements in our at-home business to drive growth and efficiencies. Adjusting for these items, we see normalized Medical segment profit growth of mid- to high single digits in fiscal '22.
Finally, as seen in the fourth quarter, we expect elevated supply chain cost to persist, particularly in the first half of the year. We anticipate these elevated costs will be partially offset by the continued benefits from our global manufacturing and supply chain transformation, which will ramp up throughout the year.
Now a few additional comments on the expected cadence next year. We expect profit growth to be significantly back-half weighted in both segments. In Pharma, this is primarily driven by the timing of the previously mentioned incremental technology investments being more weighted towards the front half as well as stronger expected second half performance in our generics program, including the impact of COVID-19.
In Medical, in addition to the elevated supply chain costs, we also anticipate the total unfavorable fiscal '22 COVID-19 impact of approximately $50 million to occur primarily in the first half of the year. As a reminder, we also experienced favorable COVID-19 impact in the first half of fiscal '21, which was of a similar magnitude.
Across the organization, we continue to place a high priority on cash flow generation as well as allocating capital in a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly manner. Our strong cash flow and improving capital position will enable our capital allocation priorities, support our company's obligations and provide increased flexibility and the ability to be more opportunistic in our capital deployment. Along those lines, we anticipate deploying the Cordis proceeds through a combination of share repurchases and debt paydown, which is expected to offset the earnings dilution on a pro forma basis. We expect share repurchases in the range of $500 million to $1 billion in fiscal '22. In addition, we expect total debt paydown of approximately $850 million, reflecting the completion of the remaining June 2022 debt tower at or before maturity.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Mike."

The majority of these benefits will materialize at FY '23 and beyond. In Pharma, we're investing an additional $80 million in technology infrastructure to create additional operational efficiencies, improve data insights and drive cost synergies to enhance our ability to grow and generate better outcomes for our customers.
Our generics program remains a critical priority. This week, we extended our Red Oak agreement with CVS Health for an additional 5 years, which takes the term of our generic sourcing joint venture through June 30, 2029. This ensures that we can continue to deliver best-in-class sourcing capabilities for our customers well into the future. We are also investing in data and analytics, including our pricing capabilities as we continue to focus on managing all components of our generics program and expect market dynamics consistent with the last few years.
We remain committed to supporting the retail pharmacy community. At our recent Annual Retail Business conference, we connected virtually with over 4,000 retail independent pharmacy customers and launched 2 new digital offerings, NavixRx and e-commerce storefront to help independent pharmacies expand their services and improve health care outcomes.
In Specialty, we're investing in our SynXis patient hub where our technology solutions [Audio Gap] the products, including cell and gene therapies. In Nuclear, we received FDA approval to use our radioactive diagnostic agent lymphosleep in pediatric patients 1 month and older. We continue to build out our multimillion dollar center for Theranostics advancement in Indianapolis and are also investing to expand our PET capabilities. We expect double-digit profit growth in Nuclear over the next several years. And in outcomes, we also expect double-digit profit growth as we expand our direct-to-patient digital footprint and implement new patient adherence programs.
Turning to Medical. We have been taking quick decisive actions throughout the fiscal year to streamline and simplify our Medical business, and this work remains a top priority heading into FY '22. We've recently restructured our organization to establish clearer lines of ownership and accountability, and made some management changes, including appointing a single leader to manage U.S. medical products and distribution as well as a single leader to manage international.
With the divestiture of Cordis, we plan to significantly reduce our international commercial footprint and have initially identified 36 markets we intend to exit, so we can focus on the locations where we have a competitive advantage and can generate sustained long-term growth.
We're laser-focused on enhancing supply chain resiliency, improving business continuity and investing in advanced planning capabilities to drive forward-looking insights to better serve our customers and their patients.
In addition, our Medical Services businesses, Option Freight Logistics and WaveMark continue to enable clinically integrated and digitally automated supply chains. Our at-Home business continues to focus on enabling and supporting comfortable home-based care for patients with acute and chronic conditions. We continue to see volume growth as care is rapidly shifting to the home.
For FY '22, we're investing an additional $20 million in technology infrastructure to create operational efficiencies and better data visibility.
With respect to the Enterprise, we're aggressively reviewing our cost structure to continue streamlining our operations and processes and intend to reinvest a portion of these savings to fuel future growth. In FY '22, we plan to launch initiatives that will deliver at least an additional $250 million savings by FY '23.
As Jason discussed earlier, we take a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly approach to capital deployment with a focus on investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders.
In closing, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and contributions that make it possible for Cardinal Health to fulfill its mission of improving the lives of people every day. And now Jason and I will take your questions."

And first of all, yes, I think we had some really great cash flow this last year. So $2.4 billion of operating cash flow and that resulted in a $3.4 billion ending cash balance, which does include the $500 million debt paydown that we completed in the fourth quarter. So as you indicated perfectly, we are stepping into this year with a lot of flexibility even before the Cordis transaction closed, which was just a few days ago, which does add another $1 billion to that balance. As we highlighted in some of those comments this morning, we do expect to pay down the $850 million is coming due by the end of the fiscal year or before end of the fiscal year. So that will be some of those uses. And then, of course, we guided towards the $500 million to $1 billion for the share repurchases, which is a fairly wide range reflective of some of the flexibility that we talked about.
And as I think about the Cordis proceeds, of course, cash is somewhat fungible. But essentially, that $1 billion, how we're thinking about it is accelerating some of that debt paydown and a portion of that, $500 million to $1 billion. So we feel real good about that as we entered into the first quarter here. You referenced the tax receivable. And I don't think we provided any updated comments on that so far. Last quarter, I referenced that we expected by the end of the calendar year. That's still our expectation, like, I think, a lot of different organizations throughout the world right now. I think Cohen has impacted some of the processes and a little bit less certainty as to the precise timing. But we still feel pretty good that's a good approximate time frame. But when you think about receiving those proceeds perhaps late in the calendar year, there will be less time to actually deploy those to the balance of this year. So that's certainly still a potential opportunity to get us maybe to some of the higher ends of that range. But nonetheless, there's a lot of flexibility that goes along with that.
As you indicated, when we talk about the opportunistic uses, essentially, we have increased flexibility here. M&A is always on that list. And it depends on the opportunity, the valuation and what we see is delivering to us strategically. And so that will be another thing that we evaluate along the year."

And -- but the key thing on a pro forma basis is that extra $1 billion will be deployed in some manner. And we will see -- and certainly, within fiscal '23 run rate, there will not be dilution expected for that divestiture.
As it relates to yet another question, somewhat as it relates to credit issues. There's nothing there. I mean we're on a gliding path to getting to our targeted leverage ratio. A key part that I referenced last quarter is that this remaining debt that's coming due at the end of this fiscal year is a key part of getting us towards those targets. And I indicated last quarter that I would anticipate the level of debt paydown to begin to diminish after this fiscal year. That continues to be our expectation. There's a lot of factors, as Mike just referenced, that could play into that. But overall, that remains our viewpoint, and there's nothing here that is, I'll say, overly constructive from that point, just a little bit of prudence until we get some of these risks and uncertainties defined.

And then we step back -- every quarter, we would step back and do our analysis and determine what the net realizable value that is and then make any adjustments that may be necessary. So as Mike highlighted, there were some highly commoditized products. So it's a subset of our PPE that -- think of it as those products that would have more volatile type of pricing. We saw that move more dramatically over the period. And given it was a subset of our inventory, it was relatively defined. It was a relatively large percentage reduction within that, but it was contained to a certain subset. And again, we're not going to get into all the details product by product, but it was that type of product that has a little bit less of the value add and then therefore, has a little bit easier to get more supply into the market and that drove the prices down quicker than other products.

And then your question regarding investments. Those investments are a mixture of -- we've spent quite heavily over the last couple of several years on the capital side of getting these IT systems in place. We are finalizing that multiyear journey now and are starting to depreciate those assets. So there will be elevated depreciation that, of course, is more fixed in nature. But there's also a component of the final testing and rollout launch of these systems tend to be more expense versus capital. And so as we're right in that rollout stage, that expense will be elevated in that part, we would expect to reduce longer term, certainly beyond fiscal '22.

I guess I'm curious, geographically, is this cost pressure mainly in the U.S. or is it international as well, in addition to some other color just on mechanically what's happening there? And does the sale of Cordis alleviate this in any way into fiscal '22?"

Of course, there could have been elevated costs on some of their raw materials and products. And Cordis being more international, obviously, it had more FX potential fluctuation. But don't see Cordis being a factor there. As far as the elevated supply chain cost, what we started seeing in the fourth quarter is, I think, which you're hearing a lot of companies talking about, we're seeing increased fuel costs, we're starting to see the cost of, for instance, containers can be 3 to 10x what they cost to chip in prior to COVID just due to ports being plugged, things like that. So we're just -- wages, et cetera. So it's just those types of things that we're seeing general elevated supply chain across the board. Again, we saw that in Q4. We expect that to continue in for the first couple of quarters. And then as things get back to more normal, we'll be able to see some either reductions in those or we'll be able to take some of those costs and where possible that appropriately pass it through to customers if it's a more permanent type of thing. So we'll be monitoring that and keeping our eyes on that."

We do expect continued double-digit growth from Nuclear and Specialty and our Outcomes businesses. We see all of them next year being able to grow top and bottom lines by double digits. And we continue to see those businesses continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of the overall Pharma segment. So as they continue to grow at those rates and are a bigger portion of the segment, obviously, they're going to continue to have more and more impact. We feel really good about the pipeline of products in Nuclear. And with the work we're doing in our center for advancement of theranostics, we already have a significant amount of manufacturers committed to joining us in the center when we open it and working together on some new both treatments and diagnostics for cancer and other areas. So we feel good about all of those businesses.

What we're seeing there is we're expecting the overall inflation rate to just be similar for the last couple of years. So we're not seeing any real changes there. And as Jason mentioned, the reason you said getting less dollars is because more of the suppliers that were contingent to inflation have moved to noncontingent, and we've renegotiated a couple of those DSAs over the last year so that we will no longer be contingent to inflation.
As far as overall rates go, I would say, we continue to feel very good about our overall value proposition. We have very strong relationships with manufacturers. And as you know, when any time there's changes in their portfolios, sometimes that means they should get a lower price when they have higher cost drugs coming out and sometimes they need to pay more fees when they lose, say, a high-priced item to patent expiration. And so those types of moving parts in terms of volume and average line extension are taken into account with each negotiation, and the team has done an excellent job working with our manufacturing partners and continue to have what I consider to be a fair market rate for that and feel very good about that, being able to be something that we can continue going forward.
As far as the Red Oak, we won't be able to get into any specifics there. But as you can imagine, it's been an excellent 7-year relationship. The team there continues to remain intact. They have decades of generic buying experience. The leadership there and the team has -- just a great group of individuals, again, with experience that continues to bring new ideas together to the market to be able to help us continue to get the best cost in the marketplace. And we continue to partner well with CVS at Board meetings, et cetera, to continue to drive that.

This reserve adjustment w",500,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will start my comments today by acknowledging that our fourth quarter results were below our expectations and yours primarily due to an inventory reserve adjustment of $197 million. This reserve adjustment was driven by changing market conditions related to COVID-19 on certain highly commoditized PPE products.
To meet our customer commitments during the pandemic, we carried higher levels of inventory in certain PPE categories during a period of significantly increased demand, higher prices and longer-than-normal supply chains. Our analysis at the quarter end of both the anticipated customer demand and projected future sale prices for these products resulted in a sizable inventory reserve that affected a subset of our medical products inventory.
In addition, there were a few other unexpected items that affected our results, which Jason will cover in his remarks. Throughout the past year, we have been taking action to drive performance, and we will continue to move forward with urgency. For example, we divested the Cordis business, extended our Red Oak Sourcing agreement with CVS Health, identified $250 million of additional cost savings opportunities, restructured parts of our organization to increase accountability and made important leadership changes. We are continually reviewing our business and seeking areas to improve.
With the actions we've taken to date and our plans for FY '22, we feel confident in our strategy and are encouraged by the tailwinds behind our growth areas and strong cash flow generation.
In FY '21, we grew revenue 6% versus the prior year and despite an estimated $200 million year-over-year operating earnings headwind related to COVID-19, we grew EPS. We continue to aggressively streamline our cost structure and surpassed our enterprise cost savings target for the third consecutive year. We generated strong operating cash flow, prioritized returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and took actions to further strengthen our balance sheet.
As I reflect on the unprecedented events of the past year, our team has prioritized our customers, maintained continuous operations, partnered with governmental agencies to support vaccine administration and protect patients has further improve the resiliency of our supply chain.
Before turning it over to Jason, I want to highlight last week's announcement that we have negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement and settlement process designed to achieve broad resolution of governmental opioid claims. If all conditions are satisfied, this agreement would result in the settlement of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities, and depending on the level of state and subdivision participation, we would pay up to $6.4 billion over 18 years. This is an important step forward for our company. As we've consistently said, we remain committed to being part of the solution for the U.S. opioid epidemic and believe the settlement would be a prudent way to provide necessary leads to our communities and certainty for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jason to further discuss our results and FY '22 guidance."
172207,1671807472,2364813,"Cardinal Health, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Cardinal Health, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we delivered EPS of $0.77, which as Mike mentioned, included a $197 million inventory reserve on certain PPE in the Medical segment.Turning to the Pharma segment on Slide 6. Fourth quarter",1837,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we delivered EPS of $0.77, which as Mike mentioned, included a $197 million inventory reserve on certain PPE in the Medical segment.
Turning to the Pharma segment on Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue increased 15% to $38 billion, driven primarily by sales growth from large Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 included reduced pharmaceutical demand related to COVID-19, which, to a lesser extent, contributed to the growth in the quarter.
Pharma segment profit was flat in the fourth quarter at $358 million. This reflects COVID-19-related volume recovery in our Nuclear business, offset by Pharmaceutical Distribution customer contract renewals. This impact from renewals was in line with our expectations and generally consistent with prior quarters. However, there were some other items, including inventory adjustments and opioid-related legal costs that were higher than previously assumed.
As we've mentioned, we continue to prioritize investing for growth and optimizing our core operations. In the fourth quarter, the deployment of some of these technology enhancements resulted in incremental costs for implementation and depreciation, which we also expect the next several quarters as we continue to deploy new capabilities.
I will further discuss our investments as we look to fiscal year '22.
As we highlighted last quarter, we continued to experience softer volumes in certain therapeutic classes within our generics program. Our generics program continued to see generally consistent market dynamics. With respect to other product types, including brand, specialty and consumer health, we largely saw volumes at or above pre-pandemic levels during the fourth quarter.
In Medical, depicted on Slide 7, revenue increased 23% to $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter. This revenue increase was driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution, primarily due to a recovery in elective procedure volumes and a positive PPE pricing impact. Medical segment loss of $63 million in the fourth quarter was due to an adverse impact from COVID-19, primarily due to the previously mentioned inventory reserve, partially offset by a recovery in elective procedure volumes. Additionally, benefits from cost savings initiatives were offset by elevated supply chain costs.
During the quarter, we were encouraged to see elective procedure volumes effectively return to near pre-COVID-19 levels. While our team continued to execute on our cost savings and efficiency initiatives within our global manufacturing and supply chain, we did experience elevated supply chain costs, particularly in the areas of freight, labor and commodities. We are taking actions to help mitigate these impacts. But as we look forward, we do expect some of these higher costs to continue into next year.
Now I'll transition to full year results, beginning with the enterprise. Total company revenue increased 6% to $162 billion with strong top line growth in both segments. Consolidated gross margin decreased 2% to $6.8 billion. Despite sales growth, SG&A decreased 1%, reflecting the benefits of our enterprise-wide cost savings measures. Operating earnings decreased 5%, reflecting a headwind of approximately $200 million year-over-year related to COVID-19, which was split fairly evenly between the segments. Excluding COVID-19, operating earnings would have grown in the low single digits in fiscal '21.
Moving below the line, interest and other decreased 44% to $133 million, driven by multiple items, including lower interest expense from debt reduction actions and increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan and onetime investment gains. As a reminder, deferred compensation gains or losses reported in interest and other are fully offset in corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line.
Our annual effective tax rate finished at 22.8%, benefiting from discrete items. We finished the year with EPS of $5.57, reflecting growth of 2% despite the net COVID-19 headwind.
Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to operate with high net working capital efficiency, generating robust operating cash flow of $2.4 billion for the full year. We finished the year with a strong cash position of $3.4 billion, with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities.
As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. We continue to deploy capital according to our priorities, investing $400 million back into the business in CapEx to drive organic growth, strengthening our balance sheet to approximately $550 million in debt paydown, which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter and returning nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
As for the segment's full year results, beginning with Pharma on Slide 10. Pharma revenue increased 6% to $146 billion, driven by sales growth from Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers. Pharma segment profit decreased 4% to $1.7 billion due to volume declines in the company's generics program, including the impact of COVID-19. This was partially offset by favorable brand sales mix. Excluding COVID-19, we estimate the Pharma segment would have grown low single digits in fiscal '21.
Turning to Medical on Slide 11. Full year Medical revenue increased 8% to $16.7 billion, driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution. As we saw throughout the year, this increase was primarily due to the impact of PPE sales and higher volumes in our Lab business. Medical segment profit decreased 13% to $577 million due to an adverse impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution. This was primarily due to the fourth quarter inventory reserve on certain PPE products, partially offset by higher volumes in our Lab business. Additionally, the team delivered strong cost savings, including global manufacturing efficiencies on the year.
When adjusting for COVID-19-related impacts in Medical, we estimate the segment would have grown mid-single digits for the full year. While our fiscal '21 results fell short of our expectations, the underlying growth we saw in both segments, excluding COVID-19, gives us confidence as we move into next year and the pandemic effects in our businesses continue to dissipate.
Turning to our guidance for fiscal '22 on Slide 13. We expect earnings per share in the range of $5.60 to $5.90. This reflects incremental technology investments of approximately $120 million to drive growth and efficiencies across the enterprise, the Cordis divestiture and other assumptions that we will detail momentarily. We expect interest and other in the range of $150 million to $180 million. We anticipate continued reduction in interest expense with the increase over the prior year, primarily a result of the fiscal '21 capability in deferred compensation not expected to repeat.
We are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of $287 million to $292 million, and CapEx of $400 million to $450 million.
Transitioning to the segments, beginning with Pharma on Slide 14. We expect high single-digit revenue growth driven by growth from large customers and continued COVID-19 recovery and mid-single-digit segment profit growth. We anticipate COVID-19 will be an overall tailwind of approximately $100 million to Pharma segment profit compared to the prior year. While we will likely continue to see some choppiness, we expect volume recovery in certain generic therapeutic classes by the end of the calendar year. As mentioned, we are investing in technology enhancements to drive growth and efficiencies, which we expect will lead to an $80 million segment profit headwind in fiscal '22, including the annualization of the investments made in the fourth quarter.
Adjusting for the COVID-19-related impacts and the incremental technology investments, we see Pharma normalized growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. We believe normalizing for these impacts provides a better approximation for the long-range growth trajectory of the business.
As for other assumptions, we continue to expect consistent market dynamics in our generics program. We expect increased contributions from our growth areas, specialty, including biosimilars, nuclear and outcomes. We anticipate a similar contingent brand inflation rate as in fiscal '21 with continued less dollar contribution each year. And we expect opioid-related legal costs of approximately $125 million, an increase of $10 million versus fiscal '21.
For Medical on Slide 15. We expect revenue to be approximately flat in fiscal '22, primarily due to the prior year COVID-19 comparison with low double-digit segment profit growth. With respect to COVID-19, we expect an approximate $100 million year-over-year tailwind to Medical segment profit. We are assuming elective procedures to remain at or near pre-COVID levels for the duration of the year. We expect moderate headwinds in fiscal '22 related to timing of selling higher-cost PPE products and lower lab testing utilization versus the prior year. And we anticipate a year-over-year comparison benefit related to the PPE inventory reserve.
Outside of COVID-19, we expect an approximate $80 million impact to segment profit due to the Cordis divestiture. Note, the anticipated reported impact for fiscal '22 is higher than previously communicated, primarily due to exchange rate favorability and other operating improvements within the business in the prior year. Additionally, we expect to invest an incremental $20 million in technology enhancements in our at-Home business to drive growth and efficiencies. Adjusting for these items, we see normalized Medical segment profit growth of mid- to high single digits in fiscal '22.
Finally, as seen in the fourth quarter, we expect elevated supply chain cost to persist, particularly in the first half of the year. We anticipate these elevated costs will be partially offset by the continued benefits from our global manufacturing and supply chain transformation, which will ramp up throughout the year.
Now a few additional comments on the expected cadence next year. We expect profit growth to be significantly back-half weighted in both segments. In Pharma, this is primarily driven by the timing of the previously mentioned incremental technology investments being more weighted towards the front half as well as stronger expected second half performance in our generics program, including the impact of COVID-19.
In Medical, in addition to the elevated supply chain costs, we also anticipate the total unfavorable fiscal '22 COVID-19 impact of approximately $50 million to occur primarily in the first half of the year. As a reminder, we also experienced favorable COVID-19 impact in the first half of fiscal '21, which was of a similar magnitude.
Across the organization, we continue to place a high priority on cash flow generation as well as allocating capital in a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly manner. Our strong cash flow and improving capital position will enable our capital allocation priorities, support our company's obligations and provide increased flexibility and the ability to be more opportunistic in our capital deployment.
Along those lines, we anticipate deploying the Cordis proceeds through a combination of share repurchases and debt paydown, which is expected to offset the earnings dilution on a pro forma basis. We expect share repurchases in the range of $500 million to $1 billion in fiscal '22. In addition, we expect total debt paydown of approximately $850 million, reflecting the completion of the remaining June 2022 debt tower at or before maturity.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Mike."

To be clear, we are disappointed with this finish to the year and are moving forward for the sense of urgency to improve our operation and execute our strategy. We're prioritizing investments in our strategic growth areas and expect these businesses to collectively realize double digit growth in FY '22. And across our business, we're enhancing our IT infrastructure in key areas to increase, capabilities and digitization improve the customer experience and drive productivity. While we expect to benefit from these investments this fiscal year, the majority of these benefits will materialize in FY '23 and beyond.
In Pharma, we're investing an additional $80 million in technology infrastructure to create additional operational efficiencies, improve data insights and drive cost synergies to enhance our ability to grow and generate better outcomes for our customers.
Our generics program remains a critical priority. This week, we extended our Red Oak agreement with CVS Health for an additional 5 years, which takes the term of our generic sourcing joint venture through June 30, 2029. This ensures that we can continue to deliver best-in-class sourcing capabilities for our customers well into the future. We are also investing in data and analytics, including our components of our generics program and expect market dynamics consistent with the last few years.
We remain committed to supporting the retail pharmacy community. At our recent Annual Retail Business conference, we connected virtually with over 4,000 retail independent pharmacy customers and launched 2 new digital offerings, NavixRx and e-commerce storefront to help independent pharmacies expand their services and improve health care outcomes.
In Specialty, we're investing in our SynXis patient hub where our technology solutions help biopharm customers remove barriers to patient care. In our third party logistics business, we're expanding our cold chain storage space to accommodate the growing number of temperature temperature-sensitive products, including cell and gene therapies.
In Nuclear, we received FDA approval to use our radioactive diagnostic agent Lymphoseek in pediatric patients 1 month and older. We continue to build out our multimillion dollar center for Theranostics advancement in Indianapolis and are also investing to expand our PET capabilities. We expect double-digit profit growth in Nuclear over the next several years. And in outcomes, we also expect double-digit profit growth as we expand our direct-to-patient digital footprint and implement new patient adherence programs.
Turning to Medical. We have been taking quick decisive actions throughout the fiscal year to streamline and simplify our Medical business, and this work remains a top priority heading into FY '22. We've recently restructured our organization to establish clearer value and made some management changes, including appointing a single leader to manage U.S. medical products and distribution as well as a single leader to manage international.
With the divestiture of Cordis, we plan to significantly reduce our international commercial footprint and have initially identified 36 markets we intend to exit, so we can focus on the locations where we have a competitive advantage and can generate sustained long-term growth.
We're laser-focused on enhancing supply chain resiliency, improving business continuity and investing in advanced planning capabilities to drive forward-looking insights to better serve our customers and their patients.
In addition, our Medical Services businesses, OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark continue to enable clinically integrated and digitally automated supply chains. Our at-Home business continues to focus on enabling and supporting comfortable home-based care for patients with acute and chronic conditions. We continue to see volume growth as care is rapidly shifting to the home.
For FY '22, we're investing an additional $20 million in technology infrastructure to create operational efficiencies and better data visibility.
With respect to the Enterprise, we're aggressively reviewing our cost structure to continue streamlining our operations and processes and intend to reinvest a portion of these savings to fuel future growth. In FY '22, we plan to launch initiatives that will deliver at least an additional $250 million savings by FY '23.
As Jason discussed earlier, we take a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly approach to capital deployment with a focus on investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders.
In closing, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and contributions that make it possible for Cardinal Health to fulfill its mission of improving the lives of people every day. And now Jason and I will take your questions."

When you think about that, think about your cash position as you sit now and the free cash that you're going to generate this year, even with the investments that you're making, do you think there's an opportunity to be a bit more aggressive either on the buyback given where your stock sits in the market?

And first of all, yes, I think we had some really great cash flow this last year. So $2.4 billion of operating cash flow and that resulted in a $3.4 billion ending cash balance, which does include the $500 million debt paydown that we completed in the fourth quarter. So as you indicated perfectly, we are stepping into this year with a lot of flexibility even before the Cordis transaction closed, which was just a few days ago, which does add another $1 billion to that balance. 
As we highlighted in some of those comments this morning, we do expect to paydown the $850 million is coming due by the end of the fiscal year or before end of the fiscal year. So that will be some of those uses. And then, of course, we guided towards the $500 million to $1 billion for the share repurchases, which is a fairly wide range reflective of some of the flexibility that we talked about.
And as I think about the Cordis proceeds, of course, cash is somewhat fungible. But essentially, that $1 billion, how we're thinking about it is accelerating some of that debt paydown and a portion of that, $500 million to $1 billion. So we feel real good about that as we entered into the first quarter here. You referenced the tax receivable. And I don't think we provided any updated comments on that so far. Last quarter, I referenced that we expected by the end of the calendar year. That's still our expectation, like, I think, a lot of different organizations throughout the world right now. I think COVID has impacted some of the processes and a little bit less certainty as to the precise timing. But we still feel pretty good that's a good approximate time frame. But when you think about receiving those proceeds perhaps late in the calendar year, there will be less time to actually deploy those to the balance of this year. So that's certainly still a potential opportunity to get us maybe to some of the higher ends of that range. But nonetheless, there's a lot of flexibility that goes along with that.
As you indicated, when we talk about the opportunistic uses, essentially, we have increased flexibility here. M&A is always on that list. And it depends on the opportunity, the valuation and what we see is delivering to us strategically. And so that will be another thing that we evaluate along the year."

And -- but the key thing on a pro forma basis is that extra $1 billion will be deployed in some manner. And we will see -- and certainly, within fiscal '23 run rate, there will not be dilution expected for that divestiture.
As it relates to yet another question, somewhat as it relates to credit issues. There's nothing there. I mean we're on a gliding path to getting to our targeted leverage ratio. A key part that I referenced last quarter is that this remaining debt that's coming due at the end of this fiscal year is a key part of getting us towards those targets. And I indicated last quarter that I would anticipate the level of debt paydown to begin to diminish after this fiscal year. That continues to be our expectation. There's a lot of factors, as Mike just referenced, that could play into that. But overall, that remains our viewpoint, and there's nothing here that is, I'll say, overly constructive from that point, just a little bit of prudence until we get some of these risks and uncertainties defined. And we also need to see underlying performance and cash flow over the course of the year.

And -- so as Mike mentioned, the key thing here is that there's a lot of uncertainties with the pandemic. And we were, first and foremost, going to put our customer commitments in front of us, and that resulted in a higher level of inventory that we carried over that period of time. And that happened while there was obviously increasing demand, higher prices and lower -- longer than normal types of supply chains.
And then we step back -- every quarter, we would step back and do our analysis and determine what the net realizable value that is and then make any adjustments that may be necessary. So as Mike highlighted, there were some highly commoditized products. So it's a subset of our PPE that -- think of it as those products that would have more volatile type of pricing. We saw that move more dramatically over the period. And given it was a subset of our inventory, it was relatively defined. It was a relatively large percentage reduction within that, but it was contained to a certain subset.
And again, we're not going to get into all the details product-by-product, but it was that type of product that has a little bit less of the value add and then therefore, has a little bit easier to get more supply into the market and that drove the prices down quicker than other products.

But as Mike mentioned, that the customer renewals is not something that we would anticipate to be significantly different year-over-year.
And then your question regarding investments. Those investments are a mixture of -- we've spent quite heavily over the last couple of several years on the capital side of getting these IT systems in place. We are finalizing that multiyear journey now and are starting to depreciate those assets. So there will be elevated depreciation that, of course, is more fixed in nature. But there's also a component of the final testing and rollout launch of these systems tend to be more expense versus capital. And so as we're right in that rollout stage, that expense will be elevated in that part, we would expect to reduce longer term, certainly beyond fiscal '22.

Of course, there could have been elevated costs on some of their raw materials and products. And Cordis being more international, obviously, it had more FX potential fluctuation. But don't see Cordis being a factor there. As far as the elevated supply chain cost, what we started seeing in the fourth quarter is, I think, which you're hearing a lot of companies talking about, we're seeing increased fuel costs, we're starting to see the cost of, for instance, containers can be 3 to 10x what they cost to ship in prior to COVID just due to ports being plugged, things like that.
So we're just -- wages, et cetera. So it's just those types of things that we're seeing general elevated supply chain across the board. Again, we saw that in Q4. We expect that to continue in for the first couple of quarters. And then as things get back to more normal, we'll be able to see some either reductions in those or we'll be able to take some of those costs and where possible that appropriately pass it through to customers if it's a more permanent type of thing.

We do expect continued double-digit growth from Nuclear and Specialty and our Outcomes businesses. We see all of them next year being able to grow top and bottom lines by double digits. And we continue to see those businesses continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of the overall Pharma segment.
So as they continue to grow at those rates and are a bigger portion of the segment, obviously, they're going to continue to have more and more impact. We feel really good about the pipeline of products in Nuclear. And with the work we're doing in our center for advancement of Theranostics, we already have a significant amount of manufacturers committed to joining us in the center when we open it and working together on some new both treatments and diagnostics for cancer and other areas.

What we're seeing there is we're expecting the overall inflation rate to just be similar for the last couple of years. So we're not seeing any real changes there. And as Jason mentioned, the reason you said getting less dollars is because more of the suppliers that were contingent to inflation have moved to noncontingent, and we've renegotiated a couple of those DSAs over the last year so that we will no longer be contingent to inflation.
As far as overall rates go, I would say, we continue to feel very good about our overall value proposition. We have very strong relationships with manufacturers. And as you know, when any time there's changes in their portfolios, sometimes that means they should get a lower price when they have higher cost drugs coming out and sometimes they need to pay more fees when they lose, say, a high-priced item to a patent expiration. And so those types of moving parts in terms of volume and average line extension are taken into account with each negotiation, and the team has done an excellent job working with our manufacturing partners and continue to have what I consider to be a fair market rate for that and feel very good about that, being able to be something that we can continue going forward.
As far as the Red Oak, we won't be able to get into any specifics there. But as you can imagine, it's been an excellent 7-year relationship. The team there continues to remain intact. They have decades of generic buying experience. The leadership there and the team has -- just a great group of individuals, again, with experience that continues to bring new ideas together to the market to be able to help us continue to get the best cost in the marketplace. And we continue to partner well with CVS at Board meetings, et cetera, to continue to drive that.

This reserve adjustment wa",500,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will start my comments today by acknowledging that our fourth quarter results were below our expectation and yours primarily due to an inventory reserve adjustment of $197 million. This reserve adjustment was driven by changing market conditions related to COVID-19 on certain highly commoditized PPE products.
To meet our customer commitments during the pandemic, we carried higher levels of inventory in certain PPE categories during a period of significantly increased demand, higher prices and longer-than-normal supply chains. Our analysis at the quarter end of both the anticipated customer demand and projected future sale prices for these products resulted in a sizable inventory reserve that affected a subset of our medical products inventory.
In addition, there were a few other unexpected items that affected our results, which Jason will cover in his remarks. Throughout the past year, we have been taking action to drive performance, and we will continue to move forward with urgency. For example, we divested the Cordis business, extended our Red Oak Sourcing Agreement with CVS Health, identified $250 million of additional cost savings opportunities, restructured parts of our organization to increase accountability and made important leadership changes. We are continually reviewing our business and seeking areas to improve.
With the actions we've taken to date and our plans for FY '22, we feel confident in our strategy, and are encouraged by the tailwinds behind our growth areas and strong cash flow generation.
In FY '21, we grew revenue 6% versus the prior year and despite an estimated $200 million year-over-year operating earnings headwind related to COVID-19, we grew EPS. We continued to aggressively streamline our cost structure and surpassed our enterprise cost savings target for the third consecutive year. We generated strong operating cash flow, prioritized returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and took actions to further strengthen our balance sheet.
As I reflect on the unprecedented events of the past year, our team has prioritized our customers, maintained continuous operations, partnered with governmental agencies to support vaccine administration and protect patients and further improved the resiliency of our supply chain.
Before turning it over to Jason, I want to highlight last week's announcement that we have negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement and settlement process designed to achieve broad resolution of governmental opioid claims. If all conditions are satisfied, this agreement would result in the settlement of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities. And depending on the level of state and subdivision participation, we would pay up to $6.4 billion over 18 years. This is an important step forward for our company. As we've consistently said, we remain committed to being part of the solution for the U.S. opioid epidemic and believe this settlement would be a prudent way to provide necessary leads to our communities and certainty for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jason to further discuss our results and FY '22 guidance."

In the fourth quarter, we delivered EPS of $0.77, which, as Mike mentioned, included a $197 million inventory reserve on certain PPE in the Medical segment.Turning to the Pharma segment on Slide 6. Fourth quarte",1841,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we delivered EPS of $0.77, which, as Mike mentioned, included a $197 million inventory reserve on certain PPE in the Medical segment.
Turning to the Pharma segment on Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue increased 15% to $38 billion driven primarily by sales growth from large Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 included reduced pharmaceutical demand related to COVID-19, which, to a lesser extent, contributed to the growth in the quarter.
Pharma segment profit was flat in the fourth quarter at $358 million. This reflects COVID-19-related volume recovery in our Nuclear business, offset by Pharmaceutical Distribution customer contract renewals. This impact from renewals was in line with our expectations and generally consistent with prior quarters. However, there were some other items, including inventory adjustments and opioid-related legal costs that were higher than previously assumed.
As we've mentioned, we continue to prioritize investing for growth and optimizing our core operations. In the fourth quarter, the deployment of some of these technology enhancements resulted in incremental costs for implementation and depreciation, which we also expect the next several quarters as we continue to deploy new capabilities.
I will further discuss our investments as we look to fiscal year '22.
As we highlighted last quarter, we continued to experience softer volumes in certain therapeutic classes within our generics program. Our generics program continued to see generally consistent market dynamics. With respect to other product types, including brand, specialty and consumer health, we largely saw volumes at or above pre-pandemic levels during the fourth quarter.
In Medical, depicted on Slide 7, revenue increased 23% to $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter. This revenue increase was driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution primarily due to a recovery in elective procedure volumes and a positive PPE pricing impact. Medical segment loss of $63 million in the fourth quarter was due to an adverse impact from COVID-19 primarily due to the previously mentioned inventory reserve, partially offset by a recovery in elective procedure volumes. Additionally, benefits from cost savings initiatives were offset by elevated supply chain costs.
During the quarter, we were encouraged to see elective procedure volumes effectively return to near pre-COVID-19 levels. While our team continued to execute on our cost savings and efficiency initiatives within our global manufacturing and supply chain, we did experience elevated supply chain costs, particularly in the areas of freight, labor and commodities. We are taking actions to help mitigate these impacts. But as we look forward, we do expect some of these higher costs to continue into next year.
Now I'll transition to full year results, beginning with the enterprise. Total company revenue increased 6% to $162 billion with strong top line growth in both segments. Consolidated gross margin decreased 2% to $6.8 billion. Despite sales growth, SG&A decreased 1%, reflecting the benefits of our enterprise-wide cost savings measures. Operating earnings decreased 5%, reflecting a headwind of approximately $200 million year-over-year related to COVID-19, which was split fairly evenly between the segments. Excluding COVID-19, operating earnings would have grown in the low single digits in fiscal '21.
Moving below the line, interest and other decreased 44% to $133 million driven by multiple items, including lower interest expense from debt reduction actions and increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan and onetime investment gains. As a reminder, deferred compensation gains or losses reported in interest and other are fully offset in corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line.
Our annual effective tax rate finished at 22.8%, benefiting from discrete items. We finished the year with EPS of $5.57, reflecting growth of 2% despite the net COVID-19 headwind.
Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to operate with high net working capital efficiency, generating robust operating cash flow of $2.4 billion for the full year. We finished the year with a strong cash position of $3.4 billion, with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. 
We continue to deploy capital according to our priorities, investing $400 million back into the business in CapEx to drive organic growth; strengthening our balance sheet to approximately $550 million in debt paydown, which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter; and returning nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
As for the segment's full year results, beginning with Pharma on Slide 10, Pharma revenue increased 6% to $146 billion driven by sales growth from Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers. Pharma segment profit decreased 4% to $1.7 billion due to volume declines in the company's generics program, including the impact of COVID-19. This was partially offset by favorable brand sales mix. Excluding COVID-19, we estimate the Pharma segment would have grown low single digits in fiscal '21.
Turning to Medical on Slide 11. Full year Medical revenue increased 8% to $16.7 billion driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution. As we saw throughout the year, this increase was primarily due to the impact of PPE sales and higher volumes in our Lab business. Medical segment profit decreased 13% to $577 million due to an adverse impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution. This was primarily due to the fourth quarter inventory reserve on certain PPE products, partially offset by higher volumes in our Lab business. Additionally, the team delivered strong cost savings, including global manufacturing efficiencies on the year.
When adjusting for COVID-19 related impacts in Medical, we estimate the segment would have grown mid-single digits for the full year. While our fiscal '21 results fell short of our expectations, the underlying growth we saw in both segments, excluding COVID-19, gives us confidence as we move into next year and the pandemic's effects on our businesses continue to dissipate.
Turning to our guidance for fiscal '22 on Slide 13. We expect earnings per share in the range of $5.60 to $5.90. This reflects incremental technology investments of approximately $120 million to drive growth and efficiencies across the enterprise, the Cordis divestiture and other assumptions that we will detail momentarily. We expect interest and other in the range of $150 million to $180 million. We anticipate continued reduction in interest expense with the increase over the prior year primarily a result of the fiscal '21 capability in deferred compensation not expected to repeat.
We are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 287 million to 292 million, and CapEx of $400 million to $450 million.
Transitioning to the segments, beginning with Pharma on Slide 14. We expect high single-digit revenue growth driven by growth from large customers and continued COVID-19 recovery and mid-single digit segment profit growth. We anticipate COVID-19 will be an overall tailwind of approximately $100 million to Pharma segment profit compared to the prior year. While we will likely continue to see some choppiness, we expect volume recovery in certain generic therapeutic classes by the end of the calendar year. As mentioned, we are investing in technology enhancements to drive growth and efficiencies, which we expect will lead to an $80 million segment profit headwind in fiscal '22, including the annualization of the investments made in the fourth quarter.
Adjusting for the COVID-19 related impacts and the incremental technology investments, we see Pharma normalized growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. We believe normalizing for these impacts provides a better approximation for the long-range growth trajectory of the business.
As for other assumptions, we continue to expect consistent market dynamics in our generics program. We expect increased contributions from our growth areas, Specialty, including biosimilars; Nuclear and Outcomes. We anticipate a similar contingent brand inflation rate as in fiscal '21 with continued less dollar contribution each year. And we expect opioid-related legal costs of approximately $125 million, an increase of $10 million versus fiscal '21.
For Medical on Slide 15, we expect revenue to be approximately flat in fiscal '22 primarily due to the prior year COVID-19 comparison with low double-digit segment profit growth. With respect to COVID-19, we expect an approximate $100 million year-over-year tailwind to Medical segment profit. We are assuming elective procedures to remain at or near pre-COVID levels for the duration of the year. We expect moderate headwinds in fiscal '22 related to timing of selling higher cost PPE products and lower lab testing utilization versus the prior year. And we anticipate a year-over-year comparison benefit related to the PPE inventory reserve.
Outside of COVID-19, we expect an approximate $80 million impact to segment profit due to the Cordis divestiture. Note, the anticipated reported impact for fiscal '22 is higher than previously communicated primarily due to exchange rate favorability and other operating improvements within the business in the prior year. Additionally, we expect to invest an incremental $20 million in technology enhancements in our at-Home business to drive growth and efficiencies. Adjusting for these items, we see normalized Medical segment profit growth of mid- to high single digits in fiscal '22.
Finally, as seen in the fourth quarter, we expect elevated supply chain cost to persist, particularly in the first half of the year. We anticipate these elevated costs will be partially offset by the continued benefits from our global manufacturing and supply chain transformation, which will ramp up throughout the year.
Now a few additional comments on the expected cadence next year. We expect profit growth to be significantly back-half weighted in both segments. In Pharma, this is primarily driven by the timing of the previously mentioned incremental technology investments being more weighted towards the front half as well as stronger expected second half performance in our generics program, including the impact of COVID-19.
In Medical, in addition to the elevated supply chain costs, we also anticipate the total unfavorable fiscal '22 COVID-19 impact of approximately $50 million to occur primarily in the first half of the year. As a reminder, we also experienced favorable COVID-19 impact in the first half of fiscal '21, which was of a similar magnitude.
Across the organization, we continue to place a high priority on cash flow generation as well as allocating capital in a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly manner. Our strong cash flow and improving capital position will enable our capital allocation priorities, support our company's obligations and provide increased flexibility and the ability to be more opportunistic in our capital deployment.
Along those lines, we anticipate deploying the Cordis proceeds through a combination of share repurchases and debt paydown, which is expected to offset the earnings dilution on a pro forma basis. We expect share repurchases in the range of $500 million to $1 billion in fiscal '22. In addition, we expect total debt paydown of approximately $850 million, reflecting the completion of the remaining June 2022 debt tower at or before maturity.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Mike."

To be clear, we are disappointed with this finish to the year and are moving forward for the sense of urgency to improve our operations and execute our strategy. We're prioritizing investments in our strategic growth areas and expect these businesses to collectively realize double digit growth in FY '22. And across our business, we're enhancing our IT infrastructure in key areas to increase capabilities in digitization, improve the customer experience and drive productivity. While we expect to benefit from these investments this fiscal year, the majority of these benefits will materialize in FY '23 and beyond.
In Pharma, we're investing an additional $80 million in technology infrastructure to create additional operational efficiencies, improve data insights and drive cost synergies to enhance our ability to grow and generate better outcomes for our customers.
Our generics program remains a critical priority. This week, we extended our Red Oak agreement with CVS Health for an additional 5 years, which takes the term of our generic sourcing joint venture through June 30, 2029. This ensures that we can continue to deliver best-in-class sourcing capabilities for our customers well into the future. We are also investing in data and analytics, including our pricing capabilities as we continue to focus on managing all components of our generics program and expect market dynamics consistent with the last few years.
We remain committed to supporting the retail pharmacy community. At our recent Annual Retail Business Conference, we connected virtually with over 4,000 retail independent pharmacy customers and launched 2 new digital offerings, NavixRx and E-Commerce Storefront, to help independent pharmacies expand their services and improve health care outcomes.
In Specialty, we're investing in our Sonexus patient hub where our technology solutions help biopharma customers remove barriers to patient care. In our third-party logistics business, we're expanding our cold chain storage space to accommodate the growing number of temperature-sensitive products, including cell and gene therapies.
In Nuclear, we received FDA approval to use our radioactive diagnostic agent LYMPHOSEEK in pediatric patients 1 month and older. We continue to build out our multimillion dollar center for Theranostics Advancement in Indianapolis and are also investing to expand our PET capabilities. We expect double-digit profit growth in Nuclear over the next several years. And in outcomes, we also expect double-digit profit growth as we expand our direct-to-patient digital footprint and implement new patient adherence programs.
Turning to Medical. We have been taking quick decisive actions throughout the fiscal year to streamline and simplify our Medical business, and this work remains a top priority heading into FY '22. We've recently restructured our organization to establish clear lines of ownership and accountability and made some management changes, including appointing a single leader to manage U.S. medical products and distribution as well as a single leader to manage international.
With the divestiture of Cordis, we plan to significantly reduce our international commercial footprint and have initially identified 36 markets we intend to exit so we can focus on the locations where we have a competitive advantage and can generate sustained long-term growth.
We're laser-focused on enhancing supply chain resiliency, improving business continuity and investing in advanced planning capabilities to drive forward-looking insights to better serve our customers and their patients.
In addition, our Medical Services businesses, OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark, continue to enable clinically integrated and digitally automated supply chains. Our at-Home business continues to focus on enabling and supporting comfortable home-based care for patients with acute and chronic conditions. We continue to see volume growth as care is rapidly shifting to the home. For FY '22, we're investing an additional $20 million in technology infrastructure to create operational efficiencies and better data visibility.
With respect to the Enterprise, we're aggressively reviewing our cost structure to continue streamlining our operations and processes and intend to reinvest a portion of these savings to fuel future growth. In FY '22, we plan to launch initiatives that will deliver at least an additional $250 million savings by FY '23.
As Jason discussed earlier, we take a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly approach to capital deployment with a focus on investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders.
In closing, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and contributions that make it possible for Cardinal Health to fulfill its mission of improving the lives of people every day. 
And now Jason and I will take your questions."

When you think about that, think about your cash position as you sit now and the free cash that you're going to generate this year, even with the investments that you're making, do you think there's an opportunity to be a bit more aggressive either on the buyback given where your stock sits in the market on M&A, given that you talked about a number of growth priorities, of which I assume with some bolt-on transactions.

And first of all, yes, I think we had some really great cash flow this last year. So $2.4 billion of operating cash flow and that resulted in a $3.4 billion ending cash balance, which does include the $500 million debt paydown that we completed in the fourth quarter. So as you indicated perfectly, we are stepping into this year with a lot of flexibility even before the Cordis transaction closed, which was just a few days ago, which does add another $1 billion to that balance. 
As we highlighted in some of those comments this morning, we do expect to paydown the $850 million that's coming due by the end of the fiscal year or before end of the fiscal year. So that will be some of those uses. And then, of course, we guided towards the $500 million to $1 billion for the share repurchases, which is a fairly wide range and reflective of some of the flexibility that we talked about.
And as I think about the Cordis proceeds, of course, cash is somewhat fungible. But essentially, that $1 billion, how we're thinking about it is accelerating some of that debt paydown and a portion of that, $500 million to $1 billion. So we feel real good about that as we entered into the first quarter here. You referenced the tax receivable. And I don't think we provided any updated comments on that so far. Last quarter, I had referenced that we expected by the end of the calendar year. That's still our expectation, like, I think, a lot of different organizations throughout the world right now. I think COVID has impacted some of the processes and a little bit less certainty as to the precise timing. But we still feel pretty good that it's the best -- good approximate time frame. But when you think about receiving those proceeds perhaps late in the calendar year, there will be less time to actually deploy those in the balance of this year. So that's certainly still a potential opportunity to get us maybe to some of the higher ends of that range. But nonetheless, there's a lot of flexibility that goes along with that.
As you indicated, when we talk about the opportunistic uses, essentially, we have increased flexibility here. M&A is always on that list. And it depends on the opportunity, the valuation and what we see is delivering to us strategically. And so that will be another thing that we evaluate along the year."

And -- but the key thing on a pro forma basis is that extra $1 billion will be deployed in some manner and we will see, and certainly, within fiscal '23 run rate, there will not be dilution expected for that divestiture.
As it relates to another question, somewhat as it relates to credit issues, there's nothing there. I mean we're on a guidance -- a glide path to getting to our targeted leverage ratio. A key part that I referenced last quarter is that this remaining debt that's coming due at the end of this fiscal year is a key part of getting us towards those targets. And I indicated last quarter that I would anticipate the level of debt paydown to begin to diminish after this fiscal year. That continues to be our expectation. There's a lot of factors, as Mike just referenced, that could play into that. But overall, that remains our viewpoint, and there's nothing here that is, I'll say, overly constrictive from that point, just a little bit of prudence until we get some of these risks and uncertainties defined. And we also need to see underlying performance and cash flow over the course of the year.

And then we step back -- every quarter, we step back and do our analysis and determine what the net realizable value that is and then make any adjustments that may be necessary. 
So as Mike highlighted, there were some highly commoditized products. So -- it's a subset of our PPE that -- think of it as those products that would have more volatile type of pricing. We saw that move more dramatically over the period. And given it was a subset of our inventory, it was relatively defined. It was a relatively large percentage reduction within that, but it was contained to a certain subset.
And again, we're not going to get into all the details product-by-product, but it was that type of product that has a little bit less of the value add and then therefore, has -- a little bit easier to get more supply into the market and that drove the prices down quicker than other products.

And then your question regarding investments, those investments are a mixture of -- we've spent quite heavily over the last couple of several years on the capital side of getting these IT systems in place. We are finalizing that multiyear journey now and are starting to depreciate those assets. So there will be elevated depreciation that, of course, is more fixed in nature. But there's also a component of the final testing, and rollout launch of these systems tend to be more expense versus capital. And so as we're right in that rollout stage, that expense will be elevated and that part, we would expect to reduce longer term, certainly beyond fiscal '22.

As far as the elevated supply chain cost, what we started seeing in the fourth quarter is, I think, which you're hearing a lot of companies talking about, we're seeing increased fuel costs, we're starting to see the cost of, for instance, containers could be 3 to 10x what they cost to ship in prior to COVID just due to ports being plugged, things like that.
So we're just -- wages, et cetera. So it's just those types of things that we're seeing general elevated supply chain across the board. Again, we saw that in Q4. We expect that to continue in for the first couple of quarters. And then as things get back to more normal, we'll be able to see some either reductions in those or we'll be able to take some of those costs and where possible that appropriately pass it through to customers if it's a more permanent type of thing.

We do expect continued double-digit growth from Nuclear and Specialty and our Outcomes businesses. We see all of them next year being able to grow top and bottom lines by double digits. And we continue to see those businesses continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of the overall Pharma segment.
So as they continue to grow at those rates and are a bigger portion of the segment, obviously, they're going to continue to have more and more impact. We feel really good about the pipeline of products in Nuclear. And with the work we're doing in our center for advancement of Theranostics, we already have a significant amount of manufacturers committed to joining us in that center when we open it and working together on some new both treatments and diagnostics for cancer and other areas.

So first of all, on brand, what we're seeing there is we're expecting the overall inflation rate to just be similar for the last couple of years. So we're not seeing any real changes there. And as Jason mentioned, the reason you said getting less dollars is because more of the suppliers that were contingent to inflation have moved to noncontingent, and we've renegotiated a couple of those DSAs over the last year so that we will no longer be contingent to inflation.
As far as overall rates go, I would say, we continue to feel very good about our overall value proposition. We have very strong relationships with manufacturers. And as you know, when -- any time there's changes in their portfolios, sometimes that means they should get a lower price when they have higher cost drugs coming out and sometimes they need to pay more fees when they lose, say, a high-priced item to a patent expiration. And so those types of moving parts in terms of volume and average line extension are taken into account with each negotiation, and the team has done an excellent job working with our manufacturing partners and continue to have what I consider to be a fair market rate for that and feel very good about that, being able to be something that we can continue going forward.
As far as the Red Oak, we won't be able to get into any specifics there. But as you can imagine, it's been an excellent 7-year relationship. The team there continues to remain intact. They have decades of generic buying experience. The leadership there and the team has just a great group of individuals, again, with experience that continues to bring new ideas together to the market to be able to help us continue to get the best cost in the marketplace. And we continue to partner well with CVS at Board meetings, et cetera, to continue to drive that.

This reserve adjustment wa",500,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will start my comments today by acknowledging that our fourth quarter results were below our expectation and yours primarily due to an inventory reserve adjustment of $197 million. This reserve adjustment was driven by changing market conditions related to COVID-19 on certain highly commoditized PPE products.
To meet our customer commitments during the pandemic, we carried higher levels of inventory in certain PPE categories during a period of significantly increased demand, higher prices and longer-than-normal supply chains. Our analysis at the quarter end of both the anticipated customer demand and projected future sale prices for these products resulted in a sizable inventory reserve that affected a subset of our medical products inventory.
In addition, there were a few other unexpected items that affected our results, which Jason will cover in his remarks. Throughout the past year, we have been taking action to drive performance, and we will continue to move forward with urgency. For example, we divested the Cordis business, extended our Red Oak Sourcing Agreement with CVS Health, identified $250 million of additional cost savings opportunities, restructured parts of our organization to increase accountability and made important leadership changes. We are continually reviewing our business and seeking areas to improve.
With the actions we've taken to date and our plans for FY '22, we feel confident in our strategy, and are encouraged by the tailwinds behind our growth areas and strong cash flow generation.
In FY '21, we grew revenue 6% versus the prior year and despite an estimated $200 million year-over-year operating earnings headwind related to COVID-19, we grew EPS. We continued to aggressively streamline our cost structure and surpassed our enterprise cost savings target for the third consecutive year. We generated strong operating cash flow, prioritized returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and took actions to further strengthen our balance sheet.
As I reflect on the unprecedented events of the past year, our team has prioritized our customers, maintained continuous operations, partnered with governmental agencies to support vaccine administration and protect patients and further improved the resiliency of our supply chain.
Before turning it over to Jason, I want to highlight last week's announcement that we have negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement and settlement process designed to achieve broad resolution of governmental opioid claims. If all conditions are satisfied, this agreement would result in the settlement of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities. And depending on the level of state and subdivision participation, we would pay up to $6.4 billion over 18 years. This is an important step forward for our company. As we've consistently said, we remain committed to being part of the solution for the U.S. opioid epidemic and believe this settlement would be a prudent way to provide necessary leads to our communities and certainty for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jason to further discuss our results and FY '22 guidance."

In the fourth quarter, we delivered EPS of $0.77, which, as Mike mentioned, included a $197 million inventory reserve on certain PPE in the Medical segment.Turning to the Pharma segment on Slide 6. Fourth quarte",1841,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we delivered EPS of $0.77, which, as Mike mentioned, included a $197 million inventory reserve on certain PPE in the Medical segment.
Turning to the Pharma segment on Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue increased 15% to $38 billion driven primarily by sales growth from large Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 included reduced pharmaceutical demand related to COVID-19, which, to a lesser extent, contributed to the growth in the quarter.
Pharma segment profit was flat in the fourth quarter at $358 million. This reflects COVID-19-related volume recovery in our Nuclear business, offset by Pharmaceutical Distribution customer contract renewals. This impact from renewals was in line with our expectations and generally consistent with prior quarters. However, there were some other items, including inventory adjustments and opioid-related legal costs that were higher than previously assumed.
As we've mentioned, we continue to prioritize investing for growth and optimizing our core operations. In the fourth quarter, the deployment of some of these technology enhancements resulted in incremental costs for implementation and depreciation, which we also expect the next several quarters as we continue to deploy new capabilities.
I will further discuss our investments as we look to fiscal year '22.
As we highlighted last quarter, we continued to experience softer volumes in certain therapeutic classes within our generics program. Our generics program continued to see generally consistent market dynamics. With respect to other product types, including brand, specialty and consumer health, we largely saw volumes at or above pre-pandemic levels during the fourth quarter.
In Medical, depicted on Slide 7, revenue increased 23% to $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter. This revenue increase was driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution primarily due to a recovery in elective procedure volumes and a positive PPE pricing impact. Medical segment loss of $63 million in the fourth quarter was due to an adverse impact from COVID-19 primarily due to the previously mentioned inventory reserve, partially offset by a recovery in elective procedure volumes. Additionally, benefits from cost savings initiatives were offset by elevated supply chain costs.
During the quarter, we were encouraged to see elective procedure volumes effectively return to near pre-COVID-19 levels. While our team continued to execute on our cost savings and efficiency initiatives within our global manufacturing and supply chain, we did experience elevated supply chain costs, particularly in the areas of freight, labor and commodities. We are taking actions to help mitigate these impacts. But as we look forward, we do expect some of these higher costs to continue into next year.
Now I'll transition to full year results, beginning with the enterprise. Total company revenue increased 6% to $162 billion with strong top line growth in both segments. Consolidated gross margin decreased 2% to $6.8 billion. Despite sales growth, SG&A decreased 1%, reflecting the benefits of our enterprise-wide cost savings measures. Operating earnings decreased 5%, reflecting a headwind of approximately $200 million year-over-year related to COVID-19, which was split fairly evenly between the segments. Excluding COVID-19, operating earnings would have grown in the low single digits in fiscal '21.
Moving below the line, interest and other decreased 44% to $133 million driven by multiple items, including lower interest expense from debt reduction actions and increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan and onetime investment gains. As a reminder, deferred compensation gains or losses reported in interest and other are fully offset in corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line.
Our annual effective tax rate finished at 22.8%, benefiting from discrete items. We finished the year with EPS of $5.57, reflecting growth of 2% despite the net COVID-19 headwind.
Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to operate with high net working capital efficiency, generating robust operating cash flow of $2.4 billion for the full year. We finished the year with a strong cash position of $3.4 billion, with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. 
We continue to deploy capital according to our priorities, investing $400 million back into the business in CapEx to drive organic growth; strengthening our balance sheet to approximately $550 million in debt paydown, which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter; and returning nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
As for the segment's full year results, beginning with Pharma on Slide 10, Pharma revenue increased 6% to $146 billion driven by sales growth from Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers. Pharma segment profit decreased 4% to $1.7 billion due to volume declines in the company's generics program, including the impact of COVID-19. This was partially offset by favorable brand sales mix. Excluding COVID-19, we estimate the Pharma segment would have grown low single digits in fiscal '21.
Turning to Medical on Slide 11. Full year Medical revenue increased 8% to $16.7 billion driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution. As we saw throughout the year, this increase was primarily due to the impact of PPE sales and higher volumes in our Lab business. Medical segment profit decreased 13% to $577 million due to an adverse impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution. This was primarily due to the fourth quarter inventory reserve on certain PPE products, partially offset by higher volumes in our Lab business. Additionally, the team delivered strong cost savings, including global manufacturing efficiencies on the year.
When adjusting for COVID-19 related impacts in Medical, we estimate the segment would have grown mid-single digits for the full year. While our fiscal '21 results fell short of our expectations, the underlying growth we saw in both segments, excluding COVID-19, gives us confidence as we move into next year and the pandemic's effects on our businesses continue to dissipate.
Turning to our guidance for fiscal '22 on Slide 13. We expect earnings per share in the range of $5.60 to $5.90. This reflects incremental technology investments of approximately $120 million to drive growth and efficiencies across the enterprise, the Cordis divestiture and other assumptions that we will detail momentarily. We expect interest and other in the range of $150 million to $180 million. We anticipate continued reduction in interest expense with the increase over the prior year primarily a result of the fiscal '21 capability in deferred compensation not expected to repeat.
We are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 287 million to 292 million, and CapEx of $400 million to $450 million.
Transitioning to the segments, beginning with Pharma on Slide 14. We expect high single-digit revenue growth driven by growth from large customers and continued COVID-19 recovery and mid-single digit segment profit growth. We anticipate COVID-19 will be an overall tailwind of approximately $100 million to Pharma segment profit compared to the prior year. While we will likely continue to see some choppiness, we expect volume recovery in certain generic therapeutic classes by the end of the calendar year. As mentioned, we are investing in technology enhancements to drive growth and efficiencies, which we expect will lead to an $80 million segment profit headwind in fiscal '22, including the annualization of the investments made in the fourth quarter.
Adjusting for the COVID-19 related impacts and the incremental technology investments, we see Pharma normalized growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. We believe normalizing for these impacts provides a better approximation for the long-range growth trajectory of the business.
As for other assumptions, we continue to expect consistent market dynamics in our generics program. We expect increased contributions from our growth areas, Specialty, including biosimilars; Nuclear and Outcomes. We anticipate a similar contingent brand inflation rate as in fiscal '21 with continued less dollar contribution each year. And we expect opioid-related legal costs of approximately $125 million, an increase of $10 million versus fiscal '21.
For Medical on Slide 15, we expect revenue to be approximately flat in fiscal '22 primarily due to the prior year COVID-19 comparison with low double-digit segment profit growth. With respect to COVID-19, we expect an approximate $100 million year-over-year tailwind to Medical segment profit. We are assuming elective procedures to remain at or near pre-COVID levels for the duration of the year. We expect moderate headwinds in fiscal '22 related to timing of selling higher cost PPE products and lower lab testing utilization versus the prior year. And we anticipate a year-over-year comparison benefit related to the PPE inventory reserve.
Outside of COVID-19, we expect an approximate $80 million impact to segment profit due to the Cordis divestiture. Note, the anticipated reported impact for fiscal '22 is higher than previously communicated primarily due to exchange rate favorability and other operating improvements within the business in the prior year. Additionally, we expect to invest an incremental $20 million in technology enhancements in our at-Home business to drive growth and efficiencies. Adjusting for these items, we see normalized Medical segment profit growth of mid- to high single digits in fiscal '22.
Finally, as seen in the fourth quarter, we expect elevated supply chain cost to persist, particularly in the first half of the year. We anticipate these elevated costs will be partially offset by the continued benefits from our global manufacturing and supply chain transformation, which will ramp up throughout the year.
Now a few additional comments on the expected cadence next year. We expect profit growth to be significantly back-half weighted in both segments. In Pharma, this is primarily driven by the timing of the previously mentioned incremental technology investments being more weighted towards the front half as well as stronger expected second half performance in our generics program, including the impact of COVID-19.
In Medical, in addition to the elevated supply chain costs, we also anticipate the total unfavorable fiscal '22 COVID-19 impact of approximately $50 million to occur primarily in the first half of the year. As a reminder, we also experienced favorable COVID-19 impact in the first half of fiscal '21, which was of a similar magnitude.
Across the organization, we continue to place a high priority on cash flow generation as well as allocating capital in a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly manner. Our strong cash flow and improving capital position will enable our capital allocation priorities, support our company's obligations and provide increased flexibility and the ability to be more opportunistic in our capital deployment.
Along those lines, we anticipate deploying the Cordis proceeds through a combination of share repurchases and debt paydown, which is expected to offset the earnings dilution on a pro forma basis. We expect share repurchases in the range of $500 million to $1 billion in fiscal '22. In addition, we expect total debt paydown of approximately $850 million, reflecting the completion of the remaining June 2022 debt tower at or before maturity.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Mike."

To be clear, we are disappointed with this finish to the year and are moving forward for the sense of urgency to improve our operations and execute our strategy. We're prioritizing investments in our strategic growth areas and expect these businesses to collectively realize double digit growth in FY '22. And across our business, we're enhancing our IT infrastructure in key areas to increase capabilities in digitization, improve the customer experience and drive productivity. While we expect to benefit from these investments this fiscal year, the majority of these benefits will materialize in FY '23 and beyond.
In Pharma, we're investing an additional $80 million in technology infrastructure to create additional operational efficiencies, improve data insights and drive cost synergies to enhance our ability to grow and generate better outcomes for our customers.
Our generics program remains a critical priority. This week, we extended our Red Oak agreement with CVS Health for an additional 5 years, which takes the term of our generic sourcing joint venture through June 30, 2029. This ensures that we can continue to deliver best-in-class sourcing capabilities for our customers well into the future. We are also investing in data and analytics, including our pricing capabilities as we continue to focus on managing all components of our generics program and expect market dynamics consistent with the last few years.
We remain committed to supporting the retail pharmacy community. At our recent Annual Retail Business Conference, we connected virtually with over 4,000 retail independent pharmacy customers and launched 2 new digital offerings, NavixRx and E-Commerce Storefront, to help independent pharmacies expand their services and improve health care outcomes.
In Specialty, we're investing in our Sonexus patient hub where our technology solutions help biopharma customers remove barriers to patient care. In our third-party logistics business, we're expanding our cold chain storage space to accommodate the growing number of temperature-sensitive products, including cell and gene therapies.
In Nuclear, we received FDA approval to use our radioactive diagnostic agent LYMPHOSEEK in pediatric patients 1 month and older. We continue to build out our multimillion dollar center for Theranostics Advancement in Indianapolis and are also investing to expand our PET capabilities. We expect double-digit profit growth in Nuclear over the next several years. And in outcomes, we also expect double-digit profit growth as we expand our direct-to-patient digital footprint and implement new patient adherence programs.
Turning to Medical. We have been taking quick decisive actions throughout the fiscal year to streamline and simplify our Medical business, and this work remains a top priority heading into FY '22. We've recently restructured our organization to establish clear lines of ownership and accountability and made some management changes, including appointing a single leader to manage U.S. medical products and distribution as well as a single leader to manage international.
With the divestiture of Cordis, we plan to significantly reduce our international commercial footprint and have initially identified 36 markets we intend to exit so we can focus on the locations where we have a competitive advantage and can generate sustained long-term growth.
We're laser-focused on enhancing supply chain resiliency, improving business continuity and investing in advanced planning capabilities to drive forward-looking insights to better serve our customers and their patients.
In addition, our Medical Services businesses, OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark, continue to enable clinically integrated and digitally automated supply chains. Our at-Home business continues to focus on enabling and supporting comfortable home-based care for patients with acute and chronic conditions. We continue to see volume growth as care is rapidly shifting to the home. For FY '22, we're investing an additional $20 million in technology infrastructure to create operational efficiencies and better data visibility.
With respect to the Enterprise, we're aggressively reviewing our cost structure to continue streamlining our operations and processes and intend to reinvest a portion of these savings to fuel future growth. In FY '22, we plan to launch initiatives that will deliver at least an additional $250 million savings by FY '23.
As Jason discussed earlier, we take a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly approach to capital deployment with a focus on investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders.
In closing, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and contributions that make it possible for Cardinal Health to fulfill its mission of improving the lives of people every day. 
And now Jason and I will take your questions."

When you think about that, think about your cash position as you sit now and the free cash that you're going to generate this year, even with the investments that you're making, do you think there's an opportunity to be a bit more aggressive either on the buyback given where your stock sits in the market on M&A, given that you talked about a number of growth priorities, of which I assume with some bolt-on transactions.

And first of all, yes, I think we had some really great cash flow this last year. So $2.4 billion of operating cash flow and that resulted in a $3.4 billion ending cash balance, which does include the $500 million debt paydown that we completed in the fourth quarter. So as you indicated perfectly, we are stepping into this year with a lot of flexibility even before the Cordis transaction closed, which was just a few days ago, which does add another $1 billion to that balance. 
As we highlighted in some of those comments this morning, we do expect to paydown the $850 million that's coming due by the end of the fiscal year or before end of the fiscal year. So that will be some of those uses. And then, of course, we guided towards the $500 million to $1 billion for the share repurchases, which is a fairly wide range and reflective of some of the flexibility that we talked about.
And as I think about the Cordis proceeds, of course, cash is somewhat fungible. But essentially, that $1 billion, how we're thinking about it is accelerating some of that debt paydown and a portion of that, $500 million to $1 billion. So we feel real good about that as we entered into the first quarter here. You referenced the tax receivable. And I don't think we provided any updated comments on that so far. Last quarter, I had referenced that we expected by the end of the calendar year. That's still our expectation, like, I think, a lot of different organizations throughout the world right now. I think COVID has impacted some of the processes and a little bit less certainty as to the precise timing. But we still feel pretty good that it's the best -- good approximate time frame. But when you think about receiving those proceeds perhaps late in the calendar year, there will be less time to actually deploy those in the balance of this year. So that's certainly still a potential opportunity to get us maybe to some of the higher ends of that range. But nonetheless, there's a lot of flexibility that goes along with that.
As you indicated, when we talk about the opportunistic uses, essentially, we have increased flexibility here. M&A is always on that list. And it depends on the opportunity, the valuation and what we see is delivering to us strategically. And so that will be another thing that we evaluate along the year."

And -- but the key thing on a pro forma basis is that extra $1 billion will be deployed in some manner and we will see, and certainly, within fiscal '23 run rate, there will not be dilution expected for that divestiture.
As it relates to another question, somewhat as it relates to credit issues, there's nothing there. I mean we're on a guidance -- a glide path to getting to our targeted leverage ratio. A key part that I referenced last quarter is that this remaining debt that's coming due at the end of this fiscal year is a key part of getting us towards those targets. And I indicated last quarter that I would anticipate the level of debt paydown to begin to diminish after this fiscal year. That continues to be our expectation. There's a lot of factors, as Mike just referenced, that could play into that. But overall, that remains our viewpoint, and there's nothing here that is, I'll say, overly constrictive from that point, just a little bit of prudence until we get some of these risks and uncertainties defined. And we also need to see underlying performance and cash flow over the course of the year.

And we were, first and foremost, going to put our customer commitments in front of us, and that resulted in a higher level of inventory that we carried over that period of time. And that happened while there was obviously increasing demand, higher prices and lower -- longer than normal types of supply chains. And then we step back -- every quarter, we step back and do our analysis and determine what the net realizable value that is and then make any adjustments that may be necessary. 
So as Mike highlighted, there were some highly commoditized products. So -- it's a subset of our PPE that -- think of it as those products that would have more volatile type of pricing. We saw that move more dramatically over the period. And given it was a subset of our inventory, it was relatively defined. It was a relatively large percentage reduction within that, but it was contained to a certain subset.
And again, we're not going to get into all the details product-by-product, but it was that type of product that has a little bit less of the value add and then therefore, has -- a little bit easier to get more supply into the market and that drove the prices down quicker than other products.

And then your question regarding investments, those investments are a mixture of -- we've spent quite heavily over the last couple of several years on the capital side of getting these IT systems in place. We are finalizing that multiyear journey now and are starting to depreciate those assets. So there will be elevated depreciation that, of course, is more fixed in nature. But there's also a component of the final testing, and rollout launch of these systems tend to be more expense versus capital. And so as we're right in that rollout stage, that expense will be elevated and that part, we would expect to reduce longer term, certainly beyond fiscal '22.

What we're referring to here is we're still seeing, again, ramping up, but we're still seeing some less than pre-COVID volumes on areas like anti-infectives, antibacterials, antibiotics, antivirals and some pain medications that we've not seen. Our thoughts are as life continues to get more and more back to normal, if that's the right word, kids are back in school, et cetera, we would start to see those drugs being needed more than they probably have historically been needed. So again, expect them to be back to pre-COVID levels by the end of the year, but that's really what we're talking about. Very similar to the exact same thing we talked about last quarter, and it's kind of continuing to play out as we mentioned back then."

And Cordis being more international, obviously, it had more FX potential fluctuation, but don't see Cordis being a factor there. As far as the elevated supply chain cost, what we started seeing in the fourth quarter is, I think, which you're hearing a lot of companies talking about, we're seeing increased fuel costs, we're starting to see the cost of, for instance, containers could be 3 to 10x what they cost to ship in prior to COVID just due to ports being plugged, things like that.
So we're just -- wages, et cetera. So it's just those types of things that we're seeing general elevated supply chain across the board. Again, we saw that in Q4. We expect that to continue in for the first couple of quarters. And then as things get back to more normal, we'll be able to see some either reductions in those or we'll be able to take some of those costs and where possible that appropriately pass it through to customers if it's a more permanent type of thing.

We do expect continued double-digit growth from Nuclear and Specialty and our Outcomes businesses. We see all of them next year being able to grow top and bottom lines by double digits. And we continue to see those businesses continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of the overall Pharma segment.
So as they continue to grow at those rates and are a bigger portion of the segment, obviously, they're going to continue to have more and more impact. We feel really good about the pipeline of products in Nuclear. And with the work we're doing in our center for advancement of Theranostics, we already have a significant amount of manufacturers committed to joining us in that center when we open it and working together on some new both treatments and diagnostics for cancer and other areas. So we feel good about all of those businesses.

So first of all, on brand, what we're seeing there is we're expecting the overall inflation rate to just be similar for the last couple of years. So we're not seeing any real changes there. And as Jason mentioned, the reason you said getting less dollars is because more of the suppliers that were contingent to inflation have moved to noncontingent, and we've renegotiated a couple of those DSAs over the last year so that we will no longer be contingent to inflation.
As far as overall rates go, I would say, we continue to feel very good about our overall value proposition. We have very strong relationships with manufacturers. And as you know, when -- any time there's changes in their portfolios, sometimes that means they should get a lower price when they have higher cost drugs coming out and sometimes they need to pay more fees when they lose, say, a high-priced item to a patent expiration. And so those types of moving parts in terms of volume and average line extension are taken into account with each negotiation, and the team has done an excellent job working with our manufacturing partners and continue to have what I consider to be a fair market rate for that and feel very good about that, being able to be something that we can continue going forward.
As far as the Red Oak, we won't be able to get into any specifics there. But as you can imagine, it's been an excellent 7-year relationship. The team there continues to remain intact. They have decades of generic buying experience. The leadership there and the team has just a great group of individuals, again, with experience that continues to bring new ideas together to the market to be able to help us continue to get the best cost in the marketplace. And we continue to partner well with CVS at Board meetings, et cetera, to continue to drive that.

Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations. As we continue to manage through the global pandemic, we're staying focused on the near-term priorities and long-term strategies to drive growth and momentum across our businesses. In pharma, we continue to see sequential volume improvement and are encouraged by the profit growth that we saw in the first quarter. We believe our pharma business inclusive of our strategic growth areas of specialty, nuclear and outcomes, is well positioned for growth in FY '22 and beyond. 
Our Medical segment continues to be impacted by the disruptions in the global supply chain that we called out last quarter. Recently, these pressures have rapidly escalated, and we are experiencing significantly elevated product costs due to international freight and commodities. While we believe the majority of these elevated supply chain costs are temporary, we do not expect them to return to normalized levels this fiscal year. As a result, we are lowering our FY '22 outlook for Medical segment profit to adjust for these increased headwinds. We are taking action to mitigate these impacts across the enterprise, and we are reaffirming our FY '22 EPS guidance of $5.60 to $5.90 per share. 
We have been on a journey to simplify our portfolio and strengthen our core businesses, so we are positioned for broad-based sustainable growth as noted in the long-term targets we're announcing today. We are prioritizing investment in our strategic growth areas and in innovative solutions to meet our customers' needs today and tomorrow. And with our improved balance sheet, commitment to our dividend and now an additional $3 billion share repurchase authorization, we're positioned to return capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our strategy. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jason to discuss our results."

I will review our first quarter results and updated expectations for fiscal '22 before closing with some comments on capital deployment. Beginning with total company results, first quarter revenue increased 13% to",1186,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I will review our first quarter results and updated expectations for fiscal '22 before closing with some comments on capital deployment. Beginning with total company results, first quarter revenue increased 13% to $44 billion, driven by sales growth from existing customers. Total gross margin decreased 4% to $1.6 billion driven by the Cordis divestiture and the net impact of elevated supply chain costs in Medical. As a reminder, the sale of Cordis was completed on August 2 and impacted the quarter's results by approximately 2 months. 
SG&A increased 1%, reflecting information technology investments and higher costs to support sales growth, partially offset by the Cordis divestiture and benefits from cost savings initiatives. Overall, first quarter operating earnings tracked in line with our expectations, down 15%. 
Moving below the line, interest and other decreased by $2 million, driven primarily by lower interest expense from continued debt reduction actions. During the first quarter, we exercised a make-whole call provision to redeem $572 million of outstanding June 2022 debt maturities. We continue to expect to repay the approximately $280 million of remaining June 2022 notes upon maturity. 
Our first quarter effective tax rate was approximately 24%. Average diluted shares outstanding were 289 million, about 4 million shares fewer than the prior year. This reflects prior year share repurchases as well as the $500 million share repurchase program initiated in the first quarter and recently completed. The net result for the quarter was EPS of $1.29. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $2.5 billion and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. This cash balance also reflects our first annual settlement payment into escrow under the proposed opioid settlement agreement. 
Now turning to the segments, beginning with Pharma on Slide 5. Revenue increased 13% to $40 billion, driven primarily by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from large pharmaceutical distribution and specialty customers. Segment profit grew 1% to $406 million, which reflects an improvement in volumes compared to the prior year quarter, which was adversely impacted by COVID-19. This was largely offset by investments in information technology enhancements. 
As a reminder, last quarter, we began deploying new technology platforms across our pharmaceutical distribution business as a part of a multiyear journey to enhance our IT infrastructure. This rollout is tracking according to plan, and we continue to expect incremental implementation and depreciation costs through the first 3 quarters of fiscal '22. As Mike mentioned, during the quarter, we saw broad-based sequential improvement in pharmaceutical demand, including generics. We continue to expect the recovery generic volumes to pre-COVID levels by the end of the calendar year. 
Outside of volumes, our generics program continued to experience generally consistent market dynamics along with strong performance from Red O. And during the quarter, pharma saw double-digit contributions from our growth businesses: specialty, nuclear and outcomes. 
Transitioning to the Medical segment on Slide 6. Medical revenue increased 5% to $4.1 billion, driven primarily by PPE sales, partially offset by the Cordis divestiture. Segment profit decreased 46% to $123 million, primarily due to elevated supply chain costs. To a lesser extent, this also reflects the impact of the Cordis divestiture, as well as net favorability in the prior year attributed to COVID-19. As Mike mentioned, Medical segment profit was negatively impacted by increased product costs due to significant inflationary pressures in our global supply chain, particularly in the areas of commodities and international freight. 
In commodities, we have seen spikes in some key resins such as polypropylene that are inputs into our self-manufactured and sourced products, with recent index prices nearly double where they were last year. And with international freight, we are seeing ocean container costs at roughly 8 to 10x pre-COVID levels. We believe the majority of these headwinds are temporary but we do not expect them to abate this fiscal year. We are taking action, including through pricing and aggressive cost management. I will discuss these impacts to our full year medical outlook shortly. 
To wrap up the quarter, despite some impact from the Delta variant on elective procedure volumes, overall, our customers continue to manage effectively and total elective volumes exited the quarter near 95% of pre-COVID levels. Additionally, lab testing volumes remain significantly elevated above pre-COVID levels but was not a material driver to the quarter due to the strong performance in the prior year. 
Next, on Slide 8, a few updates to our fiscal '22 outlook. We are reiterating our EPS guidance range of $5.60 to $5.90 per share. This reflects updated expectations for the Medical segment as well as lower ranges for our tax rate and share count. We now expect our annual effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. We also now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 280 million to 282 million. 
As for the segment outlooks on Slide 9, first, we are adjusting our pharma revenue outlook to low double-digit growth to reflect the strong branded pharmaceutical sales growth that we are seeing from large customers. For Medical, we now expect fiscal '22 segment profit to be down mid-single to low double digits. This change is driven by the significant increases in supply chain cost inflation that I previously discussed, which is expected to result in an incremental net headwind of approximately $100 million to $125 million on the year. Given the anticipated timing of realizing these cost increases and our mitigating actions, as well as the timing of selling higher-cost PPE, we expect a sequential decline in Medical segment profit in the second quarter. 
Stepping back, the only large operational item that we see meaningfully different today compared to our original fiscal '22 guidance is the incremental impact of elevated supply chain costs in Medical. Notably, we do not anticipate any material net impact in pharma from inflationary supply chain costs. And as noted last quarter, we still expect the cadence of our EPS guidance to be significantly back-half weighted. 
Now to close, an update on capital deployment. We are focused on deploying capital in a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly manner, and we'll continue to allocate capital through the lens of our priorities, which are unchanged. We have been on a journey to improve our balance sheet and our portfolio and have made tremendous progress. As we look forward, we see our debt paydown beginning to moderate, which will provide an increased ability to be more opportunistic with our return of capital to shareholders. 
On that note, 2 important updates. Our Board recently approved a new 3-year authorization to repurchase up to an additional $3 billion of our common stock, expiring at the end of calendar year 2024. And we now expect approximately $1 billion of share repurchases in fiscal '22, which includes the $500 million of share repurchases executed to date. We believe that capital deployment, along with the future growth that we expect in both our segments, will be a key driver to the double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield that we are targeting over the long term. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Mike."

Throughout the pandemic, we have responded to challenges with resilience and agility, approaching every situation with a focus of delivering for our customers so they can care for their patients. We are continually reviewing our business an",1349,"Thanks, Jason. Throughout the pandemic, we have responded to challenges with resilience and agility, approaching every situation with a focus of delivering for our customers so they can care for their patients. We are continually reviewing our business and seeking areas to improve as we navigate the dynamic macroeconomic environment. We're taking action to mitigate elevated costs and manage through temporary supply chain disruptions in medical. These actions include pricing adjustments, cutting additional costs throughout the organization and accelerating additional growth opportunities. 
Outside of a continual focus on the customer, we are directing our efforts to 3 main areas that will support our long-term target of mid-single to high single-digit growth for the Medical segment. First, we are simplifying our operating model. We continue to take decisive action to reposition the business for growth. We divested the Cordis business and have begun significantly reducing our international commercial footprint. We have announced and are in the process of exiting 36 initial markets, which will allow us to focus on the markets where we have a competitive advantage. Additionally, we are further streamlining our medical manufacturing footprint and modernizing our distribution facilities. We expect these simplification initiatives to contribute to our $750 million enterprise cost savings target and position us to generate sustained long-term growth. 
Second, we are focused on driving mix through commercial excellence. Our Cardinal brand portfolio has significant breadth with leading brands and clinically differentiated products such as Kendall compression, Kangaroo enteral feeding and Protectis Surgical Gloss, among others. 
While we have made important changes to align our commercial organization structure and incentives, we recognize that we are underpenetrated in Cardinal Health brand mix relative to our potential. An increase in private-label penetration across our U.S. and in channel customer base represents a significant profit opportunity with even further opportunities out of channel and internationally. As we move past the pandemic, we see this as a significant opportunity to both deliver savings for our customers and grow our business over the mid to long term. 
And third, we're fueling our medical Safeway mark. These growth businesses 
third, we're fueling our Medical segment growth businesses, at-Home solutions and Medical Services, which includes OptiFreight logistics and waveMark. These growth businesses are aligned with industry trends and position to capture market share and grow double digits in FY '22 and beyond. We continue to invest in technology enhancements and innovative solutions that give our businesses a competitive edge. 
In OptiFreight, we continue to expand our customer base and offerings. And in At Home Solutions, which is now a $2.2 billion business, we continue to see volume growth as care is rapidly shifting to the home. We are investing in new technologies to drive operational efficiencies and enhance data visibility. 
Moving to Pharma. We have 2 primary objectives to achieve our long-term guidance of low to mid-single-digit segment growth, continuing to strengthen our core pharma distribution business and fueling our growth businesses, specialty, nuclear and outcomes. We will continue to strengthen our core business by focusing in 3 primary areas. 
First, supporting our diverse customer base. Over 50 years, we've honed our distribution expertise and developed a strong customer base across multiple classes of trade with leaders in chain pharmacy, direct mail order, grocery and retail independent customers, all of whom play critical roles in providing health care access to their local communities. Along those lines, during the quarter, we extended our distribution agreement with CVS Health through FY '27. 
Second, we're managing our generics program to ensure consistent dynamics, which we continue to see and expect. Our generics program is anchored by the scale and expertise of Red Oak Sourcing, a partnership we also recently extended through FY '29. 
Third, we've been investing heavily in our technology to enhance customer experience and drive efficiencies. We are approaching the end of a multiyear investment journey to modernize our IT infrastructure, which will yield meaningful working capital improvements and operational efficiencies. 
As for our second overall pharma objective, fueling our growth businesses, we continue to expect these 3 businesses to realize double-digit growth over the next several years. And as these businesses grow, it will become a bigger portion of the overall pharma segment. 
In specialty, key downstream and upstream initiatives will enable our growth. In oncology, we are competing differently downstream by transforming from a distribution-led orientation to a focus on supporting independent oncology practices with solutions to thrive in a value-based care environment. 
We are seeing commercial momentum with the Vista TS our technology platform that helps oncology practices improve their performance in value-based care. We have a strong presence in other therapeutic areas, such as rheumatology, which today is a $4 billion distribution market growing double digits. 
We are also encouraged by the anticipated growth in biosimilars as more products come to market such as the FDA's approval for the first interchangeable biosimilar insulin product. We're well positioned to support the next phase of biosimilar growth as adoption increases in areas outside of oncology. 
Upstream, we are expecting strong growth from higher-margin services supporting biopharma manufacturers. We operate a leading 3PL supporting hundreds of manufacturers that continues to see wins and support new products coming to market, such as in the area of cell and gene therapy. In nuclear, we are expecting continued double-digit profit growth resulting in a doubling of our profits in this business by FY '26. 
We continue to build out our multimillion-dollar center for Theranostics advancement in Indianapolis and are investing to expand our tech capabilities. We're partnering with several companies to grow the pipeline of novel Theranostics. 
For example, through our agreement with Terra Power, we will produce and distribute Actinium 225, a radionuclide involved in creating targeted therapies for several cancer types. And in outcomes, we continue to see and expect strong growth. This business has added new payers and PBMs and is expanding clinical solutions for both independent pharmacies and retail chains to include solutions for medical billing, point-of-care testing and other clinical capabilities. 
With respect to the enterprise, we continue to aggressively review our cost structure as we work to streamline, simplify and strengthen our operations and execute our digital transformation. As I mentioned earlier, we recently increased our total cost reduction goal to $750 million by FY '23, and we are on track to deliver those savings. 
We're pairing cost reduction efforts with balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly capital allocation with a focus on investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. Long term, we're targeting a double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield. These expectations are driven by our growth targets for our segments, our commitment to our dividend and our new $3 billion share repurchase authorization. 
Now let me provide an update on the proposed opioid settlement agreement and settlement process. In September, we announced that enough states agreed to settle to proceed to the next phase. And each participating state is offering its political subdivisions the opportunity to participate in the settlement for an additional 120-day period, which ends on January 2, 2022. At that point, each of the distributors and the states will have the opportunity to determine whether there is a sufficient participation to proceed with the agreement. If all conditions are satisfied, this agreement would result in the settlement of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by the state and local governmental entities. This is an important step forward for our company. As we've consistently said, we remain committed to being part of the solution to the U.S. opioid epidemic and believe that settlement would provide relief for our communities and certainty for our shareholders. 
Turning to ESG. These priorities remain critical to achieving a healthier, more sustainable world. We recently announced goals to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 and increase minority representation in our global workforce by 2030. 
In closing, what we do matters, and it is our privilege to serve our customers, their patients and their communities around the world. 
And now Jason and I will take your questions."

Tough questions to answer because these aren't things we have historically given, obviously, I can say this. We believe there is plenty of room to grow. Some of our accounts were significantly penetrated in and others, obviously, were less penetrated in. So we do have good targets by account that we are going after. 
So we think there's plenty of opportunity there. It's one of the key reasons we believe in our long-term guidance for medical is the fact that we can do that. 
As far as margin rates go, generally, they are much more higher as a percentage and dollars than national brand. There are times in certain preferred brand programs, which is why we have them, that we do prefer national brand. But in general, as a rule of thumb, our margin rates are much more significant on our Cardinal-sourced or cargo-manufactured products. 
And then lastly, around Cordis, we're always looking at our entire portfolio of businesses to make sure we have the right type of businesses where we are positioned to win. There's nothing that sticks out to me in terms of a certain product category or that. But we are, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are exiting 36 countries. So not only do we look at products, but we look at products by country and countries and where we don't believe we have significant growth opportunity, where there might be too much risk versus benefit, et cetera. We have made real conscious decisions to aggressively manage the number of countries in, which is why we are exiting 36 countries to help simplify the model"

I guess first is when we're starting the jump-off point for these or for the earnings and earnings growth, are you starting from fiscal '22?

And then secondly, within that, can you just remind us again sort of what the -- obviously, the earnings this year are back half way. Just remind us what the tailwinds that we should be considering as we build out our model for the remainder of this fiscal year?

Your question is certainly fair as it relates to trying to define the baseline for those longer-term targets. As we indicated in the remarks today, we do anticipate this additional $100 million to $125 million related to the inflationary environment as temporary. It's difficult certainly to define exactly if that's short term, medium term or longer term. And at the current moment, we would expect those to revert back to some normalized level in a time frame that is relatively short to medium term. 
And so when we talk about these longer-term targets, we are not presuming that type of tailwind, right? So it is in a more normalized state when we provide those targets. You referenced 5 years. So I'd say 3 to 5 years is a reasonable type of time frame for average types of performance levels to get a broad perspective on the ins and the outs, but we would not expect big shocks associated with items like that, divestitures and acquisitions. Things of that nature would also be normalized out of that so that we're getting at that core type of performance. 
And then as it relates to more specifics around the elevated supply chain costs, we highlighted within our remarks that it's really just 2 key areas: the international freight and the commodities. In both cases, the reason we believe that they're temporary is that they are at multiple levels higher than what we've historically seen on international freight, which is essentially the cost of getting a shipping container shipped from overseas locations such as Asia to the United States. We're seeing that cost up 8 to 10x versus pre-COVID levels. Certainly, we would expect that to be significantly lower at some point in the future. 
And on the commodities, we're talking about a lot of different types of polymers, such as polypropylene. Those levels are more like 2x what we've seen historically. So again we would expect those to get back to a more normalized state at some point in the future. But again, those are not tailwinds to get us to these targets. Those targets are more normalized."

So that continues to be as expected. And also as expected, our investments in our technology investments, we indicated would be front-end loaded, especially with the first 3 quarters. Primarily as it relates to that fourth quarter, we started to implement those cost increases in the final implementation last Q4. So we start to get the full year effect of that as we exit the third quarter here. 
On the medical side, we did indicate a sequential decline from Q1 to Q2, and that's just related to the timing of realizing the supply chain costs I was just walking through and all the mitigating actions that go along with that. And then also recall that we cited that the COVID favorability in Q2 of last year, that is not expected to repeat. And in fact, we expect that to be a headwind this 2Q, primarily as a result of the PPE price and cost timing. So we have that Q1 to Q2 cadence. 
And then, of course, in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, we'd expect a significant COVID tailwind associated with the comparison benefit from the PPE in the prior year. And then in all of our businesses, we expect ongoing stronger contributions from our growth businesses as we see the effects of various initiatives and investments that have been put in place over the course of last year."

First of all, we, as you know, called out in our fourth quarter of last year that we did expect elevated supply chain cost. So in our guidance for this year for the Medical segment, we already assumed a certain amount of elevated supply chain cost, some of of which we had planned already to offset through cost reductions, pricing actions and those types of things. And that was originally built in. 
What we saw during the quarter, particularly as the quarter went on, was a significant increase in those supply chain costs, most notably in international freight high containers that we talked about as well as commodities. And those, we feel, will create an incremental $100 million to $125 million of cost for us. 
Roughly, I would say that $100 million to $125 million is split relatively evenly between the impact of commodities and the impact of freight cost. So they were both very, very significant. We saw other minor ones in other areas, but those were the really 2 big ones, both of which we believe are temporary because, one, as Jason said earlier, they're at all-time highs for the most part, significantly higher than where they were. And we believe that over time, the market will adjust, and those will be able to come back down. 
So what are we doing about that? That is a net number, the $100 million to $125 million, obviously, since we called that out as the adjustment to medical guidance, is that we are getting after it through pricing actions, passing some of it through. It's hard to really talk about exactly which ones you can pass through or not. The market is very complicated. There are contracts that we have to work through. We have to work with our partners, both the hospitals and the GPOs. We have to understand the supply and demand dynamics of each item in the environment. And so we are working through and understanding all of those factors, but there is some additional pricing action built into that number. And then, obviously, since we maintain guidance for the entire company, we are taking aggressive cost actions across the company. We are leveraging our improved balance sheet. And we are also focusing on our growth businesses and pushing our teams to do more faster there. So those are some, I hope, some helpful comments."

It's a greater increase in both of these areas of international freight commodities, but it's also a longer expected duration. We had anticipated that they would come back to more normal  [indiscernible] so we saw a higher spike in a longer duration. 
And in terms of just how you model it through on revenue, I'd like to just draw a little bit of distinction. With PPE, we saw many, many times higher total impact on that product cost. And so we saw a much more significant number of dollars in both cost and revenue that came through. While this is still significant, it's much less meaningful from a revenue perspective, and it's not moving that needle nearly as much."

So let me step back and hit a couple of different pieces, and I'll finish with your question on medical, but I'll take a shot here to emphasize a few others. So there's really, I would say, 3, obviously, components to our long-term target, which our long-term target we're talking about is having a double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield on average, as Jason mentioned.
In pharma, the -- to your point, we don't really see those fluctuations in commodities and costs affecting that business generally. Because if it does, it generally happens in the form of the drugs having increases, which in that model are able to be passed on and worked through the model. And so our goal of low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth in pharma is really focused on strengthening that core PD balance, getting that right mix of generics, making sure we're managing the balancing through our margin initiative growth businesses, especially nuclear outcomes, and we gave some color on those that hopefully you found helpful and exciting, for instance, nuclear doubling in the next 5 years, specialty continuing and outcomes continuing with double-digit growth. 
So we believe the combination of getting that PD business stabilized, which we're seeing and then seeing the growth there is really what's going to drive that. And then, of course, we mentioned the use of capital being able to having our debt lower, commitment to our dividend and then the share repurchases. 
On Medical, as you mentioned, it's a couple of different things. It's simplifying our operating model, focusing on driving mix and fueling our growth businesses. I won't go into those details because we did it in the comments. 
But to your question, what kind of changes can we make that help? It's really one of the things we are working on with customers right now is how do we change our contracts with our customers to give us more flexibility when there is sudden significant changes in the supply chain raise price? Our customers are being very transparent. We want to be able to make sure that if we tie those things to indexes and things, so they understand that as they come back down, we're not -- we're willing to pass lower costs back on to them. Because we don't want to look at this as a -- necessarily a chance to improve our margins. We'd like to do that through driving mix and launching more products, not on the backs of our customers during a supply chain. 
So we are working with them to create contracting methods that will allow us to be able to pass those on as well as help them understand what are the metrics we will do to be able to know for them when they changed the other direction, too."

And with the pace of the virus since then, we feel that will continue to improve. And importantly, what we saw in the quarter is we saw an improvement in our lab business that effectively offset that modest deterioration in that amount of elective procedures. So what we're seeing right now is that those 2 items tend to generally offset both good and bad, depending upon the pace of the virus. So it's nothing significant that we saw in the quarter. And as a result, we don't anticipate there being wild fluctuations going forward."

And then the rest of it would come from our dividend yield as well as capital deployment around repo to get to the double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield.

And then secondly, as we think about these sort of transitory costs in nature. You talked about $100 million to $125 million cost related to the supply chain. What's the contribution of labor cost to that headwind? Because when we think about labor costs, we think about it as potentially more structural because once you raise someone's salaries, it's difficult to bring it back down.

And -- but how you described it about the normalized level, as an example, that 100 to 125, where we indicated that we anticipate these costs remain elevated for the balance of fiscal '22. We are not taking a position at this point as to how much, if any, carries over into fiscal '23. That is a terrific example of an important element of fiscal '23 guidance that we will provide in the future. That is not, at this point, something that we feel comfortable of being able to identify. 
And then your question about labor is a great one. We did not call it out because it is very consistent with what we had last quarter. So while labor inflation and those pressures are very real for us like the whole industry, we are not seeing anything new and unique this quarter versus last quarter [ any ] additional costs for that. 
But I would also highlight that even what was included in the original guidance was not nearly as substantial as the cost that we're referencing for what was included before for commodities and international freight. Those are clearly the most significant items that drive that fluctuation. And items like labor as well as more domestic related costs such as domestic transportation and other fuel are all relatively low compared to those other 2 primary items of international freight and commodities."

Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations. As we continue to manage through the global pandemic, we're staying focused on the near-term priorities and long-term strategies to drive growth and momentum across our businesses. 
In Pharma, we continue to see sequential volume improvement and are encouraged by the profit growth that we saw in the first quarter. We believe our Pharma business, inclusive of our strategic growth areas of Specialty, Nuclear and Outcomes, is well positioned for growth in FY '22 and beyond.  
Our Medical segment continues to be impacted by the disruptions in the global supply chain that we called out last quarter. Recently, these pressures have rapidly escalated and we are experiencing significantly elevated product costs due to international freight and commodities. While we believe the majority of these elevated supply chain costs are temporary, we do not expect them to return to normalized levels this fiscal year. 
As a result, we are lowering our FY '22 outlook for Medical segment profit to adjust for these increased headwinds. We are taking action to mitigate these impacts across the enterprise, and we are reaffirming our FY '22 EPS guidance of $5.60 to $5.90 per share.  
We have been on a journey to simplify our portfolio and strengthen our core businesses, so we are positioned for broad-based sustainable growth as noted in the long-term targets we're announcing today. We are prioritizing investment in our strategic growth areas and in innovative solutions to meet our customers' needs today and tomorrow.

I will review our first quarter results and updated expectations for fiscal '22 before closing with some comments on capital deployment. Beginning with total company results. First quarter revenue increased 13%",1187,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I will review our first quarter results and updated expectations for fiscal '22 before closing with some comments on capital deployment. 
Beginning with total company results. First quarter revenue increased 13% to $44 billion, driven by sales growth from existing customers. Total gross margin decreased 4% to $1.6 billion driven by the Cordis divestiture and the net impact of elevated supply chain costs in Medical. As a reminder, the sale of Cordis was completed on August 2 and impacted the quarter's results by approximately 2 months.  
SG&A increased 1%, reflecting information technology investments and higher costs to support sales growth, partially offset by the Cordis divestiture and benefits from cost savings initiatives. 
Overall, first quarter operating earnings tracked in line with our expectations, down 15%.  
Moving below the line, interest and other decreased by $2 million, driven primarily by lower interest expense from continued debt reduction actions. During the first quarter, we exercised a make-whole call provision to redeem $572 million of outstanding June 2022 debt maturities. We continue to expect to repay the approximately $280 million of remaining June 2022 notes upon maturity.  
Our first quarter effective tax rate was approximately 24%. Average diluted shares outstanding were 289 million, about 4 million shares fewer than the prior year. This reflects prior year share repurchases as well as the $500 million share repurchase program initiated in the first quarter and recently completed. 
The net result for the quarter was EPS of $1.29. 
We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $2.5 billion and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. This cash balance also reflects our first annual settlement payment into escrow under the proposed opioid settlement agreement.  
Now turning to the segments, beginning with Pharma on Slide 5. Revenue increased 13% to $40 billion, driven primarily by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from large Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty customers. Segment profit grew 1% to $406 million, which reflects an improvement in volumes compared to the prior year quarter, which was adversely impacted by COVID-19. This was largely offset by investments in information technology enhancements.  
As a reminder, last quarter, we began deploying new technology platforms across our Pharmaceutical Distribution business as a part of a multiyear journey to enhance our IT infrastructure. This rollout is tracking according to plan, and we continue to expect incremental implementation and depreciation costs through the first 3 quarters of fiscal '22. 
As Mike mentioned, during the quarter, we saw broad-based sequential improvement in pharmaceutical demand, including generics. We continue to expect the recovery in generic volumes to pre-COVID levels by the end of the calendar year.  
Outside of volumes, our generics program continued to experience generally consistent market dynamics along with strong performance from Red Oak. And during the quarter, Pharma saw double-digit contributions from our growth businesses: Specialty, Nuclear and Outcomes.  
Transitioning to the Medical segment on Slide 6. Medical revenue increased 5% to $4.1 billion, driven primarily by PPE sales, partially offset by the Cordis divestiture. Segment profit decreased 46% to $123 million, primarily due to elevated supply chain costs. To a lesser extent, this also reflects the impact of the Cordis divestiture, as well as net favorability in the prior year attributed to COVID-19. 
As Mike mentioned, Medical segment profit was negatively impacted by increased product costs due to significant inflationary pressures in our global supply chain, particularly in the areas of commodities and international freight. In commodities, we have seen spikes in some key resins, such as polypropylene, that are inputs into our self-manufactured and sourced products with recent index prices nearly double where they were last year. And with international freight, we were seeing ocean container costs at roughly 8 to 10x pre-COVID levels. 
We believe the majority of these headwinds are temporary, but we do not expect them to abate this fiscal year. We are taking action, including through pricing and aggressive cost management. I will discuss these impacts to our full year Medical outlook shortly.  
To wrap up the quarter, despite some impact from the Delta variant on elective procedure volumes, overall, our customers continued to manage effectively and total elective volumes exited the quarter near 95% of pre-COVID levels. Additionally, lab testing volumes remained significantly elevated above pre-COVID levels, but was not a material driver to the quarter due to the strong performance in the prior year.  
Next, on Slide 8, a few updates to our fiscal '22 outlook. We are reiterating our EPS guidance range of $5.60 to $5.90 per share. This reflects updated expectations for the Medical segment as well as lower ranges for our tax rate and share count. We now expect our annual effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. We also now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 280 million to 282 million.  
As for the segment outlooks on Slide 9, first, we are adjusting our Pharma revenue outlook to low double-digit growth to reflect the strong branded pharmaceutical sales growth that we are seeing from large customers. 
For Medical, we now expect fiscal '22 segment profit to be down mid-single to low double digits. This change is driven by the significant increases in supply chain cost inflation that I previously discussed, which is expected to result in an incremental net headwind of approximately $100 million to $125 million on the year. Given the anticipated timing of realizing these cost increases and our mitigating actions, as well as the timing of selling higher-cost PPE, we expect a sequential decline in Medical segment profit in the second quarter.  
Stepping back, the only large operational item that we see meaningfully different today compared to our original fiscal '22 guidance is the incremental impact of elevated supply chain costs in Medical. Notably, we do not anticipate any material net impact in Pharma from inflationary supply chain costs. And as noted last quarter, we still expect the cadence of our EPS guidance to be significantly back half-weighted.  
Now to close, an update on capital deployment. We are focused on deploying capital in a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly manner and we'll continue to allocate capital through the lens of our priorities, which are unchanged. We have been on a journey to improve our balance sheet and our portfolio and have made tremendous progress. As we look forward, we see our debt paydown beginning to moderate, which will provide an increased ability to be more opportunistic with our return of capital to shareholders.  
On that note, 2 important updates. Our Board recently approved a new 3-year authorization to repurchase up to an additional $3 billion of our common stock, expiring at the end of calendar year 2024. And we now expect approximately $1 billion of share repurchases in fiscal '22, which includes the $500 million of share repurchases executed to date. We believe that capital deployment, along with the future growth that we expect in both our segments, will be a key driver to the double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield that we are targeting over the long term.  
With that, I'll turn it back over to Mike."
172207,1683142197,2431041,"Cardinal Health, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2021",2021-11-09,"Earnings Calls","Cardinal Health, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jason. Throughout the pandemic, we have responded to challenges with resilience and agility, approaching every situation with a focus of delivering for our customers so they can care for their patients. We are continually reviewing our business an",1336,"Thanks, Jason. Throughout the pandemic, we have responded to challenges with resilience and agility, approaching every situation with a focus of delivering for our customers so they can care for their patients. We are continually reviewing our business and seeking areas to improve as we navigate the dynamic macroeconomic environment. 
We're taking action to mitigate elevated costs and manage through temporary supply chain disruptions in Medical. These actions include pricing adjustments, cutting additional costs throughout the organization and accelerating additional growth opportunities.  
Outside of a continual focus on the customer, we are directing our efforts to the 3 main areas that will support our long-term target of mid-single to high single-digit growth for the Medical segment. First, we are simplifying our operating model. We continue to take decisive action to reposition the business for growth. We divested the Cordis business and have begun significantly reducing our international commercial footprint. We have announced and are in the process of exiting 36 initial markets, which will allow us to focus on the markets where we have a competitive advantage. Additionally, we are further streamlining our medical manufacturing footprint and modernizing our distribution facilities. 
We expect these simplification initiatives to contribute to our $750 million enterprise cost savings target and position us to generate sustained long-term growth.  
Second, we are focused on driving mix through commercial excellence. Our Cardinal brand portfolio has significant breadth with leading brands and clinically differentiated products such as Kendall compression, Kangaroo enteral feeding and Protexis surgical gloves, among others. 
While we have made important changes to align our commercial organization structure and incentives, we recognize that we are underpenetrated in Cardinal Health brand mix relative to our potential. An increase in private-label penetration across our U.S. and in-channel customer base represents a significant profit opportunity with even further opportunities out of channel and internationally. 
As we move past the pandemic, we see this as a significant opportunity to both deliver savings for our customers and grow our business over the mid to long term.  
And third, we're fueling our Medical segment growth businesses, at-Home Solutions and Medical Services, which includes OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark. These growth businesses are aligned with industry trend and positioned to capture market share and grow double digits in FY '22 and beyond. We continue to invest in technology enhancements and innovative solutions that give our businesses a competitive edge.  
In OptiFreight, we continue to expand our customer base and offerings. And in at-Home Solutions, which is now a $2.2 billion business, we continue to see volume growth as care is rapidly shifting to the home. We are investing in new technologies to drive operational efficiencies and enhance data visibility.  
Moving to Pharma. We have 2 primary objectives to achieve our long-term guidance of low to mid-single-digit segment growth: continuing to strengthen our core Pharma Distribution business; and fueling our growth businesses, Specialty, Nuclear and Outcomes. 
We will continue to strengthen our core business by focusing in 3 primary areas.  First, supporting our diverse customer base. Over 50 years, we honed our distribution expertise and develop a strong customer base across multiple classes of trade with leaders in chain pharmacy, direct mail order, grocery and retail independent customers, all of whom play critical roles in providing health care access to their local communities. Along those lines, during the quarter, we extended our distribution agreement with CVS Health through FY '27.  
Second, we're managing our generics program to ensure consistent dynamics, which we continue to see and expect. Our generics program is anchored by the scale and expertise of Red Oak Sourcing, a partnership we also recently extended through FY '29.  
Third, we've been investing heavily in our technology to enhance customer experience and drive efficiencies. We are approaching the end of a multiyear investment journey to modernize our IT infrastructure, which will yield meaningful working capital improvements and operational efficiencies.  
As for our second overall Pharma objective, fueling our growth businesses, we continue to expect these 3 businesses to realize double-digit growth over the next several years. And as these businesses grow, it will become a bigger portion of the overall Pharma segment.  
In Specialty, key downstream and upstream initiatives will enable our growth. In oncology, we are competing differently downstream by transforming from a distribution-led orientation to a focus on supporting independent oncology practices with solutions to thrive in a value-based care environment. We are seeing commercial momentum with Navista TS, our technology platform that helps oncology practices improve their performance in value-based care. 
We have a strong presence in other therapeutic areas, such as rheumatology, which today is a $4 billion distribution market growing double digits.  
We are also encouraged by the anticipated growth in biosimilars as more products come to market such as the FDA's approval for the first interchangeable biosimilar insulin product. We're well positioned to support the next phase of biosimilar growth as adoption increases in areas outside of oncology.  
Upstream, we are expecting strong growth from higher-margin services supporting biopharma manufacturers. We operate a leading 3PL supporting hundreds of manufacturers that continue to see wins and support new products coming to market, such as in the area of cell and gene therapy. 
In Nuclear, we are expecting continued double-digit profit growth resulting in a doubling of our profits in this business by FY '26. We continue to build out our multimillion dollar center for Theranostics advancement in Indianapolis and are investing to expand our tech capabilities. We're partnering with several companies to grow the pipeline of novel Theranostics.  
For example, through our agreement with TerraPower, we will produce and distribute Actinium-225, a radionuclide involved in creating targeted therapies for several cancer types. 
And in Outcomes, we continue to see and expect strong growth. This business has added new payers and PBMs and is expanding clinical solutions for both independent pharmacies and retail chains to include solutions for medical billing, point-of-care testing and other clinical capabilities.  
With respect to the enterprise, we continue to aggressively review our cost structure as we work to streamline, simplify and strengthen our operations and execute our digital transformation. As I mentioned earlier, we recently increased our total cost reduction goal to $750 million by FY '23, and we are on track to deliver those savings. We're pairing cost reduction efforts with balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly capital allocation with a focus on investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. 
Long term, we're targeting a double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield. These expectations are driven by our growth targets for our segments, our commitment to our dividend and our new $3 billion share repurchase authorization.  
Now let me provide an update on the proposed opioid settlement agreement and settlement process. In September, we announced that enough states agreed to settle to proceed to the next phase. And each participating state is offering its political subdivisions the opportunity to participate in the settlement for an additional 120-day period, which ends on January 2, 2022. At that point, each of the distributors and the states will have the opportunity to determine whether there is a sufficient participation to proceed with the agreement. 
If all conditions are satisfied, this agreement would result in the settlement of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by the state and local governmental entities. 
This is an important step forward for our company. As we've consistently said, we remain committed to being part of the solution to the U.S. opioid epidemic and believe that settlement would provide relief for our communities and certainty for our shareholders.  
Turning to ESG. These priorities remain critical to achieving a healthier, more sustainable world. We recently announced goals to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 and increased minority representation in our global workforce by 2030.
In closing, what we do matters and it is our privilege to serve our customers, their patients and their communities around the world.
And now, Jason and I will take your questions."

And then two, can you talk about the margin differential on those products?

Obviously, I can say this. We believe there is plenty of room to grow. Some of our accounts were significantly penetrated in and others obviously were less penetrated in. So we do have good targets by account that we are going after.  
So we think there's plenty of opportunity there. It's one of the key reasons we believe in our long-term guidance for Medical is the fact that we can do that. 
As far as margin rates go, generally, they are much more -- higher as a percentage and dollars than national brand. There are times in certain preferred brand programs, which is why we have them, that we do prefer national brand. But in general, as a rule of thumb, our margin rates are much more significant on our Cardinal-sourced or Cardinal-manufactured products.  
And then, lastly, around Cordis, we're always looking at our entire portfolio of businesses to make sure we have the right type of businesses where we are positioned to win. There's nothing that sticks out to me in terms of a certain product category or that. But we are, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that we are exiting 36 countries. So not only do we look at products, but we look at products by country and countries. And where we don't believe we have significant growth opportunity, where there might be too much risk versus benefit, et cetera, we have made real conscious decisions to aggressively manage the number of countries in, which is why we are exiting 36 countries to help simplify the model."

I guess first is when we're starting the jump-off point for these -- for the earnings growth, are you starting from fiscal '22? And is that a 5-year target that we should be thinking about? Or are we jumping off from fiscal '21 as sort of the baseline year? 
And then secondly, within that, can you just remind us again sort of what the -- obviously, the earnings this year are back half-weighted. Just remind us what the tailwinds that we should be considering as we build out our model for the remainder of this fiscal year? 
And then, lastly, those higher freight and shipping costs, do you assume those go away after this year as we think about it in relation to the long-term targets?"

I'll try to capture all those points. Your question is certainly fair as it relates to trying to define the baseline for those longer-term targets. As we indicated in the remarks today, we do anticipate this additional $100 milli",650,"Okay. Yes, this is Jason. I'll try to capture all those points. Your question is certainly fair as it relates to trying to define the baseline for those longer-term targets. As we indicated in the remarks today, we do anticipate this additional $100 million to $125 million related to the inflationary environment as temporary. It's difficult certainly to define exactly if that's short term, medium term or longer term. And at the current moment, we would expect those to revert back to some normalized level in a time frame that is relatively short to medium term. 
And so when we talk about these longer-term targets, we are not presuming that type of tailwind, right? So it is in a more normalized state when we provide those targets. You referenced 5 years, I'd say 3 to 5 years is a reasonable type of time frame for average types of performance levels to get a broad perspective on the ins and the outs. But we would not expect big shocks associated with items like that, divestitures and acquisitions. Things of that nature would also be normalized out of that so that we're getting at that core type of performance. 
And then as it relates to more specifics around the elevated supply chain costs, we highlighted within our remarks that it's really just 2 key areas: the international freight and the commodities. In both cases, the reason we believe that they're temporary is that they are at multiple levels higher than what we've historically seen on international freight, which is essentially the cost of getting a shipping container shipped from overseas locations such as Asia to the United States. We're seeing that cost up 8 to 10x versus pre-COVID levels. Certainly, we would expect that to be significantly lower at some point in the future. 
And on the commodities, we're talking about a lot of different types of polymers, such as polypropylene. Those levels are more like 2x what we've seen historically. So again we would expect those to get back to a more normalized state at some point in the future. But again, those are not tailwinds to get us to these targets. Those targets are more normalized. 
And in terms of the second half, different cadence of our results for the various businesses, we did indicate that -- well, with Pharma, we would expect the second half to continue to improve steadily versus where we're at today just as it relates to getting back to more normalized state for underlying generic volume. So that continues to be as expected. 
And also as expected, our investments in our technology investments we indicated would be front-end loaded, especially with the first 3 quarters. Primarily as it relates to that fourth quarter, we started to implement those cost increases in the final implementation last Q4. So we start to get the full year effect of that as we exit the third quarter here. 
On the Medical side, we did indicate a sequential decline from Q1 to Q2 and that's just related to the timing of realizing the supply chain costs I was just walking through and all the mitigating actions that go along with that. And then also recall that we cited the COVID favorability in Q2 of last year, that is not expected to repeat. In fact, we expect that to be a headwind this 2Q, primarily as a result of the PPE price and cost timing. So we have that Q1 to Q2 cadence.  And then of course, in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, we'd expect a significant COVID tailwind associated with the comparison benefit from the PPE in the prior year. 
And then in all of our businesses, we expect ongoing stronger contributions from our growth businesses as we see the effects of various initiatives and investments that have been put in place over the course of last year."

First of all, we, as you know, called out in our fourth quarter of last year that we did expect elevated supply chain cost. So in our guidance for this year for the Medical segment, we already assumed a certain amount of elevated supply chain cost, some of which we had planned already to offset through cost reductions, pricing actions and those types of things, and that was originally built in. 
What we saw during the quarter, particularly as the quarter went on, was a significant increase in those supply chain costs, most notably in international freight high containers that we talked about as well as commodities. And those, we feel, will create an incremental $100 million to $125 million of cost for us. 
Roughly, I would say that $100 million to $125 million is split relatively evenly between the impact of commodities and the impact of freight cost. So they were both very, very significant. We saw other minor ones in other areas, but those were the really 2 big ones, both of which we believe are temporary because, one, as Jason said earlier, they're at all-time highs for the most part, significantly higher than where they were. And we believe that over time, the market will adjust and those will be able to come back down. 
So what are we doing about that? That is a net number, the $100 million to $125 million, obviously, since we called that out as the adjustment to Medical guidance, is that we are getting after it through pricing actions, passing some of it through. 
It's hard to really talk about exactly which ones you can pass through or not. The market is very complicated. There are contracts that we have to work through. We have to work with our partners, both the hospitals and the GPOs. We have to understand the supply and demand dynamics of each item in the environment. And so we are working through and understanding all of those factors, but there is some additional pricing action built into that number. 
And then obviously, since we maintain guidance for the entire company, we are taking aggressive cost actions across the company. We are leveraging our improved balance sheet, and we are also focusing on our growth businesses and pushing our teams to do more, faster there. So those are some, I hope, some helpful comments."

It's a greater increase in both of these areas of international freight and commodities, but it's also a longer expected duration. We had anticipated that they would come back to more normalized levels a bit earlier, so we saw a higher spike and a longer duration. 
And in terms of just how you model it through on revenue, I'd like to just draw a little bit of distinction. With PPE, we saw many, many times higher total impact on that product cost. And so we saw a much more significant number of dollars in both cost and revenue that came through. While this is still significant, it's much less meaningful from a revenue perspective and it's not moving that needle nearly as much."

So let me step back and hit a couple of different pieces, and I'll finish with your question on Medical, but I'll take a shot here to emphasize a few others. So there's really, I would say, 3 obviously components to our long-term target, which our long-term target we're talking about is having a double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield on average, as Jason mentioned. 
In Pharma, the -- to your point, we don't really see those fluctuations in commodities and costs affecting that business generally because if it does, it generally happens in the form of the drugs having increases, which in that model, are able to be passed on and worked through the model. 
And so our goal of low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth in Pharma is really focused on strengthening that core PD balance, getting that right mix of generics, making sure we're managing the balancing through our margin initiative and all that as well as then driving our growth businesses, especially Nuclear and Outcomes, and we gave some color on those that hopefully you found helpful and exciting. For instance, Nuclear doubling in the next 5 years, Specialty continuing and Outcomes continuing with double-digit growth. So we believe the combination of getting that PD business stabilized, which we're seeing and then seeing the growth there is really what's going to drive that. 
And then, of course, we mentioned the use of capital being able to -- having our debt lower commitment to our dividend and then the share repurchases.
On Medical, as you mentioned, it's a couple of different things. It's simplifying our operating model, focusing on driving mix and fueling our growth businesses. I won't go into those details because we did it in the comments. But to your question on what kind of changes can we make that help, it's really one of the things we are working on with customers right now is how do we change our contracts with our customers to give us more flexibility when there is sudden significant changes in the supply chain that there is some ability to raise price.
Our discussions with our customers are being very transparent. We want to be able to make sure that if we're able to do that, we're very willing to tie those things to indexes and things, so they understand that, as they come back down, we're not -- we're willing to pass lower costs back on to them. Because we don't want to look at this as a -- necessarily a chance to improve our margins. We'd like to do that through driving mix and launching more products, not on the backs of our customers during a supply chain. 
So we are working with them to create contracting methods that will allow us to be able to pass those on as well as help them understand what are the metrics we will do to be able to know for them when they changed the other direction, too."

So should we take that long-term double-digit growth back out from 2022 guidance sort of the abnormal costs that you're seeing, normalize for them and then apply that growth rate to get to 2023? So that's the first part of the question. 
And then secondly, as we think about these sort of transitory costs in nature, you talk about $100 million to $125 million costs related to the supply chain. What's the contribution of labor cost to that headwind? Because when we think about labor costs, we think about it as potentially more structural because once you raised someone's salaries, it's difficult to bring it back down. So how should we think about that component within the additional cost?"

There's a reason that we do highlight that as an average over that period of time. So we are not providing fiscal '23 guidance with the statement. 
With that said, we think that there are, over these longer periods of time, that these would be the primary drivers and expectations we would have for our businesses. And -- but how you described it about the normalized level, as an example, that $100 million to $125 million, we're -- we indicated that we anticipate these costs remain elevated for the balance of fiscal '22. We are not taking a position at this point as to how much, if any, carries over into fiscal '23. That is a terrific example of an important element of fiscal '23 guidance that we will provide in the future. That is not, at this point, something that we feel comfortable being able to identify. 
And then your question about labor is a great one. We did not call it out because it is very consistent with what we had last quarter. So while labor inflation and those pressures are very real for us like the whole industry, we are not seeing anything new and unique this quarter versus last quarter and so we're not adding in any additional costs for that. 
But I would also highlight that even what was included in the original guidance was not nearly as substantial as the cost that we're referencing for what was included before for commodities and international freight. Those are clearly the most significant items that drive that fluctuation. And items like labor as well as more domestic-related costs such as domestic transportation and other fuel are all relatively low compared to those other 2 primary items of international freight and commodities."

I like to conclude with just a few thoughts. I know the elevated product costs within the Medical segment incurred a lot of attention here today, but I want to just reiterate that, one, we do believe a majority of these costs are temporary; two, that we are taking aggressive enterprise-wide actions to help mitigate; and three, we did reaffirm our non-GAAP EPS guidance. 
Additionally, in Pharma, we're encouraged by the profit growth we saw in the quarter and the ongoing resiliency in this business. With an additional $3 billion share repurchase authorization and our commitment to our dividend, we are positioned to return capital to shareholders while prioritizing investment in our growth businesses, simplifying our operating model and strengthening our core businesses. 
And together, this gives us confidence in achieving the new long-term growth targets that we provided. With that, thank you again. We hope you all have a good day."
