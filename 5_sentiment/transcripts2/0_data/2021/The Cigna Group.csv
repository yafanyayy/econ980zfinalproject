I am Alexis Jones, lead principal for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanco, Cigna's Chief Financ",440,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Alexis Jones, lead principal for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanco, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's full year 2020 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2021. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders' net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. 
In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2021 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. 
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results. In the fourth quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item benefit of $3.2 billion or $8.91 per share for the sale of Cigna's Group Disability and Life business that was completed on December 31, 2020. We also recorded an after-tax special item charge of $148 million or $0.41 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. 
Beginning next quarter in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement, the Group Disability and Other segment will be combined with corporate and called Corporate and Other Operations. This change to simplify our reporting was enabled by the aforementioned sale of the group's disability and life business. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2021 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2021 dividend. With that, I will turn the call over to David."

And thank you for joining us on our call today. When we met a year ago, the challenges from COVID-19 were just beginning to fully emerge around the globe. With the arrival of vaccines, 2021 is likely to be a year",1645,"Thank you, Alexis. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on our call today. When we met a year ago, the challenges from COVID-19 were just beginning to fully emerge around the globe. With the arrival of vaccines, 2021 is likely to be a year of transition as communities and businesses seek to turn the page. I am very proud of the ways in which our 70,000-plus colleagues led and continue to lead through this difficult time. For customers, our clients, our providers, our partners in our communities. Starting last spring, we were amongst the first to wave out-of-pocket cost for COVID-19 testing as well as treatment. Our Evernorth business quickly leveraged our supply chain expertise to ensure consistent prescription drug supply and delivery during the uncertain times. 
In our U.S. medical business, we ramped up to meet the significant increased demand for behavior health services by growing our network, adding virtual provider partners, creating demand webcasts, treating first responders and adding search capabilities for provider ethnicity. All while we were deploying hundreds of millions of dollars to support our clients and partners who are hit hardest by the pandemic. In partnership with New York Life, we launched the Brave of Heart Fund to provide charitable brands for families, frontline workers and volunteers who lost loved ones to COVID-19. Then last month, our Cigna Medical group was amongst the first non hospital organizations in the nation to administer antibody therapy for high risk COVID-19 patients, bringing up much needed hospital space. And just a few weeks ago, we partnered with industry leaders from across the public and private sectors to ensure that people who receive the vaccine have digital access to the vaccination records so they can safely return to their jobs and daily activities. 
As we continue to work to serve our clients, our customers and our patients during the pandemic, we also balanced our responsibility to deliver for our shareholders as well. For 2020 full year, we grew our adjusted revenue by 14% to $160 billion. We also delivered adjusted earnings per share of $18.45, consistent with our overall expectations, which included the ongoing elevated cost of COVID-19-related services. 
Today, I'm going to talk about how our strategic actions we took in 2020 position each of our businesses to navigate what we expect will be another very dynamic year, one that will require us, again, to balance the varying needs of all of our stakeholders. I'll also tell you about our growth framework and how our execution of it will drive our success throughout this challenging environment beyond. Following my comments, Brian Evanko will share more details about our 2020 financial results and our 2021 outlook. And then we'll take your questions. 
At Cigna, we've been on a journey, an important one over the past 2 years to significantly accelerate our strategic path. During 2020, we completed the integration of our combination with Express Scripts and delivered on our integration priorities, including revenue growth, cash flow generation, deleveraging targets, strong client retention, high levels of coworker retention and working to keep our vision top of mind with innovations and improved affordability, predictability and simplicity delivered to the market. In addition, we delivered another important milestone of our strategic journey by launching Evernorth, our health services platform, which has meaningfully grown our strategic partnerships and is bringing innovative solutions to the market already. We also recently made a series of leadership changes to align our capabilities and further operationalize our strategy reinforcing our talent depth and our commitment to continue to grow and develop our team. And based on the capital and cash flow strength of our company, we are demonstrating the ability to have an and orientation to our capital deployment strategy. This means we're able to reinvest in our business for ongoing growth, and pay a meaningful quarterly dividend, and deploy substantial capital to share repurchase, and target and pursue strategic M&A. 
At the same time, we continue to execute effectively across each of our businesses by delivering value to our clients and customers or patients. In Evernorth, our 2020 adjusted revenue increased 20% and driven by ongoing strong retention, the completion of in-sourcing Cigna volumes and organic growth, including our partnership with prime therapeutics. In U.S. commercial, our relentless support of our customers and our employer clients and partners throughout the pandemic led to strong client retention levels again in 2020, along with better-than-expected in-group strength building a solid foundation that we will carry into 2021. In U.S. government, we grew our Medicare Advantage customer base by 18%, exceeding our average annual growth target of 10% to 15%, and we expanded our geographic and product footprint to now be making market offerings in 28% of all available Medicare Advantage biomarkets. 
In addition, 88% of Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plan customers in 2021 are in 4-star plus rated plans, with our national weighted average of 4.5 stars, the highest amongst international competitors. And in our international business, despite navigating the challenges of the ongoing pandemic in multiple countries, we delivered full year adjusted earnings growth of 18%, fueled by our strong partnerships. 
Related to Group Disability and Life, which we sold to New York Life on December 31, I am proud of the way in which our team worked to deliver in a very challenging environment, fueled by the pandemic for the benefit of our clients and customers. As a result of the pandemic, it created a significant reduction in our earnings contribution for our business last year. However, we remain focused on serving our clients and customers. 
Throughout 2021, we expect the macro environment to remain dynamic, which presents both challenges and opportunities for us. Among the challenges, we expect COVID-19 in the rollout of the vaccine to continue to tax an already overburdened health care system. And we expect intensified and much-needed focus on health disparities to continue as well. At the same time, we also see opportunities. They include greater recognition of the importance of the employer-sponsored market, with companies playing an even more critical role in ensuring the well-being of their employees by offering comprehensive medical pharmacy and behavioral services. There are also a number of accelerating trends that will further drive fundamental changes in health care. For example, pharmacological innovations are quickly becoming the future of health care, driven in part by the continued rise in specialty pharmaceuticals, gene therapies and the evolution of biosimilars. There's also greater recognition and acceptance of the link between mental health and physical health. And we see care access rapidly changing as a result of consumer behavior and technology and data innovation, leading to growing use of virtual visits and coordinated home-based care, all aided by advancements in remote monitoring as well. 
Against this backdrop, the progress we achieved in 2020, along with the strength of our capabilities, that gives us confidence that we will deliver at least $20 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021, even in the face of the COVID-19 headwinds, primarily in the form of elevated medical costs. Our ability to achieve this level of continued long-term success starts with our growth framework, which is 3 fundamental building blocks. First, we delivered differentiated value in the form of affordable, predictable, simple solutions for our clients, customers and patients. This drives our ability to retain, further deepen and grow our business platforms. Second, we work to partner and innovate. This enables us to rapidly bring new solutions to the market that create even more value for our clients and customers. And it also fuels our third priority, the expansion of our addressable markets, which we'll achieve by growing our geographic footprint further by moving into underpenetrated markets through service coordination and through addition of new solutions, that gives us the opportunity to sell to new buyer groups. 
Taken together, these building blocks provide us with multiple levers to continue to achieve differentiated and sustained growth, not only in 2021, but over the long term. 
In Evernorth, this means bringing an expanded set of solutions to our existing health plan, commercial and government clients by leveraging the strength of our pharmacy, care management, health intelligence and benefit management capabilities. 
In U.S. health care, this means continued outstanding retention, along with further deepening relationships and target new business adds. In U.S. government, it means delivering on our goal of accelerated customer growth of 10% to 15% in Medicare Advantage. It also means continue to expand our geographic footprint in the individual exchange market, where, for example, in 2021 will be offered in 220 counties. This is a more than 50% year-over-year increase. And in international, it means continuing to grow as we deliver differentiated value for our globally mobile customers as well as our supplemental health solution customer. We look forward to delving more deeply into our growth strategy with you at our Investor Day, which is slated for March 8. 
So now to summarize, I am very proud of our colleagues and our company for delivering for our customers, patients, clients, partners and shareholders in an extraordinary year by maintaining a relentless focus on delivering on our commitments and leading through a rapidly changing landscape. Our performance is a testament to the resilience of our organization and our ability to thrive and deliver differentiated results in the most challenging of environments. We delivered strong revenue, earnings and cash flow results in 2020. In 2021, we expect to deliver at least $20 of adjusted earnings per share, and we will continue to drive attractive operating cash flow, which fuels our ability to return value to our shareholders through a meaningful quarterly dividend and through ongoing share repurchase as well as targeted M&A. Overall, we have confidence that we will achieve our 2021 outlook and our long-term growth objectives. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Good morning, everyone. First, as we look back at 2020, I'm very proud of the actions we've taken as a company to meet the needs of our customers, clients, provider partners, communities and co-workers while also delivering on our commitments to our shareholders. And as we enter 2021, we remain focused on delivering differentiated value and driving growth across our businesses. In my remarks today, I'll review Cigna's 2020 results, including the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on our business and provide our outlook for 2021. Key consolidated financial highlights for 2020 include adjusted revenue of $160 billion, adjusted earnings of $6.8 billion after tax, adjusted earnings per share of $18.45 and operating cash flows of $10.4 billion. These results reflect strong execution across our businesses through an unprecedented environment. 
Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Fourth quarter 2020 adjusted revenues grew to $30.5 billion and adjusted pretax earnings grew to $1.6 billion. Evernorth's strong results reflect organic growth with outstanding client retention and new partnerships, effective execution of supply chain initiatives and continued strong performance in Accretive, our industry-leading specialty pharmacy. During the quarter, we fulfilled 388 million adjusted pharmacy scripts, a 19% increase over fourth quarter 2019. The overall, Evernorth delivered a strong fourth quarter as we completed our integration efforts, and we entered 2021 with good momentum. 
Turning to U.S. Medical. Fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $9.7 billion, and adjusted pretax earnings were $328 million. These results reflect COVID-19-related impacts and the return of the health insurance tax. COVID-19-related impacts in the quarter include the direct cost of COVID-19 testing and treatment, the cost of actions we have taken to support customers, providers and coworkers and decreased specialty contributions, partially offset by a reduction in non-COVID utilization. As we progress through the fourth quarter, we experienced an increase in direct COVID-19 cost for testing and treatment as incidence rates spiked across the country. While we also saw increased levels of care deferral for non-COVID costs during the latter part of the quarter, the direct COVID-19 cost outweighed the impact of lower non-COVID costs. 
Turning to membership. We ended the year with 16.7 million total medical customers. This represents less than a 0.5% decline sequentially, excluding the loss of a 240,000 Life clients as expected due to an acquisition, as our book of business remains resilient. We finished the year with 18% Medicare Advantage customer growth and delivered mid-single-digit growth in the select and international segments despite a challenged economic backdrop. 
Overall, results for Cigna's U.S. medical segment reflects strong fundamentals and the impact of the increase in direct COVID-19 costs as we progressed through the fourth quarter. In our international markets business, fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $1.5 billion. And adjusted pretax earnings were $91 million, reflecting the cost of actions taken to support customers and coworkers and investments in the business for future growth. For our Group Disability and Other operations segment, fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $1.3 billion. Fourth quarter adjusted pretax earnings for this segment were $11 million, reflecting elevated life claims related to the pandemic and unfavorable disability claims. As previously noted, we completed the sale of the Group Disability and Life business to New York Life on December 31, 2020. 
For our corporate segment, the fourth quarter adjusted loss of $381 million reflects lower interest expenses due to lower levels of outstanding debt. Overall, Cigna's 2020 results reflect focused execution across each of our businesses through a dynamic environment as we continue to meet the needs of those we serve while delivering strong financial results. 
As we turn to 2021, we have entered the year with strength and momentum, driven by our strategic actions in 2020, which David detailed. And we expect the environment in 2021 to continue to be dynamic, presenting both challenges and opportunities for our business. Before going to our detailed outlook, with the sale of our Group Disability and Life business, contributions from Group should be removed for the purposes of year-over-year comparisons. With that, for full year 2021, we expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $165 billion, representing growth of approximately $10 billion after adjusting for 2020 group revenues. We expect full year 2021 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $6.95 billion or at least $20 per share. This is inclusive of an expected COVID-19 related headwind of approximately $1.25 per share. In 2021, we expect elevated medical costs including the impact of Direct COVID-19 related costs and more normalized non-COVID utilization, and we expect impact of a gradual economic recovery on our customer base in 2021. 
Given these COVID-19 dynamics, we expect the primary impact to be in our U.S. medical business. Further, we expect the COVID-19 headwind to be more concentrated in the first quarter of the year. And so we would expect the cadence of earnings per share in 2021 to be more weighted to the final 3 quarters of the year. Specifically, we expect approximately 20% to 22% on of 2021 earnings per share to emerge in the first quarter of the year. 
For 2021, we project an expense ratio in the range of 7.5% to 8%. And  a consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%. 
I'll now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.6 billion. This represents year-over-year growth of at least 4%. In Evernorth, we expect the 2021 quarterly earnings cadence to be directionally in line with 2020. For 2021, we expect adjusted pharmacy scripts of at least 1.55 billion scripts, and we see significant opportunity to bring new innovative solutions to market through Evernorth. With less than 15% of our Evernorth revenues derived from Cigna's U.S. medical business, we have a significant external customer and client base, and we expect continued attractive growth through existing and new Evernorth relationships. 
For U.S. Medical, we expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.8 billion. This outlook reflects focused execution in our businesses, driven by organic customer growth, deepening of customer relationships and disciplined expense management. This outlook also includes the projected impact of COVID-19. As I said earlier, the COVID-19 headwind primarily impacts our U.S. medical business, with the greatest impact in the earlier part of 2021. Key assumptions reflected in our U.S. medical earnings outlook for 2021 include the following: regarding total medical customers, we expect 2021 growth of at least 325,000 customers. This includes continued organic growth throughout the year in our commercial business, led by the select and middle market segments, partially offset by lower national accounts enrollment. We also expect Medicare Advantage customer growth in our target average annual growth range of 10% to 15%, and we expect growth in our individual ACA business, which will be largely offset by our exit of our legacy non-ACA individual market offerings. 
We expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 81% to 82%, reflecting the impact from 2021 of elevated medical costs, including the impact of Direct COVID-19 related costs and more normalized non-COVID utilization, the repeal of the health insurance tax effective for 2021 and continued focused execution and delivery of strong clinical quality across our U.S. commercial and government businesses. We also expect continued contributions from international markets as we continue to deliver differentiated solutions that improve the health, well-being and peace of mind of those we serve in our global markets. Regarding interest expense, we expect costs of approximately $1.3 billion pretax in 2021. All in, for full year 2021, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $6.95 billion or at least $20 per share. Overall, these expected results reflect the differentiated value, strength and strategic positioning of our businesses as we deliver growth while navigating the headwind associated with COVID-19. 
Now turning to our capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to drive exceptional cash flow with strong returns on capital, even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. In 2020, we deployed $4.7 billion to repay debt, and we repurchased 21.9 million shares of stock for $4.1 billion. We ended 2020 with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 39.5%, an improvement of 570 basis points over year-end 2019, as we met our deleveraging target of a debt-to-capitalization ratio of less than 40%. 
Now framing our capital outlook for 2021. We entered 2021 with $2.5 billion of deployable capital from our strong cash flow generation in 2020 and the remaining proceeds of the group sale, net of the expected debt repayment we announced on deal close. For 2021, we expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses. Combined, this gives us at least $10 billion to deploy in 2021 and positions us well to execute against our 2021 capital deployment priorities. 
First, we expect approximately $1 billion in tax payments and expenditures resulting from the group sale. We also expect to deploy approximately $1 billion to capital expenditures, primarily focused on technology to drive future growth. We expect to deploy approximately $1.4 billion to shareholder dividends, in line with our January quarterly dividend announcement. And we expect to largely deploy the remaining $6.6 billion for share repurchase and strategic M&A. Year-to-date, as of February 3, 2021, and we have already repurchased 4.2 million shares for $906 million. 
For the purposes of planning and 2021 earnings per share guidance, our outlook reflects the deployment of the vast majority of the $6.6 billion to share repurchase. Regarding M&A, we look for opportunities that are both strategically and financially attractive, and we would evaluate a given opportunity on its merits. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. So to recap, our full year 2020 consolidated results reflect strong execution led by our Evernorth segment. We entered 2021 with momentum, and we are confident in our ability to deliver our full year 2021 earnings outlook. Further, we've strategically positioned our businesses to leverage our growth framework and to be service-based and capital-light. This positioning drives significant financial strength and flexibility and gives us continued confidence in our long-term growth targets. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of our call."

I guess maybe since you are kind of more commercially focused, maybe you could help draw a little bit of a distinction between how you expect utilization in the commercial business to rebound in 2021? Is there less pent-up demand than what you might see in the Medicare business? And therefore, commercial gets to more normal more quickly in 2021 than other business lines? I just wanted to hear your thoughts on that given your performance versus your peers in Q4."

So just a few kind of framing comments, and then I'll get to the core of your question. Throughout 2020 as the pandemic emerged, we certainly did witness an inverse relationship between COVID-19 claims and deferred care. And you step back all the way in the second quarter of 2020, the impact of care deferrals more than outweighed the direct costs associated with COVID-19 claims for testing and treatment across both our commercial and Medicare businesses. During the third quarter, these factors approximately offset one another, meaning the cost of COVID claims approximately offset the effect of care deferrals. In the fourth quarter specifically, as the back half of the quarter emerged, we started to see the cost of COVID-19 claims for both testing and treatment start to exceed the benefits we were seeing from increased care deferral activity. And so we ended the quarter with performance of medical costs in aggregate that was modestly above our seasonal baseline. That effect was consistent across both the commercial and the Medicare books of business, although I would note that the commercial care deferrals were lower than the Medicare care deferrals that we saw in the fourth quarter. So that's the way I'd encourage you to think about it. And as we roll that forward into 2021, our guidance contemplates the respective books of business in the $1.25 headwind."

So yes, you have that right. For the fourth quarter, we did see the direct cost of COVID-19 testing and treatment exceed the benefits of care deferral for the quarter in aggregate, with the back half of the quarter, where the acceleration really occurred. I would note, though, that the fourth quarter also saw elevated care deferral relative to the third quarter in Medicare. And again, as we roll that forward, stepping into 2021, we've assumed that the first portion of the year, there will be elevated medical cost experience in our book of business across U.S. medical. And as the year unfolds, that will gradually dissipate towards the back half of the year."

I think what you're reflecting back on as the pandemic, the breadth of magnitude of it began to take hold and become obvious. We made the decision as an organization that we would seek to return all the favorable economics that were manifested because of COVID disruption to clients, customers, patients, our provider partners and our coworkers. So you're reflecting back to that. We did take proactive action throughout the course of the year to work with clients. That's a client-by-client set of actions depending on the client's position, desire, funding mechanisms, et cetera, to both return value in absolute sense. And in some cases, restructure programs within ITour 2021. In some cases, you could think about the, call it, the risk-sharing relationship with those clients may have moved somewhat depending again on the client's preference.

I'm going to approach it maybe a little bit differently, but hopefully, this will get at what you're looking for here. As we dimensioned the $1.25, I would encourage you to think about it in 3 broad categories. The first one being the impact of elevated COVID-19 testing treatment of vaccination costs as well as some of the pressure we anticipate on our revenue, for example, in our Medicare business. I would size that at about half of the $1.25 impact as it relates to the 2021 effect on our U.S. medical book. And you'll see that primarily in the medical care ratio or the MCR. 
The second component that's sizable is in customer volumes, again, specifically in our U.S. medical business. We would expect about 35% to 40% or so of that $1.25 to show up in the form of lower volumes due to the ongoing economic pressures associated with the pandemic.

Secondly, through partnerships, the way we work to partner in different ways, shapes and forms. And thirdly, potentially through M&A from that standpoint.

We'll be able to carry that momentum through 2021. We're pretty thick into the 2022 selling season right now. The health plan season is far along. The large commercial season is meaningfully along. And the -- we'll call it the middle market consortium selling season is in the early stages. As of right now, we know we have 2 health plan losses for 2022. We've had essentially 99% plus retention up until that point for our health plan business, and we would like to retain every client every day. And we know that that's not possible, but we have 2 known losses that have been written about in the marketplace.

We've talked before around our orientation as being -- we think about ourselves as a consultative solution provider. So I pause a little bit on the push side of the equation. But stepping back, your framing, I think, is quite healthy. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we see the change in which care will be accessed and coordinated as one of the 3 defining trends over the decade in front of us, and we see significant opportunity, to be clear. So we'll repeat that. We see significant opportunity to deliver more value, more choice, more simplicity with appropriate coordination back to customers and patients through effective use of virtual programs. This is well beyond telemedicine, it's well beyond urgent care triaging. There's longitudinal nature that is attached to that. It is aided by remote monitoring. It is aided by a coordinated system to make that longitudinal delivery work. We see this transcending from health care through behavioral health to coordinated health care and behavior health services from that standpoint. And we see it as a significant opportunity. I'd also note that we've been mindful in terms of the positioning of the corporation, whereby we see that as not only a significant opportunity in the market, but for us because we've sought not to be positioned in we'll call it bricks-and-mortar delivery or fixed delivery infrastructure, but having the flexibility of the variable delivery infrastructure that is aided for clients. 
And then lastly, we do see your point, you have the ability to design benefits. You can have a virtual primary benefit structure that are being tested in the marketplace today, and you could put that in the push category, but it's a choice that you would offer and we've already seen some positive markers.

First, we expect the ongoing COVID impact to this enrollment to continue to have pressure on customers throughout the first half of '20 -- our customer number throughout the first half of 2021. Second, as typically takes place in the national account segment, there are some non cover related this enrollment that happened historically in that business because most of the selling takes place during the first portion of the year. Offsetting that is continued growth and strength in the select segment, that has a very active selling season throughout the course of the year as well as some known we call middle market, new business adds that will take place during the middle portion of the year. 
Now as it relates still looking forward to U.S., the final part of your question relative to the trough on national accounts. Our early look at 2022 is we would expect a very attractive retention number at this point for our U.S. medical national account relationships as well as the selling season has been pretty active right now for us.

And you're correct, we had an early start and a lot of passion and drive and therefore, strategic direction relative to it. I would start with the end, and that is the Medicare Advantage book, in general, has a higher penetration of and comprehensive nature of value-based care relationships per customer that we serve versus commercial. So -- and you probably see that in other ways, you look at the marketplace. The primary care physicians, the integrated multi-specialty physician groups, et cetera, tend to adopt, adapt and internalize value-based care more comprehensively for Medicare Advantage given that population's health needs and the opportunity to deliver really significant value. The 
exciting end piece of it is we've been working now for a decade to prove that thesis in the commercial space. And it varies by market in terms of the level of breadth and depth. But we have well in excess of 600 collaborative accountable care relationships that are up and running and delivering meaningful value, the more mature ones are delivering meaningful value for customers and clients. What does that mean? Clinical quality to higher gap in care closure; service quality, strong service experience and improved affordability from that standpoint. And the last comment I would add here is the market is always dynamic. But one of the impacts of COVID-19 is that it jars everybody in every norm. And as it relates to value-based care, it puts a spotlight back on value-based care, that shared risk insured performance relationships now may look a little bit more palatable to some that may have not viewed it in the past and were more weighted to a fee-for-service model. So we see an opportunity to further expand and deepen some of those relationships, both in commercial, specifically, but as well as in some of the Medicare Advantage opportunities."

As it relates to what I would describe as ACMED or worksite support the posture has been thus far and good collaboration with HHS administration staff that is outside of what an insurance or a service relationship should be. To the extent it's revisited, revisit it dynamically, but that's typically carried by the employer through an [indiscernible] relationship or otherwise. I'd also remind you that 85% of our commercial business is self-funded. So we act as a fiduciary. And in cases where individual employers want assistance relative to that, we're proactively supporting through that lens. But we do not see that as either: a, likely in the immediate future, even relative to engagement on these topics this week; or b, a needle mover for us given the makeup of our portfolio of businesses."

If maybe you could just call out the distinction, maybe I'm putting too much emphasis on physician practices being bricks-and-mortar and excluding them as an area of focus. 
And then similarly, if it's in Evernorth, will it be more focused on providing these services to employers and health plans? Or how much of the focus is providing these services to risk-bearing primary care or other value-based care sorts of companies?"

And it happens withi",353,"Lance, it's David. I'll start with the latter portion of your question first. So as we evolve our capabilities, both the present state but evolve our capabilities, you should think about, in general, all that happens within Evernorth. And it happens within Evernorth as it relates to a platform of services to serve health plans, to serve corporate clients, to serve governmental agencies and to offer services to, as you articulated, risk-bearing or performance-based health care delivery systems. And you should think about Cigna, Cigna's medical portfolio as a consumer of those services. Now clearly, an important development partner, but a consumer of those services as another client of Evernorth. As it relates to the first portion of your question, I think your basic framing of it is right. And so if we just reiterate it and step it up a notch. Our view is that the U.S. is not in needs of more physical proximity and physical plant to serve the population in general, especially in urban and suburban areas. We obviously have additional need states relative to rural areas from that standpoint. Secondly, that consumer behavior in a variety of areas, including health care, has reinforced a desire, not an acceptance, but a desire for bringing care and services to me in a real-time basis in a highly personalized basis. Therefore, virtual care coordination. And obviously, that's augmented with clinical staff, but it's bringing the service to the individual in an immediate real-time basis, so long as it could be longitudinally managed and coordinated effectively. And then the last point I want to be really clear on our view of it is as a complementary aspect to the care delivery system, not as a disintermediation play. But it's a complementary aspect because to make it work properly, it needs to be connected back into the health care delivery system. And we have many examples we've been working today in our approach to virtual, both for medical as well as behavioral. We just see the ability to ramp it significantly given both the demand and the acceptance and then the tool availability."

We're year 2 of our  geographic and product expansion with the expectation of 10% to 15% annual growth, really happy with the 18% growth we put up in '20 and well on track to achieve 10 to 15 in '21. 
The margin profile tends to vary for a few different reasons. One is when we go into a new market, there tends to be a buildup in terms of investments in people and in marketing before the customers start to come in. Two is, when we write a new customer, typically, there's a bit of a ramp relative to profitability from a durational standpoint due to the risk adjustment coding, which you appropriately called out. Thirdly, due to the unique nature of 2020 and the COVID-19 headwinds that we faced. There was lower utilization, right? So as a result of that, we were not able to get all of the risk adjustment code that we would in a normal year, if you will. We factored all that into the 2021 outlook, the $1.25 earnings per share headwind that we've called out here. A component of that is associated with Medicare Advantage, and it's associated with lower revenue than we would have otherwise anticipated having. So as you kind of step forward, as David said in the beginning, 2022 and thereafter, we expect some of that will work itself out. And we're not going to give you exact 2022 guidance here today. That's the way I would encourage you to think about the margin profile."

I am Alexis Jones, Lead Principal for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's full year 2020 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2021. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. 
A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance.  
In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements. Including statements regarding our outlook for 2021 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.  
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results. In the fourth quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item benefit of $3.2 billion or $8.91 per share for the sale of Cigna's Group Disability and Life business that was completed on December 31, 2020. 
We also recorded an after-tax special item charge of $148 million or $0.41 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results.  
Beginning next quarter in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement, the Group Disability and Other segment will be combined with corporate and called Corporate and Other Operations. This change to simplify our reporting was enabled by the aforementioned sale of the Group's Disability and Life business. 
Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2021 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2021 dividend.

When we met a year ago, the challenges from COVID-19 were just beginning to fully emerge around the globe. With the arrival of vaccines, 2021 is likely to be a year of transition as communities and businesses seek to turn the page. I am very proud of the ways in which our 70,000-plus colleagues led and continue to lead through this difficult time for customers, our clients, our providers, our partners in our communities. 
Starting last spring, we were amongst the first to wave out-of-pocket cost for COVID-19 testing as well as treatment. Our Evernorth business quickly leveraged our supply chain expertise to ensure consistent prescription drug supply and delivery during the uncertain times.  
In our U.S. Medical business, we ramped up to meet the significant increased demand for behavior health services by growing our network, adding virtual provider partners, creating demand webcasts, treating first responders and adding search capabilities for provider ethnicity. All while we were deploying hundreds of millions of dollars to support our clients and partners who are hit hardest by the pandemic. 
In partnership with New York Life, we launched the Brave of Heart Fund to provide charitable brands for families, frontline workers and volunteers who lost loved ones to COVID-19. Then last month, our Cigna Medical group was amongst the first non-hospital organizations in the nation to administer antibody therapy for high-risk COVID-19 patients, bringing up much needed hospital space. And just a few weeks ago, we partnered with industry leaders from across the public and private sectors to ensure that people who receive the vaccine have digital access to the vaccination records so they can safely return to their jobs and daily activities.  
As we continue to work to serve our clients, our customers and our patients during the pandemic, we also balanced our responsibility to deliver for our shareholders as well. For 2020 full year, we grew our adjusted revenue by 14% to $160 billion. We also delivered adjusted earnings per share of $18.45, consistent with our overall expectations, which included the ongoing elevated cost of COVID-19 related services.  
Today, I'm going to talk about how our strategic actions we took in 2020 position each of our businesses to navigate what we expect will be another very dynamic year, one that will require us, again, to balance the varying needs of all of our stakeholders. I'll also tell you about our growth framework and how our execution of it will drive our success throughout this challenging environment beyond. Following my comments, Brian Evanko will share more details about our 2020 financial results and our 2021 outlook. And then we'll take your questions.  
At Cigna, we've been on a journey, an important one over the past 2 years to significantly accelerate our strategic path. During 2020, we completed the integration of our combination with Express Scripts and delivered on our integration priorities, including revenue growth, cash flow generation, deleveraging targets, strong client retention, high levels of coworker retention and working to keep our vision top of mind with innovations and improved affordability, predictability and simplicity delivered to the market. 
In addition, we delivered another important milestone of our strategic journey by launching Evernorth, our health services platform, which has meaningfully grown our strategic partnerships and is bringing innovative solutions to the market already. We also recently made a series of leadership changes to align our capabilities and further operationalize our strategy reinforcing our talent depth and our commitment to continue to grow and develop our team. And based on the capital and cash flow strength of our company, we are demonstrating the ability to have an and orientation to our capital deployment strategy. This means we're able to reinvest in our business for ongoing growth, and pay a meaningful quarterly dividend, and deploy substantial capital to share repurchase, and target and pursue strategic M&A.  
At the same time, we continue to execute effectively across each of our businesses by delivering value to our clients and customers or patients. In Evernorth, our 2020 adjusted revenue increased 20% driven by ongoing strong retention, the completion of in-sourcing Cigna volumes and organic growth, including our partnership with Prime Therapeutics. 
In U.S. Commercial, our relentless support of our customers and our employer clients and partners throughout the pandemic led to strong client retention levels again in 2020, along with better-than-expected in-group strength building a solid foundation that we will carry into 2021. 
In U.S. Government, we grew our Medicare Advantage customer base by 18%, exceeding our average annual growth target of 10% to 15%, and we expanded our geographic and product footprint to now be making market offerings in 28% of all available Medicare Advantage biomarkets.  
In addition, 88% of Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plan customers in 2021 are in 4-star plus rated plans, with our national weighted average of 4.5 stars, the highest amongst international competitors. And in our international business, despite navigating the challenges of the ongoing pandemic in multiple countries, we delivered full year adjusted earnings growth of 18%, fueled by our strong partnerships.  
Related to Group Disability and Life, which we sold to New York Life on December 31, I am proud of the way in which our team worked to deliver in a very challenging environment, fueled by the pandemic for the benefit of our clients and customers. As a result of the pandemic, it created a significant reduction in our earnings contribution for our business last year. However, we remain focused on serving our clients and customers.  
Throughout 2021, we expect the macro environment to remain dynamic, which presents both challenges and opportunities for us. Among the challenges, we expect COVID-19 in the rollout of the vaccine to continue to tax an already overburdened health care system. And we expect intensified and much-needed focus on health disparities to continue as well. At the same time, we also see opportunities. They include greater recognition of the importance of the employer-sponsored market, with companies playing an even more critical role in ensuring the well-being of their employees by offering comprehensive medical pharmacy and behavioral services. 
There are also a number of accelerating trends that will further drive fundamental changes in health care. For example, pharmacological innovations are quickly becoming the future of health care, driven in part by the continued rise in specialty pharmaceuticals, gene therapies and the evolution of biosimilars. There's also greater recognition and acceptance of the link between mental health and physical health. And we see care access rapidly changing as a result of consumer behavior and technology and data innovation, leading to growing use of virtual visits and coordinated home-based care, all aided by advancements in remote monitoring as well.  
Against this backdrop, the progress we achieved in 2020, along with the strength of our capabilities, that gives us confidence that we will deliver at least $20 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021, even in the face of the COVID-19 headwinds, primarily in the form of elevated medical costs. 
Our ability to achieve this level of continued long-term success starts with our growth framework, which is 3 fundamental building blocks: First, we delivered differentiated value in the form of affordable, predictable, simple solutions for our clients, customers and patients. This drives our ability to retain, further deepen and grow our business platforms. Second, we work to partner and innovate. This enables us to rapidly bring new solutions to the market that create even more value for our clients and customers. And it also fuels our third priority, the expansion of our addressable markets, which we'll achieve by growing our geographic footprint further by moving into underpenetrated markets through service coordination and through addition of new solutions, that gives us the opportunity to sell to new buyer groups.  
Taken together, these building blocks provide us with multiple levers to continue to achieve differentiated and sustained growth, not only in 2021, but over the long term.  
In Evernorth, this means bringing an expanded set of solutions to our existing health plan, commercial and government clients by leveraging the strength of our pharmacy, care management, health intelligence and benefit management capabilities.  
In U.S. health care, this means continued outstanding retention, along with further deepening relationships and target new business adds. In U.S. government, it means delivering on our goal of accelerated customer growth of 10% to 15% in Medicare Advantage. It also means continue to expand our geographic footprint in the individual exchange market, where, for example, in 2021, we'll be offered in 220 counties. This is a more than 50% year-over-year increase. And in international, it means continuing to grow as we deliver differentiated value for our globally mobile customers as well as our supplemental health solution customer. We look forward to delving more deeply into our growth strategy with you at our Investor Day, which is slated for March 8.  
So now to summarize, I am very proud of our colleagues and our company for delivering for our customers, patients, clients, partners and shareholders in an extraordinary year by maintaining a relentless focus on delivering on our commitments and leading through a rapidly changing landscape. Our performance is a testament to the resilience of our organization and our ability to thrive and deliver differentiated results in the most challenging environment. We delivered strong revenue, earnings and cash flow results in 2020. 
In 2021, we expect to deliver at least $20 of adjusted earnings per share, and we will continue to drive attractive operating cash flow, which fuels our ability to return value to our shareholders through a meaningful quarterly dividend and through ongoing share repurchase as well as targeted M&A. Overall, we have confidence that we will achieve our 2021 outlook and our long-term growth objectives. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

And as we enter 2021, we remain focused on delivering differentiated value and driving growth across our businesses. 
In my remarks today, I'll review Cigna's 2020 results, including the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on our business and provide our outlook for 2021. 
Key consolidated financial highlights for 2020 include adjusted revenue of $160 billion, adjusted earnings of $6.8 billion after tax, adjusted earnings per share of $18.45 and operating cash flows of $10.4 billion. These results reflect strong execution across our businesses through an unprecedented environment.  
Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Fourth quarter 2020 adjusted revenues grew to $30.5 billion and adjusted pretax earnings grew to $1.6 billion. Evernorth's strong results reflect organic growth with outstanding client retention and new partnerships, effective execution of supply chain initiatives and continued strong performance in Accredo, our industry-leading specialty pharmacy. 
During the quarter, we fulfilled 388 million adjusted pharmacy scripts, a 19% increase over fourth quarter 2019. Overall, Evernorth delivered a strong fourth quarter as we completed our integration efforts, and we entered 2021 with good momentum.  
Turning to U.S. Medical. Fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $9.7 billion, and adjusted pretax earnings were $328 million. These results reflect COVID-19 related impacts and the return of the health insurance tax. COVID-19 related impacts in the quarter include the direct cost of COVID-19 testing and treatment, the cost of actions we have taken to support customers, providers and coworkers and decreased specialty contributions, partially offset by a reduction in non-COVID utilization. As we progress through the fourth quarter, we experienced an increase in direct COVID-19 cost for testing and treatment as incidence rates spiked across the country. While we also saw increased levels of care deferral for non-COVID costs during the latter part of the quarter, the direct COVID-19 cost outweighed the impact of lower non-COVID costs.  
Turning to membership. We ended the year with 16.7 million total medical customers. This represents less than a 0.5% decline sequentially, excluding the loss of a 240,000 Life clients as expected due to an acquisition, as our book of business remains resilient. We finished the year with 18% Medicare Advantage customer growth and delivered mid-single-digit growth in the select and international segments despite a challenged economic backdrop.  
Overall, results for Cigna's U.S. Medical segment reflects strong fundamentals and the impact of the increase in direct COVID-19 costs as we progressed through the fourth quarter. 
In our international markets business, fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $1.5 billion. And adjusted pretax earnings were $91 million, reflecting the cost of actions taken to support customers and coworkers and investments in the business for future growth. 
For our Group Disability and Other operations segment, fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $1.3 billion. Fourth quarter adjusted pretax earnings for this segment were $11 million, reflecting elevated life claims related to the pandemic and unfavorable disability claims. As previously noted, we completed the sale of the Group Disability and Life business to New York Life on December 31, 2020. 
For our corporate segment, the fourth quarter adjusted loss of $381 million reflects lower interest expenses due to lower levels of outstanding debt. 
Overall, Cigna's 2020 results reflect focused execution across each of our businesses through a dynamic environment as we continue to meet the needs of those we serve while delivering strong financial results. 
As we turn to 2021, we have entered the year with strength and momentum, driven by our strategic actions in 2020, which David detailed. And we expect the environment in 2021 to continue to be dynamic, presenting both challenges and opportunities for our business. 
Before going to our detailed outlook, with the sale of our Group Disability and Life business, contributions from Group should be removed for the purposes of year-over-year comparisons. 
With that, for full year 2021, we expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $165 billion, representing growth of approximately $10 billion after adjusting for 2020 group revenues. We expect full year 2021 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $6.95 billion or at least $20 per share. This is inclusive of an expected COVID-19 related headwind of approximately $1.25 per share. 
In 2021, we expect elevated medical costs including the impact of direct COVID-19 related costs and more normalized non-COVID utilization, and we expect impact of a gradual economic recovery on our customer base in 2021. 
Given these COVID-19 dynamics, we expect the primary impact to be in our U.S. Medical business. Further, we expect the COVID-19 headwind to be more concentrated in the first quarter of the year. And so we would expect the cadence of earnings per share in 2021 to be more weighted to the final 3 quarters of the year. Specifically, we expect approximately 20% to 22% of 2021 earnings per share to emerge in the first quarter of the year. 
For 2021, we project an expense ratio in the range of 7.5% to 8%. And  a consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%. 
I'll now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.6 billion. This represents year-over-year growth of at least 4%. In Evernorth, we expect the 2021 quarterly earnings cadence to be directionally in line with 2020. For 2021, we expect adjusted pharmacy scripts of at least 1.55 billion scripts, and we see significant opportunity to bring new innovative solutions to market through Evernorth. With less than 15% of our Evernorth revenues derived from Cigna's U.S. Medical business, we have a significant external customer and client base, and we expect continued attractive growth through existing and new Evernorth relationships. 
For U.S. Medical, we expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.8 billion. This outlook reflects focused execution in our businesses, driven by organic customer growth, deepening of customer relationships and disciplined expense management. This outlook also includes the projected impact of COVID-19. As I said earlier, the COVID-19 headwind primarily impacts our U.S. Medical business, with the greatest impact in the earlier part of 2021. 
Key assumptions reflected in our U.S. Medical earnings outlook for 2021 include the following: regarding total medical customers, we expect 2021 growth of at least 325,000 customers. This includes continued organic growth throughout the year in our commercial business, led by the select and middle market segments, partially offset by lower national accounts enrollment. We also expect Medicare Advantage customer growth in our target average annual growth range of 10% to 15%, and we expect growth in our individual ACA business, which will be largely offset by our exit of our legacy non-ACA individual market offerings. 
We expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 81% to 82%, reflecting the impact from 2021 of elevated medical costs, including the impact of Direct COVID-19 related costs and more normalized non-COVID utilization, the repeal of the health insurance tax effective for 2021 and continued focused execution and delivery of strong clinical quality across our U.S. commercial and government businesses. 
We also expect continued contributions from International Markets as we continue to deliver differentiated solutions that improve the health, well-being and peace of mind of those we serve in our global markets. 
Regarding interest expense, we expect costs of approximately $1.3 billion pretax in 2021. All in, for full year 2021, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $6.95 billion or at least $20 per share. Overall, these expected results reflect the differentiated value, strength and strategic positioning of our businesses as we deliver growth while navigating the headwind associated with COVID-19. 
Now turning to our capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to drive exceptional cash flow with strong returns on capital, even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. In 2020, we deployed $4.7 billion to repay debt, and we repurchased 21.9 million shares of stock for $4.1 billion. We ended 2020 with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 39.5%, an improvement of 570 basis points over year-end 2019, as we met our deleveraging target of a debt-to-capitalization ratio of less than 40%. 
Now framing our capital outlook for 2021. We entered 2021 with $2.5 billion of deployable capital from our strong cash flow generation in 2020 and the remaining proceeds of the group sale, net of the expected debt repayment we announced on deal close. For 2021, we expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses. Combined, this gives us at least $10 billion to deploy in 2021 and positions us well to execute against our 2021 capital deployment priorities. 
First, we expect approximately $1 billion in tax payments and expenditures resulting from the group sale. We also expect to deploy approximately $1 billion to capital expenditures, primarily focused on technology to drive future growth. We expect to deploy approximately $1.4 billion to shareholder dividends, in line with our January quarterly dividend announcement. And we expect to largely deploy the remaining $6.6 billion for share repurchase and strategic M&A. Year-to-date, as of February 3, 2021, we have already repurchased 4.2 million shares for $906 million. 
For the purposes of planning and 2021 earnings per share guidance, our outlook reflects the deployment of the vast majority of the $6.6 billion to share repurchase. Regarding M&A, we look for opportunities that are both strategically and financially attractive, and we would evaluate a given opportunity on its merits. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. 
So to recap, our full year 2020 consolidated results reflect strong execution led by our Evernorth segment. We entered 2021 with momentum, and we are confident in our ability to deliver our full year 2021 earnings outlook. Further, we've strategically positioned our businesses to leverage our growth framework and to be service-based and capital-light. This positioning drives significant financial strength and flexibility and gives us continued confidence in our long-term growth targets. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of our call."

So just a few kind of framing comments, and then I'll get to the core of your question. Throughout 2020 as the pandemic emerged, we certainly did witness an inverse relationship between COVID-19 claims and deferred care. And you step back all the way in the second quarter of 2020, the impact of care deferrals more than outweighed the direct costs associated with COVID-19 claims for testing and treatment across both our commercial and Medicare businesses. 
During the third quarter, these factors approximately offset one another, meaning the cost of COVID claims approximately offset the effect of care deferrals. In the fourth quarter specifically, as the back half of the quarter emerged, we started to see the cost of COVID-19 claims for both testing and treatment start to exceed the benefits we were seeing from increased care deferral activity. And so we ended the quarter with performance of medical costs in aggregate that was modestly above our seasonal baseline. That effect was consistent across both the commercial and the Medicare books of business, although I would note that the commercial care deferrals were lower than the Medicare care deferrals that we saw in the fourth quarter. 
So that's the way I'd encourage you to think about it. And as we roll that forward into 2021, our guidance contemplates the respective books of business in the $1.25 headwind."

We made the decision as an organization that we would seek to return all the favorable economics that were manifested because of COVID disruption to clients, customers, patients, our provider partners and our coworkers. So you're reflecting back to that. We did take proactive action throughout the course of the year to work with clients. That's a client-by-client set of actions depending on the client's position, desire, funding mechanisms, et cetera, to both return value in absolute sense. And in some cases, restructure programs with an eye toward 2021. In some cases, you could think about the, call it, the risk-sharing relationship with those clients may have moved somewhat depending again on the client's preference.

Two is, to put a pin in it, specifically relative to stranded overhead, we were able to more rapidly accelerate the extraction of this transit overhead, largely because of executing our efficiency initiatives, but also the significant growth. So the stranded overhead extraction was more accelerated from its initiation in 2019 through 2020.

I would size that at about half of the $1.25 impact as it relates to the 2021 effect on our U.S. medical book. And you'll see that primarily in the medical care ratio or the MCR. 
The second component that's sizable is in customer volumes, again, specifically in our U.S. medical business.

Can you comment on how quickly? And you think you can diversify? And what are -- maybe update us on the areas that you're thinking about adding to the capability there. And then just based on Evernorth, there was some talk last year that the PBM selling season, people were renewing for a year because of the pandemic and do you expect the selling season to have more RFPs than normal this year? Or is it sort of a normal RFP season from what you're seeing so far?"

Relative to your first question, the platforms that we are operating within Evernorth, and again, we'll walk through it in some good detail at our Investor Day. 
There are 4 platforms within that portfolio. Our well-performing pharmacy services, our care management, our benefit management, our health intelligence platforms that are functioning, operating, delivering significant value today. Each one of which will continue to be invested in, first and foremost, organically. Brian referenced the CapEx deployment that we have within our portfolio, and Evernorth is a part user of that $1 billion CapEx. 
Secondly, through partnerships, the way we work to partner in different ways, shapes and forms. And thirdly, potentially through M&A from that standpoint. But the platform we have, we feel quite good about. As an illustration in terms of the M&A capabilities, we've talked about expanding our ability to serve customers where they are and where they seek to be served, whether that's expanded virtual platforms, expanded in home capabilities, et cetera, through that lens. 
As it relates to your second question, the selling season, et cetera, grounded in the comments we made relative to just the very strong growth results we've put up over multiple years now. We'll be able to carry that momentum through 2021. We're pretty thick into the 2022 selling season right now. The health plan season is far along. The large commercial season is meaningfully along. And the -- we'll call it the middle market consortium selling season is in the early stages. 
As of right now, we know we have 2 health plan losses for 2022. We've had essentially 99% plus retention up until that point for our health plan business, and we would like to retain every client every day. And we know that that's not possible, but we have 2 known losses that have been written about in the marketplace. Notwithstanding that, we have visibility to meaningful new business adds from the 2022 selling season, and we'll be able to continue to build on the momentum we posted for 2019 and 2020."

We've talked before around our orientation as being -- we think about ourselves as a consultative solution provider. So I pause a little bit on the push side of the equation. But stepping back, your framing, I think, is quite healthy. 
As I noted in my prepared remarks, we see the change in which care will be accessed and coordinated is one of the 3 defining trends over the decade in front of us, and we see significant opportunity, to be clear. So let me repeat that, we see significant opportunity to deliver more value, more choice, more simplicity with appropriate coordination back to customers and patients through effective use of virtual programs. 
This is well beyond telemedicine, it's well beyond urgent care triaging. There's longitudinal nature that is attached to that. It is aided by remote monitoring. It is aided by a coordinated system to make that longitudinal delivery work. We see this transcending from health care through behavioral health to coordinated health care and behavior health services from that standpoint. And we see it as a significant opportunity. I'd also note that we've been mindful in terms of the positioning of the corporation, whereby we see that as not only a significant opportunity in the market, but for us because we've sought not to be positioned in we'll call it bricks-and-mortar delivery or fixed delivery infrastructure, but having the flexibility of the variable delivery infrastructure that is aided for clients. 
And then lastly, we do see your point, you have the ability to design benefits. You can have a virtual primary benefit structure that are being tested in the marketplace today, and you could push that -- you can put that in the push category, but it's a choice that you would offer and we've already seen some positive markers. So a significant opportunity, our company is positioned to pursue it, and you should expect us to spotlight this in a little bit more detail on March 8."

One is the relationship that came out with Prime Therapeutics, effective April 1, and that became expanded on January 1, 2021. When we onboard any new client, there's a level of start-up cost associated with that as we think about bringing on new headcount to make sure that we're wrapped up for the volumes that will come. So we had a little bit of expense related to the start-up associated with our relationship with Prime Therapeutics in 2020. 
Additionally, the Cigna U.S. medical in-sourcing, which is now complete, brought revenue but de minimis earnings contribution in 2020 to Evernorth. So those are really the 2 dynamics that caused a little bit of the revenue versus our earnings growth difference that you cited.

As it relates to the year's pattern, I'd ask you to think about it as follows. First, we expect the ongoing COVID impact to this enrollment to continue to have pressure on customers throughout the first half of '20 -- our customer number throughout the first half of 2021. Second, as typically takes place in the national account segment, there are some non-COVID related disenrollment that happened historically in that business because most of the selling takes place during the first portion of the year. 
Offsetting that is continued growth and strength in the select segment, that has a very active selling season throughout the course of the year as well as some known we call middle market, new business adds that will take place during the middle portion of the year. 
Now as it relates still looking forward to U.S., the final part of your question relative to the trough on national accounts. Our early look at 2022 is we would expect a very attractive retention number at this point for our U.S. medical national account relationships as well as the selling season has been pretty active right now for us. The RFP volume is up, the quality RFP volume is high. We have some new business opportunities, wins that we have on board already, and we're in active pursuit. So we have a level of optimism relative to the outlook for that segment for January 2022. I hope that helps, Steve."

And you're correct, we had an early start and a lot of passion and drive and therefore, strategic direction relative to it. I would start with the end, and that is the Medicare Advantage book, in general, has a higher penetration of and comprehensive nature of value-based care relationships per customer that we serve versus commercial. So -- and you probably see that in other ways, you look at the marketplace. The primary care physicians, the integrated multi-specialty physician groups, et cetera, tend to adopt, adapt and internalize value-based care more comprehensively for Medicare Advantage given that population's health needs and the opportunity to deliver really significant value. 
The exciting end piece of it is we've been working now for a decade to prove that thesis in the commercial space. And it varies by market in terms of the level of breadth and depth. But we have well in excess of 600 collaborative accountable care relationships that are up and running and delivering meaningful value, the more mature ones are delivering meaningful value for customers and clients. What does that mean? Clinical quality to higher gap in care closure, service quality, strong service experience and improved affordability from that standpoint. 
And the last comment I would add here is the market is always dynamic. But one of the impacts of COVID-19 is that it jars everybody in every norm. And as it relates to value-based care, it puts a spotlight back on value-based care, that shared risk insured performance relationships now may look a little bit more palatable to some that may have not viewed it in the past and were more weighted to a fee-for-service model. So we see an opportunity to further expand and deepen some of those relationships, both in commercial, specifically, but as well as in some of the Medicare Advantage opportunities."

As it relates to what I would describe as OccMed or worksite support, the posture has been thus far and good collaboration with HHS administration staff that is outside of what an insurance or a service relationship should be. To the extent it's revisited, we revisited dynamically, but that's typically carried by the employer through an OccMed relationship or otherwise. I'd also remind you that 85% of our commercial business is self-funded. So we act as a fiduciary. And in cases where individual employers want assistance relative to that, we're proactively supporting through that lens.

If maybe you could just call out the distinction, maybe I'm putting too much emphasis on physician practices being bricks-and-mortar and excluding them as an area of focus. 
And then similarly, if it's in Evernorth, will it be more focused on providing these services to employers and health plans? Or how much of the focus is providing these services to risk-bearing primary care or other value-based care sorts of companies?"

And it happens withi",355,"Lance, it's David. I'll start with the latter portion of your question first. So as we evolve our capabilities, both the present state but evolve our capabilities, you should think about, in general, all that happens within Evernorth. And it happens within Evernorth as it relates to a platform of services to serve health plans, to serve corporate clients, to serve governmental agencies and to offer services to, as you articulated, risk-bearing or performance-based health care delivery systems. 
And you should think about Cigna, Cigna's U.S. Medical portfolio as a consumer of those services. Now clearly, an important development partner, but a consumer of those services as another client of Evernorth. As it relates to the first portion of your question, I think your basic framing of it is right. And so if we just reiterate it and step it up a notch. Our view is that the U.S. is not in needs of more physical proximity and physical plant to serve the population in general. Especially in urban and suburban areas, we obviously have additional need states relative to rural areas from that standpoint. 
Secondly, that consumer behavior in a variety of areas, including health care, has reinforced a desire, not an acceptance, but a desire for bringing care and services to me in a real-time basis in a highly personalized basis. Therefore, virtual care coordination. And obviously, that's augmented with clinical staff, but it's bringing the service to the individual in an immediate real-time basis, so long as it could be longitudinally managed and coordinated effectively. 
And then the last point I want to be really clear on our view of it is as a complementary aspect to the care delivery system, not as a disintermediation play. But it's a complementary aspect because to make it work properly, it needs to be connected back into the health care delivery system. And we have many examples we've been working today in our approach to virtual, both for medical as well as behavioral health. We just see the ability to ramp it significantly given both the demand and the acceptance and then the tool availability."

We're year 2 of our  geographic and product expansion with the expectation of 10% to 15% annual growth, really happy with the 18% growth we put up in '20 and well on track to achieve 10 to 15 in '21. 
The margin profile tends to vary for a few different reasons. One is when we go into a new market, there tends to be a buildup in terms of investments in people and in marketing before the customers start to come in. Two is, when we write a new customer, typically, there's a bit of a ramp relative to profitability from a durational standpoint due to the risk adjustment coding, which you appropriately called out. Thirdly, due to the unique nature of 2020 and the COVID-19 headwinds that we faced, there was lower utilization, right? So as a result of that, we were not able to get all of the risk adjustment codes that we would in a normal year, if you will. We factored all that into the 2021 outlook, the $1.25 earnings per share headwind that we've called out here. A component of that is associated with Medicare Advantage, and it's associated with lower revenue than we would have otherwise anticipated having. So as you kind of step forward, as David said in the beginning, 2022 and thereafter, we expect some of that will work itself out. And we're not going to give you exact 2022 guidance here today.

I'm Alexis Jones, Lead Principal for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. 
In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's first quarter 2021 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2021. As noted in our earnings release, we're describing our financial results. Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders' net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. 
In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2021 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. 
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results. In the first quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item charge of $101 million or $0.29 per share related to debt extinguishment costs incurred during the period, as well as an after-tax special item charge of $22 million or $0.06 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. We also recorded an after-tax special item benefit of $21 million or $0.06 per share related to charges associated with litigation matters. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. 
As previously noted, as a result of the sale of the Group Disability and Life business in our first quarter earnings release and quarterly financial supplement, corporate and other operations combines the results previously reported as corporate and the segment previously reported as Group Disability and Other. In our securities filings, the segment previously reported as Group Disability and Other is now reported as other operations. 
Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2021 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2021 dividend and excludes the impact of any business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today, such as our recently announced planned divestiture of the Texas Medicaid business, which we expect to close in the second half of 2021. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today. At today's we meet, our environment remains highly dynamic, with COVID-19 continuing to affect the world, our industry and our economy. At Cigna, this rapidly changing",1961,"Thanks, Alexis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today. At today's we meet, our environment remains highly dynamic, with COVID-19 continuing to affect the world, our industry and our economy. At Cigna, this rapidly changing landscape has only reinforced the tremendous responsibility we have to improve the health, well-being and peace of mind of those we serve. This remains the primary focus that drives our 70,000 coworkers each and every day, and it's the reason we work to continue to deliver for our customers, clients, patients, partners and our communities, all while delivering strong financial results for you, our shareholders. 
During the first quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $41 billion, and adjusted EPS of $4.73 per share. We also deployed significant capital to our investors through share repurchase and the payment of a meaningful quarterly dividend, reinforcing the strength of our capital-light framework. 
Building out a conversation from several weeks ago at our Investor Day, today, I'm going to talk more about how we are continuing to navigate through the current environment to balance and meet the needs of all of our stakeholders, our ability to consistently deliver strong results by executing on our growth framework and the confidence we have in achieving our increased outlook by delivering differentiated and sustained growth for the long term. Then Brian will share more details about our first quarter results and our 2021 outlook. And after that, we'll take your questions. 
Since we last met at our Investor Day in March, the macro landscape remains fluid. In the U.S., proposed legislation as well as regulation and executive actions seek to expand, extend and further support both public and private programs. Globally, social and political tensions remain high as COVID-19 with its multiple variants continue to take a toll on a number of countries such as India, where cases have again dramatically spiked. All of these forces are shaping health care and influencing the political and economic landscape around the world. At Cigna, we are navigating through this environment by continuing to innovate for and support our stakeholders with COVID-19 services, while also executing on our strategy to make health care more affordable, predictable and simple. For U.S. commercial customers, we are ensuring to get the preventative care they need, including mammographies, colonoscopies, cervical cancer screenings and child immunizations, which today are consistent with pre-pandemic levels, reflecting the continued strength of our clinical programs and proven engagement capabilities. 
Within Evernorth, for those customers served by Express Scripts home delivery, we delivered further improvements in medication adherence for people with diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. At the same time, we're also supporting the mental well-being of our customers. We are doing this through our own best-in-class capabilities where, for example, we engage with oncology patients with comorbidities by spending an average of $2,000 on their behavioral health care. We can save an average of $20,000 in avoidable costs. And we continue to innovate and leverage our strategic partnerships, including, for example, with Ginger through Cigna Ventures, which provides industry-leading on-demand, 24/7 behavioral health coaching, further extending our behavioral health access for the benefit of our customers. We're also leveraging data and actionable intelligence to understand the most common long-term complication of COVID-19 infections, then building predictive models to determine who is at greatest risk of becoming a COVID long-hauler, so we can quickly provide targeted case management and behavioral health services as well as other resources to help our customers regain their health. 
For our clients, we are serving as a trusted partner by supplying additional physical and behavior health assistance to aid in the recovery for employees who are infected by COVID-19. We're helping employers build their own communities of immunity by assisting them in launching vaccination clinics. And we're listing our data and analytics to help employers determine when and how it is safe for employees to return to work. 
For our provider partners, we're working to guide people to the most effective sites of care and further closing gaps in care with our clinical teams and our virtual capabilities. 
For our coworkers, we're supporting them in this highly disruptive environment by, for example, providing a $200 incentive for coworkers who choose to become vaccinated for COVID-19 and continuing to offer expanded lead capabilities with our emergency time-off program to provide flexibility necessitated by the current conditions. 
And finally, for our communities, we're taking steps to address social determinants of health. For example, we all know the alarming statistics on the disproportionate impact that COVID-19 has had on communities of color. As part of our S.A.F.E. initiative, we brought additional underground resources to target communities by launching COVID-19 awareness campaigns, distributing PP&E kits, dispatching our health improvement mobile resources to help to administer free flu shots and provide healthy meal as well as other support. 
Similarly, we're leaning into fight breast cancer with disparities, for example, well, amongst black women remain startling. To help to address this disparity gap, we again went directly into communities, starting in Tennessee, for example, where we collaborated with local partners to offer mobile mammography vans at churches and at other local neighborhood locations. 
At Cigna, balancing the needs of our stakeholders is deeply rooted in our corporate purpose. We constantly challenge ourselves by asking the basic question, what more could we do? To help us stay focused on delivering each and every day for the benefit of our customers, our clients, patients and our partners. Against this backdrop, the strength of our foundation propels us forward and guides our growth. 
As we shared with you at our Investor Day, through our 3 growth platforms, Evernorth, U.S. Medical and international markets, we are well positioned to leverage the 3 trends we see shaping health care into the future. Specifically, pharmacological innovations, the rising demand for coordinated mental and physical health services and the changing preferences as it relates to access to care models. And through our proven framework, we're able to drive attractive sustained growth by delivering differentiated value within our portfolio of integrated, coordinated and point solutions, continuing to work to partner and innovate and working to expand our addressable markets. As a result, we're off to a strong start in 2021 with strong fundamental execution and the strategic and capital flexibility to further our momentum into the future. 
During the first quarter, Evernorth continued to build on its differentiated and steady performance it has had delivered throughout the pandemic by evolving the health care experience for our customers and clients through continuous innovation, and by building, investing and strengthening our strategic partnerships. For example, in January, we further expanded our partnership with Prime Therapeutics by leveraging our home delivery and Accredo specialty pharmacy to drive greater value and deliver on our promise to make health care more affordable. We're also advancing our strategic capabilities with our MDLIVE acquisition, which closed last month. This acquisition will expand Evernorth Care's ability to further broaden access, lower cost of care and strategically position us to grow in the rapidly changing access to care environment. 
At the same time, Evernorth Pharmacy is also driving affordability improvement. One example is our patient assurance program, which caps the cost of prescriptions for patients with diabetes. During the quarter, the number of patients in this program increased by 64% and the value to patients delivered from this program is on track to more than double what we achieved last year. 
Turning to our U.S. Medical platform. We see bright spots in growth in our U.S. commercial portfolio. For example, we continue to take share in the Select segment, which includes employers with 51 to 500 employees as clients continue to value our integrated, aligned, self-funded, medical, pharmacy, behavioral and stop-loss programs. And more broadly, we're driving value by bringing differentiated offerings to market, fueled by innovations and advancements we are accessing from our Evernorth capabilities, particularly in areas of pharmacy services and behavioral health. 
Through our willingness to strategically partner with innovative companies like Oscar, we're also well positioned to take advantage of market growth opportunities in the small employer market, a market we view is currently being underserved. As a result, we expect to see an uptick in growth in our U.S. commercial platform during the residual part of this year. 
Additionally, one important impact of the pandemic is that businesses have expanded access to support services for their employees. [ Backing ] is a trusted source of information and providing an extended range of benefits to support whole person health as more and more employers recognize the critical link between mental and physical health. 
In the wake of COVID-19, more employers are also recognizing the connection between healthy workers, higher productivity and a growing economy. In fact, the National Bureau of Economic Research found in the U.S., we benefited by $1.5 trillion of value by having employers play a major role in health care. This reinforces the critical role our U.S. health care business plays as an important partner to employers in providing access to quality, affordable care for the benefit of their employees. 
Turning to our U.S. Government business. We are driving strong year-over-year customer growth by continuing to expand our addressable markets. The number of Medicare Advantage customers increased by 11% year-over-year, reflecting the ongoing execution of our strategy as well as our sustained strong star performance. And the number of customers in our individual and family plan business grew by 17% year-over-year, driven by our geographic expansion and the introduction of new plans that provide expanded coverage for maintenance drugs to further improve affordability for customers with certain chronic conditions. 
And in our International Markets business, we are focused on actively supporting our coworkers, customers and partners around the world who continue to be impacted by COVID-19. For example, in India, our foundation is providing financial support through UNICEF to meet the critical needs on the ground, including additional rapid testing capabilities and expanded access to vaccines. And we're providing matching gifts from the Cigna Foundation to our coworkers who donate to charities in India. Staying true to our mission is not only the right thing to do, it reinforces to our clients, our customers and our patients, our commitment to make a difference in the moments that matter most. 
Our purpose-driven orientation, together with our strategic flexibility created by our service-based model and our capital-light framework that generates significant cash flow from operations, as well as our track record of strong financial performance, where we delivered a 15% adjusted EPS compounded growth rate over the last decade, all give us confidence we will continue to sustainably grow in both the short term and the long term in this dynamic environment. 
And now taking into account the strength of our first quarter results, we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be at least $20.20 in 2021. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver our long-term targets of average annual adjusted revenue growth of 6% to 8%; average annual adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 13%; and continue to play an attractive dividend while delivering cumulative operating cash flow growth of $50 billion through 2025. 
Now to briefly summarize. We delivered strong first quarter results by executing our growth framework, while harnessing our capital strength to deploy meaningful capital for the benefit of our shareholders, reinvesting in our business and leveraging our strategic flexibility to continue to innovate and adapt, all of which sets us up for sustained long-term success. We remain confident in our ability to continue to grow as we focus our efforts to make health care more affordable, predictable and simple each and every day. 
Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business, and I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highlights",1469,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business, and I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highlights for first quarter 2021 include adjusted revenue of $41 billion; adjusted earnings of $1.7 billion after tax; and adjusted earnings per share of $4.73. Results in the first quarter reflects strong top line growth with contributions across our businesses, and first quarter earnings came in somewhat ahead of our expectations. The favorable first quarter earnings were primarily driven by strong Evernorth performance, favorable net investment income and favorable prior year medical cost development, partially offset by nonrecurring operating expenses. Our results reflect our ability to deliver in a dynamic, rapidly evolving environment, including navigating the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. First quarter 2021 adjusted revenues grew to $30.6 billion, and adjusted pretax earnings grew to $1.2 billion. Evernorth's strong results in the quarter were driven by effective execution of supply chain initiatives, continued strong performance in Accredo, our industry-leading specialty pharmacy, and organic growth of our services with deepening partnerships, all while continuing to invest for ongoing growth. Our adjusted pharmacy script volume was $393 million during the quarter, a 9% increase over first quarter 2020. Overall, Evernorth continued its positive momentum and delivered another strong quarter of financial results. 
Turning to U.S. Medical. We entered the year expecting to see the majority of COVID-19 testing and treatment cost pressure in the U.S. Medical segment in the first half of 2021, particularly in the first quarter. As we progressed throughout the first quarter, we saw COVID-19 case counts and hospitalizations decline more rapidly than we originally anticipated. Additionally, as COVID-19 cases decelerated, we saw an increase in non-COVID utilization. Importantly, throughout all of this, we continue to see key components of preventive care utilize the pre-pandemic levels for our U.S. Commercial customers. Taken as a whole, and excluding prior year medical cost development, our first quarter medical care ratio was in line with our expectations. 
With that as context, I'll now comment specifically on first quarter financial results for the U.S. Medical segment. First quarter adjusted revenues were $10.4 billion, and adjusted pretax earnings were $987 million. Our first quarter U.S. Medical earnings were slightly ahead of our expectations, primarily driven by favorable net investment income and prior year medical cost development, partially offset by nonrecurring operating expenses. Excluding these onetime factors, our U.S. Medical earnings were in line with our expectations. 
Turning to membership. We ended the quarter with 16.7 million total medical customers, an increase of 30,000 customers sequentially. As expected, U.S. Commercial customer volume declined sequentially due to disenrollment throughout the first quarter, partially offset by new sales in the Select segment, and our U.S. Government businesses performed well throughout the annual open enrollment period. Overall, results for Cigna's U.S. Medical segment reflects strong fundamentals. 
In our International Markets business, first quarter adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion, and adjusted pretax earnings were $262 million, reflecting business growth, favorable net investment income and foreign currency movements offset by higher claims costs during the period. I would also note that a refinement to the accounting for acquisition costs led to a onetime favorable benefit in the first quarter of 2020 that did not recur in the current period. 
Corporate and other operations reflects a first quarter adjusted loss of $330 million. These results reflect lower interest expense due to lower levels of outstanding debt offset by the absence of contributions from the Group Disability and Life business, which was divested on December 31, 2020. 
Overall, as a result of strong execution in a dynamic environment, we continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders and strong financial results across our businesses. 
Now looking forward to our outlook for full year 2021. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect continued strong execution across our growth platforms, and we expect to make continued meaningful investments in our businesses that are responsive to the forces changing health care, positioning us for continued long-term growth. Taken as a whole, we are raising our prior guidance for full year 2021. We now expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $166 billion, representing growth of approximately 7% after adjusting for the divestiture of our Group Disability and Life business. 
We now expect full year 2021 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $7 billion or at least $20.20 per share. Within our outlook, we continue to expect a full year COVID-19-related headwind of approximately $1.25 per share, primarily within our U.S. Medical business. And we continue to project an expense ratio in the range of 7.5% to 8%. 
I'll now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we now expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.65 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of at least 5%. This outlook reflects ongoing investments in our Evernorth portfolio, including investments in Care Solutions and MDLIVE, as we continue to see significant opportunity to bring new innovative solutions to market. 
For U.S. Medical, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.8 billion. This outlook reflects focused execution in our businesses as we expect to drive organic customer growth and deepening of customer relationships. We expect direct COVID-19-related testing and treatment to decline throughout the balance of the year and also anticipate more normalized non-COVID utilization. And with the strength of the U.S. Medical first quarter results, we will further accelerate strategic investments to support future growth, thus leaving our full year earnings outlook for U.S. Medical unchanged. 
Regarding total medical customers, we now expect 2021 growth of at least 350,000 customers. This includes organic growth throughout the remainder of the year in our commercial business, led by the Middle Market and Select segments, partially offset by disenrollment in national accounts. We also expect Medicare Advantage customer growth in our target average annual growth range of 10% to 15%, and we expect continued growth in our individual business. 
Turning to medical costs. We continue to expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 81% to 82%, reflecting the impacts in 2021 of elevated medical costs, including the impact of direct COVID-19-related costs and more normalized non-COVID utilization and the repeal of the health insurance tax effective for 2021, all while we continue to deliver strong clinical quality and overall affordability for our clients and customers. We also expect continued growth and strong margins in International Markets. 
All in, for full year 2021, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $7 billion or at least $20.20 per share. Overall, these expected results reflect the differentiated value, strength and strategic positioning of our businesses as we deliver growth while navigating the impacts associated with COVID-19. 
Now moving to our 2021 capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to drive exceptional cash flow with strong returns on capital, even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. For 2021, we continue to expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses. 
During the quarter, we met our previously stated share repurchase expectations. And year-to-date, as of May 6, 2021, we have repurchased 14.4 million shares for $3.2 billion. And we now expect full year 2021 weighted average shares of 346 million to 348 million shares. We ended first quarter 2021 with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 39.9%, in line with our long-term target of approximately 40%. We had $2.5 billion of cash available to parent at the end of the quarter. And on April 28, we declared a $1 per share dividend payable on June 23 to shareholders of record as of June 8. 
Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. 
So now to recap. Results in the first quarter reflect strong top line growth with contributions across our businesses and first quarter earnings came in somewhat ahead of our expectations. These favorable first quarter earnings were primarily driven by strong Evernorth performance, favorable net investment income and favorable prior year medical cost development, partially offset by nonrecurring operating expenses. Our strong results give us confidence in our increased outlook for full year 2021, all while continuing to support our customers, clients and coworkers. As such, we now expect 2021 full year adjusted EPS of at least $20.20 per share and have continued confidence in our long-term growth targets. 
And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

So thanks for the question. And yes, we're really pleased with the strong start to the year in Evernorth, which, as I mentioned in my comments, gives us the confidence to increase the full year guidance to at least $5.65 billion of operating income. Quarter-to-quarter, there will be some level of variability in this segment. So I would encourage you not to overreact to the singular quarter that we had here. But certainly pleased with 13% quarter-over-quarter earnings growth. 
I would remind you that our Prime Therapeutics partnership launched April 1, 2020. So the base period last year in the first quarter did not have contributions from Prime Therapeutics. So that was a bit of a benefit to this quarter that will not recur to the same degree for the balance of the year. So to your point, on the operating income growth appearing to slow to some degree later in the year. That's one contribution that you should keep in mind. 
Additionally, we continue to invest aggressively in Evernorth to expand and diversify the suite of solutions in that portfolio. So as you think about care solutions, benefits management insights, we will make continued organic, and on a targeted basis, inorganic investments to continue to expand that portfolio, which will increase SG&A, and to some degree, temper the income growth for the balance of the year.

So maybe let me unpack the U.S. Medical nonrecurring items a little bit. This might speak to the core of your question a little bit. As I mentioned in my comments, overall, our U.S. Medical earnings in the quarter were above our expectations. But when you remove the effect of the 3 nonrecurring items, we were in line with our expectations. So the 3 nonrecurring items that I cited, we had some favorability in the quarter in net investment income. We had some favorability in the quarter in prior year medical cost development, and that was offset by nonrecurring operating expenses. 
And so to the core of your question, the nonrecurring operating expenses, you can think of as litigation-oriented matters associated with operations from several years ago. So these are not related to current time periods. These are unrelated to Anthem. These are matters from several years ago, but they're related to operations. And as a result of that, we chose to book them through SG&A as opposed to considering them as a special item below the line or anything like that. They were appropriate in our eyes to book through SG&A above the line. And order of magnitude, you can think of that as approximately offsetting the favorable benefit that we had from net investment income in the quarter within U.S. Medical. But those are truly nonrecurring items since they're related to periods from several years ago, and those matters should now be closed."

Let me just frame the medical cost for a moment and then ask Brian to talk a little bit more about our framework and our expectations for the year. And then I'll come back and address the Medicaid divestiture and our Medicaid direction",292,"Justin, it's David. Let me just frame the medical cost for a moment and then ask Brian to talk a little bit more about our framework and our expectations for the year. And then I'll come back and address the Medicaid divestiture and our Medicaid direction more broadly. First, from a medical cost standpoint, big picture, we're pleased with the start to the year. Big picture, broadly speaking, we're pleased at the start to the year. And I just want to underscore a couple of components. One, our organization works tirelessly to try to drive elevated utilization of certain services like preventative care services. And importantly, we saw in the first quarter the use of preventative care services like mammographies, colonoscopies, childhood immunization, cervical cancer screenings to be at an approximate level of pre-pandemic levels. That's a tremendous result, offsetting what might have been a dampening to utilization. The national data we see more broadly is that utilization of those preventative care services is at a more dampened rate, but ours is an elevated or more consistent rate from that standpoint, which is quite important. 
Secondly, I would just remind you that, and I'll tie this back in our Medicaid comment a little later, is that we have a de minimis amount of Medicaid within our portfolio, and our national data suggests to our services business, though our [indiscernible] services business that in the first quarter, Medicaid medical costs were a bit more dampened year-over-year in the first quarter of 2021. that's not an effect on our portfolio, but we can see that in the services that we're providing. And I'll ask Brian to give you a little bit more color forward-looking in the year, then I'll come back and address Medicaid."

So just a few other comments on the quarter and the balance of the year. Overall, as I mentioned in my comments, the U.S. Medical MCR was in line with our expectations for the first quarter when you exclude the benefit of PYD or prior year development. When you include the benefit of prior year development, we're actually a little bit favorable in the first quarter. And that was at an elevated level, as we expected, when we stepped into the year. For the balance of the year, we expect a deceleration in COVID-19 testing and treatment costs. We expect an uptick in non-COVID-related utilization in quarters 2 through 4 with those factors roughly offsetting one another. And so when we constructed our full year outlook of an 81% to 82% medical care ratio, we've stressed tested a variety of scenarios about -- associated with those 2 levers and are quite confident in our ability to achieve the full year 81% to 82% medical care ratio for U.S. Medical.

So number one, it was -- we had 1 of 1. So it was one-off within our portfolio. It has a de minimis impact on our P&L at the enterprise level. So putting that aside, we determined it was best for that business to be served by an expert or a specialist, and we're pleased to effectuate and seek to close a successful transition to Molina. We think that's beneficial to the customers being served and our coworkers in that business. Looking forward, we continue to see Medicaid and government services, first and foremost, as an attractive growth opportunity within our Evernorth service portfolio, whether it's Evernorth Pharmacy, Evernorth Care, Evernorth Benefit, Evernorth Intelligence, the opportunity to bring expanded services largely through health plans today in support of Medicaid will be a growing organic part of our portfolio. Over time, we see opportunities that will manifest themselves state-by-state on state-specific service relationships against Evernorth. 
And then finally, as you recall from our Investor Day conversation within our M&A priority, we continue to have expansion of our U.S. government programs as an M&A priority.

So specific MDLIVE, first, important to reference the fact that we had a multiyear relationship with MDLIVE, both partnering to consume the services, but also through our very successful multiyear Cigna Ventures organization. So we start from a learned, shared experience and even deeper collaboration during the COVID environment. 
Specific to the asset and the direction, As we discussed at our Investor Day, we see a rapid expansion of what we call alternative side of care to be 1 of the 3 major trends as we look forward over the next 5 to 10 years. This is an important part of those building blocks and it's an important part of our Evernorth Care portfolio of capabilities. We see it as much greater than telemed or even basic virtual care triaging. We see the ability to obviously expand virtual care, primary care, behavioral care. We see the ability to expand that further in terms of longitudinal chronic care programs, polychronic and ultimately complex care programs and capabilities. So it provides us an accelerant to our strategic direction with a known partner that will now be part of the overall Cigna portfolio. And we're excited because net-net, it drives improved service, improved access, improved affordability with strong clinical outcomes for the benefit of our consumers. So truly an aggregate win-win in the portfolio. 
Specific to the digital formulary, that innovation continues to be somewhat unique in the marketplace. Our clients really appreciate the approach relative to the digital formulary, helping to essentially curate and apply externally validated expertise to the vast array of digital alternatives that exist in the ecosystem to help to provide employers more informed decisions for those that may have the greatest outcome and impact for the benefit of the customer. So I view that as a part of our consultative approach in terms of providing support and a part of our approach to, in this case, partner and curate additional services on a go-forward basis. 
Taken as a whole, we see, again, our Evernorth Care capabilities as an exciting part of the broader Evernorth growth capabilities, and we see the ability to do that in a complementary nature with our proven value-based care relationships within our Cigna portfolio as well. I hope that helps, George."

So relative to the selling season, looking to 2022, your question goes at the commercial side as well as the services side of the business. First, on the commercial side of the portfolio, at this stage of the year, we're typically looking at the national accounts environment and remind you that we define national accounts for our U.S. Commercial portfolio a little bit more narrowly than some in the market. So it's commercial employers, 5,000 or more employees who are multistate in nature. As we look to 2022, right now, we see an environment where the RFP volume, so the opportunity to pursue new business, is up somewhat. I think order of magnitude 10%. And we see the portion of our book of business that's out to bid is being up marginally, less than that 10% number. So that's a little bit of framing. We have some early traction, some early wins that exist in our portfolio. And as we sit here at this stage of the environment, we're optimistic that we'll have a very good commercial outlook in aggregate for our portfolio as we look to 2022. 
I'll bridge with the trend comment, and then I'll come to the Evernorth portfolio. Clearly, affordability remains a top decision criteria for commercial employers. There's no doubt about that. We spent ample time on that at our Investor Day, and it remains a tough strategic imperative. Further beyond that is the flexibility necessary and then the innovation required to truly integrate or coordinate mental and physical health programs, and then expand and coordinate access to care in a less fragmented way through alternative side of care framework, et cetera. So we see the trends being well lined up to our direction. 
As it relates to within Evernorth and specific to your question within pharmacy services, as you recall, we have now multiple years of very attractive growth under our belt as a combined organization, and we're pleased with that. As we look to 2022, we have an environment where, to date, our employer renewal process is manifesting itself quite strongly. And our health plan renewal process is manifesting itself strongly beyond the 2 known losses that we previously discussed relative to the health plan business. Taken as a whole, we'd expect the retention in that business as we sit here right now to be a bit less than our recent couple of years, which have been historic highs, in the upper 90s. We'll expect it to be more in the mid-90s at a consistent rate. And then taken as a whole, we will expect to see both revenue and earnings growth in our Evernorth portfolio in 2022. So both pointing in a positive direction would be the summary I would leave you with."

So a few thoughts on your question. I appreciate the framing of it. Broadly in the quarter, as I said earlier, the MCR for U.S. Medical was in line with our expectations when you exclude the favorable benefit from prior year development. Now the components within were a little bit different than we anticipated. So to your point, the COVID-19 testing and treatment burden on our book was a little bit lower than we anticipated for the quarter. However, non-COVID utilization was a little bit higher than we anticipated coming into the quarter. So the net effect of those 2 factors led to the U.S. Medical MCR being back in line with where we expected it to be. 
And as we trend out the balance of the year, we continue to expect that phenomenon to proceed, meaning deceleration in COVID-19 testing and treatment costs and a little bit of an uptick in non-COVID-related utilization. So to your point, we expect about 50% of the EPS headwind associated with COVID-19 $1.25 to continue to show up in the U.S. Medical MCR. And bridging over into 2022, we continue to anticipate about half of that $1.25 or a little bit over half of that to return in the form of earnings in our 2022 enterprise portfolio. And as such, we would expect that our long-term annual growth rate in EPS of 10% to 13%, we would expect to achieve a result that's at or above the high end of that range relative to our updated guidance of at least $20.20 per share."

Second, do you believe that you need to buy or continue to build out something around behavioral health?

So number one, bigger picture framing, I appreciate that you brought MDLIVE, Ginger together, for example. We do not believe that this is a one-and-done type activity. So we don't believe that the corporation secures itself a virtual care asset, and then they're squared for the alternative delivery space. This is a fluid environment. It's a dynamic environment. And it's a environment that has massive promise relative to bringing expanded access, coordination of services and improved overall value coming back to the affordability. Our organic capabilities, our strong MDLIVE asset advances that massively. But as Brian noted in his prior comments as well, we continue to invest in the space. So I want you to view that we view it as a dynamic and fluid space, and we very much like our positioning. 
Two is, just like in the, we'll call it, the traditional care delivery space, the coordination of physical and mental health is mission-critical. Just because it's in a virtual care environment doesn't mean that the coordination or the leverage opportunity there is not as critical. And in fact, the virtual capabilities allow us to take fragmentation out of the system more aggressively and more comprehensively. 
To your affordability comment, unequivocally, we see an ability to further improve affordability through alternative site of care and through our virtual capabilities. You may recall from Investor Day, we identified alternative site of care or site of care leverage as a meaningful opportunity to further deflect or improve overall affordability. And an example may be we see already in our virtual care delivery less use of unnecessary or redundant diagnostic services. That's a tangible illustration of an improvement in affordability. Conversely, we see opportunities to even further close gaps in care or increase utilization of the right services like maintenance medications through the dynamic, more intimate, ongoing interaction with customers or patients from that standpoint. 
So my points are threefold: one, continuation of investment here in innovation off of a very strong base; two, a continued need to use the capabilities to close fragmentation within the system or get more complementary leverage, most notably between the medical health and the mental health capabilities; and three, unequivocally a contributor to further improve affordability."

Just have you recall, we entered the exchanges in the first year, and we've sustained engagement in the exchanges since its inception. We've innovated within the exchanges.

And we're pleased with the results, both the base results in the individual exchange as well as, thus far, our early look at the additional enrollment we're seeing because of the expanded SEP. And I'll ask Brian just to give you a little color relative to that dimension. 
As it relates to the small employer marketplace, as you know, we Cigna historically have not played in the small employer marketplace, but we've focused above 51 lives or above 100 lives depending on the regulation more broadly. We have continued to view it as an underserved market, a market that has had more traditional or rigidly designed programs, less innovation and less flexibility and less leverage of more modern specialty and clinical services. And our determination was it was best to pursue that market in partnership, leveraging our partnership DNA, and we've entered that market successfully with our partnership with Oscar. We're really early in that journey. Some positive indicators for sure or early in the journey. Our early indicators are positive, though that has us accelerating our geographies and in collaboration with Oscar, and again, back to -- in partnership with our health care delivery partners.

You should think of the majority of that increase coming from the Evernorth segment. But importantly, we're also seeing strength within U.S. Medical. So I would think of most of it from Evernorth and a bit of an uptick in U.S. Medical as well. David, back to you on the inflation question."

First, through the core visibility of our business, and then more broadly for those we serve. Thus far, within our business, we do not see a large trajectory change relative to what I would call cost of goods sold inflationary pressure. There's always some, make no doubt about it. There is always some. But through ongoing innovation, ongoing productivity, ongoing value-based collaboration, broadly speaking, I would not cause a, call it, large sea change from that standpoint. Beyond that, in the broader economy, whether we look at it through a U.S. lens or pockets of the markets outside the United States, there's clearly a warming up. There's an indisputable warming up of the economy, and there's a clearly warming up of inflationary indicators, but none of which have triggered across a threshold to suggest to any one industry, save for some unique outliers, any kind of orange going to red threshold levels of inflation. But the robustness of the economy and some of the underlying cost drivers in some subsectors are clearly beginning to elevate and I think have a lot of industry leaders watching to ensure that any movement in curves -- any movement in cost curves could be anticipated, either eradicated through pricing actions like CPG companies that are being intensely discussed, cost pressures in some subsectors of the technology ecosystem where the chip industry is out of pattern relative to supply and demand from that standpoint. But broadly speaking, I would say, again, nothing affecting our space over the immediate-term horizon from an inflationary standpoint."

I know that I'm asking about 2023, and I know that's a light year away, but my question really is Medicare Advantage benefited from the lower expenses in 2020. I'm wondering how you think that's going to roll through the rate calculation. Because, right now, CMS has 2020 down 8% per capita and then increasing about 11% in this year and in next year. And so I guess my question is, do you think that kind of trajectory is likely for medical costs? And then if you can comment on it, how you think that might work into the 2023 rate."

Thoughtful, but nonetheless complex. I think as you -- as I take your question and process your question, if you look at the 2020 to 2021 environment, clearly, the posture of CMS recognize the COVID dislocation, recognize that dislocation's, for example, implication on risk adjusters sought to, in their own methodology, seek to provide some offset to that relative to their rate cutting environment as well as our guidance relative to delivery system reimbursement and set themselves up for what I would say is a pretty fluid and complex environment over the ensuing couple of years ahead. So I would expect the next couple of year cycle to be a little nontraditional from that standpoint, given the need to adjust the various moving parts that result in a net rate setting environment. History would tell us that the result of all of the above, plus or minus 1 point or 2, largely gets the program to a balanced sustainable outcome. And looking forward, I would expect that because the Medicare Advantage program continues to deliver outstanding value, as you know, for seniors. Hence, the tremendous support from a senior standpoint as well as overall clinical quality and affordability of which through the bonus programs and the reimbursement programs, the federal government's budget actually benefits from. So I would expect it to be able to be balanced through that, but a little bit more lumpy than it has been in the past. And I think this year's risk adjuster true-ups will be really mission-critical in terms of how CMS sees the industry recapturing a little bit more of the information that they deem necessary to get the risk adjusters. And then they'll factor that into the forward-looking 2023 rate environment. 
Stay tuned for more."

But now that you're starting to have this data, as individuals are starting to come back for preventive care testing, are you seeing any changes in acuity? That's one.

On your first question, to be very clear, we have seen consistent strong utilization of preventative care services. And notably, what I called out is, for example, in the first quarter of 2021, broadly speaking, preventative care services, inclusive of mammographies, colonoscopies, childhood immunization, cervical cancer screening, plus or minus in the commercial portfolio business approximate pre-pandemic levels. We think that's a very good thing. I mean, underscore, it's a very good thing and something that our team has worked tirelessly to try to effectuate elevating those levels. We see that performance against a national data set that suggests the utilization of those preventative care services are down versus pre-pandemic levels, 10% to 15%. But for our book of business, they are not. As a predictor then to the future, we see that as a mitigant for an elevation of acuity. All other things remain equal because you're consistently identifying an earlier stage through the preventative diagnostics or the preventative services. Equally as important, as I noted in my prepared remarks, are, for example, within our Evernorth portfolio and within our Evernorth Pharmacy portfolio for those customers being served by our mail order, we've actually seen get even further elevation of medication adherence. That's really important for the chronic population to avoid spikes in acuity moving forward, whether it's for diabetic, COPD, asthmatic or other patients from that standpoint. 
So broadly speaking, we're working tirelessly to get the right clinical quality and services to be consumed and supported with the clinical resources we have to avert spikes in acuity going forward. And therefore, we don't expect a large spike in acuity on a look-forward basis given the strong preventative or medication compliance. 
As it relates to your M&A question, there's not a simple way to answer your question. Importantly, though, to frame, we look at all either growth or expansion of capability opportunities through buy-build-align frameworks. We relentlessly go through a buy-build-align frameworks. So for example, today, within our Evernorth benefit portfolio, we're organically building out additional post-acute care capabilities after evaluating, buying, further partnering or in-sourcing those capabilities. We typically will look at that through a right-to-win strategic positioning and an economic framework. So you look at it through a variety of frameworks. It's not a simple economic hurdle rate. Your question didn't infer that it was a single measure, but it's not a single economic hurdle rate. It's through a right-to-win size and trajectory of the market, the resources with which to pursue, whether it's organic build, collaboration through a partnership or from an acquisitive standpoint. And obviously, certain economic hurdle rates come into play, which we don't discuss publicly. Those are proprietary, but you would imagine we're quite disciplined in terms of our return to capital thresholds. Ricky, hope that helps."

But unequivocally, there are some pockets of deflation there in line with our expectations. As it relates to the supply chain activity, I would ask you just to continue to think about supply chain initiatives as being an inherent strength within the overall portfolio through a variety of lenders, whether it's collaboration on the medical side of the equation, the traditional supply chain activity, the value-based supply chain activity, et cetera. And we have a continuous drive to improve value, albeit to partner as we go through the process. And as we get into some more of the complex dimensions of the higher-cost drugs and medications, we think there's further opportunity through the supply chain activity around value-based care relationships, aligned incentive relationships more specifically with the manufacturers and with ourselves on a go-forward basis. So I wouldn't call out any unique driver. More importantly, it's a continuous improvement part of our portfolio, and it's an underlying strength of our portfolio.

To the second part of your question, very thoughtful framework and appreciate it. If we come back and think about, first and foremost, our ability to further improve affordability, you may recall at our Investor Day, we talked about 4 major ways in which we further improve affordability off of our strong overall cost environment today. One is to further increase the percentage of utilization that takes place in the highest performing clinical settings, be they physicians or facilities. Second is to work to reduce the cost of drugs further. Third is to effectively leverage alternative sites of care. For example, the difference between AV replacement that is inpatient versus outpatient is about 1/3 less in cost, and we see a massive shift at the physical side of care, it's similar in virtual side of care. And then fourth, the ability to further coordinate the fragmented system, specifically in the areas of medical and behavioral. 
So back to your question, our evolution of our telemedicine and virtual care capability present opportunities to contribute to a variety of these areas to help to support individual customers or patients accessing higher-cost health care specialists or delivery system partners, helping to drive further leverage relative to the pharmaceutical equation in terms of medication compliance or alternative lower-cost medications and the ability to merge or coordinate services, be they behavioral and pharmacy behavioral and medical by being in that quarterback position with a customer patient from that standpoint. So we see it as being complementary to a variety of those initiatives, and we see it being both complementary to your first question, proprietary driving on our own and in collaboration as a panel extender for high-performing health care professional partners."

In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's first quarter 2021 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2021. As noted in our earnings release, we're describing our financial results. Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. 
A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders' net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. 
In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2021 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. 
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the first quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item charge of $101 million or $0.29 per share related to debt extinguishment costs incurred during the period as well as an after-tax special item charge of $22 million or $0.06 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. 
We also recorded an after-tax special item benefit of $21 million or $0.06 per share related to charges associated with litigation matters. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. 
As previously noted, as a result of the sale of the Group Disability and Life business, in our first quarter earnings release and quarterly financial supplement, corporate and other operations combines the results previously reported as corporate and the segment previously reported as Group Disability and Other. In our securities filings, the segment previously reported as Group Disability and Other is now reported as Other Operations. 
Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2021 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2021 dividend and excludes the impact of any business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today, such as our recently announced planned divestiture of the Texas Medicaid business, which we expect to close in the second half of 2021. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today. At today's we meet, our environment remains highly dynamic, with COVID-19 continuing to affect the world, our industry and our economy. At Cigna, this rapidly changing landscape has only reinforced the tremendous responsibility we have to improve the health, well-being and peace of mind of those we serve. This remains the primary focus that drives our 70,000 coworkers each and every day, and it's the reason we work to continue to deliver for our customers, clients, patients, partners and our communities, all while delivering strong financial results for you, our shareholders. 
During the first quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $41 billion, and adjusted EPS of $4.73 per share. We also deployed significant capital to our investors through share repurchase and the payment of a meaningful quarterly dividend, reinforcing the strength of our capital-light framework. 
Building out a conversation from several weeks ago at our Investor Day, today, I'm going to talk more about how we are continuing to navigate through the current environment to balance and meet the needs of all of our stakeholders, our ability to consistently deliver strong results by executing on our growth framework and the confidence we have in achieving our increased outlook by delivering differentiated and sustained growth for the long term. Then Brian will share more details about our first quarter results and our 2021 outlook. And after that, we'll take your questions. 
Since we last met at our Investor Day in March, the macro landscape remains fluid. In the U.S., proposed legislation as well as regulation and executive actions seek to expand, extend and further support both public and private programs. Globally, social and political tensions remain high as COVID-19 with its multiple variants continue to take a toll on a number of countries such as India, where cases have again dramatically spiked. All of these forces are shaping health care and influencing the political and economic landscape around the world. 
At Cigna, we are navigating through this environment by continuing to innovate for and support our stakeholders with COVID-19 services, while also executing on our strategy to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple. For U.S. commercial customers, we are ensuring to get the preventative care they need, including mammographies, colonoscopies, cervical cancer screenings and child immunizations, which today are consistent with pre-pandemic levels, reflecting the continued strength of our clinical programs and proven engagement capabilities. 
Within Evernorth, for those customers served by Express Scripts home delivery, we delivered further improvements in medication adherence for people with diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. At the same time, we're also supporting the mental well-being of our customers. We are doing this through our own best-in-class capabilities where, for example, we engage with oncology patients with comorbidities by spending an average of $2,000 on their behavioral health care. We can save an average of $20,000 in avoidable costs. And we continue to innovate and leverage our strategic partnerships, including, for example, with Ginger through Cigna Ventures, which provides industry-leading on-demand, 24/7 behavioral health coaching, further extending our behavioral health access for the benefit of our customers. 
We're also leveraging data and actionable intelligence to understand the most common long-term complication of COVID-19 infections, then building predictive models to determine who is at greatest risk of becoming a COVID long-hauler, so we can quickly provide targeted case management and behavioral health services as well as other resources to help our customers regain their health. 
For our clients, we are serving as a trusted partner by supplying additional physical and behavior health assistance to aid in the recovery for employees who are infected by COVID-19. We're helping employers build their own communities of immunity by assisting them in launching vaccination clinics. And we're leveraging our data and analytics to help employers determine when and how it is safe for employees to return to work. 
For our provider partners, we're working to guide people to the most effective sites of care and further closing gaps in care with our clinical teams and our virtual capabilities. 
For our coworkers, we're supporting them in this highly disruptive environment by, for example, providing a $200 incentive for coworkers who choose to become vaccinated for COVID-19 and continuing to offer expanded leave capabilities with our emergency time-off program to provide flexibility necessitated by the current conditions. 
And finally, for our communities, we're taking steps to address social determinants of health. For example, we all know the alarming statistics on the disproportionate impact that COVID-19 has had on communities of color. As part of our S.A.F.E. initiative, we brought additional underground resources to target communities by launching COVID-19 awareness campaigns, distributing PP&E kits, dispatching our health improvement mobile resources to help to administer free flu shots and provide healthy meal as well as other support. 
Similarly, we're leaning into fight breast cancer with disparities, for example, well, amongst black women remain startling. To help to address this disparity gap, we again went directly into communities, starting in Tennessee, for example, where we collaborated with local partners to offer mobile mammography vans at churches and at other local neighborhood locations. 
At Cigna, balancing the needs of our stakeholders is deeply rooted in our corporate purpose. We constantly challenge ourselves by asking the basic question, what more could we do? To help us stay focused on delivering each and every day for the benefit of our customers, our clients, patients and our partners. Against this backdrop, the strength of our foundation propels us forward and guides our growth. 
As we shared with you at our Investor Day, through our 3 growth platforms, Evernorth, U.S. Medical and international markets. We are well positioned to leverage the 3 trends we see shaping health care into the future. Specifically, pharmacological innovations, the rising demand for coordinated mental and physical health services and the changing preferences as it relates to access to care models. And through our proven framework, we're able to drive attractive sustained growth by delivering differentiated value within our portfolio of integrated, coordinated and point solutions, continuing to work to partner and innovate and working to expand our addressable markets. As a result, we're off to a strong start in 2021 with strong fundamental execution and the strategic and capital flexibility to further our momentum into the future. 
During the first quarter, Evernorth continued to build on its differentiated and steady performance it has had delivered throughout the pandemic by evolving the health care experience for our customers and clients through continuous innovation, and by building, investing and strengthening our strategic partnerships. For example, in January, we further expanded our partnership with Prime Therapeutics by leveraging our home delivery and Accredo specialty pharmacy to drive greater value and deliver on our promise to make health care more affordable. 
We're also advancing our strategic capabilities with our MDLIVE acquisition, which closed last month. This acquisition will expand Evernorth care's ability to further broaden access, lower cost of care and strategically position us to grow in the rapidly changing access to care environment. 
At the same time, Evernorth pharmacy is also driving affordability improvement. One example is our patient assurance program, which caps the cost of prescriptions for patients with diabetes. During the quarter, the number of patients in this program increased by 64% and the value to patients delivered from this program is on track to more than double what we achieved last year. 
Turning to our U.S. Medical platform. We see bright spots in growth in our U.S. Commercial portfolio. For example, we continue to take share in the Select segment, which includes employers with 51 to 500 employees. As clients continue to value our integrated, aligned, self-funded, medical, pharmacy, behavioral and stop-loss programs. And more broadly, we're driving value by bringing differentiated offerings to market, fueled by innovations and advancements we are accessing from our Evernorth capabilities, particularly in areas of pharmacy services and behavioral health. 
Through our willingness to strategically partner with innovative companies like Oscar, we're also well positioned to take advantage of market growth opportunities in the small employer market, a market we view is currently being underserved. As a result, we expect to see an uptick in growth in our U.S. commercial platform during the residual part of this year. 
Additionally, one important impact of the pandemic is that businesses have expanded access to support services for their employees. [ Backing ] is a trusted source of information and providing an extended range of benefits to support whole person health as more and more employers recognize the critical link between mental and physical health. 
In the wake of COVID-19, more employers are also recognizing the connection between healthy workers, higher productivity and a growing economy. In fact, the National Bureau of Economic Research found in the U.S., we benefited by $1.5 trillion of value by having employers play a major role in health care. This reinforces the critical role our U.S. health care business plays as an important partner to employers in providing access to quality, affordable care for the benefit of their employees. 
Turning to our U.S. Government business. We are driving strong year-over-year customer growth by continuing to expand our addressable markets. The number of Medicare Advantage customers increased by 11% year-over-year, reflecting the ongoing execution of our strategy as well as our sustained strong star performance. And the number of customers in our individual and family plan business grew by 17% year-over-year, driven by our geographic expansion and the introduction of new plans that provide expanded coverage for maintenance drugs to further improve affordability for customers with certain chronic conditions. 
And in our International Markets business, we are focused on actively supporting our coworkers, customers and partners around the world who continue to be impacted by COVID-19. For example, in India, our foundation is providing financial support through UNICEF to meet the critical needs on the ground, including additional rapid testing capabilities and expanded access to vaccines. And we're providing matching gifts from the Cigna Foundation to our coworkers who donate to charities in India. Staying true to our mission is not only the right thing to do, it reinforces to our clients, our customers and our patients, our commitment to make a difference in the moments that matter most. 
Our purpose-driven orientation, together with our strategic flexibility created by our service-based model and our capital-light framework that generates significant cash flow from operations as well as our track record of strong financial performance, where we delivered a 15% adjusted EPS compounded growth rate over the last decade, all give us confidence we will continue to sustainably grow in both the short term and the long term in this dynamic environment. 
And now taking into account the strength of our first quarter results, we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be at least $20.20 in 2021. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver our long-term targets of average annual adjusted revenue growth of 6% to 8%; average annual adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 13%; and continue to play an attractive dividend while delivering cumulative operating cash flow growth of $50 billion through 2025. 
Now to briefly summarize. We delivered strong first quarter results by executing our growth framework, while harnessing our capital strength to deploy meaningful capital for the benefit of our shareholders, reinvesting in our business and leveraging our strategic flexibility to continue to innovate and adapt, all of which sets us up for sustained long-term success. We remain confident in our ability to continue to grow as we focus our efforts to make health care more affordable, predictable and simple each and every day. 
Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business, and I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highligh",1469,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business, and I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. 
Key consolidated financial highlights for first quarter 2021 include adjusted revenue of $41 billion; adjusted earnings of $1.7 billion after tax; and adjusted earnings per share of $4.73. Results in the first quarter reflects strong top line growth with contributions across our businesses, and first quarter earnings came in somewhat ahead of our expectations. The favorable first quarter earnings were primarily driven by strong Evernorth performance, favorable net investment income and favorable prior year medical cost development, partially offset by nonrecurring operating expenses. Our results reflect our ability to deliver in a dynamic, rapidly evolving environment, including navigating the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. First quarter 2021 adjusted revenues grew to $30.6 billion, and adjusted pretax earnings grew to $1.2 billion. Evernorth's strong results in the quarter were driven by effective execution of supply chain initiatives, continued strong performance in Accredo, our industry-leading specialty pharmacy, and organic growth of our services with deepening partnerships, all while continuing to invest for ongoing growth. 
Our adjusted pharmacy script volume was $393 million during the quarter, a 9% increase over first quarter 2020. Overall, Evernorth continued its positive momentum and delivered another strong quarter of financial results. 
Turning to U.S. Medical. We entered the year expecting to see the majority of COVID-19 testing and treatment cost pressure in the U.S. Medical segment in the first half of 2021, particularly in the first quarter. As we progressed throughout the first quarter, we saw COVID-19 case counts and hospitalizations decline more rapidly than we originally anticipated. Additionally, as COVID-19 cases decelerated, we saw an increase in non-COVID utilization. Importantly, throughout all of this, we continue to see key components of preventive care, utilize the pre-pandemic levels for our U.S. Commercial customers. Taken as a whole, and excluding prior year medical cost development, our first quarter medical care ratio was in line with our expectations. 
With that as context, I'll now comment specifically on first quarter financial results for the U.S. Medical segment. First quarter adjusted revenues were $10.4 billion, and adjusted pretax earnings were $987 million. Our first quarter U.S. Medical earnings were slightly ahead of our expectations, primarily driven by favorable net investment income and prior year medical cost development, partially offset by nonrecurring operating expenses. Excluding these onetime factors, our U.S. Medical earnings were in line with our expectations. 
Turning to membership. We ended the quarter with 16.7 million total medical customers, an increase of 30,000 customers sequentially. As expected, U.S. Commercial customer volume declined sequentially due to disenrollment throughout the first quarter, partially offset by new sales in the Select segment, and our U.S. Government businesses performed well throughout the annual open enrollment periods. Overall, results for Cigna's U.S. Medical segment reflects strong fundamentals. 
In our International Markets business, first quarter adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion, and adjusted pretax earnings were $262 million, reflecting business growth, favorable net investment income and foreign currency movements offset by higher claims costs during the period. I would also note that a refinement to the accounting for acquisition costs led to a onetime favorable benefit in the first quarter of 2020 that did not recur in the current period. 
Corporate and other operations reflects a first quarter adjusted loss of $330 million. These results reflect lower interest expense due to lower levels of outstanding debt offset by the absence of contributions from the Group Disability and Life business, which was divested on December 31, 2020. 
Overall, as a result of strong execution in a dynamic environment, we continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders and strong financial results across our businesses. 
Now looking forward to our outlook for full year 2021. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect continued strong execution across our growth platforms, and we expect to make continued meaningful investments in our businesses that are responsive to the forces changing health care, positioning us for continued long-term growth. Taken as a whole, we are raising our prior guidance for full year 2021. We now expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $166 billion, representing growth of approximately 7% after adjusting for the divestiture of our Group Disability and Life business. 
We now expect full year 2021 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $7 billion or at least $20.20 per share. Within our outlook, we continue to expect a full year COVID-19-related headwind of approximately $1.25 per share, primarily within our U.S. Medical business. And we continue to project an expense ratio in the range of 7.5% to 8%. 
I'll now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we now expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.65 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of at least 5%. This outlook reflects ongoing investments in our Evernorth portfolio, including investments in care solutions and MDLIVE, as we continue to see significant opportunity to bring new innovative solutions to market. 
For U.S. Medical, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.8 billion. This outlook reflects focused execution in our businesses as we expect to drive organic customer growth and deepening of customer relationships. We expect direct COVID-19-related testing and treatment to decline throughout the balance of the year and also anticipate more normalized non-COVID utilization. And with the strength of the U.S. Medical first quarter results, we will further accelerate strategic investments to support future growth, thus leaving our full year earnings outlook for U.S. Medical unchanged. 
Regarding total medical customers, we now expect 2021 growth of at least 350,000 customers. This includes organic growth throughout the remainder of the year in our commercial business, led by the Middle Market and Select segments, partially offset by disenrollment in national accounts. We also expect Medicare Advantage customer growth in our target average annual growth range of 10% to 15%, and we expect continued growth in our individual business. 
Turning to medical costs. We continue to expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 81% to 82%, reflecting the impacts in 2021 of elevated medical costs, including the impact of direct COVID-19-related costs and more normalized non-COVID utilization and the repeal of the health insurance tax effective for 2021, all while we continue to deliver strong clinical quality and overall affordability for our clients and customers. We also expect continued growth and strong margins in International Markets. 
All in, for full year 2021, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $7 billion or at least $20.20 per share. Overall, these expected results reflect the differentiated value, strength and strategic positioning of our businesses as we deliver growth while navigating the impacts associated with COVID-19. 
Now moving to our 2021 capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to drive exceptional cash flow with strong returns on capital, even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. For 2021, we continue to expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses. 
During the quarter, we met our previously stated share repurchase expectations. And year-to-date, as of May 6, 2021, we have repurchased 14.4 million shares for $3.2 billion. And we now expect full year 2021 weighted average shares of 346 million to 348 million shares. We ended first quarter 2021 with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 39.9%, in line with our long-term target of approximately 40%. We had $2.5 billion of cash available to parent at the end of the quarter. And on April 28, we declared a $1 per share dividend payable on June 23 to shareholders of record as of June 8. 
Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. 
So now to recap. Results in the first quarter reflect strong top line growth with contributions across our businesses and first quarter earnings came in somewhat ahead of our expectations. These favorable first quarter earnings were primarily driven by strong Evernorth performance, favorable net investment income and favorable prior year medical cost development, partially offset by nonrecurring operating expenses. Our strong results give us confidence in our increased outlook for full year 2021, all while continuing to support our customers, clients and coworkers. As such, we now expect 2021 full year adjusted EPS of at least $20.20 per share and have continued confidence in our long-term growth targets. 
And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

So just wanted to see if there's anything you'd call out further within the PBM in the quarter? And then relatedly, if I look at the guidance from this point forward, it does seem to imply, for the remaining 3 quarters, kind of mid-single-digit growth -- income growth within the PBM.

So thanks for the question. And yes, we're really pleased with the strong start to the year in Evernorth, which, as I mentioned in my comments, gives us the confidence to increase the full year guidance to at least $5.65 billion of operating income. Quarter-to-quarter, there will be some level of variability in this segment. So I would encourage you not to overreact to the singular quarter that we had here. But certainly pleased with 13% quarter-over-quarter earnings growth. 
I would remind you that our Prime Therapeutics partnership launched April 1, 2020. So the base period last year in the first quarter did not have contributions from Prime Therapeutics. So that was a bit of a benefit to this quarter that will not recur to the same degree for the balance of the year. So to your point, on the operating income growth appearing to slow to some degree later in the year. That's one contribution that you should keep in mind. 
Additionally, we continue to invest aggressively in Evernorth to expand and diversify the suite of solutions in that portfolio. So as you think about care solutions, benefits management, insights, we will make continued organic, and on a targeted basis, inorganic investments to continue to expand that portfolio, which will increase SG&A, and to some degree, temper the income growth for the balance of the year.

So maybe let me unpack the U.S. Medical nonrecurring items a little bit. This might speak to the core of your question a little bit. As I mentioned in my comments, overall, our U.S. Medical earnings in the quarter were above our expectations. But when you remove the effect of the 3 nonrecurring items, we were in line with our expectations. So the 3 nonrecurring items that I cited, we had some favorability in the quarter in net investment income. We had some favorability in the quarter in prior year medical cost development, and that was offset by nonrecurring operating expenses.
And so to the core of your question, the nonrecurring operating expenses, you can think of as litigation-oriented matters associated with operations from several years ago. So these are not related to current time periods. These are unrelated to Anthem. These are matters from several years ago, but they're related to operations. And as a result of that, we chose to book them through SG&A as opposed to considering them as a special item below the line or anything like that. They were appropriate in our eyes to book through SG&A above the line. 
And order of magnitude, you can think of that as approximately offsetting the favorable benefit that we had from net investment income in the quarter within U.S. Medical. But those are truly nonrecurring items since they're related to periods from several years ago, and those matters should now be closed."

Let me just frame the medical cost for a moment and then ask Brian to talk a little bit more about our framework and our expectations for the year. And then I'll come back and address the Medicaid divestiture and our Medicaid direction more broadly. First, from a medical cost standpoint, big picture, we're pleased with the start to the year. Big picture, broadly speaking, we're pleased at the start to the year. And I just want to underscore a couple of components. 
One, our organization works tirelessly to try to drive elevated utilization of certain services like preventative care services. And importantly, we saw in the first quarter the use of preventative care services like mammographies, colonoscopies, childhood immunization, cervical cancer screenings to be at an approximate level of pre-pandemic levels. That's a tremendous result, offsetting what might have been a dampening to utilization. The national data we see more broadly is that utilization of those preventative care services is at a more dampened rate, but ours is an elevated or more consistent rate from that standpoint, which is quite important. 
Secondly, I would just remind you that, and I'll tie this back in our Medicaid comment a little later, is that we have a de minimis amount of Medicaid within our portfolio, and our national data suggests to our services business, though our Evernorth services business that in the first quarter, Medicaid medical costs were a bit more dampened year-over-year in the first quarter of 2021. That's not an effect on our portfolio, but we can see that in the services that we're providing. And I'll ask Brian to give you a little bit more color forward-looking in the year, then I'll come back and address Medicaid."

For the balance of the year, we expect a deceleration in COVID-19 testing and treatment costs. We expect an uptick in non-COVID-related utilization in quarters 2 through 4 with those factors roughly offsetting one another. And so when we constructed our full year outlook of an 81% to 82% medical care ratio, we've stressed tested a variety of scenarios about -- associated with those 2 levers and are quite confident in our ability to achieve the full year 81% to 82% medical care ratio for U.S. Medical.

So putting that aside, we determined it was best for that business to be served by an expert or a specialist, and we're pleased to effectuate and seek to close a successful transition to Molina. We think that's beneficial to the customers being served and our coworkers in that business. 
Looking forward, we continue to see Medicaid and government services, first and foremost, as an attractive growth opportunity within our Evernorth service portfolio, whether it's Evernorth pharmacy, Evernorth care, Evernorth benefits, Evernorth intelligence, the opportunity to bring expanded services largely through health plans today in support of Medicaid will be a growing organic part of our portfolio. Over time, we see opportunities that will manifest themselves state-by-state on state-specific service relationships again through Evernorth. 
And then finally, as you recall from our Investor Day conversation within our M&A priority, we continue to have expansion of our U.S. government programs as an M&A priority.

So specific to MDLIVE, first, important to reference the fact that we had a multiyear relationship with MDLIVE, both partnering to continuing the services, but also through our very successful multiyear Cigna Ventures organization. So we start from a learned, shared experience and even deeper collaboration during the COVID environment. 
Specific to the asset and the direction, as we discussed at our Investor Day, we see a rapid expansion of what we call alternative side of care to be 1 of the 3 major trends as we look forward over the next 5 to 10 years. This is an important part of those building blocks and it's an important part of our Evernorth care portfolio of capabilities. We see it as much greater than telemed or even basic virtual care triaging. We see the ability to obviously expand virtual care, primary care, behavioral care. We see the ability to expand that further in terms of longitudinal chronic care programs, polychronic and ultimately complex care programs and capabilities. 
So it provides us an accelerant to our strategic direction with a known partner that will now be part of the overall Cigna portfolio. And we're excited because net-net, it drives improved service, improved access, improved affordability with strong clinical outcomes for the benefit of our consumers. So truly an aggregate win-win in the portfolio. 
Specific to the digital formulary, that innovation continues to be somewhat unique in the marketplace. Our clients really appreciate the approach relative to the digital formulary, helping to essentially curate and apply externally validated expertise to the vast array of digital alternatives that exist in the ecosystem to help to provide employers more informed decisions for those that may have the greatest outcome and impact for the benefit of the customer. So I view that as a part of our consultative approach in terms of providing support and a part of our approach to, in this case, partner and curate additional services on a go-forward basis. 
Taken as a whole, we see, again, our Evernorth care capabilities as an exciting part of the broader Evernorth growth capabilities, and we see the ability to do that in a complementary nature with our proven value-based care relationships within our Cigna portfolio as well. I hope that helps, George."

I know last year, there was some discussion about potentially people being delayed. Different people had different views as to how much of that activity actually happened. I wondered what you've seen in terms of RFP activity on both sides of the business? Anything to discuss in terms of new and innovative ways that Cigna is going to market in those 2 sides of your business? And any discussion about early wins, losses?"

So relative to the selling season, looking to 2022, your question goes at the commercial side as well as the services side of the business. First, on the commercial side of the portfolio, at this stage of the year, we're typically looking at the national accounts environment and remind you that we define national accounts for our U.S. Commercial portfolio a little bit more narrowly than some in the market. So it's commercial employers, 5,000 or more employees who are multistate in nature. As we look to 2022, right now, we see an environment where the RFP volume, so the opportunity to pursue new business, is up somewhat. I think order of magnitude 10%. 
And we see the portion of our book of business that's out to bid is being up marginally, less than that 10% number. So that's a little bit of framing. We have some early traction, some early wins that exist in our portfolio. And as we sit here at this stage of the environment, we're optimistic that we'll have a very good commercial outlook in aggregate for our portfolio as we look to 2022. 
I'll bridge with the trend comment, and then I'll come to the Evernorth portfolio. Clearly, affordability remains a top decision criteria for commercial employers. There's no doubt about that. We spent ample time on that at our Investor Day, and it remains a tough strategic imperative. Further beyond that is the flexibility necessary and then the innovation required to truly integrate or coordinate mental and physical health programs, and then expand and coordinate access to care in a less fragmented way through alternative side of care framework, et cetera. So we see the trends being well lined up to our direction. 
As it relates to within Evernorth and specific to your question within pharmacy services, as you recall, we have now multiple years of very attractive growth under our belt as a combined organization, and we're pleased with that. As we look to 2022, we have an environment where, to date, our employer renewal process is manifesting itself quite strongly. And our health plan renewal process is manifesting itself rather strongly beyond the 2 known losses that we previously discussed relative to the health plan business. 
Taken as a whole, we'd expect the retention in that business as we sit here right now to be a bit less than our recent couple of years, which have been historic highs, in the upper 90s. We'll expect it to be more in the mid-90s at a consistent rate. And then taken as a whole, we will expect to see both revenue and earnings growth in our Evernorth portfolio in 2022. So both pointing in a positive direction would be the summary I would leave you with."

So a few thoughts on your question. I appreciate the framing of it. Broadly in the quarter, as I said earlier, the MCR for U.S. Medical was in line with our expectations when you exclude the favorable benefit from prior year development. Now the components within were a little bit different than we anticipated. So to your point, the COVID-19 testing and treatment burden on our book was a little bit lower than we anticipated for the quarter. However, non-COVID utilization was a little bit higher than we anticipated coming into the quarter. So the net effect of those 2 factors led to the U.S. Medical MCR being back in line with where we expected it to be. 
And as we trend out the balance of the year, we continue to expect that phenomenon to proceed, meaning deceleration in COVID-19 testing and treatment costs and a little bit of an uptick in non-COVID-related utilization. So to your point, we expect about 50% of the EPS headwind associated with COVID-19 $1.25 to continue to show up in the U.S. Medical MCR. 
And bridging over into 2022, we continue to anticipate about half of that $1.25 or a little bit over half of that to return in the form of earnings in our 2022 enterprise portfolio. And as such, we would expect that our long-term annual growth rate in EPS of 10% to 13%, we would expect to achieve a result that's at or above the high end of that range relative to our updated guidance of at least $20.20 per share."

Specifically, you talked about expanding primary care and longitudinal care. You talked earlier about your relationship with Ginger around mental health. So my question here is really twofold. First, where do you see the opportunities with MDLIVE around lowering overall medical costs for Cigna? 
Second, do you believe that you need to buy or continue to build out something around behavioral health? 
And then thirdly, can you just give us an idea of how many Cigna lives actually use MDLIVE today?"

So number one, bigger picture framing, I appreciate that you brought MDLIVE, Ginger together, for example. We do not believe that this is a one-and-done type activity. So we don't believe that the corporation secures itself a virtual care asset, and then they're squared for the alternative delivery space. This is a fluid environment. It's a dynamic environment. And it's a environment that has massive promise relative to bringing the expanded access, coordination of services and improved overall value coming back to the affordability. 
Our organic capabilities, our strong -- the MDLIVE asset advances that massively. But as Brian noted in his prior comments as well, we continue to invest in this space. So I want you to view that we view it as a dynamic and fluid space, and we very much like our positioning. 
Two is, just like in the, we'll call it, the traditional care delivery space, the coordination of physical and mental health is mission-critical. Just because it's in a virtual care environment doesn't mean that the coordination or the leverage opportunity there is not as critical. And in fact, the virtual capabilities allow us to take fragmentation out of the system more aggressively and more comprehensively. 
To your affordability comment, unequivocally, we see an ability to further improve affordability through alternative site of care and through our virtual capabilities. You may recall from Investor Day, we identified alternative site of care or site of care leverage as a meaningful opportunity to further deflect or improve overall affordability. And an example may be we see already in our virtual care delivery less use of unnecessary or redundant diagnostic services. That's a tangible illustration of an improvement in affordability. 
Conversely, we see opportunities to even further close gaps in care or increase utilization of the right services like maintenance medications through the dynamic, more intimate, ongoing interaction with customers or patients from that standpoint. 
So my points are threefold: one, continuation of investment here in innovation off of a very strong base; two, a continued need to use the capabilities to close fragmentation within the system or get more complementary leverage, most notably between the medical health and the mental health capabilities; and three, unequivocally a contributor to further improved affordability."

We're very pleased with the sustained performance, starting with the individual exchanges. Just have you recall, we entered the exchanges in the first year, and we've sustained engagement in the exchanges since its inception. We've innovated within the exchanges. We've delivered a proven model, and now we're in an expansion mode relative to additional geographies, in large part with our collaborative accountable care and aligned value-based relationships from the health care delivery system. 
And we're pleased with the results, both the base results in the individual exchange as well as, thus far, our early look at the additional enrollment we're seeing because of the expanded SEP. And I'll ask Brian just to give you a little color relative to that dimension. 
As it relates to the small employer marketplace, as you know, we Cigna historically have not played in the small employer marketplace, but we've focused above 51 lives or above 100 lives depending on the regulation more broadly. We have continued to view it as an underserved market, a market that has had more traditional or rigidly designed programs, lacked innovation and less flexibility and less leverage of more modern specialty and clinical services. 
And our determination was, it was best to pursue that market in partnership, leveraging our partnership DNA, and we've entered that market successfully with our partnership with Oscar. We're really early in that journey. Some positive indicators for sure. We're early in the journey. Our early indicators are positive though that has us accelerating our geographies and in collaboration with Oscar, and again, back to -- in partnership with our health care delivery partners. So Brian, maybe just a little color in terms of what we view the SEP process looking in the economics within the individual exchange?"

There is always some. But through ongoing innovation, ongoing productivity, ongoing value-based collaboration, broadly speaking, I would not cause a, call it, large sea change from that standpoint. 
Beyond that, in the broader economy, whether we look at it through a U.S. lens or pockets of the markets outside the United States, there's clearly a warming up. There's an indisputable warming up of the economy, and there's a clearly warming up of inflationary indicators, but none of which have triggered across a threshold to suggest to any one industry, save for some unique outliers, any kind of orange going to red threshold levels of inflation. 
But the robustness of the economy and some of the underlying cost drivers in some subsectors are clearly beginning to elevate and I think have a lot of industry leaders watching to ensure that any movement in curves -- any movement in cost curves could be anticipated, and either eradicated through pricing actions like CPG companies that are being intensely discussed, cost pressures in some subsectors of the technology ecosystem where the chip industry is out of pattern relative to supply and demand from that standpoint.

Thoughtful, but nonetheless complex. I think as you -- as I take your question and process your question, if you look at the 2020 to 2021 environment, clearly, the posture of CMS recognize the COVID dislocation, recognize that dislocation, for example, is implication on risk adjusters sought to, in their own methodology, seek to provide some offset to that relative to their rate cutting environment as well as our guidance relative to delivery system reimbursement and set themselves up for what I would say is a pretty fluid and complex environment over the ensuing couple of years ahead. 
So I would expect the next couple of years cycle to be a little nontraditional from that standpoint, given the need to adjust the various moving parts that result in a net rate setting environment. History would tell us that the result of all of the above, plus or minus 1 point or 2, largely gets the program to a balanced sustainable outcome. And looking forward, I would expect that because the Medicare Advantage program continues to deliver outstanding value, as you know, for seniors. Hence, the tremendous support from a senior standpoint as well as overall clinical quality and affordability of which through the bonus programs and the reimbursement programs, the federal government's budget actually benefits from. 
So I would expect it to be able to be balanced through that, but a little bit more lumpy than it has been in the past. And I think this year's risk adjuster true-ups will be really mission-critical in terms of how CMS sees the industry recapturing a little bit more of the information that they deem necessary to get the risk adjusters. And then they'll factor that into the forward-looking 2023 rate environment.

On your first question, to be very clear, we have seen consistent strong utilization of preventative care services. And notably, what I called out is, for example, in the first quarter of 2021, broadly speaking, preventative care services, inclusive of mammographies, colonoscopies, childhood immunization, cervical cancer screening, plus or minus in the commercial portfolio business approximate pre-pandemic levels. We think that's a very good thing. I mean, underscore, it's a very good thing and something that our team has worked tirelessly to try to effectuate elevating those levels. 
We see that performance against a national data set that suggests the utilization of those preventative care services are down versus pre-pandemic levels, 10% to 15%. But for our book of business, they are not. As a predictor then to the future, we see that as a mitigant for an elevation of acuity. All other things remain equal because you're consistently identifying an earlier stage through the preventative diagnostics or the preventative services. 
Equally as important, as I noted in my prepared remarks, are, for example, within our Evernorth portfolio and within our Evernorth Pharmacy portfolio for those customers being served by our mail order, we've actually seen get even further elevation of medication adherence. That's really important for the chronic population to avoid spikes in acuity moving forward, whether it's for diabetic, COPD, asthmatic or other patients from that standpoint. 
So broadly speaking, we're working tirelessly to get the right clinical quality and services to be consumed and supported with the clinical resources we have to avert spikes in acuity going forward. And therefore, we don't expect a large spike in acuity on a look-forward basis given the strong preventative or medication compliance.
As it relates to your M&A question, there's not a simple way to answer your question. Importantly, though, to frame, we look at all either growth or expansion of capability opportunities through buy-build-align frameworks. We relentlessly go through a buy-build-align frameworks. So for example, today, within our Evernorth benefit portfolio, we're organically building out additional post-acute care capabilities after evaluating, buying, further partnering or in-sourcing those capabilities. We typically will look at that through a right-to-win strategic positioning and an economic framework. 
So you look at it through a variety of frameworks. It's not a simple economic hurdle rate. Your question didn't infer that it was a single measure, but it's not a single economic hurdle rate. It's through a right-to-win size and trajectory of the market, the resources with which to pursue, whether it's organic build, collaboration through a partnership or from an acquisitive standpoint. And obviously, certain economic hurdle rates come into play, which we don't discuss publicly. Those are proprietary, but you would imagine we're quite disciplined in terms of our return to capital thresholds. Ricky, hope that helps."

As it relates to the supply chain activity, I would ask you just to continue to think about supply chain initiatives as being an inherent strength within the overall portfolio through a variety of lenses, whether it's collaboration on the medical side of the equation, the traditional supply chain activity, the value-based supply chain activity, et cetera. And we have a continuous drive to improve value, albeit to partner as we go through the process. 
And as we get into some more of the complex dimensions of the higher-cost drugs and medications, we think there's further opportunity through the supply chain activity around value-based care relationships, aligned incentive relationships more specifically with the manufacturers and with ourselves on a go-forward basis. So I wouldn't call out any unique driver. More importantly, it's a continuous improvement part of our portfolio, and it's an underlying strength of our portfolio. And lastly, our sustained growth supports that in a very positive way."

So to be really clear, again, we see the opportunity, obviously, from a stand-alone, if you will, fulfillment and delivery of the service, but also an opportunity in collaboration in alignment as a panel extender for high-performing collaborative accountable care relationships, and those conversations are dynamic and underway.
To the second part of your question, very thoughtful framework and appreciate it. If we come back and think about, first and foremost, our ability to further improve affordability, you may recall at our Investor Day, we talked about 4 major ways in which we further improve affordability off of our strong overall cost environment today. 
One is to further increase the percentage of utilization that takes place in the highest performing clinical settings, be they physicians or facilities. Second is to work to reduce the cost of drugs further. Third is to effectively leverage alternative sites of care. For example, the difference between AV replacement that is inpatient versus outpatient is about 1/3 less in cost, and we see a massive shift at the physical side of care, it's similar in virtual side of care. And then fourth, the ability to further coordinate the fragmented system, specifically in the areas of medical and behavioral. 
So back to your question, our -- evolution of our telemedicine and virtual care capability present opportunities to contribute to a variety of these areas to help to support individual customers or patients, accessing higher-cost health care specialists or delivery system partners, helping to drive further leverage relative to the pharmaceutical equation in terms of medication compliance or alternative lower-cost medications and the ability to merge or coordinate services, be they behavioral and pharmacy behavioral and medical by being in that quarterback position with a customer patient from that standpoint. So we see it as being complementary to a variety of those initiatives, and we see it being both complementary to your first question, proprietary driving on our own and in collaboration as a panel extender for high-performing health care professional partners."

I'm Alexis Jones, Lead Principle for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are: David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's second quarter 2021 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2021. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. 
We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we'll be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2021 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. 
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results. In the second quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item charge of $9 million or $0.03 per share related to debt extinguishment costs incurred during the period. We also recorded an after-tax special item charge of $14 million or $0.04 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. 
As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2021 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2021 dividends, and excludes the impact of any business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David."

I am going to spend a few minutes talking about the current environment and the forces that are shaping it, the strength and durable nature of our model that enables us to capitalize on opportunities and continue to grow even in the most disruptive conditions, and how the strength and durability is fueling our short- and long-term success. Then Brian will share more details about our second quarter results as well as our outlook for the rest of the year. And we'll take your questions. 
So let's jump in. During the quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $43 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.24 per share, all while we continue to drive balanced capital deployment as we execute on M&A, share repurchase and our quarterly dividend plan. We achieved these results in a fluid and challenging environment. As we continue to execute our strategy, we are confident in our ability to navigate these dynamic conditions. Our portfolio with 3 growth platforms enables us to create value for our clients and customers, and drive sustained business growth. 
During the quarter, the strength of our Evernorth business was clearly a standout. We are seeing high demand for Health Services programs, and we continue to invest in broadening our service offerings as well as our reach. Our sustained success validates our ability to be a trusted partner of choice for customers and clients as they manage many of the most challenging aspects of health care today. We do this by leveraging our portfolio that includes pharmacy solutions, benefit management solutions, care solutions and intelligence solutions. 
Evernorth is helping to improve access to care, keep costs down and deliver better outcomes as we serve our clients, patients and customers. And another quarter of Evernorth's strong revenue and earnings growth reinforces that our customers and clients value these capabilities. In Cigna Medical, we did see elevated medical cost pressure in the quarter as costs associated with direct COVID-19 care and the broader ramp-up of utilization levels exceeded our projections. Within this challenging environment, we continue to take proactive steps to ensure our customers have access to the care they need. This includes the elevated mental health services needed during these unprecedented times as well as continuing to work with our customers and patients to help navigate them to optimal site of care. 
During the quarter, we achieved customer growth in Cigna Medical in both our U.S. Commercial and Government business, and we continue to be on track for medical customer growth of at least 350,000 customers in 2021. Brian will share additional perspective on our results and outlook in his comments. 
Overall, our performance, which is strong through the first half of the year reflects the resiliency of our business and the balanced profile within our organization. With our focus on driving performance during the remainder of the year, it's imperative that we understand and account for the challenges our customers and clients will face as well as the continued evolution of the health care landscape. At a macro level, the environment is marked by ongoing uncertainty for business, government communities around the world. For example, COVID vaccination levels have brought welcome relief to millions, yet only about half of the U.S. is fully vaccinated, and that percentage is much lower for the world's population. 
With the spread of the merchants Delta variant, COVID infections and hospitalizations are on the rise in some regions, bringing renewed attention to travel restrictions and mask mandates. We see the economic recovery while positive, has been uneven in varied amongst industries as companies continue to cope with supply chain disruption, emerging inflationary pressure and various issues impacting the workforce. More broadly, from a health perspective, federal and state policymakers continue to be actively engaged. And as we've previously discussed, we continue to see 3 primary forces of change shaping the health care landscape today in its future. Specifically, pharmacological innovation, including specialty pharmaceuticals, gene therapies, evolved oncology medications, vaccines and acceleration in biosimilars. Second, the recognition of the link between mental health and physical health continues to grow, especially accelerated in this COVID environment. And third, the rise of virtual care and other alternative access to care models are rapidly changing. Together, these macro dynamics are profoundly influencing buying behaviors and service innovation in health care. 
Now with respect to clients, we are seeing a renewed commitment of employer clients to providing health care benefits vital to helping them to both attract and retain talent as well as increased productivity by maintaining a healthy workforce. This includes, for example, adopting alternative side of care programs and access programs. We see an intensified need for affordability across all of our clients, including pharmacy services as demand surges for high-priced breakthrough drug therapies. We see a desire for more consultative solution-based services as many clients are confronting the convergence of social, physical and mental health issues in ways they have not experienced before. 
With respect to the individual customers of patients utilizing our service, we see that they are increasingly valuing their employee-based service models. They're benefiting from support services that help them tend to their emotional well-being, and they have growing demand for coordination of care, both in COVID and non-COVID events. Against this backdrop, we are delivering differentiated value for the benefit of our customers and clients with our capabilities that address their emerging and evolving needs. For example, we have had a strong focus on providing virtual services, broadening networks as well as coordinated clinical programs. In our Pharmacy Solutions, we've been answering the call for greater affordability as we continue to see the emergence of new and expensive pharmacological advancements. 
Evernorth's recent expansion of our industry-first comprehensive weight management program illustrates the benefit of a more coordinated approach. Patients can now receive treatment with [ VEGOVI ], a promising new therapy for obesity and other weight management medications. And now with MDLIVE fully operational within our Evernorth business, MDLIVE physicians, along with other Evernorth clinicians are available to help patients. This program expansion also includes personalized support services from health coaches, peer support groups and curated digital apps. This weight management effort is the latest addition to our Evernorth suite of SafeguardRx programs. As for impact in 2020, patients enrolled in SafeguardRx have saved more than $6 billion in aggregate. 
In Evernorth Care Solutions, we've experienced an increase in demand for our behavioral health solutions from customers and clients as well. In the past 1.5 years, it has brought heightened stress and other personal challenges, and we see many more people reaching up for health and services. Clients now more broadly understand that someone with a chronic condition is more likely to have a mental health or substance abuse related illness, and individuals are feeling the additional mental and physical challenges associated with pandemic. 
With our market-leading health capabilities, we are driving more value to our Evernorth and Cigna Medical clients and customers by providing the tools and services they need to address their mental well-being and deliver better sustained long-term outcomes. 
Within our Cigna Medical platform, in U.S. commercial, we are working closely with our employer clients to provide our integrated suite of solutions designed to make their workforce healthier and more productive. We know that employees receiving health and well-being benefits to their employers are less likely to miss work because of health. A recent study shows a significant impact up to 70-fewer percent, they've missed over a year. With our integrated approach, we strive to bring the right mix of solutions that reduce the workforce challenges many of our clients are facing and helping to support them to engage and retain their employees. 
And affordability is and remains a primary focus across our entire portfolio as it is in Cigna Medical. Our clients continue to manage through an incredibly dynamic environment for the business and is becoming even more important that they can count on us with greater affordability for the health care programs. New and expensive pharmacological advancements are a predominant contributor to this challenge. And we have been a leader here putting these treatments in the hands of those who need them at a more affordable price. For example, [ REMICADE ] is treatment for chronic conditions such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis, while life changing, can also impose significant financial burdens. 1 year of REMICADE infusion costs about $30,000 on average and as much as $70,000 depending on setting of care. We recently launched a Cigna pharmacy program that shares prescription drug savings directly with patients who switch from REMICADE to one of the approved biosimilars. More than 20% of eligible patients in consultation with their provider have already switched to lower-cost preferred alternative medications. This program has an immediate benefit to clients who save at least 10% on the cost of the drug. And we've taken a leadership position here by supporting our patients with a $500 incentive. This is a great example of aligning interest. Over the longer term, we can drive even greater impact as biosimilars become a more prevalent part in the United States as helping us further improve affordability. 
And in Cigna Medical, we're actively working toward improving affordability by ensuring that our customers continue to have access to the care they need and optimize their long-term health. For example, in Arizona, we conducted a highly targeted outreach program to our customers who are at high risk due to chronic condition, yet who have not been vaccinated. The initial results are encouraging, and we're seeing positive increase in vaccination rates amongst these targeted individuals. We are now taking the learnings from that pilot into other locations across the United States with a particular focus on increasing vaccination rates amongst those in most need. This broad range of examples illustrates how our comprehensive and strategic approach to helping our clients and customers address their most pressing health needs help us going forward. And in this dynamic environment, we will continue to expand the services we offer our clients and customers. And therefore, we see many more opportunities to create value for both our clients and customers and as a result, for you, our shareholders. 
It is clear that the strength of our medical and pharmacy offerings, combined with our strategic agility has enabled us to continue to capture growth even in the most dynamic environment by delivering differentiated value, by partnering and relentlessly innovating and by expanding our addressable markets as we broaden our reach to new geographies and through the introduction of a broader suite of solutions. When you combine this compelling growth potential, along with our significant operating cash flow generated by our service-based capital-light model, we have confidence in our ability to meet our long-term targets by achieving differentiated results, which include average annual revenue growth of 6% to 8%, average annual EPS growth of 10% to 13%, and continuing to pay an attractive dividend, all while producing cumulative operating cash flow of approximately $50 billion through 2025. Relative to 2021, we remain committed to delivering full year EPS of at least $2.20. 
Now to briefly summarize. First, we recognized in an environment like this that's so challenging, we know the growth doesn't come easily. It has to be earned each and every day. Second, we have a proven track record of delivering differentiated value, innovating and partnering and smartly expanding our addressable market to fuel sustained long-term growth, even in a disruptive environment. And our company has attractive sustainable growth opportunities across our 3 well-positioned growth platforms, and importantly, the strategic and capital flexibility to take advantage of opportunities. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
172899,1674100824,2364423,"Cigna Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","The Cigna Group","Executives","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business, and I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highlight",1615,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business, and I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highlights for second quarter 2021 include adjusted revenue growth of 10% to $43.1 billion, adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion after tax, and adjusted earnings per share of $5.24. Results in the second quarter reflect strong top line growth with solid contributions across our businesses. 
Before I go into segment-specific results, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes addressing the medical cost environment we are experiencing. Let me be clear, our second quarter results and our full year outlook have been adversely impacted by elevated claim costs compared to our prior expectations. Despite this pressure, our diversified portfolio of businesses and multiple earnings levers drove second quarter adjusted earnings that exceeded our expectations at the enterprise level. Specifically, within the second quarter, ongoing direct COVID-19 costs were above our expectations, and non-COVID utilization returned more rapidly than we anticipated. 
During my comments today and in our Q&A, David and I will use the term baseline to refer to 2019 [ for ] pre-pandemic claim costs that will be trended forward for 2 years to 2021 to provide you with an estimate for what 2021 claim cost would have been in the absence of COVID-19. 
The return of non-COVID utilization has varied by both geography and customer group. For example, we saw the following within the second quarter. In U.S. Commercial non-COVID costs were back to baseline levels. While in Medicare Advantage, non-COVID costs accelerated from first quarter levels but remained slightly below baseline for the second quarter. We expect to continue seeing elevated claim costs compared to our original expectations for the balance of 2021 within U.S. Medical. However, the strength of our diversified portfolio of businesses and our multiple earnings levers give us the confidence to reaffirm our full year EPS outlook of at least $20.20. Additionally, as we look forward to 2022, while we recognize the dynamic environment in which we operate, we expect another year of attractive growth driven by all 3 of our growth platforms. 
Now I'd like to turn to our segment-level results and then provide an update on the details of our outlook as well as our capital positioning. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Second quarter 2021 adjusted revenues grew 14% to $32.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings grew 13% to $1.4 billion compared to the second quarter of 2020. Evernorth's strong results in the quarter were driven by ongoing organic growth, driving both top and bottom line contributions, and continued progress on a range of affordability initiatives for the benefit of our customers and clients. In the quarter, we also continued to make significant investments to support our ongoing growth, including our virtual care platform and technology capabilities. 
Our adjusted pharmacy script volume was $410 million during the quarter, a 13% increase over second quarter 2020 driven by strong organic growth as well as the impact of vaccine volumes in the quarter. Overall, Evernorth delivered another strong quarter, continuing to create differentiated value for clients and customers while driving better-than-expected top and bottom line contributions to the enterprise. 
Turning to U.S. Medical. Second quarter adjusted revenues were $10.5 billion, and adjusted pretax earnings were $1 billion. Overall, our second quarter U.S. medical earnings reflected the impact of elevated claim costs, offset by favorability from operating expenses, nonrecurring items and net investment income. 
Regarding our medical costs. We entered the second quarter expecting a continued decline in COVID-related claim costs and a gradual return in broader care consumption patterns towards more normalized levels. While these directional patterns did transpire, as I noted earlier, both direct COVID-19 costs and broader utilization levels were above our expectations for the second quarter. Direct COVID-19 costs were highest in April, decreasing throughout the second quarter while non-COVID costs approximated baseline levels for the quarter. Both U.S. Commercial and U.S. Government total medical costs, reflecting the combined impact of direct COVID-19 and non-COVID costs, were above baseline for the quarter, with U.S. Commercial further above baseline as those customers return to utilize the health care systems at a slightly higher level. Given these developments, the second quarter medical care ratio was above our expectations. We now expect that the level of non-COVID costs we incurred toward the end of the second quarter will persist for the balance of the year. This, coupled with the ongoing direct COVID-19-related costs we expect to incur, has led us to raise our guidance for the full year 2021 medical care ratio. 
Turning to membership. We ended the quarter with 17 million total medical customers, an increase of 249,000 customers sequentially. The customer growth in the quarter was largely driven by new wins in middle market and growth in the individual business through the extended special enrollment period, supported by continued strong retention across our portfolio. All in, for U.S. Medical, we continue driving customer growth and expanding services while remaining focused on delivering value and supporting our customers and clients in a dynamic environment. 
In our International Markets business, second quarter adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $234 million. These results were approximately in line with our expectations. Corporate and other operations delivered a second quarter adjusted loss of $331 million. Overall, we continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders with strong growth, reflecting contributions across our businesses, led by outperformance in Evernorth. The diversified portfolio of Cigna businesses and the multiple avenues to create and ultimately capture value have allowed us to continue meeting our enterprise commitments despite ongoing uncertainties in the marketplace. 
Now turning to our updated outlook for full year 2021. We are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance for full year 2021 of at least $20.20. Before I walk through the outlook by segment, I'd like to frame the key drivers underlying this outlook. The updated components include an increase in expected earnings from Evernorth, a decrease in expected earnings from U.S. Medical driven by a higher medical care ratio, a more favorable outlook for operating expenses and other contributions that are net favorable for the year. Additionally, we now expect full year 2021 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $170 billion, representing growth of at least 9% from 2020 when excluding the divestiture of our Group Disability and Life business. 
Within our outlook, we now expect a full year COVID-19-related headwind of approximately $2.50 per share, primarily impacting our U.S. Medical business. This includes approximately 80% related to impacts on the medical care ratio and approximately 20% related to lower customer volumes due to economy-driven enrollment dynamics. Finally, we now expect an adjusted SG&A ratio of approximately 7.5%, an improvement relative to our prior outlook. 
I'll now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we now expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.8 billion, representing growth of at least 8% over 2020, reflecting the significant value we create for our customers and clients. For U.S. Medical, we now expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.5 billion. Underlying this updated outlook, we now expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 83% to 84% driven by our updated medical cost expectations for the second half of 2021, as I previously discussed. Regarding total medical customers, we continue to expect 2021 growth of at least 350,000 customers. All in, for full year 2021, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of at least $20.20 with the underlying drivers being an increase in expected earnings from Evernorth, a decrease in expected earnings from U.S. Medical driven by a higher medical care ratio, a more favorable outlook for operating expenses and other contributions that are net favorable for the year. 
Now moving to our 2021 capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong cash flows and returns on capital even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. I would highlight that we had some timing-related items, which impacted cash flow from operations during the second quarter. For full year 2021, we continue to expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses. 
Year-to-date, as of August 4, 2021, we have repurchased about 18 million shares for about $4.1 billion, and we now expect full year 2021 weighted average shares of 344 million to 345 million shares. On July 28, we declared a $1 per share dividend, payable on September 23 to shareholders of record as of September 8. 
Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. So now to recap. Results in the second quarter reflect strong top line growth with contributions across our businesses. Additionally, we acknowledge that the environment remains fluid as evidenced by the impact of elevated medical costs in the second quarter and on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Even with this additional pressure, our diversified portfolio and multiple earnings levers have positioned us to achieve our outlook for full year 2021, all while continuing to support our customers, clients and coworkers. 
We continue to expect 2021 full year adjusted earnings of at least $20.20 per share and have continued confidence in delivering our long-term EPS growth rate that will average 10% to 13% per year. 
With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

On the increased outlook for -- on the medical cost ratio, and what you're giving us relative to COVID to non COVID, it looks like, if my math is right, about 2/3 of the increase in MLR would be related to the COVID costs, given the $1.25, now it's $2.50 EPS headwind. And I guess that would mean the remaining is the non-COVID. I want to just confirm that. And would the Cove cost to be spread relatively evenly over the course of the year -- rest of the year, Q2, Q3, Q4? And then does that become a tailwind for '22 as hopefully that reverses?"

So I -- a few different questions in there. I'll try to give you the overall picture. So as I said in my prepared comments there, we now anticipate about a $2.50 earnings per share headwind in 2021 associated with COVID. And of that, approximately 80% impacts the medical care ratio and approximately 20% is related to enrollment levels being depressed here in 2021. Focusing on the $2 per share COVID-related headwind that's impacting the medical care ratio. There's a few components underlying that. So 1 would be the impact of Medicare Advantage risk adjuster revenue headwinds here in 2021. The other component of it is the level of total cost of care that we're experiencing in 2021 compared to our prior expectation, which includes both COVID-direct costs, and it also includes non-COVID costs that returned earlier than we anticipated during the year here. 
And so I wouldn't necessarily parse the 2/3, 1/3 the way that you did, but rather look at the total cost picture being more elevated in comparison to what we had previously expected. COVID costs were highest for us in the first quarter. Within the second quarter, they were higher in April than they were in May and June, and we expect for the balance of the year that COVID costs will run at a lower level than they did in the first half of the year. So that's what's embedded in our outlook. And as I said, the non-COVID utilization, we're anticipating to run at approximately baseline levels for the back half of the year. That, plus the COVID costs we expect to incur, leads us to all-in cost levels at slightly above our baseline for the back half of 2021. And as it relates to what we expect to unwind heading into 2022. Again, if you parse apart the components of that $2 I was just making reference to, the Medicare Advantage risk adjuster headwind, we expect to fully recover in 2022. So between our bid strategies and the operational activities we're seeing, we have full confidence that we'll fully recover that component. 
The components related to total cost of care, we expect to recover a portion of that in 2022. And so fortunately, that will come through pricing actions. A portion of that will come through clinical management activities. And a portion of that, we expect to be a little bit of natural abatement in aggregate costs between 2021 and 2022. So we're currently estimating that about half of that $2 per share headwind will come back in 2022 in the form of incremental earnings. So think about $1 of the $2.50 EPS headwind returning into the P&L in 2022."

Underlying our outlook will be strong base earnings growth, contributions from ongoing capital deployment and the recovery of some of the headwind that Brian articulated. There'll be an offset to that. Partially offsetting that will be the lack of some of the non-run-ratable items we're realizing in our 2021 at least $20.20 EPS outlook. So when you take it all together, we expect 2022 will be another strong year for us. As it relates to growth rates, the way I'd ask you to think about that is, first off, I take at least $20.20. When we adjust that for the non-run-ratable items, we would expect to grow at the high end of our 10% to 13% range. Another way of thinking about it, if you take at least $20.20 outlook for 2020, we would expect to grow at least 10% on that.

As it relates to the performance in the current year, we have some attractive growth in that business, both underlying fundamental growth as well as growth contribution from the SEP period. And as it relates to the core of your question, on performance, I'd ask you to think about the underlying -- what we're seeing, the underlying performance of that book of business is similar to the trends and impact that Brian articulated before. So we see an uptick in utilization within that book of business, more approximating from a non-COVID standpoint, baseline activity with some additional utilization on the COVID side of the equation. And lastly, our early look at the SEP special enrollment period, additional lives. Those lines are performing similar to other special enrollment period like we've observed before.

So on the first part of your question there, if I misspoke, I apologize. For the second quarter, our non-COVID utilization for Commercial was essentially at baseline.

For the back half of the year within our Commercial business, we're expecting that non-COVID utilization will continue to run at baseline and we will incur direct COVID-19-related costs, but at a lower level than what we saw in the first half of the year. So hopefully, that clarifies a bit, the commentary around Commercial and the assumptions on the back half. 
Relative to the nonrecurring items that you asked about, you could think about those as largely being SG&A oriented with the bulk of it being associated with litigation from prior years where we had some favorable developments in the quarter that allowed us to recognize some gains there. So boxing that just directionally, you should think of it as about $150 million after tax.

That opportunity is a little greater now for 2022 than it was a quarter ago from that perspective. The new item is what Brian walked through, which are the nonrecurring items, and he gave you approximate order of magnitude. So again, to repeat to the specific part of your question, we believe today, if you take at least $20.20 that we will deliver for this year, our growth rate will be at least 10%. We believe if you take the at least $20.20 and adjust it for those nonrecurring items, that we referenced -- that Brian just referenced, the growth rate will approximate 13% or so.

If you think about how the second quarter unfolded, I think this is instructive for how we think about the back half of the year and into '22. So April, we saw the highest level of COVID costs, as I said earlier, those track downward pretty meaningfully in May and June. And the total cost of care, when you combine the COVID and non-COVID cost together in the months of May and June, it's more in line with what we're expecting for the back half of '21 and as we step into '22. So for those reasons, based on the more emergent data, we feel better about the next 18 months as compared to the first 4 months of the year where we had particularly elevated costs in our book.

The underlying question comes back to, as Brian broke out the portions of it. We essentially are looking at an environment in the second half of the year where the medical cost environment will be slightly above baseline. And the pieces of that are that the non-COVID or the, call it, traditional parts of medical costs, approximate baseline in the commercial portfolio. And above and beyond that, there's some additional load for COVID. So one would have to believe that either, a, the non-COVID costs are going to run above baseline for some reason that they haven't to date, when we look at the way we built up the proxy for baseline and/or that the additional COVID costs that we're saying are additive to that, will be materially greater, right? So we acknowledge it's the fluid environment beyond the shadow it out. But we believe that the estimate we've made for the step up in aggregate for the rest of the year to run slightly above baseline is an appropriate assessment based upon the pattern we saw in the end of the first quarter and the way in which the second quarter has evolved and developed. And as I noted, we have about 2/3 of the risk business yet to be priced for 2022."

So a few different components there to the question. Big picture compared to our expectations, I would encourage you to think about the 3 books of business, meaning the Commercial risk, the individual exchange and the Medicare Advantage as all being approximately off by the same amount compared to our expectations in terms of total claim costs. So I'd start there in terms of -- we are not seeing one being really disproportionately impacted relative to our prior expectations. They're all off by, call it, that 200 basis points or so that changed in our MCR guide. The Medicare Advantage business, though, in 2021 as further weighed down by the risk adjustment revenue headwind. So you should view the margins on the Medicare Advantage business as being particularly low relative to what our long-term expectations are. And as we step into '22, we would expect margin expansion on each of those books of business off of what we're experiencing here in '21. As it relates to the risk adjuster headwind, that's a component of the $2 per share headwind. We haven't specifically sized that. It's certainly less than half of that. I would note, we recently received our midyear settlement from CMS, which was favorable to our expectations, which gives us further confidence in our ability to fully recover that headwind in '22."

Specifically, you start your real thoughtful question in terms of kind of [ apportion in ] 5 years out. We don't have a rigid target 5 years out that we want x percent in category a or y percent in category z. But however, we do see an environment where the services portion of our portfolio will continue to grow at an accelerated rate. We see the right to win the ability to create value and our strategic position there for the multiple client segments we're able to serve there as being quite attractive, and you should expect this to continue to grow our pharmacy, our care, our benefits and our intelligence capability to be able to bring to bear against that. Secondly, we've continued to call out U.S. Government as an attractive growth segment and that will transpire both organically and inorganically as opportunities present themselves. And thirdly, we continue to see targeted opportunities in our International portfolio as attractive growth opportunities. On a final note, you articulated examples of home care, otherwise, et cetera. I won't call out any 1 precise example, but I'll step back and remind you, as we've talked about it, we see what we call alternative sites of care. So virtual, longitudinal virtual, polychronic, home care, coordinated home care as attractive additional growth opportunities within our service portfolio, and we continue to extend ourselves and expand ourselves within that space. So multiple strategic alternatives; second, strong platforms to build off of; third, the capital flexibility to be able to grow in multiple attractive markets that you appropriately called out."

Part of that due to the focus we've had on preventive care, as you indicated in your question as well as appropriate behavioral health utilization as we talked about earlier. And just -- there are a variety of metrics that we use to track this. And just 1 really specific one I'll give you, we track within our commercial book of business when we have new cancer diagnosis, how many of them are at a metastatic stage when they're first diagnosed. And so prior to the pandemic, if you look at the top 5 cancer types, we saw 38% to 39% of these in a metastatic stage when they presented to us. In 2021, we're in that same range, 38% to 39%. So that's an indicator that we track one of many that suggests we do not yet have those signs of acuity spikes.

On the services side, you referenced pharmacy unequivocally, but expanded beyond pharmacy to care and benefit management services as well as intelligent services. For example, as we look to continue to serve our expanding portfolio of health plan clients. They have diverse portfolios that they serve, commercial, obviously, Medicare, Medicaid, exchange and otherwise. That's an important part of our growth chassis as we go forward with dedicated resources and then ultimately, direct to government contractor relationships as well.

And we're proud of the fact that our portfolio -- our diverse portfolio can perform in this environment and importantly, deliver for our clients, our customers and patients while we deliver our responsibilities from a shareholder perspective. But I appreciate the tone of your question. 
Now specifically, as you go back in time, when we brought this portfolio together in terms of the companies, we viewed, obviously, that we had an opportunity to bring in a leading PBM portfolio of services, but it was broader than that. Secondly, we viewed, as we talk about now, that pharmacological innovation was a big part of the future of health care. And the acceleration of innovation is what we're seeing today through a whole variety of things, gene therapy, specialty, medications evolving, biosimilars, et cetera. And hence, if you're going to be helping individuals with their overall health care needs, being a leader in pharmacy services is mission-critical. We also saw the opportunity to expand that portfolio through a broader services platform, which we did through Evernorth, and then continue to feed that broader services platform for health plan clients for corporate clients, for our government clients, et cetera. 
And as we've noted, both Brian and I have noted, we're very pleased with the performance within the portfolio and the service we're delivering. And importantly, we continue to invest in that portfolio at an accelerating rate relative to expanding products, services, capabilities as well as our reach. Now as it relates to the profit model, the primary mechanisms would articulate for you to think about is back to the time you referenced, we acknowledge that the financing models were going to change, and we didn't resist that. We offer choice. We offer choice in terms of how purchasers or clients want to finance their offering. And we've evolved, for example, with a higher percentage of pass-through arrangements for clients in the PBM services from well less than 50% to 50% to well greater than 50% over 3 cycles. And we've been able to evolve our service-based capabilities and our value creation capabilities for the benefit of clients. Secondly, we continue to press for more aligned relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers on the clinical outcomes, not just the consumptions. We know that broadly in the industry is value-based programs, but think about them as aligned programs. And then lastly, as the biosimilars start to evolve at a more rapid rate, the positioning of our company to have the clinical depth, the coordination of clinical services, the manufacturer relationships and importantly, the medical physician relationships are mission-critical. And as I use the REMICADE example, all those come to bear because it's a patient-by-patient decision made with a practicing physician relative to the choices and alternatives. So again, I appreciate your question. We're pleased with the performance, but maybe even more importantly than that underlying your question, we're delighted with the strategic position that the platform gives us right now to continue to drive growth and create value going forward."

But big picture, the first half of the year, we ran a few points above baseline in total when you combine the effect of COVID and non-COVID utilization together. For the back half of the year, we're projecting to run slightly above the baseline in totality, and that's comprised of non-COVID utilization running approximately at baseline plus COVID utilization on top of that. 
To your question on how does that pattern relative to what we saw in the first half, you should think of the direct COVID-19 related costs as being the highest in the first quarter, lower in the second quarter, and we're modeling slightly lower than that for the back half of the year on direct COVID-19-related costs.

I'm Alexis Jones, Lead Principle for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are: David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's second quarter 2021 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2021. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.  
We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we'll be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2021 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.  
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results. In the second quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item charge of $9 million or $0.03 per share related to debt extinguishment costs incurred during the period. We also recorded an after-tax special item charge of $14 million or $0.04 per share for integration and transaction-related costs.  
As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2021 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2021 dividends, and excludes the impact of any business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today.  
With that, I will turn the call over to David."

Today, I am going to spend a few minutes talking about the current environment and the forces that are shaping it, the strength and durable nature of our model that enables us to capitalize on opportunities and continue to grow even in the most disruptive conditions, and how the strength and durability is fueling our short- and long-term success. Then Brian will share more details about our second quarter results as well as our outlook for the rest of the year. And we'll take your questions.  
So let's jump in. During the quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $43 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.24 per share, all while we continue to drive balanced capital deployment as we execute on M&A, share repurchase and our quarterly dividend plan. We achieved these results in a fluid and challenging environment. As we continue to execute our strategy, we are confident in our ability to navigate these dynamic conditions. Our portfolio with 3 growth platforms enables us to create value for our clients and customers, and drive sustained business growth.  
During the quarter, the strength of our Evernorth business was clearly a standout. We are seeing high demand for Health Services programs, and we continue to invest in broadening our service offerings as well as our reach. Our sustained success validates our ability to be a trusted partner of choice for customers and clients as they manage many of the most challenging aspects of health care today. We do this by leveraging our portfolio that includes pharmacy solutions, benefit management solutions, care solutions and intelligence solutions.  
Evernorth is helping to improve access to care, keep costs down and deliver better outcomes as we serve our clients, patients and customers. And another quarter of Evernorth's strong revenue and earnings growth reinforces that our customers and clients value these capabilities. In Cigna Medical, we did see elevated medical cost pressure in the quarter as costs associated with direct COVID-19 care and the broader ramp-up of utilization levels exceeded our projections. Within this challenging environment, we continue to take proactive steps to ensure our customers have access to the care they need. This includes the elevated mental health services needed during these unprecedented times as well as continuing to work with our customers and patients to help navigate them to optimal sites of care. During the quarter, we achieved customer growth in Cigna Medical in both our U.S. Commercial and Government business, and we continue to be on track for medical customer growth of at least 350,000 customers in 2021. Brian will share additional perspective on our results and outlook in his comments.  
Overall, our performance, which is strong through the first half of the year reflects the resiliency of our business and the balanced profile within our organization. With our focus on driving performance during the remainder of the year, it's imperative that we understand and account for the challenges our customers and clients will face as well as the continued evolution of the health care landscape. At a macro level, the environment is marked by ongoing uncertainty for business, governments, communities around the world. For example, COVID vaccination levels have brought welcome relief to millions, yet only about half of the U.S. is fully vaccinated, and that percentage is much lower for the world's population.  
With the spread of the more contagious Delta variant, COVID infections and hospitalizations are on the rise in some regions, bringing renewed attention to travel restrictions and mask mandates. We see the economic recovery while positive, has been uneven in varied amongst industries as companies continue to cope with supply chain disruption, emerging inflationary pressure and various issues impacting the workforce. More broadly, from a health perspective, federal and state policymakers continue to be actively engaged. And as we've previously discussed, we continue to see 3 primary forces of change shaping the health care landscape today and in the future. Specifically, pharmacological innovation, including specialty pharmaceuticals, gene therapies, evolved oncology medications, vaccines and acceleration in biosimilars.  
Second, the recognition of the link between mental health and physical health continues to grow, especially accelerated in this COVID environment. And third, the rise of virtual care and other alternative access to care models are rapidly changing. Together, these macro dynamics are profoundly influencing buying behaviors and service innovation in health care. 
Now with respect to clients, we are seeing a renewed commitment of employer clients to providing health care benefits vital to helping them to both attract and retain talent as well as increased productivity by maintaining a healthy workforce. This includes, for example, adopting alternative side of care programs and access programs. We see an intensified need for affordability across all of our clients, including pharmacy services as demand surges for high-priced breakthrough drug therapies. We see a desire for more consultative solution-based services as many clients are confronting the convergence of social, physical and mental health issues in ways they have not experienced before.  
With respect to the individual customers and patients utilizing our service, we see that they are increasingly valuing their employee-based service models. They're benefiting from support services that help them tend to their emotional well-being, and they have growing demand for coordination of care, both in COVID and non-COVID events. Against this backdrop, we are delivering differentiated value for the benefit of our customers and clients with our capabilities that address their emerging and evolving needs. For example, we have had a strong focus on providing virtual services, broadening networks as well as coordinated clinical programs. In our Pharmacy Solutions, we've been answering the call for greater affordability as we continue to see the emergence of new and expensive pharmacological advancements.  
Evernorth's recent expansion of our industry-first comprehensive weight management program illustrates the benefit of a more coordinated approach. Patients can now receive treatment with Wegovy, a promising new therapy for obesity and other weight management medications. And now with MDLIVE fully operational within our Evernorth business, MDLIVE physicians, along with other Evernorth clinicians are available to help patients. This program expansion also includes personalized support services from health coaches, peer support groups and curated digital apps. This weight management effort is the latest addition to our Evernorth suite of SafeGuardRx programs. As for impact in 2020, patients enrolled in SafeGuardRx have saved more than $6 billion in aggregate.  
In Evernorth Care Solutions, we've experienced an increase in demand for our behavioral health solutions from customers and clients as well. In the past 1.5 years, it has brought heightened stress and other personal challenges, and we see many more people reaching up for health and services. Clients now more broadly understand that someone with a chronic condition is more likely to have a mental health or substance abuse related illness, and individuals are feeling the additional mental and physical challenges associated with the pandemic.  
With our market-leading behavioral health capabilities, we are driving more value to our Evernorth and Cigna Medical clients and customers by providing the tools and services they need to address their mental well-being and deliver better sustained long-term outcomes.  
Within our Cigna Medical platform, in U.S. commercial, we are working closely with our employer clients to provide our integrated suite of solutions designed to make their workforce healthier and more productive. We know that employees receiving health and well-being benefits to their employers are less likely to miss work because of poor health. A recent study shows a significant impact up to 70-fewer percent days missed missed over a year. With our integrated approach, we strive to bring the right mix of solutions that reduce the workforce challenges many of our clients are facing and helping to support them to engage and retain their employees.  
And affordability is and remains a primary focus across our entire portfolio as it is in Cigna Medical. Our clients continue to manage through an incredibly dynamic environment for the business and is becoming even more important that they can count on us with greater affordability for the health care programs. New and expensive pharmacological advancements are a predominant contributor to this challenge. And we have been a leader here putting these treatments in the hands of those who need them at a more affordable price. For example, Remicade is treatment for chronic conditions such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis, while life changing, can also impose significant financial burdens. 1 year of Remicade infusion costs about $30,000 on average and as much as $70,000 depending on setting of care. We recently launched a Cigna pharmacy program that shares prescription drug savings directly with patients who switch from Remicade to one of the approved biosimilars.  
More than 20% of eligible patients in consultation with their provider have already switched to lower-cost preferred alternative medications. This program has an immediate benefit to clients who save at least 10% on the cost of the drug. And we've taken a leadership position here by supporting our patients with a $500 incentive. This is a great example of aligning interest.  
Over the longer term, we can drive even greater impact as biosimilars become a more prevalent part in the United States as helping us to further improve affordability.  
And in Cigna Medical, we're actively working toward improving affordability by ensuring that our customers continue to have access to the care they need and optimize their long-term health. For example, in Arizona, we conducted a highly targeted outreach program to our customers who are at high risk due to chronic condition, yet who have not been vaccinated. The initial results are encouraging, and we're seeing positive increase in vaccination rates amongst these targeted individuals. We are now taking the learnings from that pilot into other locations across the United States with a particular focus on increasing vaccination rates amongst those in most need. This broad range of examples illustrates how our comprehensive and strategic approach to helping our clients and customers address their most pressing health needs help us going forward. And in this dynamic environment, we will continue to expand the services we offer our clients and customers. And therefore, we see many more opportunities to create value for both our clients and customers and as a result, for you, our shareholders.  
It is clear that the strength of our medical and pharmacy offerings, combined with our strategic agility has enabled us to continue to capture growth even in the most dynamic environment by delivering differentiated value, by partnering and relentlessly innovating and by expanding our addressable markets as we broaden our reach to new geographies and through the introduction of a broader suite of solutions. When you combine this compelling growth potential, along with our significant operating cash flow generated by our service-based capital-light model, we have confidence in our ability to meet our long-term targets by achieving differentiated results, which include average annual revenue growth of 6% to 8%, average annual EPS growth of 10% to 13%, and continuing to pay an attractive dividend, all while producing cumulative operating cash flow of approximately $50 billion through 2025. Relative to 2021, we remain committed to delivering full year EPS of at least $20.20. 
Now to briefly summarize. First, we recognized in an environment like this that's so challenging, we know the growth doesn't come easily. It has to be earned each and every day. Second, we have a proven track record of delivering differentiated value, innovating and partnering and smartly expanding our addressable market to fuel sustained long-term growth, even in a disruptive environment. And our company has attractive sustainable growth opportunities across our 3 well-positioned growth platforms, and importantly, the strategic and capital flexibility to take advantage of opportunities.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business, and I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highlight",1616,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business, and I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highlights for second quarter 2021 include adjusted revenue growth of 10% to $43.1 billion, adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion after tax, and adjusted earnings per share of $5.24. Results in the second quarter reflect strong top line growth with solid contributions across our businesses.  
Before I go into segment-specific results, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes addressing the medical cost environment we are experiencing. Let me be clear, our second quarter results and our full year outlook have been adversely impacted by elevated claim costs compared to our prior expectations. Despite this pressure, our diversified portfolio of businesses and multiple earnings levers drove second quarter adjusted earnings that exceeded our expectations at the enterprise level. Specifically, within the second quarter, ongoing direct COVID-19 costs were above our expectations, and non-COVID utilization returned more rapidly than we anticipated.  
During my comments today and in our Q&A, David and I will use the term baseline to refer to 2019 for pre-pandemic claim costs that will be trended forward for 2 years to 2021 to provide you with an estimate for what 2021 claim cost would have been in the absence of COVID-19.  
The return of non-COVID utilization has varied by both geography and customer group. For example, we saw the following within the second quarter. In U.S. Commercial, non-COVID costs were back to baseline levels. While in Medicare Advantage, non-COVID costs accelerated from first quarter levels but remained slightly below baseline for the second quarter. We expect to continue seeing elevated claim costs compared to our original expectations for the balance of 2021 within U.S. Medical. However, the strength of our diversified portfolio of businesses and our multiple earnings levers give us the confidence to reaffirm our full year EPS outlook of at least $20.20. Additionally, as we look forward to 2022, while we recognize the dynamic environment in which we operate, we expect another year of attractive growth driven by all 3 of our growth platforms.  
Now I'd like to turn to our segment-level results and then provide an update on the details of our outlook as well as our capital positioning. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Second quarter 2021 adjusted revenues grew 14% to $32.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings grew 13% to $1.4 billion compared to the second quarter of 2020. Evernorth's strong results in the quarter were driven by ongoing organic growth, driving both top and bottom line contributions, and continued progress on a range of affordability initiatives for the benefit of our customers and clients. In the quarter, we also continued to make significant investments to support our ongoing growth, including our virtual care platform and technology capabilities.  
Our adjusted pharmacy script volume was 410 million during the quarter, a 13% increase over second quarter 2020 driven by strong organic growth as well as the impact of vaccine volumes in the quarter. Overall, Evernorth delivered another strong quarter, continuing to create differentiated value for clients and customers while driving better-than-expected top and bottom line contributions to the enterprise.  
Turning to U.S. Medical. Second quarter adjusted revenues were $10.5 billion, and adjusted pretax earnings were $1 billion. Overall, our second quarter U.S. Medical earnings reflected the impact of elevated claim costs, offset by favorability from operating expenses, nonrecurring items and net investment income.  
Regarding our medical costs. We entered the second quarter expecting a continued decline in COVID-related claim costs and a gradual return in broader care consumption patterns towards more normalized levels. While these directional patterns did transpire, as I noted earlier, both direct COVID-19 costs and broader utilization and broader utilization levels were above our expectations for the second quarter. Direct COVID-19 costs were highest in April, decreasing throughout the second quarter while non-COVID costs approximated baseline levels for the quarter. Both U.S. Commercial and U.S. Government total medical costs, reflecting the combined impact of direct COVID-19 and non-COVID costs, were above baseline for the quarter, with U.S. Commercial further above baseline as those customers return to utilize the health care systems at a slightly higher level. Given these developments, the second quarter medical care ratio was above our expectations. 
We now expect that the level of non-COVID costs we incurred toward the end of the second quarter will persist for the balance of the year. This, coupled with the ongoing direct COVID-19-related costs we expect to incur, has led us to raise our guidance for the full year 2021 medical care ratio.  
Turning to membership. We ended the quarter with 17 million total medical customers, an increase of 249,000 customers sequentially. The customer growth in the quarter was largely driven by new wins in middle market and growth in the individual business through the extended special enrollment period, supported by continued strong retention across our portfolio. All in, for U.S. Medical, we continue driving customer growth and expanding services while remaining focused on delivering value and supporting our customers and clients in a dynamic environment.  
In our International Markets business, second quarter adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $234 million. These results were approximately in line with our expectations. Corporate and other operations delivered a second quarter adjusted loss of $331 million. Overall, we continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders with strong growth, reflecting contributions across our businesses, led by outperformance in Evernorth. The diversified portfolio of Cigna businesses and the multiple avenues to create and ultimately capture value have allowed us to continue meeting our enterprise commitments despite ongoing uncertainties in the marketplace.  
Now turning to our updated outlook for full year 2021. We are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance for full year 2021 of at least $20.20. Before I walk through the outlook by segment, I'd like to frame the key drivers underlying this outlook. The updated components include an increase in expected earnings from Evernorth, a decrease in expected earnings from U.S. Medical driven by a higher medical care ratio, a more favorable outlook for operating expenses and other contributions that are net favorable for the year. Additionally, we now expect full year 2021 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $170 billion, representing growth of at least 9% from 2020 when excluding the divestiture of our Group Disability and Life business.  
Within our outlook, we now expect a full year COVID-19-related headwind of approximately $2.50 per share, primarily impacting our U.S. Medical business. This includes approximately 80% related to impacts on the medical care ratio and approximately 20% related to lower customer volumes due to economy-driven enrollment dynamics.  
Finally, we now expect an adjusted SG&A ratio of approximately 7.5%, an improvement relative to our prior outlook.  
I'll now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we now expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.8 billion, representing growth of at least 8% over 2020, reflecting the significant value we create for our customers and clients. For U.S. Medical, we now expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.5 billion. Underlying this updated outlook, we now expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 83% to 84% driven by our updated medical cost expectations for the second half of 2021, as I previously discussed. Regarding total medical customers, we continue to expect 2021 growth of at least 350,000 customers. All in, for full year 2021, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of at least $20.20 with the underlying drivers being an increase in expected earnings from Evernorth, a decrease in expected earnings from U.S. Medical driven by a higher medical care ratio, a more favorable outlook for operating expenses and other contributions that are net favorable for the year.  
Now moving to our 2021 capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong cash flows and returns on capital even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. I would highlight that we had some timing-related items, which impacted cash flow from operations during the second quarter. For full year 2021, we continue to expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses.  
Year-to-date, as of August 4, 2021, we have repurchased about 18 million shares for about $4.1 billion. And we now expect full year 2021 weighted average shares of 344 million to 345 million shares. On July 28, we declared a $1 per share dividend, payable on September 23 to shareholders of record as of September 8.  
Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. So now to recap. Results in the second quarter reflect strong top line growth with contributions across our businesses. Additionally, we acknowledge that the environment remains fluid as evidenced by the impact of elevated medical costs in the second quarter and on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Even with this additional pressure, our diversified portfolio and multiple earnings levers have positioned us to achieve our outlook for full year 2021, all while continuing to support our customers, clients and coworkers.  
We continue to expect 2021 full year adjusted earnings of at least $20.20 per share, and have continued confidence in delivering our long-term EPS growth rate that will average 10% to 13% per year.  
With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

And I guess that would mean the remaining is the non-COVID. I want to just confirm that. And would the COVID cost be spread relatively evenly over the course of the year -- rest of the year, Q2, Q3, Q4? And then does that become a tailwind for '22 as hopefully that reverses?"

So I -- a few different questions in there. I'll try to give you the overall picture. So as I said in my prepared comments there, we now anticipate about a $2.50 earnings per share headwind in 2021 associated with COVID. And of that, approximately 80% impacts the medical care ratio and approximately 20% is related to enrollment levels being depressed here in 2021. Focusing on the $2 per share COVID-related headwind that's impacting the medical care ratio. There's a few components underlying that. So 1 would be the impact of Medicare Advantage risk adjuster revenue headwinds here in 2021. The other component of it is the level of total cost of care that we're experiencing in 2021 compared to our prior expectations, which includes both COVID-direct costs, and it also includes non-COVID costs that returned earlier than we anticipated during the year here. 
And so I wouldn't necessarily parse the 2/3, 1/3 the way that you did, but rather look at the total cost picture being more elevated in comparison to what we had previously expected. COVID costs were highest for us in the first quarter. Within the second quarter, they were higher in April than they were in May and June, and we expect for the balance of the year that COVID costs will run at a lower level than they did in the first half of the year. So that's what's embedded in our outlook. And as I said, the non-COVID utilization, we're anticipating to run at approximately baseline levels for the back half of the year. That, plus the COVID costs we expect to incur, leads us to all-in cost levels at slightly above our baseline for the back half of 2021. And as it relates to what we expect to unwind heading into 2022. Again, if you parse apart the components of that $2 I was just making reference to, the Medicare Advantage risk adjuster headwind, we expect to fully recover in 2022. So between our bid strategies and the operational activities we're seeing, we have full confidence that we'll fully recover that component. 
The components related to total cost of care, we expect to recover a portion of that in 2022. And so a portion of that will come through pricing actions. A portion of that will come through clinical management activities. And a portion of that, we expect to be a little bit of natural abatement in aggregate costs between 2021 and 2022. So we're currently estimating that about half of that $2 per share headwind will come back in 2022 in the form of incremental earnings. So think about $1 of the $2.50 EPS headwind returning into the P&L in 2022."

So as we think about 2022, clearly early to give you a detailed guidance, but let me try to walk through the moving parts as we think about '22. Underlying our outlook will be strong base earnings growth, contributions from ongoing capital deployment and the recovery of some of the headwind that Brian articulated. There'll be an offset to that. Partially offsetting that will be the lack of some of the non-run-ratable items we're realizing in our 2021 at least $20.20 EPS outlook. So when you take it all together, we expect 2022 will be another strong year for us. As it relates to growth rates, the way I'd ask you to think about that is, first off, I take at least $20.20. When we adjust that for the non-run-ratable items, we would expect to grow at the high end of our 10% to 13% range. Another way of thinking about it, if you take at least $20.20 outlook for 2020, we would expect to grow at least 10% on that. So a net new item was the non-run-ratable items that we'll have in 2022, but an attractive growth rate on either parameter as we expect to have another strong year for 2022."

As it relates to the performance in the current year, we have some attractive growth in that business, both underlying fundamental growth as well as growth contribution from the SEP period. And as it relates to the core of your question, on performance, I'd ask you to think about the underlying -- what we're seeing, the underlying performance of that book of business is similar to the trends and impact that Brian articulated before. So we see an uptick in utilization within that book of business, more approximating from a non-COVID standpoint of baseline activity with some additional utilization on the COVID side of the equation. And lastly, our early look at the SEP special enrollment period, additional lives. Those lives are performing similar to other special enrollment period lives we've observed before. So some of the MLR that we're seeing across our broader portfolio is showing through in the individual business, but not up proportion in either way from the overall behavior of that book."

So on the first part of your question there, if I misspoke, I apologize. For the second quarter, our non-COVID utilization for Commercial was essentially at baseline.

For the back half of the year within our Commercial business, we're expecting that non-COVID utilization will continue to run at baseline and we will incur direct COVID-19-related costs, but at a lower level than what we saw in the first half of the year. So hopefully, that clarifies a bit, the commentary around Commercial and the assumptions on the back half. 
Relative to the nonrecurring items that you asked about, you could think about those as largely being SG&A oriented with the bulk of it being associated with litigation from prior years where we had some favorable developments in the quarter that allowed us to recognize some gains there. So boxing that just directionally, you should think of it as about $150 million after tax.

That opportunity is a little greater now for 2022 than it was a quarter ago from that perspective. The net new item is what Brian walked through, which are the nonrecurring items, and he gave you approximate order of magnitude. So again, to repeat to the specific part of your question, we believe today, if you take at least $20.20 that we will deliver for this year, our growth rate will be at least 10%. We believe if you take the at least $20.20 and adjust it for those nonrecurring items, that we referenced -- that Brian just referenced, the growth rate will approximate 13% or so.

On your point about behavioral health, a metric that I'll share with you just relative to prior to the pandemic within our U.S. Commercial book in 2019, about 8% of our customers were utilizing behavioral Health Services. And as you know, we have industry-leading capability in this space. This year, that number is going to be up almost 40%. So we're going to have nearly 11% of our customers this year, utilizing behavioral Health Services, which we think is a good thing for the long term, it's putting a little bit of pressure on the P&L this year, but we believe it's a good thing for the long term. in our recent acquisition of MDLIVE offers us the opportunity to further synergize that given the demand for virtual behavioral health has grown meaningfully over the course of pandemic."

So one would have to believe that either, a, the non-COVID costs are going to run above baseline for some reason that they haven't to date, when we look at the way we built up the proxy for baseline and/or that the additional COVID costs that we're saying are additive to that, will be materially greater, right? So we acknowledge it's the fluid environment beyond the shadow of a doubt.

So a few different components there to the question. Big picture compared to our expectations, I would encourage you to think about the 3 books of business, meaning the Commercial risk, the individual exchange and the Medicare Advantage as all being approximately off by the same amount compared to our expectations in terms of total claim costs. So I'd start there in terms of -- we are not seeing one being really disproportionately impacted relative to our prior expectations. They're all off by, call it, that 200 basis points or so that changed in our MCR guide. The Medicare Advantage business, though, in 2021 as further weighed down by the risk adjustment revenue headwind. So you should view the margins on the Medicare Advantage business as being particularly low relative to what our long-term expectations are. And as we step into '22, we would expect margin expansion on each of those books of business off of what we're experiencing here in '21. As it relates to the risk adjuster headwind, that's a component of the $2 per share headwind. We haven't specifically sized that. It's certainly less than half of that. I would note, we recently received our midyear settlement from CMS, which was favorable to our expectations, which gives us further confidence in our ability to fully recover that headwind in '22."

I appreciate the forward-looking orientation relative to that. To answer your question, we got a ground back into our portfolio, the 3 platforms we have, which we feel very positively about, the services-based platform within Evernorth, the U.S. Medical platform, both Commercial and Government, and then our International platform. We see attractive growth opportunities organically and inorganically in all 3 as we look to the future. Specifically, you start your real thoughtful question in terms of kind of apportionment in 5 years out. We don't have a rigid target 5 years out that we want x percent in category a or y percent in category z. But however, we do see an environment where the services portion of our portfolio will continue to grow at an accelerated rate. We see the right to win the ability to create value and our strategic position there for the multiple client segments we're able to serve there as being quite attractive, and you should expect this to continue to grow our pharmacy, our care, our benefits and our intelligence capability to be able to bring to bear against that. Secondly, we've continued to call out U.S. Government as an attractive growth segment and that will transpire both organically and inorganically as opportunities present themselves. And thirdly, we continue to see targeted opportunities in our International portfolio as attractive growth opportunities. On a final note, you articulated examples of home care, otherwise, et cetera. I won't call out any 1 precise example, but I'll step back and remind you, as we've talked about it, we see what we call alternative sites of care. So virtual, longitudinal virtual, polychronic, home care, coordinated home care as attractive additional growth opportunities within our service portfolio, and we continue to extend ourselves and expand ourselves within that space. So multiple strategic alternatives; second, strong platforms to build off of; third, the capital flexibility to be able to grow in multiple attractive markets that you appropriately called out."

So just wondering -- trying to understand how it compares in second quarter and what are you seeing in terms of acuity. And then just a follow-up on your point on expansion into U.S. Government, just kind of like if you can give us maybe a little bit more direction in terms you looking more at Medicare versus Medicaid. And should we think about expansion on the medical side? Or is it more in sort of the adjacent areas and more sort of kind of like the PBM side, the Pharmacy Service that could be expanded into sort of the Medicare and Medicaid market?"

So big picture, we're not yet seeing signs of any meaningfully higher acuity amongst our customer base. Part of that due to the focus we've had on preventive care, as you indicated in your question as well as appropriate behavioral health utilization as we talked about earlier. And just -- there are a variety of metrics that we use to track this. And just 1 really specific one I'll give you, we track within our commercial book of business when we have new cancer diagnoses, how many of them are at a metastatic stage when they're first diagnosed. And so prior to the pandemic, if you look at the top 5 cancer types, we saw 38% to 39% of these in a metastatic stage when they presented to us. In 2021, we're in that same range, 38% to 39%. So that's an indicator that we track one of many that suggests we do not yet have those signs of acuity spikes. And as I said earlier, we're also seeing a site of service shifts in the book of business, which is a mitigant over time to the potential for a QE coming back into the book.

The short answer is we see expansion opportunities in both the U.S. Medical side of the equation as well as in the Evernorth services side.

On the services side, you referenced pharmacy unequivocally, but expanded beyond pharmacy to care and benefit management services as well as intelligent services. For example, as we look to continue to serve our expanding portfolio of health plan clients. They have diverse portfolios that they serve: commercial, obviously, Medicare, Medicaid, exchange and otherwise. That's an important part of our growth chassis as we go forward with dedicated resources and then ultimately, direct to government contractor relationships as well. So we see attractive growth opportunities in the government space, both off of the health plan side of the business in the Cigna Medical portfolio as well as in the services side of the business through Evernorth."

And I appreciate the tone, but candidly, I don't feel beaten up. These are dynamic and challenging times. And we're proud of the fact that our portfolio -- our diverse portfolio can perform in this environment and importantly, deliver for our clients, our customers and patients while we deliver our responsibilities from a shareholder perspective. But I appreciate the tone of your question. 
Now specifically, as you go back in time, when we brought this portfolio together in terms of the companies, we viewed, obviously, that we had an opportunity to bring in a leading PBM portfolio of services, but it was broader than that. Secondly, we viewed, as we talk about now, that pharmacological innovation was a big part of the future of health care. And the acceleration of innovation is what we're seeing today through a whole variety of things, gene therapy, specialty, medications evolving, biosimilars, et cetera. And hence, if you're going to be helping individuals with their overall health care needs, being a leader in pharmacy services is mission-critical. We also saw the opportunity to expand that portfolio through a broader services platform, which we did through Evernorth, and then continue to feed that broader services platform for health plan clients for corporate clients, for our government clients, et cetera. 
And as we've noted, both Brian and I have noted, we're very pleased with the performance within the portfolio and the service we're delivering. And importantly, we continue to invest in that portfolio at an accelerating rate relative to expanding products, services, capabilities as well as our reach. Now as it relates to the profit model, the primary mechanisms that would articulate for you to think about is back to the time you referenced, we acknowledged that the financing models were going to change, and we didn't resist that. We offer choice. We offer choice in terms of how purchasers or clients want to finance their offering. And we've evolved, for example, with a higher percentage of pass-through arrangements for clients in the PBM services from well less than 50% to 50% to well greater than 50% over 3 cycles. And we've been able to evolve our service-based capabilities and our value creation capabilities for the benefit of clients. Secondly, we continue to press for more aligned relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers on the clinical outcomes, not just the consumptions. We know that broadly in the industry is value-based programs, but think about them as aligned programs. And then lastly, as the biosimilars start to evolve at a more rapid rate, the positioning of our company to have the clinical depth, the coordination of clinical services, the manufacturer relationships and importantly, the medical physician relationships are mission-critical. And as I use the Remicade example, all those come to bear because it's a patient-by-patient decision made with a practicing physician relative to the choices and alternatives. So again, I appreciate your question. We're pleased with the performance, but maybe even more importantly than that underlying your question, we're delighted with the strategic position that the platform gives us right now to continue to drive growth and create value going forward."

We have -- as Brian articulated earlier, we have multiple growth and profit levers, and we'll seek to make trade-offs within that and ensure that we seek to deliver an attractive, sustainable result. So I think those are the 2 major points I'd ask you to think about. I talked about the growth rate in frameworks of at least. So we weren't providing guidance to pencil a number rather how we're thinking about the growth platforms and trajectory. And there's nothing in our underlying business portfolio today. I'll leave you with, there's nothing in our underlying business portfolio today that suggests that the organic underlying growth of our earnings will be demonstrably different unless we determine we're going to make a trade-off in terms of rate and pace of investment within the portfolio or there's an exogenous impact to the industry on the cost side of the equation.

So rather than looking at quarter-by-quarter because there's quite a bit of variability that's transpired in the different months. But big picture, the first half of the year, we ran a few points above baseline in total when you combine the effect of COVID and non-COVID utilization together. For the back half of the year, we're projecting to run slightly above the baseline in totality, and that's comprised of non-COVID utilization running approximately at baseline plus COVID utilization on top of that. 
To your question on how does that pattern relative to what we saw in the first half, you should think of the direct COVID-19 related costs as being the highest in the first quarter, lower in the second quarter, and we're modeling slightly lower than that for the back half of the year on direct COVID-19-related costs. So those pieces get you to that overall expectation of slightly above baseline for the back half of the year, and that essentially offsets the seasonality we would typically see in the MCR pattern for our book of business."

I'm Alexis Jones, lead principle for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. 
In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's third quarter 2021 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2021. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. 
We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2021 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. 
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results. In the third quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item benefit of $35 million or $0.10 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, Special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. 
Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2021 outlook. We will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2021 dividend and does not assume any impact from any business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today such as our recently announced planned divestiture of life accident and supplemental benefits businesses outside of the U.S., which we expect to close in 2022.

This morning, I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about our strong results for the quarter, how we are advancing our growth strategy, and I'll provide some additional perspec",1383,"Thanks, Alexis, and thank you to everyone for joining us on our call today. This morning, I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about our strong results for the quarter, how we are advancing our growth strategy, and I'll provide some additional perspective on our 2022 outlook, and then Brian will share some more details about our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, and then we'll take your questions. 
So let's jump in. During the quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $44 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.73 per share, all while continuing to reinvest back in our business to fund growth, expansion and ongoing innovation, and we continue to return significant value to our shareholders. These results reinforce we are delivering for our customers, our patients, clients, provider partners as well as for you, our shareholders. With our high-performing health service portfolio and sharp focus on executing our strategy, we are confident in our ability to continue driving growth and are again raising our full year [ 2001 ] guidance for adjusted EPS and revenue. Our performance is strong, considering the ongoing impact of the pandemic on medical costs as well as the higher claims we've experienced amongst the special enrollment period or SEP customers within our individual business. 
As it relates to our MCR in the quarter, our commercial business did improve from the second quarter to the third quarter, and our Medicare Advantage business also improved sequentially. We continue to execute a series of actions in 2021 and 2022 to further improve our MCR, and Brian will walk through this in more detail in a few moments. Separately, in early October, we also announced an agreement with Chubb to sell our life, accident and supplemental benefits business in our international markets platform in 7 countries for $5.75 billion. 
We expect to realize about $5.4 billion in net after-tax proceeds and to complete the transaction in 2022 following regulatory approvals. Guided by our strategy and similar to our 2020 divestiture of our group insurance business, this transaction unlocks the value of the best-in-class leading asset while also enabling us to even more sharply focus our business on health and well-being services. So overall, our performance for the quarter reflects our clear strategy and strong execution in delivering attractive results and importantly, our ongoing commitment to prioritize and support the evolving health and well-being needs of those we serve. 
Now I'll walk through some additional detail for our Evernorth and U.S. Medical businesses. A year ago, we launched Evernorth to the marketplace as our health service platform, focused on servicing health plans, employers, government organizations and healthcare providers. Since that time, Evernorth has established itself with unique partnerships and innovative services that are resonating with multiple buyer groups. 
Our Evernorth pharmacy and our medical offerings through our U.S. medical platform are the 2 primary gateways through which most of our clients and customers form their base relationship with us. Wrapping around these 2 exceptionally strong platforms are our additional suites of innovative health services through Evernorth, including benefits management, care solutions and intelligence solutions. These help us to expand and deepen existing relationships. In the third quarter, Evernorth retained and expanded our relationship with the Department of Defense TRICARE pharmacy program and renewed a 7-year contract. It's our privilege to serve almost 10 million active duty service members, retirees and their families. Evernorth will continue supporting TRICARE pharmacy operations, including specialty pharmacy services, military pharmacy claims and retail network pharmacies. The new contract also allows for expansion of specialty and care coordination services through 2029. As we look through the balance of the year and into 2022, Evernorth will continue to grow revenue and earnings. 
Turning to our U.S. Medical platform. In U.S. Commercial, our teams are leveraging and deploying the innovative solutions from Evernorth to expand our service offerings and address the evolving needs of our clients and customers. For example, in our U.S. commercial platform, we are leveraging Evernorth's MDLIVE capabilities to expand virtual care options for our customers through their employers with primary, urgent, behavioral and dermatology care. As part of these value-based arrangements during virtual visits, MDLIVE physicians are leveraging our Evernorth intelligence capabilities, enabling them to provide more connected and coordinated experience. And we continue to expand our capabilities with MDLIVE as we recently launched a virtual first health plan for employers. 
Another great example of Evernorth and U.S. Commercial partnering to bring more value to our health plan clients is a new arrangement we have with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Health Plan. We will make in-network care available to UPMC customers who live work or travel outside of their network service area. UPMC has been an Evernorth Pharmacy client for 16 years, and this agreement illustrates how we are collaborating across our enterprise to deliver greater affordability and differentiated value for health plan clients. 
We are pleased how the market continues to recognize the value we are delivering through our broad suite of solutions. And as such, we continue to grow through both our U.S. commercial and Evernorth platforms. Within Medicare Advantage, consistent with our strategy, we continue to grow in our existing markets and are expanding into new geographies. Our progress is further supported by our overall value of our offerings. For 2022 calendar year, 89% of our Medicare Advantage customers will be in 4-star or greater plans nationally. This is the highest level we've ever achieved, and it marks the fifth year in a row we've improved our Star performance. And in our Individual & Family Plan business, we have driven strong growth in this year, increasing customers by 47% through the third quarter. A substantial portion of this growth did come from the extended special enrollment period. And as I previously noted, some of the MCR impact in the third quarter was driven by the medical costs amongst those we added during the outpaced SEP growth. 
We do expect this will moderate in 2022. We are positioning ourselves to build on this momentum in the individual family plan business by expanding our addressable market, again, as we enter in 3 new states and 93 new counties in 2022. These new markets offer the potential to reach an additional 1.5 million customers. The continued strength of our results and the growth we are generating through the execution of our strategy gives us confidence we will deliver against our commitments in 2021. We will deliver EPS in line with our long-term targets and revenue growth well above our long-term targets for yet another year. We will also deliver EPS within our long-term target range in 2022. 
Specifically for 2021, we are committed to delivering our increased guidance for full year adjusted EPS of at least $20.35. For full year 2021, we remain on track for generating at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, and we expect to return more than $7 billion to shareholders in 2021 through dividends and share repurchase. 
Looking to 2022, we expect to grow EPS by at least 10% off of our increased 2021 guidance of at least $20.35 per share. We anticipate a number of tailwinds, including core growth in our business, and additional contribution from margin expansion in our U.S. Medical business as we drive pricing actions, execute affordability and efficiency initiatives and benefit from the return of Medicare risk adjustment revenue to more normalized levels. 
We're also expecting year-over-year headwinds as we plan for net investment income to be more in line with historical levels. And of course, the rate and pace of ongoing strategic investments will vary from year-to-year. In short, 2022 will be another strong year for Cigna. 
Now to briefly summarize. As we've demonstrated through the quarter and throughout 2021, we are delivering for our customers, patients, clients, and provider partners as they experience the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. We are also taking significant value-enhancing actions such as divesting a portion of our international business, returning substantial amounts of capital to our shareholders and continuing to strategically invest in our capabilities and in strategic partnerships, all of which position us to continue to advance our long-term growth agenda and continue to deliver shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
172899,1685137099,2424823,"Cigna Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","The Cigna Group","Executives","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone.

During the quarter, total medical",1312,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. 
Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business, and I will discuss our updated outlook for the full year. During the quarter, total medical costs were higher than our expectations within our U.S. Medical segment, driven largely by the impact of the Delta variant in our U.S. commercial business and increased medical costs for special enrollment period customers in our U.S. individual business. Importantly, I would remind you that approximately 80% of our revenues are from service-based businesses that are not significantly exposed to medical cost fluctuations. Our balanced portfolio and multiple levers for value creation resulting in Cigna's overall revenue and earnings exceeding our third quarter expectations. This strong third quarter performance, coupled with capital deployment activities, led to an increased outlook for full year 2021, which I will discuss shortly. 
Now turning to Enterprise results. Key consolidated financial highlights in third quarter 2021 include adjusted revenue growth of 9% to $44.3 billion; adjusted earnings growth of 20% to $1.9 billion after tax and adjusted earnings per share growth of 30% to $5.73. Results in the third quarter reflect strong top and bottom line growth with contributions across all of our businesses with overall performance above our expectations. 
I'll now discuss our segment level results, and we'll then provide an update on the details of our outlook as well as our capital positioning. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Third quarter 2021 adjusted revenues grew 13% to $33.6 billion. Adjusted pharmacy script volumes increased 8% to 411 million scripts and adjusted pretax earnings grew 7% to $1.5 billion compared to third quarter 2020. Evernorth's strong results in the quarter were driven by organic growth, including strong volumes in retail and specialty pharmacy, along with ongoing efforts to improve affordability for the benefit of our clients, customers and patients and deepening of existing relationships, partially offset by significant strategic investments to support ongoing growth, including our virtual care platform and technology capabilities. 
Overall, Evernorth continues to create differentiated value for clients and customers. while driving overall revenue and earnings growth that exceeded our original expectations through the first 3 quarters of 2021. 
Turning to U.S. Medical. Third quarter adjusted revenues were $10.5 billion, and adjusted pretax earnings were approximately $1 billion. Overall, our U.S. Medical earnings exceeded our expectations during the third quarter, reflecting the impact of favorable net investment income and increased specialty contributions, partially offset by higher claim costs due to the net impact of COVID-19 and increased medical costs for special enrollment period customers in our individual business. The net effect of these claim cost impacts produced a medical care ratio of 84.4% in the third quarter. 
Looking ahead, we are actively managing overall medical costs and our MCR with a range of actions, including continuing to leverage our insights from our strong data and analytics capabilities to address key drivers and identify opportunities such as guiding customers to more effective and efficient sites of care, continued discipline in our pricing and rate actions. And we're also continuing to promote preventative care and access to behavioral services to provide meaningful support to patients and moderate overall medical costs over the longer term. 
Turning to membership. We ended the quarter with 17 million total medical customers, an increase of approximately 368,000 customers year-to-date. In U.S. Medical, the year-to-date customer growth was driven by net growth in select and mill markets within U.S. commercial and continued organic growth in Medicare Advantage and individual within U.S. government. In our International Markets business, third quarter adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $250 million. These results were in line with our expectations. Corporate and other operations delivered a third quarter adjusted loss of $275 million. Overall, Cigna's broad portfolio of services continues to serve the needs of our customers and clients. Cigna remains committed to delivering value for all of our stakeholders, leveraging our well-positioned businesses. 
Now turning to our updated outlook for full year 2021. We are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance for full year 2021 to at least $20.35 per share, reflecting the strength of the quarter, the favorable impact of our year-to-date share repurchase and acknowledgment of the ongoing fluidity of the broader environment. This represents EPS growth of at least 10% from 2020, consistent with our long-term EPS growth range of 10% to 13%, even with the ongoing challenges associated with COVID-19 and while having significantly increased our dividend in 2021. As we look forward, it is clear that COVID-19 will continue to have an impact in the fourth quarter and in 2022. And as time progresses, COVID-related impacts and the ongoing performance of the business are becoming more intertwined. Therefore, we no longer believe it's instructive to continue to quantify the impact of COVID-19. 
These dynamics are fully contemplated in our 2021 expectations for adjusted EPS of at least $20.35 and our 2022 expectations for EPS growth of at least 10% off this 2021 guidance. 
Turning to revenue. We now expect full year 2021 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $172 billion, representing growth of at least 11% from 2020 when adjusting for the divestiture of our Group Disability and Life business. I would note this revenue growth rate significantly exceeds our projected long-term average annual growth goal of 6% to 8% and represents the third consecutive year of significant revenue outperformance since our combination with Express Scripts in late 2018. 
I will now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.8 billion, representing growth of at least 8% over 2020, reflecting the significant value we create for our customers and clients. For U.S. Medical, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.5 billion. Underlying this updated outlook, we now expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84% to 84.5%, which includes our expectations for elevated medical costs for individual special enrollment period customers. 
Regarding total medical customers, we continue to expect 2021 growth of at least 350,000 customers. Now moving to our 2021 capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong cash flows and returns on capital even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. For full year 2021, we continue to expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses. Year-to-date, as of November 3, 2021, we have repurchased 26.5 million shares for $6.3 billion. And we now expect full year 2021 weighted average shares of approximately 342 million shares. This includes the impact of the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase that we announced in the third quarter. On October 27, we declared a $1 per share dividend payable on December 22 to shareholders of record as of December 7. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. 
So now to recap. Results in the third quarter reflect strong top and bottom line growth with solid contributions across our businesses. Cigna has shown the ability to deliver value through dynamic environments with our breadth of businesses and multiple earnings levers. We continue to support our customers, clients and coworkers and deliver on our financial commitments. We now expect 2021 full year adjusted earnings of at least $20.35 per share, representing growth of at least 10% from 2020, consistent with our long-term EPS growth rate range of 10% to 13%. And we expect to grow 2022 adjusted EPS at least 10% off our raised 2021 guidance.

Let me try to shape our insights relative to 2022 now that we're much deeper into 2021. First, you're right, earlier this year, we've tried to frame the magnitude of the headwind and indisputably, COVID had many disruptions to the marketplace, whether it was testing, treatment, revenue dislocation, et cetera. Against that backdrop, as you know, our broad service portfolio and our broad funding mechanisms continue to perform quite well, and we're able to deliver from a marketplace standpoint. If you think about 2021, there's really 4 big chunky items: one, we'll put it in the headwind category, the headwind created by the COVID costs and the headwind created by MRA revenue decrement; and then positives offsetting that somewhat, which were favorable net investment income and some operating expense items. Now as we think about and look at the 2022 environment, our visibility in terms of our growth outlook, our rate execution, our affordability initiatives, our efficiency initiatives and our understanding of how this year is coming to close broadly speaking, those puts and takes in 2021 largely offset one another as we step into 2022, the headwinds and tailwinds. So or at least 10% growth in 2022 off of our elevated 2021 EPS essentially represents capital deployment in line with our strategic target of 4% to 5% of accretion, and the residual leased 5% to 6% from fundamental operating growth to get us to that at least 10%. So to recap additional visibility in terms of the drivers for 2022 growth, mix of growth, rate execution, affordability. And then secondly, the puts and takes in 2021 are configuring in a way that they largely offset one another as we step into 2022 underscoring that, that at least 10% is largely fundamental for our business portfolio."

If you look at the inherent growth that Evernorth has delivered for the organization and the diversity of the growth, we're quite pleased with that. Secondly, our ability to both drive fundamental growth, continue to invest in innovation and extend our partnerships, we feel quite good. So just framing Evernorth and then coming to the MDLIVE question, our Evernorth portfolio has 4 specific portfolios of services that are positioned well: Evernorth Pharmacy, Evernorth Care, Evernorth Benefits and Evernorth Intelligence. Our positioning relative to serving health plans, large employers, expanding with governmental agencies and increasingly with healthcare providers continues to resonate well in the marketplace. For 2022, to your comment relative to some losses, we expect the retention rate in the Evernorth pharmacy business in the mid-90s, which is still a strong result even with the known losses we had identified. And given the strength we've had of growth over the last several years, we are quite committed to maintaining price discipline in the marketplace. So the business portfolio will grow yet again. Specific to MDLIVE, we're delighted to have the MDLIVE capabilities in our portfolio, and that now resides within Evernorth Care. We see the utilization of those services continue to grow. As I noted, beyond important, urgent or triage care, but to primary behavioral dermatology. And then we've recently expanded our virtual first offering. So we see it as a great opportunity to both expand access improve affordability. But finally, it presents a platform to broaden some access to care in terms of alternative side care capabilities. So in a nutshell, we're pleased. We'll grow again and we're investing in further growth, including within the virtual capabilities of MDLIVE."

Just a minute with backdrop relative to our performance in the commercial market and then I'll jump right into '22. We have a very focused strategy and a long track record over the last decade of successfully growing in the commercial marketplace as we seek to subsegment and deliver the right solutions for our respective clients in that marketplace. And if you think about it over the last decade-ish, we've generally grown low single-digit medical membership, we couple that with significant and targeted cross-selling of our new and innovative services. And then we complement that with appropriate pricing actions. And the net of that yields higher single-digit revenue growth. So that's the big picture of our strategic approach. I'd also highlight with Evernorth, we are further expanding the services that we're able to bring through to deepen relationships like our prior conversation relative to virtual care as an example. Now specific to 2022, to be clear, we'll grow again. We will clearly grow our medical customer base again. And specifically within the commercial market, we have good visibility in terms of having net growth in our national accounts and large account business portfolio. and we'll have another year of growth within our Select segment. So the net of all that of any marketplace that is competitive as we are oriented around solutions that have affordability and high engagement programs with the right funding mechanisms, we will again have another year of net growth in the U.S. commercial portfolio, and it's something we're quite proud of and positioned to continue on."

I think this was in the context of our U.S. medical performance in terms of your question on specialty. So as you reflect on our third quarter performance for that segment and again, the earnings in totality were above our expectations in the quarter. We had 2 areas of favorability. As you called out, investment income and specialty contributions and your specialty contributions include pharmacy, behavioral, dental, the full suite of portfolio capabilities we have in the specialty domain that was partly offset by the 2 sources of claims pressure that I articulated in the COVID-related pressure in commercial as well as the special enrollment period MCRs that were elevated in the individual exchange. 
Specifically on the favorability that we recorded in the third quarter, the investment income is nonrecurring. So you should not consider that to be something that would occur again in the fourth quarter or into '22. We would expect the specialty contributions to persist as favorability as we head into fourth quarter and into '22. That was a smaller component of the two in terms of the favorable items in the third quarter, but that is something we would expect to continue to persist going forward.

Our visibility has us both growing and improving our MCR within the commercial book of business. So to do that, we'll be quite disciplined, Kevin, to be clear, and we are willing to make targeted trade-offs for MCR or margin versus volume. And the net of that will yield net customer growth and net margin improvement as we step into 2022. An add-on specifically in the individual market, our visibility in the individual market is that there are significant pockets of competitiveness in certain markets. And as such, in the individual marketplace, we would expect for 2022 to see no growth or more likely negative growth, some shrinkage in our book of business, but improvement in the MCR within that portfolio and that's fully contemplated in our 2022 outlook of net growth for the portfolio as well as earnings expansion."

So as we kind of look at the potential impact of special enrollment period enrollments based on your typical attrition, it doesn't look like that's particularly material to the increase in MCR versus 2019 baseline, which is up about 400 basis points in the 3Q, and you had a lot of COVID costs, but it was up almost 400 basis points in the 2Q, and you didn't have a lot of COVID costs and you had more deferred care coming back. So I guess the question is, is there any other substantial moving parts to how you're running versus the 2019 baseline? And then just going forward, what are your -- what do you anticipate as COVID and the delta variant comes down, do you feel like commercial utilization is largely caught up or we're sort of still back in a cycle like Uber in the 2Q, where you see some of the deferred care increasing?"

So I'll try to take the various components of that question here. So if you think about where we're running in 2021 on the MCR, maybe I'll talk in terms of the full year guide, I think that's probably the most constructive way to pull it apart. The 84% to 84.5% refresh guidance that we issued. If the special enrollment period lies within the individual exchange portfolio had not grown to the level that they are and had not had the elevated MCR that they did in the quarter. We would have had an MCR performance for the full year that was more linked at the higher end of our prior guidance range. So toward the higher end of the 83% to 84% range if you exclude the impact of the individual SEP customers from the full year outlook. So just give you a little bit of dimensioning as to the materiality there. Those customer lives have built up over the course of the year. So there were not that many in the second quarter. There were many more in the third quarter. And the elevated MCR hit us particularly significantly in the third quarter, and we expect that pressure to continue into the fourth quarter. As David made reference to in a prior question, we would expect that to dissipate into 2022 as many of those lives are treat and/or choose new carriers. As it relates to other parts of the portfolio, the commercial business in the third quarter, we had some elevated COVID-related costs, particularly in August and September with the Delta variant hitting younger ages more significantly than earlier in the pandemic. So that created some elevated commercial claim cost pressure in the third quarter. I would note in our Medicare Advantage book, the MCR in the quarter was a little bit favorable to our expectations, which gives us greater confidence here as we head into 2022 on that subset of the overall U.S. medical book of business. So hopefully, it gives you a little bit of a picture for how 2021 is shaping up. 
In terms of your question on looking forward on commercial utilization, are we caught up, et cetera. We have seen much less deferred care in the commercial line of business throughout the pandemic and all the indicators that we track, whether that be preventive care utilization or whether that be rates of new cancer diagnosis, et cetera. I would tell you that there's not a significant amount of future pent-up demand or catch-up care to come. With that said, our pricing posture, as David mentioned earlier, continues to be a prioritization of margin expansion as we head into 2022."

So my point of underscoring, this has been, as you articulated and continues to be a really important part of our strategy to try to get the right value to be realized for our clients or customers and our patients.

We also saw some upside within our behavioral health offerings as demand for that has continued to grow throughout the pandemic. We saw some increased uptake there, which drove some additional margin for us within the quarter. And again, those are 2 areas we expect to persist as we head into the new year. 
Relative to stop loss, obviously, you've got to pull this 1 apart further because you got individual stop-loss cover as well as aggregate stop-loss cover and the dynamics there behave a little bit differently throughout the pandemic, meaning most COVID-related claims didn't actually hit our individual stop-loss thresholds yet. We saw a little bit of pressure earlier in the pandemic on our aggregate stop loss business. That business gets repriced along with our typical 12-month contract cycles for all the clients that we have. So we feel good about how we're positioned there on a prospective basis. I'd also note, we're seeing good demand for that product. You probably saw in the supplement there. We had 7% premium growth in our stop-loss line in the quarter-over-quarter. So feeling good about all the specialty solutions when you look at the total portfolio."

So removing that, we would have been toward the higher end of our prior guide of 83% to 84%, but a sub-bullet there is the individual open enrollment lives are actually performing pretty well. So when we look at the profitability of the overall individual portfolio, we have good performance on the standard open enrollment lives. We have more performance on the special enrollment period lives and the total picture there is therefore a bit elevated. 
Medicare Advantage, as I made reference to, actually ran a little bit favorable to our expectations in the third quarter. and then commercial was a touch higher than our projections due to the effect of the delta variant in the months of August and September, in particular. So those are the broad buckets that I paint for you as you think about what's inside the medical care ratio. 
Relative to stop loss, we do have a range of attachment points depending on the clients. So we tend to see particular popularity around $50,000, $75,000 level, but it really depends on the risk appetite for a given client. So it's hard to say that there's 1 that's always the preferred choice. We have a distribution and the distribution evolves depending on the appetite for clients at any given point in time."

I don't think there's a singular common definition in the middle market. So let me try to frame your important comment. First, as you look at our go-to-market offerings, we have a broad suite of funding alternatives and we seek to offer to our clients their respective decision of how they want to finance their purchase after the benefits are configured, after the access profile is configured, after the clinical programs are configured and the service models are configured to align, as Brian referenced before, the risk transfer and the balance relative to them. So having that broad suite is really important. If we look at the select segment, 100 to 500 life clients, it varies from year-to-year in terms of how much of the client demand is guaranteed costs versus self-funded with stop-loss, but self-funded with stop-loss has been a meaningful portion. And as you walk from that into the heart of what I might consider middle market, the further you walk up in average size on average, more demand for self-funded, less demand for risk transfer and in the -- in between range, some for shared returns of fundamentals that exist. So a little bit of linearity as you just go up in respective size from that standpoint. But the important part is choice that we offer in the marketplace and try to separate the financing decision from the design features from the program. I would say to the last part of your question, I do not believe that there's a boomerang or a reconfiguration effect that's happened that we benefited from, from a stop loss standpoint. We've seen just consistency in how we use stop loss. And I'd remind you from prior conversations, we have a large book. We have a dedicated team that manages that book because there needs to be specialization in that like many other aspects of our business. And it's both performed for clients, importantly, giving them the peace of mind and revenue predictability and expense predictability they need as well as for us over a long period of time. But I would not call out anything unique in terms of ebbing and flowing that's changed our rate of growth and stop loss over the recent past."

We have not historically walked through individual numbers there. I'd ask you to step back and remember our strategy here. We have a high cross-sell and high integrated offering within our medical business. As you think within the prior question that Matthew asked, as you go to our Select segment, think about that as 100% integrated. It is so integral to our offering. And as you move upmarket, it's more of a stand-alone sale that needs to be made. We see continued progress there, and we're pleased to either have it as an integrated part of our medical offering or a stand-alone PBM offering that we could harness and sell additional services because at the end of the day, as I called out in my prepared remarks, there are 2 fundamental ways in which a client or a customer establishes their primary health and well-being relationship, either a pharmacy relationship or largely off of a medical relationship and we're positioned to lever both.

Given the breadth of our portfolio, we're going to be able to achieve both our aggregate growth as well as our earnings objectives while maintaining price discipline in temporarily dislocated markets, and we deem that to be one. So we expect to see a net flat or decrement in our volumes in the individual exchange business and a margin improvement. I'm not going to give you a margin number. We're not guiding in detail for 2022 yet, and we typically don't guide relative to individual margins. Having said that, we expect to improve that margin from 2021 to 2022 to a more attractive and more sustainable level, and we'll maintain the discipline there. As it relates to intermediate to long term, we continue to see this as a growth market. But as we've manage it and as we demonstrated over time, if there are temporary dislocations, we'll maintain discipline, and we'll lever other parts of the business to ensure the portfolio delivers. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we've entered 3 more states and almost 100 additional counties to give us access to an addressable market of approximately 1.5 million additional customers to sell to. And we've been in this marketplace since its inception in 2014. And we have a track record of sustained performance, albeit episodically needing to sharpen focus as we will in 2022, given the market conditions."

So we understand that fully. Big picture, stepping back, any initiatives that are constructive and sustainable that improve affordability and value for individuals, we're actively open to engaged in and generally supportive of. Specifically in the pharmacy space where you double-click down on, we think the most meaningful way that's sustainable policy change that could further affordability is to stimulate and further accelerate more competition. And if I harken back as an example, to make it tangible, hepatitis C was, I think, a very positive example that reinforces that. That is the marketplace rapidly move from 1 to 2 suppliers for hepatitis C services, which was a breakthrough drug that society benefits from to your overall affordability change dramatically. That's an action that is different than who's negotiating or it's very different than putting an artificial cap on a rate of growth from that standpoint. So big picture, we will await the specific details, and we will remain actively engaged, no doubt. We believe the most sustainable way to further improve affordability is to expand choice and expand competition. That's what's worked in the marketplace in the model. And lastly, prior conversations, we've had our well-performing and broad portfolio of pharmacy services and tools is well positioned to be able to deliver value in a changing environment, and we're confident and the capabilities we have over the strategic horizon here."

So again, roughly about 1% of total script volumes for Evernorth, not a material contribution from an income standpoint. And if that number goes up or down next year, it won't materially move the needle for the Evernorth segment. 
More broadly, on the second part of your question, as we think about specialty generics and you can even broaden that to include bio-similars. We're really excited about those for the future from the standpoint of driving affordability on behalf of our clients and customers. We think competition is a good thing. And ultimately, specialty generics, while the timing with which they're introduced is hard to predict and does create some variability in our quarterly income patterns, ultimately, we view that as a great thing for our clients, customers and ultimately, for our business. And fortunately, we have a wide range of earnings levers that allow us to capture value in a variety of ways depending on how different client contracts are constructed. So we're really excited about specialty generics and bio-similars going forward."

I'm Alexis Jones, lead principle for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer.
In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's third quarter 2021 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2021. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. 
A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.  
We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2021 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.  
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the third quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item benefit of $35 million or $0.10 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results.  
Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2021 outlook. We will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2021 dividend and does not assume any impact from any business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today such as our recently announced planned divestiture of life accident and supplemental benefits businesses outside of the U.S., which we expect to close in 2022.  
With that, I will turn the call over to David."

This morning, I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about our strong results for the quarter, how we are advancing our growth strategy, and I'll provide some additional perspective on our 2022 outlook, and then Brian will share some more details about our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, and then we'll take your questions.  
So let's jump in. During the quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $44 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.73 per share, all while continuing to reinvest back in our business to fund growth, expansion and ongoing innovation, and we continue to return significant value to our shareholders. 
These results reinforce we are delivering for our customers, our patients, clients, provider partners as well as for you, our shareholders. With our high-performing health service portfolio and sharp focus on executing our strategy, we are confident in our ability to continue driving growth and are again raising our full year [ 2021 ] guidance for adjusted EPS and revenue. Our performance is strong, considering the ongoing impact of the pandemic on medical costs as well as the higher claims we've experienced amongst the special enrollment period or SEP customers within our individual business.  
As it relates to our MCR in the quarter, our commercial business did improve from the second quarter to the third quarter, and our Medicare Advantage business also improved sequentially. We continue to execute a series of actions in 2021 and 2022 to further improve our MCR, and Brian will walk through this in more detail in a few moments. 
Separately, in early October, we also announced an agreement with Chubb to sell our life, accident and supplemental benefits business in our international markets platform in 7 countries for $5.75 billion.  
We expect to realize about $5.4 billion in net after-tax proceeds and to complete the transaction in 2022 following regulatory approvals. Guided by our strategy and similar to our 2020 divestiture of our group insurance business, this transaction unlocks the value of the best-in-class leading asset while also enabling us to even more sharply focus our business on health and well-being services. 
So overall, our performance for the quarter reflects our clear strategy and strong execution in delivering attractive results and importantly, our ongoing commitment to prioritize and support the evolving health and well-being needs of those we serve.  
Now I'll walk through some additional detail for our Evernorth and U.S. Medical businesses. A year ago, we launched Evernorth to the marketplace as our health service platform, focused on servicing health plans, employers, government organizations and healthcare providers. Since that time, Evernorth has established itself with unique partnerships and innovative services that are resonating with multiple buyer groups.  
Our Evernorth pharmacy and our medical offerings through our U.S. medical platform are the 2 primary gateways through which most of our clients and customers form their base relationship with us. 
Wrapping around these 2 exceptionally strong platforms are our additional suites of innovative health services through Evernorth, including benefits management, care solutions and intelligence solutions. These help us to expand and deepen existing relationships. In the third quarter, Evernorth retained and expanded our relationship with the Department of Defense TRICARE pharmacy program and renewed a 7-year contract. It's our privilege to serve almost 10 million active duty service members, retirees and their families. 
Evernorth will continue supporting TRICARE pharmacy operations, including specialty pharmacy services, military pharmacy claims and retail network pharmacies. The new contract also allows for expansion of specialty and care coordination services through 2029. As we look through the balance of the year and into 2022, Evernorth will continue to grow revenue and earnings.  
Turning to our U.S. Medical platform. In U.S. Commercial, our teams are leveraging and deploying the innovative solutions from Evernorth to expand our service offerings and address the evolving needs of our clients and customers. For example, in our U.S. commercial platform, we are leveraging Evernorth's MDLIVE capabilities to expand virtual care options for our customers through their employers with primary, urgent, behavioral and dermatology care. 
As part of these value-based arrangements during virtual visits, MDLIVE physicians are leveraging our Evernorth intelligence capabilities, enabling them to provide more connected and coordinated experience. And we continue to expand our capabilities with MDLIVE as we recently launched a virtual first health plan for employers.  
Another great example of Evernorth and U.S. Commercial partnering to bring more value to our health plan clients is a new arrangement we have with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Health Plan. We will make in-network care available to UPMC customers who live, work or travel outside of their network service area. UPMC has been an Evernorth Pharmacy client for 16 years, and this agreement illustrates how we are collaborating across our enterprise to deliver greater affordability and differentiated value for health plan clients.  
We are pleased how the market continues to recognize the value we are delivering through our broad suite of solutions. And as such, we continue to grow through both our U.S. commercial and Evernorth platforms. Within Medicare Advantage, consistent with our strategy, we continue to grow in our existing markets and are expanding into new geographies. Our progress is further supported by our overall value of our offerings. For 2022 calendar year, 89% of our Medicare Advantage customers will be in four-Star or greater plans nationally. 
This is the highest level we've ever achieved, and it marks the fifth year in a row we've improved our Star's performance. And in our Individual & Family Plan business, we have driven strong growth in this year, increasing customers by 47% through the third quarter. A substantial portion of this growth did come from the extended special enrollment period. And as I previously noted, some of the MCR impact in the third quarter was driven by the medical costs amongst those we added during the outpaced SEP growth.  
We do expect this will moderate in 2022. We are positioning ourselves to build on this momentum in the individual family plan business by expanding our addressable market, again, as we enter in 3 new states and 93 new counties in 2022. These new markets offer the potential to reach an additional 1.5 million customers. The continued strength of our results and the growth we are generating through the execution of our strategy gives us confidence we will deliver against our commitments in 2021. We will deliver EPS in line with our long-term targets and revenue growth well above our long-term targets for yet another year. We will also deliver EPS within our long-term target range in 2022.  
Specifically for 2021, we are committed to delivering our increased guidance for full year adjusted EPS of at least $20.35. For full year 2021, we remain on track for generating at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, and we expect to return more than $7 billion to shareholders in 2021 through dividends and share repurchase.  
Looking to 2022, we expect to grow EPS by at least 10% off of our increased 2021 guidance of at least $20.35 per share. We anticipate a number of tailwinds, including core growth in our business, and additional contribution from margin expansion in our U.S. Medical business as we drive pricing actions, execute affordability and efficiency initiatives and benefit from the return of Medicare risk adjustment revenue to more normalized levels.  
We're also expecting year-over-year headwinds as we plan for net investment income to be more in line with historical levels. And of course, the rate and pace of ongoing strategic investments will vary from year-to-year. In short, 2022 will be another strong year for Cigna.  
Now to briefly summarize. As we've demonstrated through the quarter and throughout 2021, we are delivering for our customers, patients, clients, and provider partners as they experience the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. We are also taking significant value-enhancing actions such as divesting a portion of our international business, returning substantial amounts of capital to our shareholders and continuing to strategically invest in our capabilities and in strategic partnerships. All of which position us to continue to advance our long-term growth agenda and continue to deliver shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business, and I will discuss our updated outlook for the full year. 
During the quarter, total medical costs were higher than our expectations within our U.S. Medical segment, driven largely by the impact of the Delta variant in our U.S. commercial business and increased medical costs for special enrollment period customers in our U.S. individual business. Importantly, I would remind you that approximately 80% of our revenues are from service-based businesses that are not significantly exposed to medical cost fluctuations. 
Our balanced portfolio and multiple levers for value creation resulting in Cigna's overall revenue and earnings exceeding our third quarter expectations. This strong third quarter performance, coupled with capital deployment activities, led to an increased outlook for full year 2021, which I will discuss shortly.  
Now turning to Enterprise results. Key consolidated financial highlights in third quarter 2021 include adjusted revenue growth of 9% to $44.3 billion; adjusted earnings growth of 20% to $1.9 billion after tax and adjusted earnings per share growth of 30% to $5.73. Results in the third quarter reflect strong top and bottom line growth with contributions across all of our businesses with overall performance above our expectations.  
I'll now discuss our segment level results, and we'll then provide an update on the details of our outlook as well as our capital positioning. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Third quarter 2021 adjusted revenues grew 13% to $33.6 billion. Adjusted pharmacy script volumes increased 8% to 411 million scripts and adjusted pretax earnings grew 7% to $1.5 billion compared to third quarter 2020. Evernorth's strong results in the quarter were driven by organic growth, including strong volumes in retail and specialty pharmacy, along with ongoing efforts to improve affordability for the benefit of our clients, customers and patients and deepening of existing relationships, partially offset by significant strategic investments to support ongoing growth, including our virtual care platform and technology capabilities.  
Overall, Evernorth continues to create differentiated value for clients and customers. while driving overall revenue and earnings growth that exceeded our original expectations through the first 3 quarters of 2021.  
Turning to U.S. Medical. Third quarter adjusted revenues were $10.5 billion, and adjusted pretax earnings were approximately $1 billion. Overall, our U.S. medical earnings exceeded our expectations during the third quarter, reflecting the impact of favorable net investment income and increased specialty contributions, partially offset by higher claim costs due to the net impact of COVID-19 and increased medical costs for special enrollment period customers in our individual business. The net effect of these claim cost impacts produced a medical care ratio of 84.4% in the third quarter.  
Looking ahead, we are actively managing overall medical costs and our MCR with a range of actions, including continuing to leverage our insights from our strong data and analytics capabilities to address key drivers and identify opportunities such as guiding customers to more effective and efficient sites of care, continued discipline in our pricing and rate actions. And we're also continuing to promote preventative care and access to behavioral services to provide meaningful support to patients and moderate overall medical costs over the longer term.  
Turning to membership. We ended the quarter with 17 million total medical customers, an increase of approximately 368,000 customers year-to-date. In U.S. Medical, the year-to-date customer growth was driven by net growth in select and mill markets within U.S. commercial and continued organic growth in Medicare Advantage and individual within U.S. government. 
In our International Markets business, third quarter adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $250 million. These results were in line with our expectations. Corporate and other operations delivered a third quarter adjusted loss of $275 million. Overall, Cigna's broad portfolio of services continues to serve the needs of our customers and clients. Cigna remains committed to delivering value for all of our stakeholders, leveraging our well-positioned businesses.  
Now turning to our updated outlook for full year 2021. We are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance for full year 2021 to at least $20.35 per share, reflecting the strength of the quarter, the favorable impact of our year-to-date share repurchase and acknowledgment of the ongoing fluidity of the broader environment. This represents EPS growth of at least 10% from 2020, consistent with our long-term EPS growth range of 10% to 13%, even with the ongoing challenges associated with COVID-19 and while having significantly increased our dividend in 2021. As we look forward, it is clear that COVID-19 will continue to have an impact in the fourth quarter and in 2022. And as time progresses, COVID-related impacts and the ongoing performance of the business are becoming more intertwined. Therefore, we no longer believe it's instructive to continue to quantify the impact of COVID-19.  
These dynamics are fully contemplated in our 2021 expectations for adjusted EPS of at least $20.35 and our 2022 expectations for EPS growth of at least 10% off this 2021 guidance.  
Turning to revenue. We now expect full year 2021 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $172 billion, representing growth of at least 11% from 2020 when adjusting for the divestiture of our Group Disability and Life business. I would note this revenue growth rate significantly exceeds our projected long-term average annual growth goal of 6% to 8% and represents the third consecutive year of significant revenue outperformance since our combination with Express Scripts in late 2018.  
I will now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.8 billion, representing growth of at least 8% over 2020, reflecting the significant value we create for our customers and clients. For U.S. Medical, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.5 billion. Underlying this updated outlook, we now expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84% to 84.5%, which includes our expectations for elevated medical costs for individual special enrollment period customers.  
Regarding total medical customers, we continue to expect 2021 growth of at least 350,000 customers. Now moving to our 2021 capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong cash flows and returns on capital, even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. For full year 2021, we continue to expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses. 
Year-to-date, as of November 3, 2021, we have repurchased 26.5 million shares for $6.3 billion. And we now expect full year 2021 weighted average shares of approximately 342 million shares. This includes the impact of the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase that we announced in the third quarter. On October 27, we declared a $1 per share dividend payable on December 22 to shareholders of record as of December 7. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital.  
So now to recap. Results in the third quarter reflect strong top and bottom line growth with solid contributions across our businesses. Cigna has shown the ability to deliver value through dynamic environments with our breadth of businesses and multiple earnings levers. We continue to support our customers, clients and coworkers and deliver on our financial commitments. We now expect 2021 full year adjusted earnings of at least $20.35 per share, representing growth of at least 10% from 2020, consistent with our long-term EPS growth rate range of 10% to 13%. And we expect to grow 2022 adjusted EPS at least 10% off our raised 2021 guidance.

Let me try to shape our insights relative to 2022 now that we're much deeper into 2021. First, you're right, earlier this year, we've tried to frame the magnitude of the headwind and indisputably, COVID had many disruptions to the marketplace, whether it was testing, treatment, revenue dislocation, et cetera. 
Against that backdrop, as you know, our broad service portfolio and our broad funding mechanisms continue to perform quite well, and we're able to deliver from a marketplace standpoint. If you think about 2021, there's really 4 big chunky items: one, we'll put it in the headwind category, the headwind created by the COVID costs and the headwind created by MRA revenue decrement; and then positives offsetting that somewhat, which were favorable net investment income and some operating expense items. 
Now as we think about and look at the 2022 environment, our visibility in terms of our growth outlook, our rate execution, our affordability initiatives, our efficiency initiatives and our understanding of how this year is coming to close broadly speaking, those puts and takes in 2021 largely offset one another as we step into 2022, the headwinds and tailwinds. So or at least 10% growth in 2022 off of our elevated 2021 EPS essentially represents capital deployment in line with our strategic target of 4% to 5% of accretion, and the residual leased 5% to 6% from fundamental operating growth to get us to that at least 10%. 
So to recap additional visibility in terms of the drivers for 2022 growth, mix of growth, rate execution, affordability. And then secondly, the puts and takes in 2021 are configuring in a way that they largely offset one another as we step into 2022 underscoring that at least 10% is largely fundamental for our business portfolio."

If you look at the inherent growth that Evernorth has delivered for the organization and the diversity of the growth, we're quite pleased with that. Secondly, our ability to both drive fundamental growth, continue to invest in innovation and extend our partnerships, we feel quite good. So just framing Evernorth and then coming to the MDLIVE question, our Evernorth portfolio has 4 specific portfolios of services that are positioned well: Evernorth Pharmacy, Evernorth Care, Evernorth Benefits and Evernorth Intelligence. 
Our positioning relative to serving health plans, large employers, expanding with governmental agencies and increasingly with healthcare providers continues to resonate well in the marketplace. For 2022, to your comment relative to some losses, we expect the retention rate in the Evernorth pharmacy business in the mid-90s, which is still a strong result even with the known losses we had identified. And given the strength we've had of growth over the last several years, we are quite committed to maintaining price discipline in the marketplace. So the business portfolio will grow yet again. 
Specific to MDLIVE, we're delighted to have the MDLIVE capabilities in our portfolio, and that now resides within Evernorth Care. We see the utilization of those services continue to grow. As I noted, beyond important, urgent or triage care, but to primary behavioral dermatology. And then we've recently expanded our virtual first offering. So we see it as a great opportunity to both expand access improve affordability. But finally, it presents a platform to broaden some access to care in terms of alternative side care capabilities. So in a nutshell, we're pleased. We'll grow again and we're investing in further growth, including within the virtual capabilities of MDLIVE."

But using our strategy as a guide, the important underscore here, our strategy guides us to further enhance and deepen our health and well-being solutions. This portion of our portfolio was less directly aligned over time to that. So we use the strategy as a guide #1. 
Two, we feel very good about the value realization and the net value realization here is quite important in terms of a high-performing asset, and I appreciate your correlation to the group transaction, another high-performing asset where we felt quite good about using our strategy as a guide and capitalizing on a very attractive valuation.

As you look at the timing of when dividends were available to be extracted as an example. 
In terms of deployment with the proceeds, the broad template, as David made reference to our group disability and life divestiture is what we would expect to follow in this instance as well with the exception of we don't have the same need for long-term debt repayment as we did with the Group Disability and Life transaction. So we would expect the primary use to be for share repurchase.

We have a very focused strategy and a long track record over the last decade of successfully growing in the commercial marketplace as we seek to subsegment and deliver the right solutions for our respective clients in that marketplace. And if you think about it over the last decade-ish, we've generally grown low single-digit medical membership, we coupled that with significant and targeted cross-selling of our new and innovative services. And then we complement that with appropriate pricing actions. And the net of that yields higher single-digit revenue growth. So that's the big picture of our strategic approach. 
I'd also highlight with Evernorth, we are further expanding the services that we're able to bring through to deepen relationships like our prior conversation relative to virtual care as an example. 
Now specific to 2022, to be clear, we'll grow again. We will clearly grow our medical customer base again. And specifically within the commercial market, we have good visibility in terms of having net growth in our national accounts and large account business portfolio and we'll have another year of growth within our Select segment.

As you called out, investment income and specialty contributions and your specialty contributions include pharmacy, behavioral, dental, the full suite of portfolio capabilities we have in the specialty domain that was partly offset by the 2 sources of claims pressure that I articulated in the COVID-related pressure in commercial as well as the special enrollment period, MCRs that were elevated in the individual exchange. 
Specifically on the favorability that we recorded in the third quarter, the investment income is nonrecurring. So you should not consider that to be something that would occur again in the fourth quarter or into '22. We would expect the specialty contributions to persist as favorability as we head into fourth quarter and into '22.

 Our visibility has us both growing and improving our MCR within the commercial book of business. So to do that, we'll be quite disciplined, Kevin, to be clear, and we are willing to make targeted trade-offs for MCR or margin versus volume. And the net of that will yield net customer growth and net margin improvement as we step into 2022. 
An add-on specifically in the individual market, our visibility in the individual market is that there are significant pockets of competitiveness in certain markets. And as such, in the individual marketplace, we would expect for 2022 to see no growth or more likely negative growth, some shrinkage in our book of business, but improvement in the MCR within that portfolio and that's fully contemplated in our 2022 outlook of net growth for the portfolio as well as earnings expansion."

So as we kind of look at the potential impact of special enrollment period enrollees based on your typical attrition, it doesn't look like that's particularly material to the increase in MCR versus 2019 baseline, which is up about 400 basis points in the 3Q, and you had a lot of COVID costs, but it was up almost 400 basis points in the 2Q, and you didn't have a lot of COVID costs and you had more deferred care coming back. 
So I guess the question is, is there any other substantial moving parts to how you're running versus the 2019 baseline? And then just going forward, what are your -- what do you anticipate as COVID and the Delta variant comes down, do you feel like commercial utilization is largely caught up or we're sort of still back in a cycle like we burn the 2Q, where you see some of the deferred care increasing?"

So I'll try to take the various components of that question here. So if you think about where we're running in 2021 on the MCR, maybe I'll talk in terms of the full year guide, I think that's probably the most constructive way to pull it apart. The 84% to 84.5% refresh guidance that we issued. If the special enrollment period lies within the individual exchange portfolio had not grown to the level that they are and had not had the elevated MCR that they did in the quarter, we would have had an MCR performance for the full year that was more linked at the higher end of our prior guidance range. 
So toward the higher end of the 83% to 84% range, if you exclude the impact of the individual SEP customers from the full year outlook. So just give you a little bit of dimensioning as to the materiality there. Those customer lives have built up over the course of the year. So there were not that many in the second quarter. There were many more in the third quarter. And the elevated MCR hit us particularly significantly in the third quarter, and we expect that pressure to continue into the fourth quarter. 
As David made reference to in a prior question, we would expect that to dissipate into 2022 as many of those lives attrite and/or choose new carriers. As it relates to other parts of the portfolio, the commercial business in the third quarter, we had some elevated COVID-related costs, particularly in August and September with the Delta variant hitting younger ages more significantly than earlier in the pandemic. So that created some elevated commercial claim cost pressure in the third quarter. I would note in our Medicare Advantage book, the MCR in the quarter was a little bit favorable to our expectations, which gives us greater confidence here as we head into 2022 on that subset of the overall U.S. medical book of business. So hopefully, it gives you a little bit of a picture for how 2021 is shaping up. 
In terms of your question on looking forward on commercial utilization, are we caught up, et cetera. We have seen much less deferred care in the commercial line of business throughout the pandemic and all the indicators that we track, whether that be preventive care utilization or whether that be rates of new cancer diagnosis, et cetera. I would tell you that there's not a significant amount of future pent-up demand or catch-up care to come. 
With that said, our pricing posture, as David mentioned earlier, continues to be a prioritization of margin expansion as we head into 2022."

We also saw some upside within our behavioral health offerings as demand for that has continued to grow throughout the pandemic. We saw some increased uptake there, which drove some additional margin for us within the quarter. And again, those are 2 areas we expect to persist as we head into the new year. 
Relative to stop loss, obviously, you've got to pull this one apart further because you got individual stop-loss cover as well as aggregate stop-loss cover and the dynamics there behaved a little bit differently throughout the pandemic, meaning most COVID-related claims didn't actually hit our individual stop-loss thresholds yet. We saw a little bit of pressure earlier in the pandemic on our aggregate stop loss business. That business gets repriced along with our typical 12-month contract cycles for all the clients that we have. So we feel good about how we're positioned there on a prospective basis. 
I'd also note, we're seeing good demand for that product. You probably saw in the supplement there. We had 7% premium growth in our stop-loss line in the quarter-over-quarter. So feeling good about all the specialty solutions when you look at the total portfolio."

For the full year, as I mentioned earlier, the refresh 84% to 84.5% outlook reflects particular pressure from the individual exchange lives and specifically the special enrollment period in enrollees. So removing that, we would have been toward the higher end of our prior guide of 83% to 84%, but a sub-bullet there is the individual open enrollment lives are actually performing pretty well. So when we look at the profitability of the overall individual portfolio, we have good performance on the standard open enrollment lives. We have more performance on the special enrollment period lives and the total picture there is therefore a bit elevated. 
Medicare Advantage, as I made reference to, actually ran a little bit favorable to our expectations in the third quarter. and then commercial was a touch higher than our projections due to the effect of the delta variant in the months of August and September, in particular. So those are the broad buckets that I paint for you as you think about what's inside the medical care ratio. 
Relative to stop loss, we do have a range of attachment points depending on the clients. So we tend to see particular popularity around $50,000, $75,000 level, but it really depends on the risk appetite for a given client. So it's hard to say that there's one that's always the preferred choice. We have a distribution and the distribution evolves depending on the appetite for clients at any given point in time."

But should we think about -- is that still the usable framework going into '22? Or should we think about maybe less operational growth and maybe more from capital deployment? Just any additional thoughts around those components might help, knowing that it's preliminary right now."

And we think that's an appropriate and prudent and attractive outlook given the fluid and dynamism of the marketplace.

I don't think there's a singular common definition of middle market. So let me try to frame your important comment. First, as you look at our go-to-market offerings, we have a broad suite of funding alternatives and we seek to offer to our clients their respective decision of how they want to finance their purchase, after the benefits are configured, after the access profile is configured, after the clinical programs are configured and the service models are configured to align, as Brian referenced before, the risk transfer and the balance relative to them. 
So having that broad suite is really important. If we look at the select segment, 100 to 500 life clients, it varies from year-to-year in terms of how much of the client demand is guaranteed costs versus self-funded with stoploss, but self-funded with stoploss has been a meaningful portion. And as you walk from that into the heart of what I might consider middle market, the further you walk up in average size on average, more demand for self-funded, less demand for risk transfer and in the -- in between range, some for shared returns of fundamentals that exist. 
So a little bit of linearity as you just go up in respective size from that standpoint. But the important part is choice that we offer in the marketplace and try to separate the financing decision from the design features from the program. I would say to the last part of your question, I do not believe that there's a boomerang or a reconfiguration effect that's happened that we benefited from, from a stop loss standpoint. We've seen just consistency in how we use stoploss. And I'd remind you from prior conversations, we have a large book. We have a dedicated team that manages that book because there needs to be specialization in that like many other aspects of our business. And it's both performed for clients, importantly, giving them the peace of mind and revenue predictability and expense predictability they need as well as for us over a long period of time. But I would not call out anything unique in terms of ebbing and flowing that's changed our rate of growth and stop loss over the recent past."

We have not historically walked through individual numbers there. I'd ask you to step back and remember our strategy here. We have a high cross-sell and high integrated offering within our medical business. As you think within the prior question that Matthew asked, as you go to our Select segment, think about that as 100% integrated. It is so integral to our offering. 
And as you move upmarket, it's more of a stand-alone sale that needs to be made. We see continued progress there, and we're pleased to either have it as an integrated part of our medical offering or a stand-alone PBM offering that we could harness and sell additional services because at the end of the day, as I called out in my prepared remarks, there are 2 fundamental ways in which a client or a customer establishes their primary health and well-being relationship, either a pharmacy relationship or largely off of a medical relationship and we're positioned to lever both. 
So I would leave you with a directional answer on the PBM commercial. Brian referenced PBM strength or pharma strength in our commercial portfolio. That's a net positive, and we continue to see traction both on stand-alone pharmacy as well as integrated pharmacy within our business."

Given the breadth of our portfolio, we're going to be able to achieve both our aggregate growth as well as our earnings objectives while maintaining price discipline in temporarily dislocated markets, and we deem that to be one.

Having said that, we expect to improve that margin from 2021 to 2022 to a more attractive and more sustainable level, and we'll maintain the discipline there. 
As it relates to intermediate to long term, we continue to see this as a growth market.

So we understand that fully. 
Big picture, stepping back, any initiatives that are constructive and sustainable that improve affordability and value for individuals, we're actively open to engaged in and generally supportive of. Specifically in the pharmacy space where you double-click down on, we think the most meaningful way that's sustainable policy change that could further affordability is to stimulate and further accelerate more competition. And if I harken back as an example, to make it tangible, hepatitis C was, I think, a very positive example that reinforces that. That is the marketplace rapidly move from 1 to 2 suppliers for hepatitis C services, which was a breakthrough drug that society benefits from the overall affordability change dramatically. That's an action that is different than who's negotiating or it's very different than putting an artificial cap on a rate of growth from that standpoint. 
So big picture. We will await the specific details, and we will remain actively engaged, no doubt. We believe the most sustainable way to further improve affordability is to expand choice and expand competition. That's what's worked in the marketplace in the model. And lastly, prior conversations, we've had our well-performing and broad portfolio of pharmacy services and tools is well positioned to be able to deliver value in a changing environment, and we're confident and the capabilities we have over the strategic horizon here."

In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's third quarter 2021 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2021. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. 
A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.  
We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2021 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.  
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the third quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item benefit of $35 million or $0.10 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results.  
Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2021 outlook. We will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2021 dividend and does not assume any impact from any business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today such as our recently announced planned divestiture of life accident and supplemental benefits businesses outside of the U.S., which we expect to close in 2022.  
With that, I will turn the call over to David."

With our high-performing health service portfolio and sharp focus on executing our strategy, we are confident in our ability to continue driving growth and are again raising our full year [ 2021 ] guidance for adjusted EPS and revenue. Our performance is strong, considering the ongoing impact of the pandemic on medical costs as well as the higher claims we've experienced amongst the special enrollment period or SEP customers within our individual business.  
As it relates to our MCR in the quarter, our commercial business did improve from the second quarter to the third quarter, and our Medicare Advantage business also improved sequentially. We continue to execute a series of actions in 2021 and 2022 to further improve our MCR, and Brian will walk through this in more detail in a few moments. 
Separately, in early October, we also announced an agreement with Chubb to sell our life, accident and supplemental benefits business in our international markets platform in 7 countries for $5.75 billion.  
We expect to realize about $5.4 billion in net after-tax proceeds and to complete the transaction in 2022 following regulatory approvals. Guided by our strategy and similar to our 2020 divestiture of our group insurance business, this transaction unlocks the value of the best-in-class leading asset while also enabling us to even more sharply focus our business on health and well-being services. 
So overall, our performance for the quarter reflects our clear strategy and strong execution in delivering attractive results and importantly, our ongoing commitment to prioritize and support the evolving health and well-being needs of those we serve.  
Now I'll walk through some additional detail for our Evernorth and U.S. Medical businesses. A year ago, we launched Evernorth to the marketplace as our health service platform, focused on servicing health plans, employers, government organizations and healthcare providers. Since that time, Evernorth has established itself with unique partnerships and innovative services that are resonating with multiple buyer groups.  
Our Evernorth pharmacy and our medical offerings through our U.S. medical platform are the 2 primary gateways through which most of our clients and customers form their base relationship with us. 
Wrapping around these 2 exceptionally strong platforms are our additional suites of innovative health services through Evernorth, including benefits management, care solutions and intelligence solutions. These help us to expand and deepen existing relationships. In the third quarter, Evernorth retained and expanded our relationship with the Department of Defense TRICARE pharmacy program and renewed a 7-year contract. It's our privilege to serve almost 10 million active duty service members, retirees and their families. 
Evernorth will continue supporting TRICARE pharmacy operations, including specialty pharmacy services, military pharmacy claims and retail network pharmacies. The new contract also allows for expansion of specialty and care coordination services through 2029. As we look through the balance of the year and into 2022, Evernorth will continue to grow revenue and earnings.  
Turning to our U.S. Medical platform. In U.S. Commercial, our teams are leveraging and deploying the innovative solutions from Evernorth to expand our service offerings and address the evolving needs of our clients and customers. For example, in our U.S. commercial platform, we are leveraging Evernorth's MDLIVE capabilities to expand virtual care options for our customers through their employers with primary, urgent, behavioral and dermatology care. 
As part of these value-based arrangements during virtual visits, MDLIVE physicians are leveraging our Evernorth intelligence capabilities, enabling them to provide more connected and coordinated experience. And we continue to expand our capabilities with MDLIVE as we recently launched a virtual first health plan for employers.  
Another great example of Evernorth and U.S. Commercial partnering to bring more value to our health plan clients is a new arrangement we have with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Health Plan. We will make in-network care available to UPMC customers who live, work or travel outside of their network service area. UPMC has been an Evernorth Pharmacy client for 16 years, and this agreement illustrates how we are collaborating across our enterprise to deliver greater affordability and differentiated value for health plan clients.  
We are pleased how the market continues to recognize the value we are delivering through our broad suite of solutions. And as such, we continue to grow through both our U.S. commercial and Evernorth platforms. Within Medicare Advantage, consistent with our strategy, we continue to grow in our existing markets and are expanding into new geographies. Our progress is further supported by our overall value of our offerings. For 2022 calendar year, 89% of our Medicare Advantage customers will be in four-Star or greater plans nationally. 
This is the highest level we've ever achieved, and it marks the fifth year in a row we've improved our Star's performance. And in our Individual & Family Plan business, we have driven strong growth in this year, increasing customers by 47% through the third quarter. A substantial portion of this growth did come from the extended special enrollment period. And as I previously noted, some of the MCR impact in the third quarter was driven by the medical costs amongst those we added during the outpaced SEP growth.  
We do expect this will moderate in 2022. We are positioning ourselves to build on this momentum in the individual family plan business by expanding our addressable market, again, as we enter in 3 new states and 93 new counties in 2022. These new markets offer the potential to reach an additional 1.5 million customers. The continued strength of our results and the growth we are generating through the execution of our strategy gives us confidence we will deliver against our commitments in 2021. We will deliver EPS in line with our long-term targets and revenue growth well above our long-term targets for yet another year. We will also deliver EPS within our long-term target range in 2022.  
Specifically for 2021, we are committed to delivering our increased guidance for full year adjusted EPS of at least $20.35. For full year 2021, we remain on track for generating at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, and we expect to return more than $7 billion to shareholders in 2021 through dividends and share repurchase.  
Looking to 2022, we expect to grow EPS by at least 10% off of our increased 2021 guidance of at least $20.35 per share. We anticipate a number of tailwinds, including core growth in our business, and additional contribution from margin expansion in our U.S. Medical business as we drive pricing actions, execute affordability and efficiency initiatives and benefit from the return of Medicare risk adjustment revenue to more normalized levels.  
We're also expecting year-over-year headwinds as we plan for net investment income to be more in line with historical levels. And of course, the rate and pace of ongoing strategic investments will vary from year-to-year. In short, 2022 will be another strong year for Cigna.  
Now to briefly summarize. As we've demonstrated through the quarter and throughout 2021, we are delivering for our customers, patients, clients, and provider partners as they experience the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. We are also taking significant value-enhancing actions such as divesting a portion of our international business, returning substantial amounts of capital to our shareholders and continuing to strategically invest in our capabilities and in strategic partnerships. All of which position us to continue to advance our long-term growth agenda and continue to deliver shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
172899,1685137099,2428037,"Cigna Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","The Cigna Group","Executives","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone.  Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business, and I will discuss our updated outlook for the full year. During the quarter, total medi",1312,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone.  
Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business, and I will discuss our updated outlook for the full year. 
During the quarter, total medical costs were higher than our expectations within our U.S. Medical segment, driven largely by the impact of the Delta variant in our U.S. commercial business and increased medical costs for special enrollment period customers in our U.S. individual business. Importantly, I would remind you that approximately 80% of our revenues are from service-based businesses that are not significantly exposed to medical cost fluctuations. 
Our balanced portfolio and multiple levers for value creation resulting in Cigna's overall revenue and earnings exceeding our third quarter expectations. This strong third quarter performance, coupled with capital deployment activities, led to an increased outlook for full year 2021, which I will discuss shortly.  
Now turning to Enterprise results. Key consolidated financial highlights in third quarter 2021 include adjusted revenue growth of 9% to $44.3 billion; adjusted earnings growth of 20% to $1.9 billion after tax and adjusted earnings per share growth of 30% to $5.73. Results in the third quarter reflect strong top and bottom line growth with contributions across all of our businesses with overall performance above our expectations.  
I'll now discuss our segment level results, and we'll then provide an update on the details of our outlook as well as our capital positioning. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Third quarter 2021 adjusted revenues grew 13% to $33.6 billion. Adjusted pharmacy script volumes increased 8% to 411 million scripts and adjusted pretax earnings grew 7% to $1.5 billion compared to third quarter 2020. Evernorth's strong results in the quarter were driven by organic growth, including strong volumes in retail and specialty pharmacy, along with ongoing efforts to improve affordability for the benefit of our clients, customers and patients and deepening of existing relationships, partially offset by significant strategic investments to support ongoing growth, including our virtual care platform and technology capabilities.  
Overall, Evernorth continues to create differentiated value for clients and customers. while driving overall revenue and earnings growth that exceeded our original expectations through the first 3 quarters of 2021.  
Turning to U.S. Medical. Third quarter adjusted revenues were $10.5 billion, and adjusted pretax earnings were approximately $1 billion. Overall, our U.S. medical earnings exceeded our expectations during the third quarter, reflecting the impact of favorable net investment income and increased specialty contributions, partially offset by higher claim costs due to the net impact of COVID-19 and increased medical costs for special enrollment period customers in our individual business. The net effect of these claim cost impacts produced a medical care ratio of 84.4% in the third quarter.  
Looking ahead, we are actively managing overall medical costs and our MCR with a range of actions, including continuing to leverage our insights from our strong data and analytics capabilities to address key drivers and identify opportunities such as guiding customers to more effective and efficient sites of care, continued discipline in our pricing and rate actions. And we're also continuing to promote preventative care and access to behavioral services to provide meaningful support to patients and moderate overall medical costs over the longer term.  
Turning to membership. We ended the quarter with 17 million total medical customers, an increase of approximately 368,000 customers year-to-date. In U.S. Medical, the year-to-date customer growth was driven by net growth in select and mill markets within U.S. commercial and continued organic growth in Medicare Advantage and individual within U.S. government. 
In our International Markets business, third quarter adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $250 million. These results were in line with our expectations. Corporate and other operations delivered a third quarter adjusted loss of $275 million. Overall, Cigna's broad portfolio of services continues to serve the needs of our customers and clients. Cigna remains committed to delivering value for all of our stakeholders, leveraging our well-positioned businesses.  
Now turning to our updated outlook for full year 2021. We are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance for full year 2021 to at least $20.35 per share, reflecting the strength of the quarter, the favorable impact of our year-to-date share repurchase and acknowledgment of the ongoing fluidity of the broader environment. This represents EPS growth of at least 10% from 2020, consistent with our long-term EPS growth range of 10% to 13%, even with the ongoing challenges associated with COVID-19 and while having significantly increased our dividend in 2021. As we look forward, it is clear that COVID-19 will continue to have an impact in the fourth quarter and in 2022. And as time progresses, COVID-related impacts and the ongoing performance of the business are becoming more intertwined. Therefore, we no longer believe it's instructive to continue to quantify the impact of COVID-19.  
These dynamics are fully contemplated in our 2021 expectations for adjusted EPS of at least $20.35 and our 2022 expectations for EPS growth of at least 10% off this 2021 guidance.  
Turning to revenue. We now expect full year 2021 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $172 billion, representing growth of at least 11% from 2020 when adjusting for the divestiture of our Group Disability and Life business. I would note this revenue growth rate significantly exceeds our projected long-term average annual growth goal of 6% to 8% and represents the third consecutive year of significant revenue outperformance since our combination with Express Scripts in late 2018.  
I will now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.8 billion, representing growth of at least 8% over 2020, reflecting the significant value we create for our customers and clients. For U.S. Medical, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.5 billion. Underlying this updated outlook, we now expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84% to 84.5%, which includes our expectations for elevated medical costs for individual special enrollment period customers.  
Regarding total medical customers, we continue to expect 2021 growth of at least 350,000 customers. Now moving to our 2021 capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong cash flows and returns on capital, even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. For full year 2021, we continue to expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses. 
Year-to-date, as of November 3, 2021, we have repurchased 26.5 million shares for $6.3 billion. And we now expect full year 2021 weighted average shares of approximately 342 million shares. This includes the impact of the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase that we announced in the third quarter. On October 27, we declared a $1 per share dividend payable on December 22 to shareholders of record as of December 7. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital.  
So now to recap. Results in the third quarter reflect strong top and bottom line growth with solid contributions across our businesses. Cigna has shown the ability to deliver value through dynamic environments with our breadth of businesses and multiple earnings levers. We continue to support our customers, clients and coworkers and deliver on our financial commitments. We now expect 2021 full year adjusted earnings of at least $20.35 per share, representing growth of at least 10% from 2020, consistent with our long-term EPS growth rate range of 10% to 13%. And we expect to grow 2022 adjusted EPS at least 10% off our raised 2021 guidance.  
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

I know it sounds like you're getting away from talking about that $250 million of net COVID impact that you're absorbing this year? I know there's various inputs there. But I was wondering because there -- last quarter, it sounded like you were carrying a lot of your expectation for COVID-related costs broadly defined into next year. As you think about your updated thoughts about '22, can you comment on how much of an ongoing COVID headwind are you expecting?

Let me try to shape our insights relative to 2022 now that we're much deeper into 2021. First, you're right, earlier this year, we've tried to frame the magnitude of the headwind and indisputably, COVID had many disruptions to the marketplace, whether it was testing, treatment, revenue dislocation, et cetera. 
Against that backdrop, as you know, our broad service portfolio and our broad funding mechanisms continue to perform quite well, and we're able to deliver from a marketplace standpoint. If you think about 2021, there's really 4 big chunky items: one, we'll put it in the headwind category, the headwind created by the COVID costs and the headwind created by MRA revenue decrement; and then positives offsetting that somewhat, which were favorable net investment income and some operating expense items. 
Now as we think about and look at the 2022 environment, our visibility in terms of our growth outlook, our rate execution, our affordability initiatives, our efficiency initiatives and our understanding of how this year is coming to close broadly speaking, those puts and takes in 2021 largely offset one another as we step into 2022, the headwinds and tailwinds. So or at least 10% growth in 2022 off of our elevated 2021 EPS essentially represents capital deployment in line with our strategic target of 4% to 5% of accretion, and the residual leased 5% to 6% from fundamental operating growth to get us to that at least 10%. 
So to recap additional visibility in terms of the drivers for 2022 growth, mix of growth, rate execution, affordability. And then secondly, the puts and takes in 2021 are configuring in a way that they largely offset one another as we step into 2022 underscoring that at least 10% is largely fundamental for our business portfolio."

So relative to Evernorth, first as we step into 2022, as Brian and I both noted, we're quite pleased with the underlying performance of Evernorth. If you look at the inherent growth that Evernorth has delivered for the organization and the diversity of the growth, we're quite pleased with that. Secondly, our ability to both drive fundamental growth, continue to invest in innovation and extend our partnerships, we feel quite good. So just framing Evernorth and then coming to the MDLIVE question, our Evernorth portfolio has 4 specific portfolios of services that are positioned well: Evernorth Pharmacy, Evernorth Care, Evernorth Benefits and Evernorth Intelligence. 
Our positioning relative to serving health plans, large employers, expanding with governmental agencies and increasingly with healthcare providers continues to resonate well in the marketplace. For 2022, to your comment relative to some losses, we expect the retention rate in the Evernorth pharmacy business in the mid-90s, which is still a strong result even with the known losses we had identified. And given the strength we've had of growth over the last several years, we are quite committed to maintaining price discipline in the marketplace. So the business portfolio will grow yet again. 
Specific to MDLIVE, we're delighted to have the MDLIVE capabilities in our portfolio, and that now resides within Evernorth Care. We see the utilization of those services continue to grow. As I noted, beyond important, urgent or triage care, but to primary behavioral dermatology. And then we've recently expanded our virtual first offering. So we see it as a great opportunity to both expand access improve affordability. But finally, it presents a platform to broaden some access to care in terms of alternative side care capabilities. So in a nutshell, we're pleased. We'll grow again and we're investing in further growth, including within the virtual capabilities of MDLIVE."

This portion of our portfolio was less directly aligned over time to that. So we use the strategy as a guide #1. 
Two, we feel very good about the value realization and the net value realization here is quite important in terms of a high-performing asset, and I appreciate your correlation to the group transaction, another high-performing asset where we felt quite good about using our strategy as a guide and capitalizing on a very attractive valuation.

In terms of deployment with the proceeds, the broad template, as David made reference to our group disability and life divestiture is what we would expect to follow in this instance as well with the exception of we don't have the same need for long-term debt repayment as we did with the Group Disability and Life transaction.

We have a very focused strategy and a long track record over the last decade of successfully growing in the commercial marketplace as we seek to subsegment and deliver the right solutions for our respective clients in that marketplace. And if you think about it over the last decade-ish, we've generally grown low single-digit medical membership, we coupled that with significant and targeted cross-selling of our new and innovative services. And then we complement that with appropriate pricing actions. And the net of that yields higher single-digit revenue growth. So that's the big picture of our strategic approach. 
I'd also highlight with Evernorth, we are further expanding the services that we're able to bring through to deepen relationships like our prior conversation relative to virtual care as an example. 
Now specific to 2022, to be clear, we'll grow again. We will clearly grow our medical customer base again. And specifically within the commercial market, we have good visibility in terms of having net growth in our national accounts and large account business portfolio and we'll have another year of growth within our Select segment.

I think this was in the context of our U.S. medical performance in terms of your question on specialty. So as you reflect on our third quarter performance for that segment and again, the earnings in totality were above our expectations in the quarter. We had 2 areas of favorability. As you called out, investment income and specialty contributions and your specialty contributions include pharmacy, behavioral, dental, the full suite of portfolio capabilities we have in the specialty domain that was partly offset by the 2 sources of claims pressure that I articulated in the COVID-related pressure in commercial as well as the special enrollment period, MCRs that were elevated in the individual exchange. 
Specifically on the favorability that we recorded in the third quarter, the investment income is nonrecurring. So you should not consider that to be something that would occur again in the fourth quarter or into '22. We would expect the specialty contributions to persist as favorability as we head into fourth quarter and into '22. That was a smaller component of the 2 in terms of the favorable items in the third quarter, but that is something we would expect to continue to persist going forward.

 Our visibility has us both growing and improving our MCR within the commercial book of business. So to do that, we'll be quite disciplined, Kevin, to be clear, and we are willing to make targeted trade-offs for MCR or margin versus volume. And the net of that will yield net customer growth and net margin improvement as we step into 2022. 
An add-on specifically in the individual market, our visibility in the individual market is that there are significant pockets of competitiveness in certain markets. And as such, in the individual marketplace, we would expect for 2022 to see no growth or more likely negative growth, some shrinkage in our book of business, but improvement in the MCR within that portfolio and that's fully contemplated in our 2022 outlook of net growth for the portfolio as well as earnings expansion."

So as we kind of look at the potential impact of special enrollment period enrollees based on your typical attrition, it doesn't look like that's particularly material to the increase in MCR versus 2019 baseline, which is up about 400 basis points in the 3Q, and you had a lot of COVID costs, but it was up almost 400 basis points in the 2Q, and you didn't have a lot of COVID costs and you had more deferred care coming back. 
So I guess the question is, is there any other substantial moving parts to how you're running versus the 2019 baseline? And then just going forward, what are your -- what do you anticipate as COVID and the Delta variant comes down, do you feel like commercial utilization is largely caught up or we're sort of still back in a cycle like we burn the 2Q, where you see some of the deferred care increasing?"

So I'll try to take the various components of that question here. So if you think about where we're running in 2021 on the MCR, maybe I'll talk in terms of the full year guide, I think that's probably the most constructive way to pull it apart. The 84% to 84.5% refresh guidance that we issued. If the special enrollment period lies within the individual exchange portfolio had not grown to the level that they are and had not had the elevated MCR that they did in the quarter, we would have had an MCR performance for the full year that was more linked at the higher end of our prior guidance range. 
So toward the higher end of the 83% to 84% range, if you exclude the impact of the individual SEP customers from the full year outlook. So just give you a little bit of dimensioning as to the materiality there. Those customer lives have built up over the course of the year. So there were not that many in the second quarter. There were many more in the third quarter. And the elevated MCR hit us particularly significantly in the third quarter, and we expect that pressure to continue into the fourth quarter. 
As David made reference to in a prior question, we would expect that to dissipate into 2022 as many of those lives attrite and/or choose new carriers. As it relates to other parts of the portfolio, the commercial business in the third quarter, we had some elevated COVID-related costs, particularly in August and September with the Delta variant hitting younger ages more significantly than earlier in the pandemic. So that created some elevated commercial claim cost pressure in the third quarter. I would note in our Medicare Advantage book, the MCR in the quarter was a little bit favorable to our expectations, which gives us greater confidence here as we head into 2022 on that subset of the overall U.S. medical book of business. So hopefully, it gives you a little bit of a picture for how 2021 is shaping up. 
In terms of your question on looking forward on commercial utilization, are we caught up, et cetera. We have seen much less deferred care in the commercial line of business throughout the pandemic and all the indicators that we track, whether that be preventive care utilization or whether that be rates of new cancer diagnosis, et cetera. I would tell you that there's not a significant amount of future pent-up demand or catch-up care to come. 
With that said, our pricing posture, as David mentioned earlier, continues to be a prioritization of margin expansion as we head into 2022."

And the historical way, one thinks about a specialty suite of a few products of behavioral, pharmacy, dental, has expanded tremendously to 25, 30 different services when you take the subsegments of decision support, chronic care management, specialty services, now virtual alternative services, et cetera. 
So my point of underscoring, this has been, as you articulated and continues to be a really important part of our strategy to try to get the right value to be realized for our clients or customers and our patients.

We also saw some upside within our behavioral health offerings as demand for that has continued to grow throughout the pandemic. We saw some increased uptake there, which drove some additional margin for us within the quarter. And again, those are 2 areas we expect to persist as we head into the new year. 
Relative to stop loss, obviously, you've got to pull this one apart further because you got individual stop-loss cover as well as aggregate stop-loss cover and the dynamics there behaved a little bit differently throughout the pandemic, meaning most COVID-related claims didn't actually hit our individual stop-loss thresholds yet. We saw a little bit of pressure earlier in the pandemic on our aggregate stop loss business. That business gets repriced along with our typical 12-month contract cycles for all the clients that we have. So we feel good about how we're positioned there on a prospective basis. 
I'd also note, we're seeing good demand for that product. You probably saw in the supplement there. We had 7% premium growth in our stop-loss line in the quarter-over-quarter. So feeling good about all the specialty solutions when you look at the total portfolio."

For the full year, as I mentioned earlier, the refresh 84% to 84.5% outlook reflects particular pressure from the individual exchange lives and specifically the special enrollment period in enrollees. So removing that, we would have been toward the higher end of our prior guide of 83% to 84%, but a sub-bullet there is the individual open enrollment lives are actually performing pretty well. So when we look at the profitability of the overall individual portfolio, we have good performance on the standard open enrollment lives. We have more performance on the special enrollment period lives and the total picture there is therefore a bit elevated. 
Medicare Advantage, as I made reference to, actually ran a little bit favorable to our expectations in the third quarter. and then commercial was a touch higher than our projections due to the effect of the delta variant in the months of August and September, in particular. So those are the broad buckets that I paint for you as you think about what's inside the medical care ratio. 
Relative to stop loss, we do have a range of attachment points depending on the clients. So we tend to see particular popularity around $50,000, $75,000 level, but it really depends on the risk appetite for a given client. So it's hard to say that there's one that's always the preferred choice. We have a distribution and the distribution evolves depending on the appetite for clients at any given point in time."

I don't think there's a singular common definition of middle market. So let me try to frame your important comment. First, as you look at our go-to-market offerings, we have a broad suite of funding alternatives and we seek to offer to our clients their respective decision of how they want to finance their purchase, after the benefits are configured, after the access profile is configured, after the clinical programs are configured and the service models are configured to align, as Brian referenced before, the risk transfer and the balance relative to them. 
So having that broad suite is really important. If we look at the select segment, 100 to 500 life clients, it varies from year-to-year in terms of how much of the client demand is guaranteed costs versus self-funded with stoploss, but self-funded with stoploss has been a meaningful portion. And as you walk from that into the heart of what I might consider middle market, the further you walk up in average size on average, more demand for self-funded, less demand for risk transfer and in the -- in between range, some for shared returns of fundamentals that exist. 
So a little bit of linearity as you just go up in respective size from that standpoint. But the important part is choice that we offer in the marketplace and try to separate the financing decision from the design features from the program. I would say to the last part of your question, I do not believe that there's a boomerang or a reconfiguration effect that's happened that we benefited from, from a stop loss standpoint. We've seen just consistency in how we use stoploss. And I'd remind you from prior conversations, we have a large book. We have a dedicated team that manages that book because there needs to be specialization in that like many other aspects of our business. And it's both performed for clients, importantly, giving them the peace of mind and revenue predictability and expense predictability they need as well as for us over a long period of time. But I would not call out anything unique in terms of ebbing and flowing that's changed our rate of growth and stop loss over the recent past."

We have a high cross-sell and high integrated offering within our medical business. As you think within the prior question that Matthew asked, as you go to our Select segment, think about that as 100% integrated. It is so integral to our offering. 
And as you move upmarket, it's more of a stand-alone sale that needs to be made. We see continued progress there, and we're pleased to either have it as an integrated part of our medical offering or a stand-alone PBM offering that we could harness and sell additional services because at the end of the day, as I called out in my prepared remarks, there are 2 fundamental ways in which a client or a customer establishes their primary health and well-being relationship, either a pharmacy relationship or largely off of a medical relationship and we're positioned to lever both.

I appreciate that you're pricing, I guess, conservatively in a fairly competitive backdrop. How much of the way back towards your target margins? Do you think that's going to get you in 2022?

Given the breadth of our portfolio, we're going to be able to achieve both our aggregate growth as well as our earnings objectives while maintaining price discipline in temporarily dislocated markets, and we deem that to be one. 
So we expect to see a net flat or decrement in our volumes in the individual exchange business and a margin improvement. I'm not going to give you a margin number. We're not guiding in detail for 2022 yet, and we typically don't guide relative to individual margins. Having said that, we expect to improve that margin from 2021 to 2022 to a more attractive and more sustainable level, and we'll maintain the discipline there. 
As it relates to intermediate to long term, we continue to see this as a growth market. But as we've managed it and as we demonstrated over time, if there are temporary dislocations, we'll maintain discipline, and we'll lever other parts of the business to ensure the portfolio delivers. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we've entered 3 more states and almost 100 additional counties to give us access to an addressable market of approximately 1.5 million additional customers to sell to. And we've been in this marketplace since its inception in 2014. And we have a track record of sustained performance, albeit episodically needing to sharpen focus as we will in 2022, given the market conditions."

So we understand that fully. 
Big picture, stepping back, any initiatives that are constructive and sustainable that improve affordability and value for individuals, we're actively open to engaged in and generally supportive of. Specifically in the pharmacy space where you double-click down on, we think the most meaningful way that's sustainable policy change that could further affordability is to stimulate and further accelerate more competition. And if I harken back as an example, to make it tangible, hepatitis C was, I think, a very positive example that reinforces that. That is the marketplace rapidly move from 1 to 2 suppliers for hepatitis C services, which was a breakthrough drug that society benefits from the overall affordability change dramatically. That's an action that is different than who's negotiating or it's very different than putting an artificial cap on a rate of growth from that standpoint. 
So big picture. We will await the specific details, and we will remain actively engaged, no doubt. We believe the most sustainable way to further improve affordability is to expand choice and expand competition. That's what's worked in the marketplace in the model. And lastly, prior conversations, we've had our well-performing and broad portfolio of pharmacy services and tools is well positioned to be able to deliver value in a changing environment, and we're confident and the capabilities we have over the strategic horizon here."

And if that number goes up or down next year, it won't materially move the needle for the Evernorth segment. 
More broadly, on the second part of your question, as we think about specialty generics and you can even broaden that to include biosimilars. We're really excited about those for the future from the standpoint of driving affordability on behalf of our clients and customers. 
We think competition is a good thing. And ultimately, specialty generics, while the timing with which they're introduced is hard to predict and does create some variability in our quarterly income patterns, ultimately, we view that as a great thing for our clients, customers and ultimately, for our business. And fortunately, we have a wide range of earnings levers that allow us to capture value in a variety of ways depending on how different client contracts are constructed.

I'm Alexis Jones, lead principle for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer.
In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's third quarter 2021 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2021. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. 
A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.  
We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2021 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.  
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the third quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item benefit of $35 million or $0.10 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results.  
Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2021 outlook. We will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2021 dividend and does not assume any impact from any business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today such as our recently announced planned divestiture of life accident and supplemental benefits businesses outside of the U.S., which we expect to close in 2022.  
With that, I will turn the call over to David."

This morning, I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about our strong results for the quarter, how we are advancing our growth strategy, and I'll provide some additional perspective on our 2022 outlook, and then Brian will share some more details about our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, and then we'll take your questions.  
So let's jump in. During the quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $44 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.73 per share, all while continuing to reinvest back in our business to fund growth, expansion and ongoing innovation, and we continue to return significant value to our shareholders. 
These results reinforce we are delivering for our customers, our patients, clients, provider partners as well as for you, our shareholders. With our high-performing health service portfolio and sharp focus on executing our strategy, we are confident in our ability to continue driving growth and are again raising our full year [ 2021 ] guidance for adjusted EPS and revenue. Our performance is strong, considering the ongoing impact of the pandemic on medical costs as well as the higher claims we've experienced amongst the special enrollment period or SEP customers within our individual business.  
As it relates to our MCR in the quarter, our commercial business did improve from the second quarter to the third quarter, and our Medicare Advantage business also improved sequentially. We continue to execute a series of actions in 2021 and 2022 to further improve our MCR, and Brian will walk through this in more detail in a few moments. 
Separately, in early October, we also announced an agreement with Chubb to sell our life, accident and supplemental benefits business in our international markets platform in 7 countries for $5.75 billion.  
We expect to realize about $5.4 billion in net after-tax proceeds and to complete the transaction in 2022 following regulatory approvals. Guided by our strategy and similar to our 2020 divestiture of our group insurance business, this transaction unlocks the value of the best-in-class leading asset while also enabling us to even more sharply focus our business on health and well-being services. 
So overall, our performance for the quarter reflects our clear strategy and strong execution in delivering attractive results and importantly, our ongoing commitment to prioritize and support the evolving health and well-being needs of those we serve.  
Now I'll walk through some additional detail for our Evernorth and U.S. Medical businesses. A year ago, we launched Evernorth to the marketplace as our health service platform, focused on servicing health plans, employers, government organizations and healthcare providers. Since that time, Evernorth has established itself with unique partnerships and innovative services that are resonating with multiple buyer groups.  
Our Evernorth pharmacy and our medical offerings through our U.S. medical platform are the 2 primary gateways through which most of our clients and customers form their base relationship with us. 
Wrapping around these 2 exceptionally strong platforms are our additional suites of innovative health services through Evernorth, including benefits management, care solutions and intelligence solutions. These help us to expand and deepen existing relationships. In the third quarter, Evernorth retained and expanded our relationship with the Department of Defense TRICARE pharmacy program and renewed a 7-year contract. It's our privilege to serve almost 10 million active duty service members, retirees and their families. 
Evernorth will continue supporting TRICARE pharmacy operations, including specialty pharmacy services, military pharmacy claims and retail network pharmacies. The new contract also allows for expansion of specialty and care coordination services through 2029. As we look through the balance of the year and into 2022, Evernorth will continue to grow revenue and earnings.  
Turning to our U.S. Medical platform. In U.S. Commercial, our teams are leveraging and deploying the innovative solutions from Evernorth to expand our service offerings and address the evolving needs of our clients and customers. For example, in our U.S. commercial platform, we are leveraging Evernorth's MDLIVE capabilities to expand virtual care options for our customers through their employers with primary, urgent, behavioral and dermatology care. 
As part of these value-based arrangements during virtual visits, MDLIVE physicians are leveraging our Evernorth intelligence capabilities, enabling them to provide more connected and coordinated experience. And we continue to expand our capabilities with MDLIVE as we recently launched a virtual first health plan for employers.  
Another great example of Evernorth and U.S. Commercial partnering to bring more value to our health plan clients is a new arrangement we have with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Health Plan. We will make in-network care available to UPMC customers who live, work or travel outside of their network service area. UPMC has been an Evernorth Pharmacy client for 16 years, and this agreement illustrates how we are collaborating across our enterprise to deliver greater affordability and differentiated value for health plan clients.  
We are pleased how the market continues to recognize the value we are delivering through our broad suite of solutions. And as such, we continue to grow through both our U.S. commercial and Evernorth platforms. Within Medicare Advantage, consistent with our strategy, we continue to grow in our existing markets and are expanding into new geographies. Our progress is further supported by our overall value of our offerings. For 2022 calendar year, 89% of our Medicare Advantage customers will be in four-Star or greater plans nationally. 
This is the highest level we've ever achieved, and it marks the fifth year in a row we've improved our Star's performance. And in our Individual & Family Plan business, we have driven strong growth in this year, increasing customers by 47% through the third quarter. A substantial portion of this growth did come from the extended special enrollment period. And as I previously noted, some of the MCR impact in the third quarter was driven by the medical costs amongst those we added during the outpaced SEP growth.  
We do expect this will moderate in 2022. We are positioning ourselves to build on this momentum in the individual family plan business by expanding our addressable market, again, as we enter in 3 new states and 93 new counties in 2022. These new markets offer the potential to reach an additional 1.5 million customers. The continued strength of our results and the growth we are generating through the execution of our strategy gives us confidence we will deliver against our commitments in 2021. We will deliver EPS in line with our long-term targets and revenue growth well above our long-term targets for yet another year. We will also deliver EPS within our long-term target range in 2022.  
Specifically for 2021, we are committed to delivering our increased guidance for full year adjusted EPS of at least $20.35. For full year 2021, we remain on track for generating at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, and we expect to return more than $7 billion to shareholders in 2021 through dividends and share repurchase.  
Looking to 2022, we expect to grow EPS by at least 10% off of our increased 2021 guidance of at least $20.35 per share. We anticipate a number of tailwinds, including core growth in our business, and additional contribution from margin expansion in our U.S. Medical business as we drive pricing actions, execute affordability and efficiency initiatives and benefit from the return of Medicare risk adjustment revenue to more normalized levels.  
We're also expecting year-over-year headwinds as we plan for net investment income to be more in line with historical levels. And of course, the rate and pace of ongoing strategic investments will vary from year-to-year. In short, 2022 will be another strong year for Cigna.  
Now to briefly summarize. As we've demonstrated through the quarter and throughout 2021, we are delivering for our customers, patients, clients, and provider partners as they experience the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. We are also taking significant value-enhancing actions such as divesting a portion of our international business, returning substantial amounts of capital to our shareholders and continuing to strategically invest in our capabilities and in strategic partnerships. All of which position us to continue to advance our long-term growth agenda and continue to deliver shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business, and I will discuss our updated outlook for the full year. 
During the quarter, total medical costs were higher than our expectations within our U.S. Medical segment, driven largely by the impact of the Delta variant in our U.S. commercial business and increased medical costs for special enrollment period customers in our U.S. individual business. Importantly, I would remind you that approximately 80% of our revenues are from service-based businesses that are not significantly exposed to medical cost fluctuations. 
Our balanced portfolio and multiple levers for value creation resulting in Cigna's overall revenue and earnings exceeding our third quarter expectations. This strong third quarter performance, coupled with capital deployment activities, led to an increased outlook for full year 2021, which I will discuss shortly.  
Now turning to Enterprise results. Key consolidated financial highlights in third quarter 2021 include adjusted revenue growth of 9% to $44.3 billion; adjusted earnings growth of 20% to $1.9 billion after tax and adjusted earnings per share growth of 30% to $5.73. Results in the third quarter reflect strong top and bottom line growth with contributions across all of our businesses with overall performance above our expectations.  
I'll now discuss our segment level results, and we'll then provide an update on the details of our outlook as well as our capital positioning. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Third quarter 2021 adjusted revenues grew 13% to $33.6 billion. Adjusted pharmacy script volumes increased 8% to 411 million scripts and adjusted pretax earnings grew 7% to $1.5 billion compared to third quarter 2020. Evernorth's strong results in the quarter were driven by organic growth, including strong volumes in retail and specialty pharmacy, along with ongoing efforts to improve affordability for the benefit of our clients, customers and patients and deepening of existing relationships, partially offset by significant strategic investments to support ongoing growth, including our virtual care platform and technology capabilities.  
Overall, Evernorth continues to create differentiated value for clients and customers. while driving overall revenue and earnings growth that exceeded our original expectations through the first 3 quarters of 2021.  
Turning to U.S. Medical. Third quarter adjusted revenues were $10.5 billion, and adjusted pretax earnings were approximately $1 billion. Overall, our U.S. medical earnings exceeded our expectations during the third quarter, reflecting the impact of favorable net investment income and increased specialty contributions, partially offset by higher claim costs due to the net impact of COVID-19 and increased medical costs for special enrollment period customers in our individual business. The net effect of these claim cost impacts produced a medical care ratio of 84.4% in the third quarter.  
Looking ahead, we are actively managing overall medical costs and our MCR with a range of actions, including continuing to leverage our insights from our strong data and analytics capabilities to address key drivers and identify opportunities such as guiding customers to more effective and efficient sites of care, continued discipline in our pricing and rate actions. And we're also continuing to promote preventative care and access to behavioral services to provide meaningful support to patients and moderate overall medical costs over the longer term.  
Turning to membership. We ended the quarter with 17 million total medical customers, an increase of approximately 368,000 customers year-to-date. In U.S. Medical, the year-to-date customer growth was driven by net growth in select and mill markets within U.S. commercial and continued organic growth in Medicare Advantage and individual within U.S. government. 
In our International Markets business, third quarter adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $250 million. These results were in line with our expectations. Corporate and other operations delivered a third quarter adjusted loss of $275 million. Overall, Cigna's broad portfolio of services continues to serve the needs of our customers and clients. Cigna remains committed to delivering value for all of our stakeholders, leveraging our well-positioned businesses.  
Now turning to our updated outlook for full year 2021. We are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance for full year 2021 to at least $20.35 per share, reflecting the strength of the quarter, the favorable impact of our year-to-date share repurchase and acknowledgment of the ongoing fluidity of the broader environment. This represents EPS growth of at least 10% from 2020, consistent with our long-term EPS growth range of 10% to 13%, even with the ongoing challenges associated with COVID-19 and while having significantly increased our dividend in 2021. As we look forward, it is clear that COVID-19 will continue to have an impact in the fourth quarter and in 2022. And as time progresses, COVID-related impacts and the ongoing performance of the business are becoming more intertwined. Therefore, we no longer believe it's instructive to continue to quantify the impact of COVID-19.  
These dynamics are fully contemplated in our 2021 expectations for adjusted EPS of at least $20.35 and our 2022 expectations for EPS growth of at least 10% off this 2021 guidance.  
Turning to revenue. We now expect full year 2021 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $172 billion, representing growth of at least 11% from 2020 when adjusting for the divestiture of our Group Disability and Life business. I would note this revenue growth rate significantly exceeds our projected long-term average annual growth goal of 6% to 8% and represents the third consecutive year of significant revenue outperformance since our combination with Express Scripts in late 2018.  
I will now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.8 billion, representing growth of at least 8% over 2020, reflecting the significant value we create for our customers and clients. For U.S. Medical, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.5 billion. Underlying this updated outlook, we now expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84% to 84.5%, which includes our expectations for elevated medical costs for individual special enrollment period customers.  
Regarding total medical customers, we continue to expect 2021 growth of at least 350,000 customers. Now moving to our 2021 capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong cash flows and returns on capital, even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. For full year 2021, we continue to expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses. 
Year-to-date, as of November 3, 2021, we have repurchased 26.5 million shares for $6.3 billion. And we now expect full year 2021 weighted average shares of approximately 342 million shares. This includes the impact of the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase that we announced in the third quarter. On October 27, we declared a $1 per share dividend payable on December 22 to shareholders of record as of December 7. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital.  
So now to recap. Results in the third quarter reflect strong top and bottom line growth with solid contributions across our businesses. Cigna has shown the ability to deliver value through dynamic environments with our breadth of businesses and multiple earnings levers. We continue to support our customers, clients and coworkers and deliver on our financial commitments. We now expect 2021 full year adjusted earnings of at least $20.35 per share, representing growth of at least 10% from 2020, consistent with our long-term EPS growth rate range of 10% to 13%. And we expect to grow 2022 adjusted EPS at least 10% off our raised 2021 guidance.

Let me try to shape our insights relative to 2022 now that we're much deeper into 2021. First, you're right, earlier this year, we've tried to frame the magnitude of the headwind and indisputably, COVID had many disruptions to the marketplace, whether it was testing, treatment, revenue dislocation, et cetera. 
Against that backdrop, as you know, our broad service portfolio and our broad funding mechanisms continue to perform quite well, and we're able to deliver from a marketplace standpoint. If you think about 2021, there's really 4 big chunky items: one, we'll put it in the headwind category, the headwind created by the COVID costs and the headwind created by MRA revenue decrement; and then positives offsetting that somewhat, which were favorable net investment income and some operating expense items. 
Now as we think about and look at the 2022 environment, our visibility in terms of our growth outlook, our rate execution, our affordability initiatives, our efficiency initiatives and our understanding of how this year is coming to close broadly speaking, those puts and takes in 2021 largely offset one another as we step into 2022, the headwinds and tailwinds. So or at least 10% growth in 2022 off of our elevated 2021 EPS essentially represents capital deployment in line with our strategic target of 4% to 5% of accretion, and the residual leased 5% to 6% from fundamental operating growth to get us to that at least 10%. 
So to recap additional visibility in terms of the drivers for 2022 growth, mix of growth, rate execution, affordability. And then secondly, the puts and takes in 2021 are configuring in a way that they largely offset one another as we step into 2022 underscoring that at least 10% is largely fundamental for our business portfolio."

So relative to Evernorth, first as we step into 2022, as Brian and I both noted, we're quite pleased with the underlying performance of Evernorth. If you look at the inherent growth that Evernorth has delivered for the organization and the diversity of the growth, we're quite pleased with that. Secondly, our ability to both drive fundamental growth, continue to invest in innovation and extend our partnerships, we feel quite good. So just framing Evernorth and then coming to the MDLIVE question, our Evernorth portfolio has 4 specific portfolios of services that are positioned well: Evernorth Pharmacy, Evernorth Care, Evernorth Benefits and Evernorth Intelligence. 
Our positioning relative to serving health plans, large employers, expanding with governmental agencies and increasingly with healthcare providers continues to resonate well in the marketplace. For 2022, to your comment relative to some losses, we expect the retention rate in the Evernorth pharmacy business in the mid-90s, which is still a strong result even with the known losses we had identified. And given the strength we've had of growth over the last several years, we are quite committed to maintaining price discipline in the marketplace. So the business portfolio will grow yet again. 
Specific to MDLIVE, we're delighted to have the MDLIVE capabilities in our portfolio, and that now resides within Evernorth Care. We see the utilization of those services continue to grow. As I noted, beyond important, urgent or triage care, but to primary behavioral dermatology. And then we've recently expanded our virtual first offering. So we see it as a great opportunity to both expand access improve affordability. But finally, it presents a platform to broaden some access to care in terms of alternative side care capabilities. So in a nutshell, we're pleased. We'll grow again and we're investing in further growth, including within the virtual capabilities of MDLIVE."

This portion of our portfolio was less directly aligned over time to that. So we use the strategy as a guide #1. 
Two, we feel very good about the value realization and the net value realization here is quite important in terms of a high-performing asset, and I appreciate your correlation to the group transaction, another high-performing asset where we felt quite good about using our strategy as a guide and capitalizing on a very attractive valuation.

As you look at the timing of when dividends were available to be extracted as an example. 
In terms of deployment with the proceeds, the broad template, as David made reference to our group disability and life divestiture is what we would expect to follow in this instance as well with the exception of we don't have the same need for long-term debt repayment as we did with the Group Disability and Life transaction. So we would expect the primary use to be for share repurchase.

We have a very focused strategy and a long track record over the last decade of successfully growing in the commercial marketplace as we seek to subsegment and deliver the right solutions for our respective clients in that marketplace. And if you think about it over the last decade-ish, we've generally grown low single-digit medical membership, we coupled that with significant and targeted cross-selling of our new and innovative services. And then we complement that with appropriate pricing actions. And the net of that yields higher single-digit revenue growth. So that's the big picture of our strategic approach. 
I'd also highlight with Evernorth, we are further expanding the services that we're able to bring through to deepen relationships like our prior conversation relative to virtual care as an example. 
Now specific to 2022, to be clear, we'll grow again. We will clearly grow our medical customer base again. And specifically within the commercial market, we have good visibility in terms of having net growth in our national accounts and large account business portfolio and we'll have another year of growth within our Select segment.

As you called out, investment income and specialty contributions and your specialty contributions include pharmacy, behavioral, dental, the full suite of portfolio capabilities we have in the specialty domain that was partly offset by the 2 sources of claims pressure that I articulated in the COVID-related pressure in commercial as well as the special enrollment period, MCRs that were elevated in the individual exchange. 
Specifically on the favorability that we recorded in the third quarter, the investment income is nonrecurring. So you should not consider that to be something that would occur again in the fourth quarter or into '22. We would expect the specialty contributions to persist as favorability as we head into fourth quarter and into '22.

 Our visibility has us both growing and improving our MCR within the commercial book of business. So to do that, we'll be quite disciplined, Kevin, to be clear, and we are willing to make targeted trade-offs for MCR or margin versus volume. And the net of that will yield net customer growth and net margin improvement as we step into 2022. 
An add-on specifically in the individual market, our visibility in the individual market is that there are significant pockets of competitiveness in certain markets. And as such, in the individual marketplace, we would expect for 2022 to see no growth or more likely negative growth, some shrinkage in our book of business, but improvement in the MCR within that portfolio and that's fully contemplated in our 2022 outlook of net growth for the portfolio as well as earnings expansion."

So as we kind of look at the potential impact of special enrollment period enrollees based on your typical attrition, it doesn't look like that's particularly material to the increase in MCR versus 2019 baseline, which is up about 400 basis points in the 3Q, and you had a lot of COVID costs, but it was up almost 400 basis points in the 2Q, and you didn't have a lot of COVID costs and you had more deferred care coming back. 
So I guess the question is, is there any other substantial moving parts to how you're running versus the 2019 baseline? And then just going forward, what are your -- what do you anticipate as COVID and the Delta variant comes down, do you feel like commercial utilization is largely caught up or we're sort of still back in a cycle like we burn the 2Q, where you see some of the deferred care increasing?"

So I'll try to take the various components of that question here. So if you think about where we're running in 2021 on the MCR, maybe I'll talk in terms of the full year guide, I think that's probably the most constructive way to pull it apart. The 84% to 84.5% refresh guidance that we issued. If the special enrollment period lies within the individual exchange portfolio had not grown to the level that they are and had not had the elevated MCR that they did in the quarter, we would have had an MCR performance for the full year that was more linked at the higher end of our prior guidance range. 
So toward the higher end of the 83% to 84% range, if you exclude the impact of the individual SEP customers from the full year outlook. So just give you a little bit of dimensioning as to the materiality there. Those customer lives have built up over the course of the year. So there were not that many in the second quarter. There were many more in the third quarter. And the elevated MCR hit us particularly significantly in the third quarter, and we expect that pressure to continue into the fourth quarter. 
As David made reference to in a prior question, we would expect that to dissipate into 2022 as many of those lives attrite and/or choose new carriers. As it relates to other parts of the portfolio, the commercial business in the third quarter, we had some elevated COVID-related costs, particularly in August and September with the Delta variant hitting younger ages more significantly than earlier in the pandemic. So that created some elevated commercial claim cost pressure in the third quarter. I would note in our Medicare Advantage book, the MCR in the quarter was a little bit favorable to our expectations, which gives us greater confidence here as we head into 2022 on that subset of the overall U.S. medical book of business. So hopefully, it gives you a little bit of a picture for how 2021 is shaping up. 
In terms of your question on looking forward on commercial utilization, are we caught up, et cetera. We have seen much less deferred care in the commercial line of business throughout the pandemic and all the indicators that we track, whether that be preventive care utilization or whether that be rates of new cancer diagnosis, et cetera. I would tell you that there's not a significant amount of future pent-up demand or catch-up care to come. 
With that said, our pricing posture, as David mentioned earlier, continues to be a prioritization of margin expansion as we head into 2022."

We also saw some upside within our behavioral health offerings as demand for that has continued to grow throughout the pandemic. We saw some increased uptake there, which drove some additional margin for us within the quarter. And again, those are 2 areas we expect to persist as we head into the new year. 
Relative to stop-loss, obviously, you've got to pull this one apart further because you got individual stop-loss cover as well as aggregate stop-loss cover and the dynamics there behaved a little bit differently throughout the pandemic, meaning most COVID-related claims didn't actually hit our individual stop-loss thresholds yet. We saw a little bit of pressure earlier in the pandemic on our aggregate stop-loss business. That business gets repriced along with our typical 12-month contract cycles for all the clients that we have. So we feel good about how we're positioned there on a prospective basis. 
I'd also note, we're seeing good demand for that product. You probably saw in the supplement there. We had 7% premium growth in our stop-loss line in the quarter-over-quarter. So feeling good about all the specialty solutions when you look at the total portfolio."

For the full year, as I mentioned earlier, the refresh 84% to 84.5% outlook reflects particular pressure from the individual exchange lives and specifically the special enrollment period in enrollees. So removing that, we would have been toward the higher end of our prior guide of 83% to 84%, but a sub-bullet there is the individual open enrollment lives are actually performing pretty well. So when we look at the profitability of the overall individual portfolio, we have good performance on the standard open enrollment lives. We have more performance on the special enrollment period lives and the total picture there is therefore a bit elevated. 
Medicare Advantage, as I made reference to, actually ran a little bit favorable to our expectations in the third quarter. and then commercial was a touch higher than our projections due to the effect of the delta variant in the months of August and September, in particular. So those are the broad buckets that I paint for you as you think about what's inside the medical care ratio. 
Relative to stop-loss, we do have a range of attachment points depending on the clients. So we tend to see particular popularity around $50,000, $75,000 level, but it really depends on the risk appetite for a given client. So it's hard to say that there's one that's always the preferred choice. We have a distribution and the distribution evolves depending on the appetite for clients at any given point in time."

But should we think about -- is that still the usable framework going into '22? Or should we think about maybe less operational growth and maybe more from capital deployment? Just any additional thoughts around those components might help, knowing that it's preliminary right now."

So then if you back away from that, that leaves you 5 to 6 fundamental organic earnings growth contribution to get to the at least 10% number. 
And we think that's an appropriate and prudent and attractive outlook given the fluid and dynamism of the marketplace. So broadly speaking, both components are in line with our long-term strategic objectives. And we have a track record, including 2021, which is a disruptive year of delivering in line with that.

I don't think there's a singular common definition of middle market. So let me try to frame your important comment. First, as you look at our go-to-market offerings, we have a broad suite of funding alternatives and we seek to offer to our clients their respective decision of how they want to finance their purchase, after the benefits are configured, after the access profile is configured, after the clinical programs are configured and the service models are configured to align, as Brian referenced before, the risk transfer and the balance relative to them. 
So having that broad suite is really important. If we look at the select segment, 100 to 500 life clients, it varies from year-to-year in terms of how much of the client demand is guaranteed costs versus self-funded with stop-loss, but self-funded with stop-loss has been a meaningful portion. And as you walk from that into the heart of what I might consider middle market, the further you walk up in average size on average, more demand for self-funded, less demand for risk transfer and in the -- in between range, some for shared returns of fundamentals that exist. 
So a little bit of linearity as you just go up in respective size from that standpoint. But the important part is choice that we offer in the marketplace and try to separate the financing decision from the design features from the program. I would say to the last part of your question, I do not believe that there's a boomerang or a reconfiguration effect that's happened that we benefited from, from a stop-loss standpoint. We've seen just consistency in how we use stop-loss. And I'd remind you from prior conversations, we have a large book. We have a dedicated team that manages that book because there needs to be specialization in that like many other aspects of our business. And it's both performed for clients, importantly, giving them the peace of mind and revenue predictability and expense predictability they need as well as for us over a long period of time. But I would not call out anything unique in terms of ebbing and flowing that's changed our rate of growth and stop-loss over the recent past."

The second question, I think you're asking relative to PBM commercial cross-sell penetration, et cetera, respective growth, I don't have an individual number for you. We have not historically walked through individual numbers there. I'd ask you to step back and remember our strategy here. We have a high cross-sell and high integrated offering within our medical business. As you think within the prior question that Matthew asked, as you go to our Select segment, think about that as 100% integrated. It is so integral to our offering. 
And as you move upmarket, it's more of a stand-alone sale that needs to be made. We see continued progress there, and we're pleased to either have it as an integrated part of our medical offering or a stand-alone PBM offering that we could harness and sell additional services because at the end of the day, as I called out in my prepared remarks, there are 2 fundamental ways in which a client or a customer establishes their primary health and well-being relationship, either a pharmacy relationship or largely off of a medical relationship and we're positioned to lever both. 
So I would leave you with a directional answer on the PBM commercial. Brian referenced PBM strength or pharma strength in our commercial portfolio. That's a net positive, and we continue to see traction both on stand-alone pharmacy as well as integrated pharmacy within our business."

Given the breadth of our portfolio, we're going to be able to achieve both our aggregate growth as well as our earnings objectives while maintaining price discipline in temporarily dislocated markets, and we deem that to be one. 
So we expect to see a net flat or decrement in our volumes in the individual exchange business and a margin improvement. I'm not going to give you a margin number. We're not guiding in detail for 2022 yet, and we typically don't guide relative to individual margins. Having said that, we expect to improve that margin from 2021 to 2022 to a more attractive and more sustainable level, and we'll maintain the discipline there. 
As it relates to intermediate to long term, we continue to see this as a growth market. But as we've managed it and as we demonstrated over time, if there are temporary dislocations, we'll maintain discipline, and we'll lever other parts of the business to ensure the portfolio delivers. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we've entered 3 more states and almost 100 additional counties to give us access to an addressable market of approximately 1.5 million additional customers to sell to.

So we understand that fully. 
Big picture, stepping back, any initiatives that are constructive and sustainable that improve affordability and value for individuals, we're actively open to engaged in and generally supportive of. Specifically in the pharmacy space where you double-click down on, we think the most meaningful way that's sustainable policy change that could further affordability is to stimulate and further accelerate more competition. And if I harken back as an example, to make it tangible, hepatitis C was, I think, a very positive example that reinforces that. That is the marketplace rapidly move from 1 to 2 suppliers for hepatitis C services, which was a breakthrough drug that society benefits from the overall affordability change dramatically. That's an action that is different than who's negotiating or it's very different than putting an artificial cap on a rate of growth from that standpoint. 
So big picture. We will await the specific details, and we will remain actively engaged, no doubt. We believe the most sustainable way to further improve affordability is to expand choice and expand competition. That's what's worked in the marketplace in the model. And lastly, prior conversations, we've had our well-performing and broad portfolio of pharmacy services and tools is well positioned to be able to deliver value in a changing environment, and we're confident and the capabilities we have over the strategic horizon here."
