I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of Packaging Corporation of America. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Chief Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. 
I'll begin the call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide more details. I'll then wrap things up, and we'd be glad to take questions. 
Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter 2020 net income of $124 million or $1.30 per share. Excluding the special items, fourth quarter 2020 net income was $127 million or $1.33 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2019's net income of $163 million or $1.71 per share. Fourth quarter net sales were $1.7 billion in both 2020 and 2019. Total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding special items, was $293 million in 2020 and $335 million in 2019. Fourth quarter net income included special items of $3 million, primarily for facilities closure and restructuring costs. 
In addition, we also reported full year 2020 earnings, excluding special items, of $550 million or $5.78 per share compared to 2019's earnings, excluding special items, of $726 million or $7.65 per share. Net sales were $6.7 billion in 2020 and $7 billion in 2019. Excluding the special items, total company EBITDA in 2020 was $1.23 billion compared to $1.45 billion in 2019. Details of the special items for both the fourth quarter and full year 2020 and 2019 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release. Excluding special items, the $0.38 per share decrease in fourth quarter 2020 earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our Packaging segment of $0.30; the Paper segment, $0.05; lower volumes in our Paper segment of $0.27 and higher scheduled maintenance outage costs of $0.08. 
High demand for trucks due to low inventories along with driver shortages and rail rate increases drove higher freight expenses of $0.07 and our tax rate was $0.05 per share higher, primarily due to some of the benefits we had in 2019 that were not repeated in 2020. These items were partially offset by higher volumes in our Packaging segment of $0.40 per share and excellent management of costs during the quarter, which resulted in lower operating costs of $0.01 and lower other costs of $0.03 per share. 
Looking at the Packaging business, EBITDA, excluding special items in the fourth quarter of 2020 of $303 million with sales of $1.54 billion resulted in a margin of 20% versus last year's EBITDA of $303 million and sales of $1.46 billion or a 21% margin. For the full year 2020, Packaging segment EBITDA, excluding special items, was $1.2 billion with sales of $5.9 billion or 21% margin compared to full year 2019 EBITDA of $1.3 billion with sales of $5.9 billion or 22% margin. 
Demand in our Packaging segment remained very strong as sales volumes in both the containerboard mills and the corrugated products plants set all time records. Although we were able to replenish some inventory during the quarter by postponing a large discretionary outage at the DeRidder Mill and utilizing the Jackson Mill for additional containerboard production, we again ended the period with inventory levels lower-than-planned and at a new low from a weeks of supply standpoint due to much stronger-than-expected demand. 
As we mentioned on the last quarter's call, during the fourth quarter, we did begin producing high-performance virgin linerboard on the #3 machine at Jackson, Alabama to help meet the continued strong demand from our box plant customers and also to build some much-needed inventory prior to the year-end. The machine's capabilities met our expectations for the quarter, producing excellent quality, light weight high-performance grades for the months of November and December. Although, as we said previously, these tons are currently at a very high cost. We were able to refine our previous studies and assumptions in order to more accurately estimate the future capital investment and process changes required in a phased approach to fully utilize the potential of the mill to produce containerboard at an optimal cost and quality. In order for us to address our strategic integrated containerboard supply needs capable of providing the necessary runway to grow our downstream box plant demand this analysis, along with other options we've been evaluating will be reviewed by the Board of Directors in our February meeting.  We'll then be able to discuss this further with you. 
I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business."

As Mark mentioned, our corrugated products plants established new all-time quarterly records for total box shipments up 9.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter as well as shipments per day, up 11.7%, and compared to last year. Said another way, although there were 3 less shipping days this quarter compared to the third quarter, our total fourth quarter shipments exceeded the third quarter by 2.2%. For the full year, annual corrugated shipment records were set as well, both in total and per day, up 5.8% and 5.4%, respectively, with one more shipping day compared to 2019. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 16,000 tons below last year's fourth quarter as we ran our containerboard system to supply the record needs of our box plants. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.31 per share lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 and down $0.11 per share versus the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to a less rich mix as the graphics and point of purchase display business as well as the produce business in the Pacific Northwest tails off during this period. 
Export containerboard prices were $0.01 per share above both the fourth quarter of 2019 as well as the third quarter of 2020. As expected, late in the quarter, we began to see the initial benefit of our recently announced packaging segment price increases. While we don't comment on forward pricing specifics, we would expect to realize the vast majority of the increases during the first quarter of 2021. 
I'll now turn it back to Mark."

Market conditions in the Paper segment continued to be challenged due to the nationwide responses to help control the spread of the pandemic. As expected, sales volume was below seasonally stronger third quarter levels and over 30% below the fourth quarter of 2019. As mentioned previously, with the scheduled outage at our International falls mill, the Jackson Mill was restarted on white paper in October and produced both paper and containerboard during the fourth quarter. We'll continue to assess our outlook for paper demand and optimal inventory levels and will run our paper system accordingly. 
Average paper prices and mix were 1% below the third quarter of 2020 and approximately 3% below the fourth quarter of 2019. 
I'll now turn it over to Bob."

For the fourth quarter, we generated cash from operations of $271 million and free cash flow of $103 million, the primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $168 million. Common stock dividends totaled $75 million, $51 million for federal and state income tax payments and net interest payments of $40 million. We ended the year with $975 million of cash on hand or just over $1.1 billion, including marketable securities. Our liquidity at December 31, was just under $1.5 billion. 
For the full year 2020, cash from operations was $1.03 billion. We had capital spending of $421 million. Free cash flow was $612 million. Our final recurring effective tax rate for 2020 was 25%, and our final reported cash tax rate was 18%. Regarding full year estimates of certain key items for the upcoming year, we expect total capital expenditures to be between $500 million to $525 million, which excludes any potential capital spending related to the Jackson conversion since that is still being evaluated, as Mark indicated earlier. DD&A is expected to be approximately $407 million. Pension and post-retirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million, which is net of a nonoperating pension benefit of almost $20 million, primarily due to our pension asset performance in 2020. 
We also expect to make cash pension and post-retirement benefit plan contributions of $52 million. Based on the recent 27% increase to our dividend, we expect dividend payments for the year of $380 million. Our full year interest expense in 2021 is expected to be approximately $95 million and net cash interest payments should be about $93 million. The estimate for our 2021 combined federal and state cash tax rate is about 20.5%. And for our book effective tax rate, approximately 25%. 
Currently, planned annual maintenance outages at our mills in 2021 will result in approximately 81,000 less tons of containerboard production compared to 2020. The annual earnings impact of these outages, including lost volume, direct costs and amortized repair costs, is expected to be $0.90 per share compared to the $0.65 per share we had in 2020. The current estimated impact by quarter in 2021 is $0.10 per share in the first quarter, $0.25 in the second, $0.13 in the third quarter and $0.42 per share in the fourth. 
I'll now turn it back over to Mark."

As they've done through this pandemic, our employees demonstrated tremendous resiliency to overcome adversity in both their personal and work lives to deliver significant accomplishments throughout the company. Not the least of which was running our manufacturing and office locations safely during these times of constant change and distraction. Without question, we experienced difficulties and unique challenges during the year, however, our employees never lost their resolve to succeed. Our manufacturing and sales organizations continue to successfully adapt to the needs of our customers during this period of unprecedented demand in our Packaging business, and also effectively managed the market challenges in our Paper business brought on by the pandemic as well as working through the impact of multiple hurricanes. Our engineering and technology organization has stayed on track with the key capital projects and process improvements for our box plants and mills and our corporate staff groups found innovative solutions for remote working conditions to ensure we continue to manage the company effectively. As well as perform all of the necessary administrative activities that are necessary for our employees or are required as a public company. 
I'm very proud of our accomplishments and the strong partnerships we've built with our customers and suppliers over the many years. Looking ahead, as we move from the fourth into the first quarter, our Packaging segment demand should remain strong with shipments exceeding those of last year's record first quarter. This will require us to continue producing containerboard at our Jackson Mill in addition to an appropriate amount of white paper to maintain optimal inventory levels for servicing the paper customers. As Tom mentioned, we expect to realize the majority of our recently announced Packaging segment price increases during the first quarter, and we expect average export prices to move higher as well. 
However, higher freight costs are expected to continue and labor costs will be higher with annual wage inflation and timing related increases to fringes and benefits as we start the new year. Seasonally colder weather will increase energy and wood costs, and we also expect higher prices for recycled fiber. 
Finally, scheduled outage expenses should be lower. Although inflation related increases with our operating supplies and repair costs are expected to offset much of that benefit. Shelter in place and locked down conditions are constantly changing across the country. And with the new federal administration in place, we expect that guidelines and requirements will continue to evolve. There continues to be numerous events and actions that could significantly impact our expectations and assumptions for the upcoming quarter in both our Packaging and Paper segments. This is true not only for the operation of our facilities, but also for the needs of our customers and the availability of services and products we rely on for our -- from our suppliers. As a result, we are not able to appropriately quantify our guidance for the first quarter. 
With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company, it involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy, and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. 
And with that, Holly, I'd like to open up the call to questions, please."

You're limited in productivity and also, again, fiber yield. So the cost, obviously, are the highest in our system. But nevertheless, the machine exceeded our expectations in terms of its productivity. And we're extremely pleased during the quarter. The machine accomplished what we needed, and that was providing our box plant system and needed tons to continue supplying the box demand for the quarter. and try to build a little inventory. 
Again, we're extremely pleased. The efforts also enabled us to fully understand what we believed would be an appropriate phased approach to consider a conversion of the mills to containerboard in much the same way we looked at the DeRidder Mill and the Wallula Mill. So we'll be going forward with a discussion with the Board of Directors in February on our different options and alternatives on how we want to approach that. But we're very pleased. 
Again, the machine has performed quite well. And as [ I ] also called out in October, that machine is just an outstanding paper machine and the mill itself has a lot of great opportunity to go forward. Bob, do you want to add anything?"

As you could imagine -- and let's go back to things we've said for years and years, you can convert any mill to make anything depending on how much capital you're willing to spend on that conversion. That being said, if you look at a mill like DeRidder and mill like Wallula, they're all unique. They have their strengths and weaknesses that you have to address with capital. Jackson is no different. What you would be typically looking at is in the pulp mill, hot stock refining, de fiberizing, various pumping capabilities that would allow you to raise [ capa ] on the paper machine itself with stock approach, additional refining capabilities and just mass throughput capabilities with the running containerboard versus a lightweight fiber. So then you're looking at head box dynamics, drainage, formation in terms of the former and then pressing and drying and then winder modifications and role handling. 
So there's a comprehensive checklist that you have to go through in doing your analysis. But those are the type of things you would look at in that -- those are the items that we've now have a really good understanding of the capability and the limitations. So it's helped us refine our expected scope. But nevertheless, you're talking about a project at a minimum that's in the hundreds of millions of dollars to convert a Jackson Mill and do it the way PCA would do a conversion. But it would be a good project. And so we have other alternatives, obviously, we're looking at. I don't want to get into those, you can imagine.

And the demand was at all-time records from the containerboard mills to the box plants to the box customers. You can only imagine that when you're a carrier whether it's a trucking carrier or a rail carrier. And you now have this unprecedented demand along with your workforce that is being challenged with this pandemic. A direct example of that is, at any given time during those few months, we had upwards of 100 people in our mill system that were out either quarantining or positive and then same thing in the box plant. So it was a challenge, and we saw that through the logistics chain on how our customers were dealing with this and how our carriers were dealing with this in their own workforce capability. And so it was the human factor and the rolling stock factor in terms of trucks and rail in order to move the goods, like say, to meet the unprecedented demand. 
And as Tom said, in many cases, we are moving product from plant to plant and plants were cooperating with one another. So it's a very challenging time in that regard."

This first quarter is not much better than what we saw in the fourth quarter. I would expect as the economy finally recovers, and you have workplaces starting to come to some new semblance of normalcy and schools fully opening up across the country all the way up to higher education that at some point over the next year, demand will pick up to a new norm. I don't really know what that new norm would be. I do have to believe that there has been now a permanent demand destruction of some number that people have learned working from home, how they do their business. And so Jackson currently affords us the opportunity to short term, take advantage of the asset and make again, a high cost, very good quality containerboard. But at the same time, you would have to assume that our box demand grows and our paper demand destruction remains at a certain level that it will be difficult to justify having a very large machine that only is able to fill its orders for a portion of the time in the future years. 
So we're looking at that as an opportunity that we have a very strong need for the containerboard. And as we've always done, we have long-term fill those needs internally rather than going out to the outside market. And even if we wanted to go to the outside market now, there are no tons to be purchased. And so we believe that Jackson ultimately will be a far better asset in the containerboard side of the business, ultimately.  What the timing is, I'm not sure. I'm just thinking over the next couple of years that, that timing will play out."

You might ask, you might start with the question of, again, why Jackson and why do what we're doing at Jackson. And as we alluded to earlier, the fact is I can't buy any tons in the open market. I -- We have a great volume demand. We have great need. If anything, our customers are concerned that we have enough supply, even as an industry. So consequently, we were fortunate to be able to have this great asset, as Mark alluded to, that's not going to produce at its normal rate because of the destruction of demand in the white business, and we were able to convert it. 
And yes, it's at a high cost, but great quality, it kept us going. It gave us the ability to grow, gave us the ability to satisfy our customers and was incredibly integral to our ability to continue this growth trend. So now when it comes to white and some other things, we have trade agreements. We've got some other arrangements where we're in good shape there. So we're not really that concerned about that. But these -- again, what you see, and I think it's important to point out that what's going on -- what we observe at least in the marketplace and our inability to buy any additional tons, we would have only bought those for a short period of time anyway because we intend to be fully integrated. And supply our own tons. And I would assume others might think the same way. But it's important to note that some of these projects that are continually mentioned out there that are the one-offs, somebody is going to put a mill in with no downstream cut up, very difficult to do. I don't know where they get the customer base. Again, it's -- I can only speak for ourselves. We're going to supply ourselves. We're not buyers in the open market. So I'm not -- we have to take care of ourselves, I guess that's the point. And you see very few of these one-offs ever come off. I can name one that did, and it's now shut down. So I'm not really concerned about that. We have to take care of ourselves, and we have to figure out our own supply.

I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of Packaging Corporation of America. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Chief -- Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.
I'll begin the call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide more details. I'll then wrap things up and we'd be glad to take questions.
Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter 2020 net income of $124 million or $1.30 per share. Excluding the special items, fourth quarter 2020 net income was $127 million or $1.33 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2019's net income of $163 million or $1.71 per share. Fourth quarter net sales were $1.7 billion in both 2020 and 2019. Total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding special items, was $293 million in 2020 and $335 million in 2019.
Fourth quarter net income included special items of $3 million primarily for facilities closure and restructuring costs. In addition, we also reported full year 2020 earnings excluding special items of $550 million or $5.78 per share compared to 2019's earnings excluding special items of $726 million or $7.65 per share. Net sales were $6.7 billion in 2020 and $7 billion in 2019. Excluding the special items, total company EBITDA in 2020 was $1.23 billion compared to $1.45 billion in 2019. Details of the special items for both the fourth quarter and full year 2020 and 2019 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release.
Excluding special items, the $0.38 per share decrease in fourth quarter 2020 earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our Packaging segment of $0.30; the Paper segment, $0.05; lower volumes in our Paper segment of $0.27 and higher scheduled maintenance outage costs of $0.08.
High demand for trucks due to low inventories along with driver shortages and rail rate increases drove higher freight expenses of $0.07 and our tax rate was $0.05 per share higher primarily due to some of the benefits we had in 2019 that were not repeated in 2020. These items were partially offset by higher volumes in our Packaging segment of $0.40 per share and excellent management of costs during the quarter, which resulted in lower operating costs of $0.01 and lower other costs of $0.03 per share.
Looking at the Packaging business. EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter of 2020 of $303 million with sales of $1.54 billion resulted in a margin of 20% versus last year's EBITDA of $303 million and sales of $1.46 billion or a 21% margin. For the full year 2020, Packaging segment EBITDA excluding special items was $1.2 billion with sales of $5.9 billion or 21% margin compared to full year 2019 EBITDA of $1.3 billion with sales of $5.9 billion or 22% margin.
Demand in our Packaging segment remained very strong as sales volumes in both the containerboard mills and the corrugated products plants set all-time records. Although we were able to replenish some inventory during the quarter by postponing a large discretionary outage at the DeRidder mill and utilizing the Jackson mill for additional containerboard production, we again ended the period with inventory levels lower than planned and at a new low from a weeks of supply standpoint due to much stronger-than-expected demand.
As we mentioned on the last quarter's call, during the fourth quarter, we did begin producing high-performance virgin linerboard on the #3 machine at Jackson, Alabama to help meet the continued strong demand from our box plant customers and also to build some much-needed inventory prior to the year-end. The machine's capabilities met our expectations for the quarter, producing excellent quality, lightweight, high-performance grades for the months of November and December. Although as we said previously, these tons are currently at a very high cost, we were able to refine our previous studies and assumptions in order to more accurately estimate the future capital investment and process changes required in a phased approach to fully utilize the potential of the mill to produce containerboard at an optimal cost and quality.
In order for us to address our strategic integrated containerboard supply needs capable of providing the necessary runway to grow our downstream box plant demand, this analysis along with other options we've been evaluating will be reviewed by the Board of Directors in our February meeting. We'll then be able to discuss this further with you.
I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business."

As Mark mentioned, our corrugated products plants established new all-time quarterly records for total box shipments up 9.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter as well as shipments per day up 11.7% compared to last year.

As Mark mentioned, our corrugated products plants established new all-time quarterly records for total box shipments up 9.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter as well as shipments per day up 11.7% compared to last year. Said another way, although there were 3 less shipping days this quarter compared to the third quarter, our total fourth quarter shipments exceeded the third quarter by 2.2%. For the full year, annual corrugated shipment records were set as well, both in total and per day, up 5.8% and 5.4%, respectively, with 1 more shipping day compared to 2019.
Outside sales volume of containerboard was 16,000 tons below last year's fourth quarter as we ran our containerboard system to supply the record needs of our box plants. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.31 per share lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 and down $0.11 per share versus the third quarter of 2020 primarily due to a less rich mix as the graphics and point-of-purchase display business as well as the produce business in the Pacific Northwest tails off during this period. Export containerboard prices were $0.01 per share above both the fourth quarter of 2019 as well as the third quarter of 2020.
As expected, late in the quarter, we began to see the initial benefit of our recently announced Packaging segment price increases. While we don't comment on forward pricing specifics, we would expect to realize the vast majority of the increases during the first quarter of 2021.
I'll now turn it back to Mark."

Market conditions in the Paper segment continued to be challenged due to the nationwide responses to help control the spread of the pandemic. As expected, sales volume was below seasonally stronger third quarter levels and over 30% below the fourth quarter of 2019. As mentioned previously, with the scheduled outage at our International Falls mill, the Jackson mill was restarted on white paper in October and produced both paper and containerboard during the fourth quarter. We'll continue to assess our outlook for paper demand and optimal inventory levels and will run our paper system accordingly.
Average paper prices and mix were 1% below the third quarter of 2020 and approximately 3% below the fourth quarter of 2019.
I'll now turn it over to Bob."

For the fourth quarter, we generated cash from operations of $271 million and free cash flow of $103 million. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $168 million. Common stock dividends totaled $75 million, $51 million for federal and state income tax payments and net interest payments of $40 million. We ended the year with $975 million of cash on hand or just over $1.1 billion, including marketable securities. Our liquidity at December 31 was just under $1.5 billion.
For the full year 2020, cash from operations was $1.03 billion. We had capital spending of $421 million. Free cash flow was $612 million. Our final recurring effective tax rate for 2020 was 25% and our final reported cash tax rate was 18%.
Regarding full year estimates of certain key items for the upcoming year, we expect total capital expenditures to be between $500 million to $525 million, which excludes any potential capital spending related to the Jackson conversion since that is still being evaluated, as Mark indicated earlier. DD&A is expected to be approximately $407 million. Pension and post-retirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million, which is net of a nonoperating pension benefit of almost $20 million primarily due to our pension asset performance in 2020. We also expect to make cash pension and post-retirement benefit plan contributions of $52 million.
Based on the recent 27% increase to our dividend, we expect dividend payments for the year of $380 million. Our full year interest expense in 2021 is expected to be approximately $95 million and net cash interest payments should be about $93 million. The estimate for our 2021 combined federal and state cash tax rate is about 20.5% and for our book effective tax rate, approximately 25%.
Currently, planned annual maintenance outages at our mills in 2021 will result in approximately 81,000 less tons of containerboard production compared to 2020. The annual earnings impact of these outages, including lost volume, direct costs and amortized repair costs, is expected to be $0.90 per share compared to the $0.65 per share we had in 2020. The current estimated impact by quarter in 2021 is $0.10 per share in the first quarter, $0.25 in the second, $0.13 in the third quarter and $0.42 per share in the fourth.
I'll now turn it back over to Mark."

As they've done through this pandemic, our employees demonstrated tremendous resiliency to overcome adversity in both their personal and work lives to deliver significant accomplishments throughout the company, not the least of which was running our manufacturing and office locations safely during these times of constant change and distraction.
Without question, we experienced difficulties and unique challenges during the year. However, our employees never lost their resolve to succeed. Our manufacturing and sales organizations continued to successfully adapt to the needs of our customers during this period of unprecedented demand in our packaging business and also effectively manage the market challenges in our paper business brought on by the pandemic as well as working through the impact of multiple hurricanes. Our engineering and technology organization has stayed on track with the key capital projects and process improvements for our box plants and mills and our corporate staff groups found innovative solutions for remote working conditions to ensure we continue to manage the company effectively as well as perform all of the necessary administrative activities that are necessary for our employees or are required as a public company.
I'm very proud of our accomplishments and the strong partnerships we've built with our customers and suppliers over the many years. Looking ahead, as we move from the fourth into the first quarter, our Packaging segment demand should remain strong with shipments exceeding those of last year's record first quarter. This will require us to continue producing containerboard at our Jackson mill in addition to an appropriate amount of white paper to maintain optimal inventory levels for servicing the paper customers.
As Tom mentioned, we expect to realize the majority of our recently announced Packaging segment price increases during the first quarter and we expect average export prices to move higher as well. However, higher freight costs are expected to continue and labor costs will be higher with annual wage inflation and timing related increases to fringes and benefits as we start the new year. Seasonally colder weather will increase energy and wood costs. And we also expect higher prices for recycled fiber. Finally, scheduled outage expenses should be lower although inflation-related increases with our operating supplies and repair costs are expected to offset much of that benefit.
Shelter-in-place and lockdown conditions are constantly changing across the country. And with the new federal administration in place, we expect that guidelines and requirements will continue to evolve. There continues to be numerous events and actions that could significantly impact our expectations and assumptions for the upcoming quarter in both our Packaging and Paper segments. This is true not only for the operation of our facilities but also for the needs of our customers and the availability of services and products we rely on for our -- from our suppliers. As a result, we are not able to appropriately quantify our guidance for the first quarter.
With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions. But I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.
And with that, Holly, I'd like to open up the call to questions, please."

We called it out as very high cost of production. As you can imagine, without spending the capital on the mill that you would normally spend on a conversion that would help you with the pulp yield, as an example, in various -- on the paper machine to improve drying capability, you're limited in productivity and also, again, fiber yield.
So the cost obviously are the highest in our system. But nevertheless, the machine exceeded our expectations in terms of its productivity. And we're extremely pleased during the quarter. The machine accomplished what we needed. And that was providing our box plant system needed tons to continue supplying the box demand for the quarter and try to build a little inventory.
Again, we're extremely pleased. The effort also enabled us to fully understand what we believed would be an appropriate phased approach to consider a conversion of the mills to containerboard in much the same way we looked at the DeRidder mill and the Wallula mill. So we'll be going forward with a discussion with the Board of Directors in February on our different options and alternatives on how we want to approach that.
But we're very pleased. Again, the machine has performed quite well. And as I also called out in October, that machine is just an outstanding paper machine and the mill itself has a lot of great opportunity to go forward.
Bob, do you want to add anything?"

So on the items that you could perhaps have some line of sight on and if we compare it to the year-on-year impact in the fourth quarter, what would you say -- well, we have maintenance outages. But on freight and on energy and any other cost that you again could talk to should be the direction versus the fourth quarter year-on-year change when we look at first quarter?

You can convert any mill to make anything depending on how much capital you're willing to spend on that conversion. That being said, if you look at a mill like DeRidder and mill like Wallula, they're all unique. They have their strengths and weaknesses that you have to address with capital.
Jackson is no different. What you would be typically looking at is in the pulp mill, hot stock refining, defiberizing, various pumping capabilities that would allow you to raise cap on the paper machine itself with stock approach, additional refining capabilities and just mass throughput capabilities with the running containerboard versus a lightweight fiber. So then you're looking at head box dynamics, drainage, formation in terms of the former and then pressing and drying and then winder modifications and role handling.
So there's a comprehensive checklist that you have to go through in doing your analysis. But those are the type of things you would look at in that -- those are the items that we now have a really good understanding of the capability and the limitations. So it's helped us refine our expected scope. But nevertheless, you're talking about a project at a minimum that's in the hundreds of millions of dollars to convert a Jackson mill and do it the way PCA would do a conversion. But it would be a good project.
And so we have other alternatives, obviously, we're looking at. I don't want to get into those. You can imagine. They include everything from further investments in existing assets to looking at other mills and mill opportunities. So it's -- that hasn't changed for years now. So again, that discussion will be a discussion we have with the Board in February."

A direct example of that is at any given time during those few months, we had upwards of 100 people in our mill system that were out either quarantining or positive. And then same thing in the box plant.
So it was a challenge and we saw that through the logistics chain on how our customers were dealing with this and how our carriers were dealing with this in their own workforce capability. And so it was the human factor and the rolling stock factor in terms of trucks and rail in order to move the goods like, say, to meet the unprecedented demand.
And as Tom said, in many cases, we are moving product from plant to plant and plants were cooperating with one another. So it's a very challenging time in that regard."

We're also seeing obviously the big trends in people moving away from cities, buying homes.

This first quarter is not much better than what we saw in the fourth quarter. I would expect as the economy finally recovers and you have workplaces starting to come to some new semblance of normalcy and schools fully opening up across the country all the way up to higher education that at some point over the next year, demand will pick up to a new norm. I don't really know what that new norm will be. I do have to believe that there has been now a permanent demand destruction of some number. People have learned working from home, how they do their business.
And so Jackson currently affords us the opportunity to, short term, take advantage of the asset and make, again, a high-cost, very good quality containerboard. But at the same time, you would have to assume that our box demand grows and our paper demand destruction remains at a certain level that it will be difficult to justify having a very large machine that only is able to fill its orders for a portion of the time in the future years.
So we're looking at that as an opportunity that we have a very strong need for the containerboard. And as we've always done, we have long-term filled those needs internally rather than going out to the outside market. And even if we wanted to go to the outside market now, there are no tons to be purchased.
And so we believe that Jackson ultimately will be a far better asset in the containerboard side of the business ultimately. What the timing is, I'm not sure. I'm just thinking over the next couple of years that, that timing will play out."

You might ask -- you might start with the question of, again, why Jackson and why do what we're doing at Jackson. And as we alluded to earlier, the fact is I can't buy any tons in the open market. We have a great volume demand. We have great need. If anything, our customers are concerned that we have enough supply even as an industry.
So consequently, we were fortunate to be able to have this great asset, as Mark alluded to, that's not going to produce at its normal rate because of the destruction of demand in the white business and we were able to convert it. And yes, it's at a high cost but great quality. It kept us going. It gave us the ability to grow, gave us the ability to satisfy our customers and was incredibly integral to our ability to continue this growth trend. So now when it comes to white and some other things, we have trade agreements. We've got some other arrangements where we're in good shape there. So we're not really that concerned about that.
But these -- again, what you see and I think it's important to point out that what's going on -- what we observe at least in the marketplace and our inability to buy any additional tons, we would have only bought those for a short period of time anyway because we intend to be fully integrated and supply our own tons. And I would assume others might think the same way.
But it's important to note that some of these projects that are continually mentioned out there that are the one-offs, somebody is going to put a mill in with no downstream cut up, very difficult to do. I don't know where they get the customer base. Again, it's -- I can only speak for ourselves. We're going to supply ourselves. We're not buyers in the open market.
So I'm not -- we have to take care of ourselves. I guess that's the point. And you see very few of these one-offs ever come off. I can name one that did and it's now shut down. So I'm not really concerned about that. We have to take care of ourselves and we have to figure out our own supply.

I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of Packaging Corporation of America. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Chief -- Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.
I'll begin the call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide more details. I'll then wrap things up and we'd be glad to take questions.
Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter 2020 net income of $124 million or $1.30 per share. Excluding the special items, fourth quarter 2020 net income was $127 million or $1.33 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2019's net income of $163 million or $1.71 per share. Fourth quarter net sales were $1.7 billion in both 2020 and 2019. Total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding special items, was $293 million in 2020 and $335 million in 2019.
Fourth quarter net income included special items of $3 million primarily for facilities closure and restructuring costs. In addition, we also reported full year 2020 earnings excluding special items of $550 million or $5.78 per share compared to 2019's earnings excluding special items of $726 million or $7.65 per share. Net sales were $6.7 billion in 2020 and $7 billion in 2019. Excluding the special items, total company EBITDA in 2020 was $1.23 billion compared to $1.45 billion in 2019. Details of the special items for both the fourth quarter and full year 2020 and 2019 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release.
Excluding special items, the $0.38 per share decrease in fourth quarter 2020 earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our Packaging segment of $0.30; the Paper segment, $0.05; lower volumes in our Paper segment of $0.27 and higher scheduled maintenance outage costs of $0.08.
High demand for trucks due to low inventories along with driver shortages and rail rate increases drove higher freight expenses of $0.07 and our tax rate was $0.05 per share higher primarily due to some of the benefits we had in 2019 that were not repeated in 2020. These items were partially offset by higher volumes in our Packaging segment of $0.40 per share and excellent management of costs during the quarter, which resulted in lower operating costs of $0.01 and lower other costs of $0.03 per share.
Looking at the Packaging business. EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter of 2020 of $303 million with sales of $1.54 billion resulted in a margin of 20% versus last year's EBITDA of $303 million and sales of $1.46 billion or a 21% margin. For the full year 2020, Packaging segment EBITDA excluding special items was $1.2 billion with sales of $5.9 billion or 21% margin compared to full year 2019 EBITDA of $1.3 billion with sales of $5.9 billion or 22% margin.
Demand in our Packaging segment remained very strong as sales volumes in both the containerboard mills and the corrugated products plants set all-time records. Although we were able to replenish some inventory during the quarter by postponing a large discretionary outage at the DeRidder Mill and utilizing the Jackson mill for additional containerboard production, we again ended the period with inventory levels lower than planned and at a new low from a weeks of supply standpoint due to much stronger-than-expected demand.
As we mentioned on the last quarter's call, during the fourth quarter, we did begin producing high-performance virgin linerboard on the #3 machine at Jackson, Alabama to help meet the continued strong demand from our box plant customers and also to build some much-needed inventory prior to the year-end. The machine's capabilities met our expectations for the quarter, producing excellent quality, lightweight, high-performance grades for the months of November and December. Although as we said previously, these tons are currently at a very high cost, we were able to refine our previous studies and assumptions in order to more accurately estimate the future capital investment and process changes required in a phased approach to fully utilize the potential of the mill to produce containerboard at an optimal cost and quality.
In order for us to address our strategic integrated containerboard supply needs capable of providing the necessary runway to grow our downstream box plant demand, this analysis along with other options we've been evaluating will be reviewed by the Board of Directors in our February meeting. We'll then be able to discuss this further with you.
I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business."

As Mark mentioned, our corrugated products plants established new all-time quarterly records for total box shipments up 9.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter as well as shipments per day up 11.7% compared to last year. Said another way, although there were 3 less shipping days this quarter compared to the third quarter, our total fourth quarter shipments exceeded the third quarter by 2.2%. For the full year, annual corrugated shipment records were set as well, both in total and per day, up 5.8% and 5.4%, respectively, with 1 more shipping day compared to 2019.
Outside sales volume of containerboard was 16,000 tons below last year's fourth quarter as we ran our containerboard system to supply the record needs of our box plants. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.31 per share lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 and down $0.11 per share versus the third quarter of 2020 primarily due to a less rich mix as the graphics and point-of-purchase display business as well as the produce business in the Pacific Northwest tails off during this period. Export containerboard prices were $0.01 per share above both the fourth quarter of 2019 as well as the third quarter of 2020.
As expected, late in the quarter, we began to see the initial benefit of our recently announced Packaging segment price increases. While we don't comment on forward pricing specifics, we would expect to realize the vast majority of the increases during the first quarter of 2021.
I'll now turn it back to Mark."

Market conditions in the Paper segment continued to be challenged due to the nationwide responses to help control the spread of the pandemic. As expected, sales volume was below seasonally stronger third quarter levels and over 30% below the fourth quarter of 2019. As mentioned previously, with the scheduled outage at our International Falls mill, the Jackson mill was restarted on white paper in October and produced both paper and containerboard during the fourth quarter. We'll continue to assess our outlook for paper demand and optimal inventory levels and will run our paper system accordingly.

For the fourth quarter, we generated cash from operations of $271 million and free cash flow of $103 million. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $168 million. Common stock dividends totaled $75 million, $51 million for federal and state income tax payments and net interest payments of $40 million. We ended the year with $975 million of cash on hand or just over $1.1 billion, including marketable securities. Our liquidity at December 31 was just under $1.5 billion.
For the full year 2020, cash from operations was $1.03 billion. We had capital spending of $421 million. Free cash flow was $612 million. Our final recurring effective tax rate for 2020 was 25% and our final reported cash tax rate was 18%.
Regarding full year estimates of certain key items for the upcoming year, we expect total capital expenditures to be between $500 million to $525 million, which excludes any potential capital spending related to the Jackson conversion since that is still being evaluated, as Mark indicated earlier. DD&A is expected to be approximately $407 million. Pension and post-retirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million, which is net of a nonoperating pension benefit of almost $20 million primarily due to our pension asset performance in 2020. We also expect to make cash pension and post-retirement benefit plan contributions of $52 million.
Based on the recent 27% increase to our dividend, we expect dividend payments for the year of $380 million. Our full year interest expense in 2021 is expected to be approximately $95 million and net cash interest payments should be about $93 million. The estimate for our 2021 combined federal and state cash tax rate is about 20.5% and for our book effective tax rate, approximately 25%.
Currently, planned annual maintenance outages at our mills in 2021 will result in approximately 81,000 less tons of containerboard production compared to 2020. The annual earnings impact of these outages, including lost volume, direct costs and amortized repair costs, is expected to be $0.90 per share compared to the $0.65 per share we had in 2020. The current estimated impact by quarter in 2021 is $0.10 per share in the first quarter, $0.25 in the second, $0.13 in the third quarter and $0.42 per share in the fourth.

As they've done through this pandemic, our employees demonstrated tremendous resiliency to overcome adversity in both their personal and work lives to deliver significant accomplishments throughout the company, not the least of which was running our manufacturing and office locations safely during these times of constant change and distraction.
Without question, we experienced difficulties and unique challenges during the year. However, our employees never lost their resolve to succeed. Our manufacturing and sales organizations continued to successfully adapt to the needs of our customers during this period of unprecedented demand in our packaging business and also effectively manage the market challenges in our paper business brought on by the pandemic as well as working through the impact of multiple hurricanes. Our engineering and technology organization has stayed on track with the key capital projects and process improvements for our box plants and mills and our corporate staff groups found innovative solutions for remote working conditions to ensure we continue to manage the company effectively as well as perform all of the necessary administrative activities that are necessary for our employees or are required as a public company.
I'm very proud of our accomplishments and the strong partnerships we've built with our customers and suppliers over the many years. Looking ahead, as we move from the fourth into the first quarter, our Packaging segment demand should remain strong with shipments exceeding those of last year's record first quarter. This will require us to continue producing containerboard at our Jackson mill in addition to an appropriate amount of white paper to maintain optimal inventory levels for servicing the paper customers.
As Tom mentioned, we expect to realize the majority of our recently announced Packaging segment price increases during the first quarter and we expect average export prices to move higher as well. However, higher freight costs are expected to continue and labor costs will be higher with annual wage inflation and timing related increases to fringes and benefits as we start the new year. Seasonally colder weather will increase energy and wood costs. And we also expect higher prices for recycled fiber. Finally, scheduled outage expenses should be lower although inflation-related increases with our operating supplies and repair costs are expected to offset much of that benefit.
Shelter-in-place and lockdown conditions are constantly changing across the country. And with the new federal administration in place, we expect that guidelines and requirements will continue to evolve. There continues to be numerous events and actions that could significantly impact our expectations and assumptions for the upcoming quarter in both our Packaging and Paper segments. This is true not only for the operation of our facilities but also for the needs of our customers and the availability of services and products we rely on for our -- from our suppliers. As a result, we are not able to appropriately quantify our guidance for the first quarter.
With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions. But I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.
And with that, Holly, I'd like to open up the call to questions, please."

As you can imagine, without spending the capital on the mill that you would normally spend on a conversion that would help you with the pulp yield, as an example, in various -- on the paper machine to improve drying capability, you're limited in productivity and also, again, fiber yield.
So the cost obviously are the highest in our system. But nevertheless, the machine exceeded our expectations in terms of its productivity. And we're extremely pleased during the quarter. The machine accomplished what we needed. And that was providing our box plant system needed tons to continue supplying the box demand for the quarter and try to build a little inventory.
Again, we're extremely pleased. The effort also enabled us to fully understand what we believed would be an appropriate phased approach to consider a conversion of the mills to containerboard in much the same way we looked at the DeRidder Mill and the Wallula Mill. So we'll be going forward with a discussion with the Board of Directors in February on our different options and alternatives on how we want to approach that.
But we're very pleased. Again, the machine has performed quite well. And as I also called out in October, that machine is just an outstanding paper machine and the mill itself has a lot of great opportunity to go forward.

You can convert any mill to make anything depending on how much capital you're willing to spend on that conversion. That being said, if you look at a mill like DeRidder and a mill like Wallula, they're all unique. They have their strengths and weaknesses that you have to address with capital.
Jackson is no different. What you would be typically looking at is in the pulp mill, hot stock refining, defiberizing, various pumping capabilities that would allow you to raise cap on the paper machine itself with stock approach, additional refining capabilities and just mass throughput capabilities with the running containerboard versus a lightweight fiber. So then you're looking at head box dynamics, drainage, formation in terms of the former and then pressing and drying and then winder modifications and role handling.
So there's a comprehensive checklist that you have to go through in doing your analysis. But those are the type of things you would look at in that -- those are the items that we now have a really good understanding of the capability and the limitations. So it's helped us refine our expected scope. But nevertheless, you're talking about a project at a minimum that's in the hundreds of millions of dollars to convert a Jackson mill and do it the way PCA would do a conversion. But it would be a good project.
And so we have other alternatives, obviously, we're looking at. I don't want to get into those. You can imagine. They include everything from further investments in existing assets to looking at other mills and mill opportunities. So it's -- that hasn't changed for years now.

I would contend that a lot of purchasing habits have changed, probably accelerated by 5 years or more. And those are expected to remain the same.
We're also seeing obviously the big trends in people moving away from cities, buying homes. When you buy homes, there's a lot of things that go into those homes that are associated with corrugated boxes.

This first quarter is not much better than what we saw in the fourth quarter. I would expect as the economy finally recovers and you have workplaces starting to come to some new semblance of normalcy and schools fully opening up across the country all the way up to higher education that at some point over the next year, demand will pick up to a new norm. I don't really know what that new norm will be. I do have to believe that there has been now a permanent demand destruction of some number. People have learned working from home, how they do their business.
And so Jackson currently affords us the opportunity to, short term, take advantage of the asset and make, again, a high-cost, very good quality containerboard. But at the same time, you would have to assume that our box demand grows and our paper demand destruction remains at a certain level that it will be difficult to justify having a very large machine that only is able to fill its orders for a portion of the time in the future years.
So we're looking at that as an opportunity that we have a very strong need for the containerboard. And as we've always done, we have long-term filled those needs internally rather than going out to the outside market. And even if we wanted to go to the outside market now, there are no tons to be purchased.
And so we believe that Jackson ultimately will be a far better asset in the containerboard side of the business ultimately. What the timing is, I'm not sure. I'm just thinking over the next couple of years that, that timing will play out."

You might ask -- you might start with the question of, again, why Jackson and why do what we're doing at Jackson. And as we alluded to earlier, the fact is I can't buy any tons in the open market. We have a great volume demand. We have great need. If anything, our customers are concerned that we have enough supply even as an industry.
So consequently, we were fortunate to be able to have this great asset, as Mark alluded to, that's not going to produce at its normal rate because of the destruction of demand in the white business and we were able to convert it. And yes, it's at a high cost but great quality. It kept us going. It gave us the ability to grow, gave us the ability to satisfy our customers and was incredibly integral to our ability to continue this growth trend. So now when it comes to white and some other things, we have trade agreements. We've got some other arrangements where we're in good shape there. So we're not really that concerned about that.
But these -- again, what you see and I think it's important to point out that what's going on -- what we observe at least in the marketplace and our inability to buy any additional tons, we would have only bought those for a short period of time anyway because we intend to be fully integrated and supply our own tons. And I would assume others might think the same way.
But it's important to note that some of these projects that are continually mentioned out there that are the one-offs, somebody is going to put a mill in with no downstream cut up, very difficult to do. I don't know where they get the customer base. Again, it's -- I can only speak for ourselves. We're going to supply ourselves. We're not buyers in the open market.
So I'm not -- we have to take care of ourselves. I guess that's the point. And you see very few of these one-offs ever come off. I can name one that did and it's now shut down. So I'm not really concerned about that. We have to take care of ourselves and we have to figure out our own supply.

And that's what we saw going through the December period. And even as we look at the first quarter now, we're probably in that 25% to 30% demand destruction in terms of our business from where it was a year ago. It's not declining further but it's not getting better in any significant manner. Bob?"

I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of Packaging Corporation of America. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Chief -- Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.
I'll begin the call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide more details. I'll then wrap things up and we'd be glad to take questions.
Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter 2020 net income of $124 million or $1.30 per share. Excluding the special items, fourth quarter 2020 net income was $127 million or $1.33 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2019's net income of $163 million or $1.71 per share. Fourth quarter net sales were $1.7 billion in both 2020 and 2019. Total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding special items, was $293 million in 2020 and $335 million in 2019.
Fourth quarter net income included special items of $3 million primarily for facilities closure and restructuring costs. In addition, we also reported full year 2020 earnings excluding special items of $550 million or $5.78 per share compared to 2019's earnings excluding special items of $726 million or $7.65 per share. Net sales were $6.7 billion in 2020 and $7 billion in 2019. Excluding the special items, total company EBITDA in 2020 was $1.23 billion compared to $1.45 billion in 2019. Details of the special items for both the fourth quarter and full year 2020 and 2019 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release.
Excluding special items, the $0.38 per share decrease in fourth quarter 2020 earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our Packaging segment of $0.30; the Paper segment, $0.05; lower volumes in our Paper segment of $0.27 and higher scheduled maintenance outage costs of $0.08.
High demand for trucks due to low inventories along with driver shortages and rail rate increases drove higher freight expenses of $0.07 and our tax rate was $0.05 per share higher primarily due to some of the benefits we had in 2019 that were not repeated in 2020. These items were partially offset by higher volumes in our Packaging segment of $0.40 per share and excellent management of costs during the quarter, which resulted in lower operating costs of $0.01 and lower other costs of $0.03 per share.
Looking at the Packaging business. EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter of 2020 of $303 million with sales of $1.54 billion resulted in a margin of 20% versus last year's EBITDA of $303 million and sales of $1.46 billion or a 21% margin. For the full year 2020, Packaging segment EBITDA excluding special items was $1.2 billion with sales of $5.9 billion or 21% margin compared to full year 2019 EBITDA of $1.3 billion with sales of $5.9 billion or 22% margin.
Demand in our Packaging segment remained very strong as sales volumes in both the containerboard mills and the corrugated products plants set all-time records. Although we were able to replenish some inventory during the quarter by postponing a large discretionary outage at the DeRidder Mill and utilizing the Jackson mill for additional containerboard production, we again ended the period with inventory levels lower than planned and at a new low from a weeks of supply standpoint due to much stronger-than-expected demand.
As we mentioned on the last quarter's call, during the fourth quarter, we did begin producing high-performance virgin linerboard on the #3 machine at Jackson, Alabama to help meet the continued strong demand from our box plant customers and also to build some much-needed inventory prior to the year-end. The machine's capabilities met our expectations for the quarter, producing excellent quality, lightweight, high-performance grades for the months of November and December. Although as we said previously, these tons are currently at a very high cost, we were able to refine our previous studies and assumptions in order to more accurately estimate the future capital investment and process changes required in a phased approach to fully utilize the potential of the mill to produce containerboard at an optimal cost and quality.
In order for us to address our strategic integrated containerboard supply needs capable of providing the necessary runway to grow our downstream box plant demand, this analysis along with other options we've been evaluating will be reviewed by the Board of Directors in our February meeting. We'll then be able to discuss this further with you.
I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business."

As Mark mentioned, our corrugated products plants established new all-time quarterly records for total box shipments up 9.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter as well as shipments per day up 11.7% compared to last year. Said another way",260,"Thanks, Mark. As Mark mentioned, our corrugated products plants established new all-time quarterly records for total box shipments up 9.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter as well as shipments per day up 11.7% compared to last year. Said another way, although there were 3 less shipping days this quarter compared to the third quarter, our total fourth quarter shipments exceeded the third quarter by 2.2%. For the full year, annual corrugated shipment records were set as well, both in total and per day, up 5.8% and 5.4%, respectively, with 1 more shipping day compared to 2019.
Outside sales volume of containerboard was 16,000 tons below last year's fourth quarter as we ran our containerboard system to supply the record needs of our box plants. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.31 per share lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 and down $0.11 per share versus the third quarter of 2020 primarily due to a less rich mix as the graphics and point-of-purchase display business as well as the produce business in the Pacific Northwest tails off during this period. Export containerboard prices were $0.01 per share above both the fourth quarter of 2019 as well as the third quarter of 2020.
As expected, late in the quarter, we began to see the initial benefit of our recently announced Packaging segment price increases. While we don't comment on forward pricing specifics, we would expect to realize the vast majority of the increases during the first quarter of 2021.

Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter was $10 million with sales of $156 million or 6% margin compared to fourth quarter 2019 EBITDA of $53 million and sales of $244 million or a 22% margin.

Market conditions in the Paper segment continued to be challenged due to the nationwide responses to help control the spread of the pandemic. As expected, sales volume was below seasonally stronger third quarter levels and over 30% below the fourth quarter of 2019. As mentioned previously, with the scheduled outage at our International Falls mill, the Jackson mill was restarted on white paper in October and produced both paper and containerboard during the fourth quarter. We'll continue to assess our outlook for paper demand and optimal inventory levels and will run our paper system accordingly.
Average paper prices and mix were 1% below the third quarter of 2020 and approximately 3% below the fourth quarter of 2019.

For the fourth quarter, we generated cash from operations of $271 million and free cash flow of $103 million. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $168 million. Common stock dividends totaled $75 million, $51 million for federal and state income tax payments and net interest payments of $40 million. We ended the year with $975 million of cash on hand or just over $1.1 billion, including marketable securities. Our liquidity at December 31 was just under $1.5 billion.
For the full year 2020, cash from operations was $1.03 billion. We had capital spending of $421 million. Free cash flow was $612 million. Our final recurring effective tax rate for 2020 was 25% and our final reported cash tax rate was 18%.
Regarding full year estimates of certain key items for the upcoming year, we expect total capital expenditures to be between $500 million to $525 million, which excludes any potential capital spending related to the Jackson conversion since that is still being evaluated, as Mark indicated earlier. DD&A is expected to be approximately $407 million. Pension and post-retirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million, which is net of a nonoperating pension benefit of almost $20 million primarily due to our pension asset performance in 2020. We also expect to make cash pension and post-retirement benefit plan contributions of $52 million.
Based on the recent 27% increase to our dividend, we expect dividend payments for the year of $380 million. Our full year interest expense in 2021 is expected to be approximately $95 million and net cash interest payments should be about $93 million. The estimate for our 2021 combined federal and state cash tax rate is about 20.5% and for our book effective tax rate, approximately 25%.
Currently, planned annual maintenance outages at our mills in 2021 will result in approximately 81,000 less tons of containerboard production compared to 2020. The annual earnings impact of these outages, including lost volume, direct costs and amortized repair costs, is expected to be $0.90 per share compared to the $0.65 per share we had in 2020. The current estimated impact by quarter in 2021 is $0.10 per share in the first quarter, $0.25 in the second, $0.13 in the third quarter and $0.42 per share in the fourth.

As they've done through this pandemic, our employees demonstrated tremendous resiliency to overcome adversity in both their personal and work lives to deliver significant accomplishments throughout the company, not the least of which was running our manufacturing and office locations safely during these times of constant change and distraction.
Without question, we experienced difficulties and unique challenges during the year. However, our employees never lost their resolve to succeed. Our manufacturing and sales organizations continued to successfully adapt to the needs of our customers during this period of unprecedented demand in our packaging business and also effectively manage the market challenges in our paper business brought on by the pandemic as well as working through the impact of multiple hurricanes. Our engineering and technology organization has stayed on track with the key capital projects and process improvements for our box plants and mills and our corporate staff groups found innovative solutions for remote working conditions to ensure we continue to manage the company effectively as well as perform all of the necessary administrative activities that are necessary for our employees or are required as a public company.
I'm very proud of our accomplishments and the strong partnerships we've built with our customers and suppliers over the many years. Looking ahead, as we move from the fourth into the first quarter, our Packaging segment demand should remain strong with shipments exceeding those of last year's record first quarter. This will require us to continue producing containerboard at our Jackson mill in addition to an appropriate amount of white paper to maintain optimal inventory levels for servicing the paper customers.
As Tom mentioned, we expect to realize the majority of our recently announced Packaging segment price increases during the first quarter and we expect average export prices to move higher as well. However, higher freight costs are expected to continue and labor costs will be higher with annual wage inflation and timing related increases to fringes and benefits as we start the new year. Seasonally colder weather will increase energy and wood costs. And we also expect higher prices for recycled fiber. Finally, scheduled outage expenses should be lower although inflation-related increases with our operating supplies and repair costs are expected to offset much of that benefit.
Shelter-in-place and lockdown conditions are constantly changing across the country. And with the new federal administration in place, we expect that guidelines and requirements will continue to evolve. There continues to be numerous events and actions that could significantly impact our expectations and assumptions for the upcoming quarter in both our Packaging and Paper segments. This is true not only for the operation of our facilities but also for the needs of our customers and the availability of services and products we rely on for our -- from our suppliers. As a result, we are not able to appropriately quantify our guidance for the first quarter.
With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions. But I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.
And with that, Holly, I'd like to open up the call to questions, please."

As you can imagine, without spending the capital on the mill that you would normally spend on a conversion that would help you with the pulp yield, as an example, in various -- on the paper machine to improve drying capability, you're limited in productivity and also, again, fiber yield.
So the cost obviously are the highest in our system. But nevertheless, the machine exceeded our expectations in terms of its productivity. And we're extremely pleased during the quarter. The machine accomplished what we needed. And that was providing our box plant system needed tons to continue supplying the box demand for the quarter and try to build a little inventory.
Again, we're extremely pleased. The effort also enabled us to fully understand what we believed would be an appropriate phased approach to consider a conversion of the mills to containerboard in much the same way we looked at the DeRidder Mill and the Wallula Mill. So we'll be going forward with a discussion with the Board of Directors in February on our different options and alternatives on how we want to approach that.
But we're very pleased. Again, the machine has performed quite well. And as I also called out in October, that machine is just an outstanding paper machine and the mill itself has a lot of great opportunity to go forward.

You can convert any mill to make anything depending on how much capital you're willing to spend on that conversion. That being said, if you look at a mill like DeRidder and a mill like Wallula, they're all unique. They have their strengths and weaknesses that you have to address with capital.
Jackson is no different. What you would be typically looking at is in the pulp mill, hot stock refining, defiberizing, various pumping capabilities that would allow you to raise cap on the paper machine itself with stock approach, additional refining capabilities and just mass throughput capabilities with the running containerboard versus a lightweight fiber. So then you're looking at head box dynamics, drainage, formation in terms of the former and then pressing and drying and then winder modifications and role handling.
So there's a comprehensive checklist that you have to go through in doing your analysis. But those are the type of things you would look at in that -- those are the items that we now have a really good understanding of the capability and the limitations. So it's helped us refine our expected scope. But nevertheless, you're talking about a project at a minimum that's in the hundreds of millions of dollars to convert a Jackson mill and do it the way PCA would do a conversion. But it would be a good project.
And so we have other alternatives, obviously, we're looking at. I don't want to get into those. You can imagine. They include everything from further investments in existing assets to looking at other mills and mill opportunities. So it's -- that hasn't changed for years now.

This first quarter is not much better than what we saw in the fourth quarter. I would expect as the economy finally recovers and you have workplaces starting to come to some new semblance of normalcy and schools fully opening up across the country all the way up to higher education that at some point over the next year, demand will pick up to a new norm. I don't really know what that new norm will be. I do have to believe that there has been now a permanent demand destruction of some number. People have learned working from home, how they do their business.
And so Jackson currently affords us the opportunity to, short term, take advantage of the asset and make, again, a high-cost, very good quality containerboard. But at the same time, you would have to assume that our box demand grows and our paper demand destruction remains at a certain level that it will be difficult to justify having a very large machine that only is able to fill its orders for a portion of the time in the future years.
So we're looking at that as an opportunity that we have a very strong need for the containerboard. And as we've always done, we have long-term filled those needs internally rather than going out to the outside market. And even if we wanted to go to the outside market now, there are no tons to be purchased.
And so we believe that Jackson ultimately will be a far better asset in the containerboard side of the business ultimately. What the timing is, I'm not sure. I'm just thinking over the next couple of years that, that timing will play out."

You might ask -- you might start with the question of, again, why Jackson and why do what we're doing at Jackson. And as we alluded to earlier, the fact is I can't buy any tons in the open market. We have a great volume demand. We have great need. If anything, our customers are concerned that we have enough supply even as an industry.
So consequently, we were fortunate to be able to have this great asset, as Mark alluded to, that's not going to produce at its normal rate because of the destruction of demand in the white business and we were able to convert it. And yes, it's at a high cost but great quality. It kept us going. It gave us the ability to grow, gave us the ability to satisfy our customers and was incredibly integral to our ability to continue this growth trend. So now when it comes to white and some other things, we have trade agreements. We've got some other arrangements where we're in good shape there. So we're not really that concerned about that.
But these -- again, what you see and I think it's important to point out that what's going on -- what we observe at least in the marketplace and our inability to buy any additional tons, we would have only bought those for a short period of time anyway because we intend to be fully integrated and supply our own tons. And I would assume others might think the same way.
But it's important to note that some of these projects that are continually mentioned out there that are the one-offs, somebody is going to put a mill in with no downstream cut up, very difficult to do. I don't know where they get the customer base. Again, it's -- I can only speak for ourselves. We're going to supply ourselves. We're not buyers in the open market.
So I'm not -- we have to take care of ourselves. I guess that's the point. And you see very few of these one-offs ever come off. I can name one that did and it's now shut down. So I'm not really concerned about that. We have to take care of ourselves and we have to figure out our own supply.

Or is that something that's not possible? Just kind of wondering down the road on export side of Jackson."

I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. 
I'll begin the call with an overview of our first quarter results and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide additional details. I'll then wrap things up, and then we'll be glad to take questions. 
Yesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $167 million or $1.75 per share. First quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.02 per share related to closure costs for certain corrugated products facilities and specific costs related to discontinuing paper operations associated with the previously announced conversion of the No. 3 machine at our Jackson, Alabama mill to linerboard. 
Excluding the special items, first quarter 2021 net income was $169 million or $1.77 per share compared to the first quarter 2020 net income of $143 million or $1.50 per share. First quarter net sales were $1.8 billion in 2021 and $1.7 billion in 2020. Total company EBITDA for the first quarter, excluding special items, was $342 million in 2021 and $311 million in 2020. 
Details of the special items for both the first quarter of 2021 and 2020 were included in the schedules that were accompanying the earnings press release. Excluding the special items, the $0.27 per share increase in first quarter 2021 earnings compared to the first quarter of 2020 was driven primarily by higher volumes of $0.45 and prices in mix, $0.31 in the Packaging segment and lower annual outage expenses for $0.12. The items were partially offset by lower volumes, $0.28 and prices and mix of $0.03 in the Paper segment. 
Operating costs were $0.15 per share higher, primarily due to inflation-related increases, particularly in the areas of labor and benefits expenses and fiber costs and energy. We also had inflation related increases in our converting costs, which were $0.02 per share higher. 
For the last 3 quarters, freight and logistics costs have risen and were $0.12 per share higher in the first quarter compared to last year. Significant increases in fuel costs, tight truck supply and a higher mix of spot pricing to keep up with box demand are the primary drivers. And in the first quarter, we had the issues brought on by the winter storms as well. We also had other expenses of $0.01 per share. 
Looking at the Packaging business. EBITDA, excluding special items in the first quarter of 2021 of $352 million with sales of $1.6 billion, resulted in a margin of 22% versus last year's EBITDA of $290 million and sales of $1.5 billion or a 20% margin. Demand in the Packaging segment remained very strong as sales volume in both our containerboard mills and our corrugated products plants set or matched all-time quarterly records. 
Although we were able to replenish some inventory during the quarter by utilizing the Jackson, Alabama mill for additional containerboard production, we again ended the period with inventory levels lower than planned and at record lows from a weeks of supply standpoint due to stronger-than-expected demand. 
Our mills and box plants displayed outstanding management of their operations to meet customer commitments in spite of several weather-related events that impacted their operations, created raw material availability issues and presented both inbound and outbound freight and logistics challenges. In addition, our facilities continued to deliver on numerous cost reduction initiatives, efficiency improvements and capital projects and bringing the benefits of those efforts to the bottom line. 
We also recently completed 2 high-return strategic projects that we've mentioned to you before, the OCC project at our Wallula mill and the Boiler project at our Filer mill. The tremendous effort our employees put into these initiatives and projects helps us minimize some of the cost inflation we see every year and especially now with what we're seeing in the areas I mentioned previously. 
I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide more details on containerboard sales in our corrugated business."

Total volume in our corrugated products plants was up 6.6% versus last year and equaled the all-time record for total box shipments that we just set in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Shipments per day were up 8.3% over last year, which set a new first quarter record for us. Strong domestic demand drove outside sales volume of containerboard 13% above last year's first quarter. 
Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.26 per share above the first quarter of 2020 and up $0.52 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 as we continue to implement our November 2020 announced price increases during the quarter, and we began the implementation of our announced March increase. 
Export containerboard prices were up $0.05 per share versus last year's first quarter and up $0.04 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.

As expected, sales volume was about 22% below last year as we ran only 1 machine at the Jackson, Alabama mill this quarter versus both machines running in the first quarter of 2020. First quarter paper prices and mix were almost 3% below last year. However, prices began to move higher in the latter part of the quarter, resulting from the announced paper price increases and averaged 1% higher than fourth quarter 2020 average prices. 
Industry conditions in the uncoated free sheet market continue to be challenged due to the nationwide responses to help control the spread of the pandemic. However, with the actions we've taken in our Paper segment to match supply with our customers' demand and moving production on the No. 3 machine at our Jackson, Alabama mill from paper to linerboard, we have not only avoided the significant cost issues associated with extended paper market downtime, but we have also enhanced our capabilities as well as the profitability in our Packaging segment. 
Going forward, we will continue to assess our outlook for paper demand and the optimal inventory levels and will run our paper system accordingly.

I want to update you on our full year guidance for a couple of items that we provided on last quarter's call. Current plans and scope of work for the scheduled maintenance outages at our containerboard mills has changed and the new total company estimated cost impact for the year is $0.97 per share. The actual impact in the first quarter was $0.10 per share and the revised estimated impact by quarter for the remainder of the year is now $0.30 per share in the second quarter, $0.16 in the third and $0.41 per share in the fourth quarter. 
Also, our capital spending estimate for the year has changed to a range of $650 million to $675 million as we have now announced our plans for the conversion of the No. 3 paper machine at our Jackson mill to linerboard.

Regarding the conversion of the No. 3 machine at Jackson, Alabama, our current plans are to continue running the machine on linerboard as demand warrants in a manner similar as to how we ran in the first quarter until the scheduled first phase outage is taken in the second quarter of 2022. 
The converted machine is expected to operate at an initial production rate of approximately 75% of its new capacity. The second phase outage work is planned for mid-2023 with the machine reaching its run rate capacity of 2,000 tons per day by the end of 2023. This phased conversion over the next few years will provide much needed internal linerboard supply. This gives us a runway for maintaining an optimal integration level and enables us to further optimize and enhance our current mill capacity and box plant operations. 
We're committed to being fully integrated, and we have a track record of ramping up production from machine conversions according to our customers' demand requirements. We will continue to serve our paper customers with the #1 paper machine at Jackson, Alabama, and both machines at our international falls, Minnesota mill, which is capable of producing all of Jackson's paper grades. 
Looking ahead, as we move from the first and into the second quarter, in our Packaging segment, we expect demand to remain strong. And we will continue implementing our previously announced paper price increases. 
We also expect export prices to move higher. In the Paper segment, we expect volumes to be fairly flat with higher average prices and mix as we continue the rollout of our recently announced paper price increase. The second quarter will be our busiest of the year for planned annual outages in the Packaging segment with work scheduled at 4 of the mills. 
Outage expenses are estimated to be approximately $0.20 per share higher compared to the first quarter. We also anticipate continued inflation with freight and logistics expenses as well as most of our operating and conversion costs. However, energy costs should improve as we move into seasonally milder weather. 
With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted the forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy, and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. 
And with that, Regina, I'd like to open up the call to questions, please."

My last question, I know it's something you might not want to talk too much live, Mark, on. But qualitatively, if we look at where first quartile and a fourth quartile machine might be in containerboard, would it be unduly penalizing to estimate that maybe right now, Jackson is costing you, I don't know, $10 million a quarter just because of where it is on the cost curve right now and relative to where it will be at some point in the quarter?"

I think everyone could understand that without the capital investment, we are running probably in that high third, low fourth quartile cost portion of the curve. The beauty of it is though it's very productive, very efficient in providing us the critical tons we need to run the box system. 
We've also, in the last 4 months, we've taken considerable cost out as we've learned more about the machine, but the machine has proven to be quite an extremely efficient machine. But the -- someone might think about the capital spending that we are undertaking as we speak that will go through next year and the year after. It's not only the incremental productivity that we'll capture with the capital spending, but it's the significant cost reduction that we'll see over the next 2 years coming out of that facility. 
So we have an elegant plan in place. And right now, even though the costs are higher, as one would expect, the tons are extremely valuable to our system."

But if you think about what we are producing and what we produced in the fourth quarter and what we produced in the first quarter, the Jackson No. 3 machine on a run rate and looking at its grade mix is producing a little over 100,000 tons a quarter. It's in that range. 
And so on an annualized basis, it's providing an incremental 400-plus thousand tons a year to the run rate and part of the reason, again, if you think about the filings, we did not have the machine listed as a true linerboard machine. So it's still  considered a paper machine, providing us with some much-needed linerboard right now. 
Fast forward, to help you with your math, if you assume the 4.3 million plus the 400,000 tons, you get to pretty close to your number. The other factor that we'll give you a little understanding on is the project I mentioned on the call just a few minutes ago, the Wallula OCC project, not only was that going to be a fiber flexibility opportunity for the Wallula mill, but anybody that understands fiber physics, recycled fibers of any kind drain and dry much more easily than virgin fiber. 
And so by mixing now the OCC in with our virgin craft fiber at the Wallula mill, we're seeing, as we expected, much higher speed on the machines, and in particular, the No. 3 machine. The drainage, pressing, drying is far superior than it was before. And so starting in February, when we started the OCC plant up, we've been averaging close to 100 tons a day more production on that machine. And so that's another piece of the incremental first quarter tons that was built in. And that you'll see for the rest of the year also. So that really help -- go ahead."

Until, again, at such time, as businesses resume more of a normal pattern of in-office activity, you won't see cut size demand pick up dramatically. 
As schools come back and go back to a more normalized school day function, more cut size use will take place in school. So I would expect, starting in the fall semester for the new school year that more demand will take place. I can't quantify that for you. I would just say that it should move up positively. 
We do think, ultimately, there -- the pandemic has created a new opportunity for people that they'll work from home, they'll work part days. I mean, people in the business world are obviously trying to understand how we will all run our businesses in the future and whether we'll have people in the office, full time, part time, flex time. And so paper demand will go along with that. 
We are anticipating that there will be some permanent demand destruction that comes out of the pandemic.

So we went ahead and took the machine down for the better part of a week -- last week, as a matter of fact, and address the opportunities and the requirements on that machine and put it in good shape. And so that machine has gone through its outage, but that would be the qualifying difference in the number that Bob's going to talk to you about.

But in recycled fiber, even certain chemicals, repairs, materials, outside services, I mean, you name it, they all have converting cost. They all have an inflationary component that we see continuing into the second quarter. That, of course, freight, freight is another one that is not -- that's just for all the reasons that Mark had mentioned earlier, there are several things driving it.

January, very strong. February would appear to be not quite as strong, but it still was very strong. It just looked like it wasn't quite as strong because we didn't get the shipments. And then March jumped up dramatically, but that was driven primarily by some of the shipments we didn't have in -- we didn't get done in February. 
So overall, when I look back, I say, the demand was, as we said, coming out of the fourth quarter with incredibly high demand, it remained essentially very close to that going through the entire first quarter. And now you're seeing same indications starting into the second quarter."

Good morning, and again, I appreciate everybody participating today in Packaging Corporation of America's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.  
I'll begin the call with an overview of our first quarter results and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide additional details. I'll then wrap things up, and then we'll be glad to take questions.  
Yesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $167 million or $1.75 per share. First quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.02 per share related to closure costs for certain corrugated products facilities and specific costs related to discontinuing paper operations associated with the previously announced conversion of the No. 3 machine at our Jackson, Alabama mill to linerboard.  
Excluding the special items, first quarter 2021 net income was $169 million or $1.77 per share compared to the first quarter 2020 net income of $143 million or $1.50 per share. First quarter net sales were $1.8 billion in 2021 and $1.7 billion in 2020. Total company EBITDA for the first quarter, excluding special items, was $342 million in 2021 and $311 million in 2020.  
Details of the special items for both the first quarter of 2021 and 2020 were included in the schedules that were accompanying the earnings press release. Excluding the special items, the $0.27 per share increase in first quarter 2021 earnings compared to the first quarter of 2020 was driven primarily by higher volumes of $0.45 and prices in mix, $0.31 in the Packaging segment and lower annual outage expenses for $0.12. The items were partially offset by lower volumes, $0.28 and prices and mix of $0.03 in the Paper segment.  
Operating costs were $0.15 per share higher, primarily due to inflation-related increases, particularly in the areas of labor and benefits expenses and fiber costs and energy. We also had inflation related increases in our converting costs, which were $0.02 per share higher.  
For the last 3 quarters, freight and logistics costs have risen and were $0.12 per share higher in the first quarter compared to last year. Significant increases in fuel costs, high truck supply and a higher mix of spot pricing to keep up with box demand are the primary drivers. And in the first quarter, we had the issues brought around by the winter storms as well.  We also had other expenses of $0.01 per share.  
Looking at the Packaging business. EBITDA, excluding special items in the first quarter of 2021 of $352 million with sales of $1.6 billion, resulted in a margin of 22% versus last year's EBITDA of $290 million and sales of $1.5 billion or a 20% margin. Demand in the Packaging segment remained very strong as sales volume in both our containerboard mills and our corrugated products plants set or matched all-time quarterly records.  
Although we were able to replenish some inventory during the quarter by utilizing the Jackson, Alabama mill for additional containerboard production, we again ended the period with inventory levels lower than planned and at record lows from a weeks of supply standpoint due to stronger-than-expected demand.  
Our mills and box plants displayed outstanding management of their operations to meet customer commitments in spite of several weather-related events that impacted their operations, created raw material availability issues and presented both inbound and outbound freight and logistics challenges. In addition, our facilities continued to deliver on numerous cost reduction initiatives, efficiency improvements and capital projects and bringing the benefits of those efforts to the bottom line.  
We also recently completed 2 high-return strategic projects that we've mentioned to you before. The OCC project at our Wallula Mill and the Boiler project at our Filer mill. The tremendous effort our employees put into these initiatives and projects helps us minimize some of the cost inflation we see every year and especially now with what we're seeing in the areas I mentioned previously.  
I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide more details on containerboard sales in our corrugated business."

As Mark mentioned, corrugated products and containerboard demand were very strong during the quarter. Total volume in our corrugated products plants was up 6.6% versus last year and equaled the all-time record for total box shipments that we just set in the fourth quarter of 2020.  
Shipments per day were up 8.3% over last year, which set a new first quarter record for us. Strong domestic demand drove outside sales volume of containerboard 13% above last year's first quarter. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.26 per share above the first quarter of 2020 and up $0.52 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 as we continue to implement our November 2020 announced price increases during the quarter, and we began the implementation of our announced March increase.  
Export containerboard prices were up $0.05 per share versus last year's first quarter and up $0.04 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.  
I'll now turn it back to Mark."

As expected, sales volume was about 22% below last year as we ran only 1 machine at the Jackson, Alabama mill this quarter versus both machines running in the first quarter of 2020. First quarter paper prices and mix were almost 3% below last year. However, prices began to move higher in the latter part of the quarter, resulting from the announced paper price increases and averaged 1% higher than fourth quarter 2020 average prices.  
Industry conditions in the uncoated free sheet market continue to be challenged due to the nationwide responses to help control the spread of the pandemic. However, with the actions we've taken in our Paper segment to match supply with our customers' demand and moving production on the No. 3 machine at our Jackson, Alabama mill from paper to linerboard, we have not only avoided the significant cost issues associated with extended paper market downtime, but we have also enhanced our capabilities as well as the profitability in our Packaging segment.  
Going forward, we will continue to assess our outlook for paper demand and the optimal inventory levels and we will run our paper system accordingly.  
I'll now turn it over to Bob."

I want to update you on our full year guidance for a couple of items that we provided on last quarter's call. Current plans and scope of work for the scheduled maintenance outages at our containerboard mills has changed and the new total company estimated cost impact for the year is $0.97 per share. The actual impact in the first quarter was $0.10 per share and the revised estimated impact by quarter for the remainder of the year is now $0.30 per share in the second quarter, $0.16 in the third and $0.41 per share in the fourth quarter.

Regarding the conversion, the No. 3 machine at Jackson, Alabama, our current plans are to continue running the machine on linerboard as demand warrants in a manner similar as to how we ran in the first quarter until the scheduled first phase outage is taken in the second quarter of 2022.  
The converted machine is expected to operate at an initial production rate of approximately 75% of its new capacity. The second phase outage work is planned for mid-2023 with the machine reaching its run rate capacity of 2,000 tons per day by the end of 2023. This phased conversion over the next few years will provide much needed internal linerboard supply. This gives us a runway for maintaining an optimal integration level and enables us to further optimize and enhance our current mill capacity and box plant operations.  
We're committed to being fully integrated, and we have a track record of ramping up production from machine conversions according to our customers' demand requirements. We will continue to serve our paper customers with the No. 1 paper machine at Jackson, Alabama, and both machines at our International Falls, Minnesota mill, which is capable of producing all of Jackson's paper grades.  
Looking ahead, as we move from the first and into the second quarter, in our Packaging segment, we expect demand to remain strong. And we will continue implementing our previously announced paper price increases.  
We also expect export prices to move higher. In the Paper segment, we expect volumes to be fairly flat with higher average prices and mix as we continue the rollout of our recently announced paper price increase. The second quarter will be our busiest of the year for planned annual outages in the Packaging segment with work scheduled at 4 of the mills. Outage expenses are estimated to be approximately $0.20 per share higher compared to the first quarter. We also anticipate continued inflation with freight and logistics expenses as well as most of our operating and conversion costs. However, energy costs should improve as we move into seasonally milder weather.  
With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy, and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC.

My last question, I know it's something you might not want to talk too much live mic on. But qualitatively, if we look at where our first quartile and a fourth quartile machine might be in containerboard, would it be unduly penalizing to estimate that maybe right now, Jackson is costing you, I don't know, $10 million a quarter just because of where it is on the cost curve right now and relative to where it will be at some point in the quarter?"

We've also, in the last 4 months, we've taken considerable cost out as we've learned more about the machine, but the machine has proven to be quite an extremely efficient machine. But the -- someone might think about the capital spending that we are undertaking as we speak that will go through next year and the year after. It's not only the incremental productivity that we'll capture with the capital spending, but it's the significant cost reduction that we'll see over the next 2 years coming out of that facility.

But if you think about what we are producing and what we produced in the fourth quarter and what we produced in the first quarter, the Jackson No. 3 machine on a run rate and looking at its grade mix is producing a little over 100,000 tons a quarter. It's in that range. 
And so on an annualized basis, it's providing an incremental 400-plus thousand tons a year to the run rate and part of the reason, again, if you think about the filings, we did not have the machine listed as a true linerboard machine. So it's still -- we still considered a paper machine, providing us with some much-needed linerboard right now. 
Fast forward, to help you with your math, if you assume the 4.3 million plus the 400,000 tons, you get to pretty close to your number. The other factor that we'll give you a little understanding on is the project I mentioned on the call just a few minutes ago, the Wallula OCC project, not only was that going to be a fiber flexibility opportunity for the Wallula mill, but anybody that understands fiber physics, recycled fibers of any kind drain and dry much more easily than virgin fiber. 
And so by mixing now the OCC in with our virgin craft fiber at the Wallula mill, we're seeing, as we expected, much higher speed on the machines, and in particular, the No. 3 machine. The drainage, pressing, drying is far superior than it was before. And so starting in February, when we started the OCC plant up, we've been averaging close to 100 tons a day more production on that machine. And so that's another piece of the incremental first quarter tons that was built in. And that you'll see for the rest of the year also. So that really help -- go ahead."

Until, again, at such time, as businesses resume more of a normal pattern of in-office activity, you won't see cut size demand pick up dramatically. 
As schools come back and go back to a more normalized school day function, more cut size use will take place in school. So I would expect, starting in the fall semester for the new school year that more demand will take place. I can't quantify that for you. I would just say that it should move up positively. 
We do think, ultimately, there -- the pandemic has created a new opportunity for people that they'll work from home, they'll work part days. I mean, people in the business world are obviously trying to understand how we will all run our businesses in the future and whether we'll have people in the office, full time, part time, flex time. And so paper demand will go along with that. 
We are anticipating that there will be some permanent demand destruction that comes out of the pandemic. We also understand that because of our demand for containerboard and the opportunity we had with Jackson, that as we've always looked at the paper business that it was the right decision to make for all the reasons we talked about over the last 6 months to utilize the asset and exit some of this market.

So if you look at our capital effectiveness and the returns on our capital spending, we're very pleased with the returns that we see. And so capital is a matter of affordability and opportunity. And obviously, I don't ever see us not having opportunities, and then it becomes a matter of affordability.

January, very strong. February would appear to be not quite as strong, but it still was very strong. It just looked like it wasn't quite as strong because we didn't get the shipments.

I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Ex",775,"Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.
I'll begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide further details. I'll then wrap things up, and then we'd be glad to take questions.
Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $207 million or $2.17 per share. Excluding special items, second quarter 2021 net income was also $207 million or $2.17 per share compared to the second quarter of 2020 net income of $132 million or $1.38 per share.
Second quarter net sales were $1.9 billion in 2021 and $1.5 billion in 2020. The Total company EBITDA for the second quarter, excluding special items, was $397 million in 2021 and $299 million in 2020. Reported earnings in the second quarter of 2021 included special items expense and income rounding to a negligible impact while last year's second quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.79 per share related primarily to the impairment of goodwill associated with our paper segment.
Details of all special items for the second quarter of 2021 and 2020 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings release conference, a press release. Excluding special items, the $0.79 per share increase in second quarter 2021 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2020 was driven primarily by higher prices and mix of $1.01 and volume $0.74 in our Packaging segment, higher volume in our Paper segment of $0.03; and lower nonoperating pension expense of $0.03.
These items were partially offset by higher operating costs of $0.57, primarily due to inflation-related increases in the areas of labor and fringes, repairs, materials and supplies, recycled fiber costs as well as other indirect and fixed cost areas. We also had inflation-related increases in our converting costs, which were higher by $0.05 per share, while annual outage expenses were up $0.19 per share compared to last year.
Freight and logistics expenses were higher by $0.19 per share, driven by historically high load-to-truck ratios, driver shortages, increases in fuel costs and a higher mix of spot pricing to keep pace with the box demand.
Lastly, depreciation expense was higher by $0.01 per share and Paper segment prices and mix were lower by $0.01 per share. Looking at our Packaging business. EBITDA, excluding special items in the second quarter of 2021 of $409 million with sales of $1.7 billion resulted in a margin of 24% versus last year's EBITDA of $313 million and sales of $1.4 billion or a 22% margin.
Our mills and plants continue to do an outstanding job of meeting our customer needs while managing through certain material and chemical availability issues, a tight labor market, various freight and logistics challenges as well as the planned maintenance outages at 4 of our mills during the second quarter.
The mill executed the planned outages extremely well. And with the help of the #3 machine at our Jackson, Alabama Mill, provided our plants the necessary containerboard to achieve an all-time record for total box shipments. Although we were able to build some much needed inventory, due to very high demand, we ended the second quarter below our targeted levels and at a new low for weeks of inventory supply for this time of the year and ahead of expected very busy third and fourth quarters.
In the second half of the year, we still anticipate a planned outage at our Jackson, Alabama Mill later in the third quarter as well as a significant planned outage at our DeRidder Mill in the fourth quarter. Implementation of the previously announced price increases continues to be executed extremely well by our sales organization while our engineering and technology organization and the employees at all of our mills and corrugated products plants continue to successfully implement numerous initiatives and projects to reduce cost through efficiency, productivity and optimization improvements with inflation-driven cost increases across most all areas of our company, coupled with truck, rail and barge challenges for both incoming and outgoing products and materials at our facilities, these efforts are absolutely critical to our success.
In addition, being a primarily virgin fiber-based producer of containerboard minimizes the impact of significant increases in recycled fiber costs over the last several quarters. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business."

As Mark indicated, containerboard and corrugated products demand remains very strong across most of all of our end markets. Our plants achieved a new all-time quarterly record for total box shipments as well as a second quarter record for shipments per day, both of which were up 9.6% compared to last year's second quarter.
Through the first half of 2021, our box shipment volume is up 9% on a per day basis versus the industry being up 6.8%. Driven by higher domestic demand, outside sales volume of containerboard was about 43,000 tons above the second quarter of 2020, but was down slightly versus the first quarter of this year due to lower export shipments, supplying the record requirements of our box plants and the need to position inventory levels ahead of what appears to be a strong second half of the year.
We are getting good realization from the implementation of our previously announced price increases across all product lines. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.92 per share above the second quarter of 2020 and up $0.51 per share compared to the first quarter of 2021.
Export containerboard prices were up $0.09 per share versus last year's second quarter and up $0.04 compared to the first quarter of 2021. Finally, I'd like to reemphasize some of what Mark was pointing out regarding the many things we do to help offset inflation and improve our margins beyond just price increases.
The benefits from our capital spending strategy in the box plants that we've spoken about over the last few years have been extremely successful and put us in position to serve our customers better than ever before. Our strategy of improving the technology and equipment in our plants and optimizing our footprint through the construction of new facilities as well as closing certain plants to consolidate business with other locations is based upon our customers' needs and demands and improving our capabilities to grow with them.
We're seeing this in our volume growth with new and existing customers, operating efficiencies and savings and cost reductions in several conversion areas throughout our plants. I'll now turn it back to Mark."

Although about 1% below second quarter 2020 levels, prices and mix moved higher for the first and into the second quarter of 2021 as we continue to implement our announced price increases.
Volume was 17% above last year when pandemic issues caused us to take both machines at the Jackson, Alabama Mill down for 2 months during the second quarter. While this year, we ran the #1 machine at Jackson on paper and the #3 machine ran linerboard. Now that we have our finished goods inventory at a new optimal level, sales volume in the second quarter is fairly reflective of what our production capability is as a 3-machine paper system.
We'll continue to assess our outlook for paper demand and we'll run our paper system accordingly. I'll now turn it over to Bob."

As we move from the second to the third quarter, in our Packaging segment, we expect continued strong demand for containerboard and corrugated products with one additional day for box shipments. Paper segment volume should be relatively flat, primarily due to the scheduled maintenance outage at the Jackson Mill.
We will also continue to implement our previously announced price increases in both our Packaging and Paper segments. Our annual outage costs will be lower with one outage in the third quarter versus 4 mill outages in the second quarter. Inflation associated with most of the operating costs as well as freight and logistics expenses is expected to continue.
Energy costs will also be impacted due to higher seasonal usage and wood costs in our southern mills will be higher due to wet weather, low inventory and high demand. Considering these items, we expect third quarter earnings of $2.37 per share. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call today constitute forward-looking statements.

I can tell you that going into the third quarter, our bookings and billings are running about 7% ahead of last year. Keep in mind that our comps become much tougher so it's not as if volume has slowed down at all.
It's remained incredibly robust coming right out of the fourth quarter of last year and all the way through this year. I think that's why we felt quite a bit more comfortable about giving some sort of guidance going forward.
Also, you asked about the -- some of the lack of supply in the second quarter, maybe bleeding over into the third quarter. We're running lead times that are longer than we're used to and certainly longer than our customers are used to. So the demand remains very high, trying to get it out the door is an issue more related to transportation at this stage than it is certainly about paper.
We're able to take care of our own plants through our system. So that's not the issue for us. It's more transportation. And I think that's reflective of most of the industry."

And then lastly, on cost you flagged wood cost, I think, particularly in the South.

But this isn't any different than the price increases we've had in the past. It's a very disciplined approach that we do. We roll them in over approximately in the 90-day period. We have local accounts that go in at maybe a quicker rate than some of our contractual accounts.
If you want to look at the 3 price increases kind of separately, the first price increase was effectively done. And -- but you do have some bleed over depending on contracts and things like that, timing. Those can be impacted. Second, price increase, the same way. It's -- it rolls out over a whole 90-day period. Third price increase hasn't been reflected yet in pulp and paper.
It's obviously we have raised prices to our independent customers and our linerboard and medium customers domestically. Those are in place. But the lion's share of the price increase, which goes through boxes, again, that will flow through over a 90-day period. So virtually none of that would be reflected at this stage in the third quarter."

So far, we've maintained very close to those kind of numbers. And I think it's just indicative of what the market is right now and the changes that have taken place from consumer habits.
Also, I'll remind you that last year, during COVID, of course, from a mix standpoint, our display business had basically gone to nothing because of the shutdowns and no shopping in brick-and-mortar and things like that so. So that end of the business had dried up quite a bit, and that's back now.
And then also, we've had good cost controls in terms of getting this volume out as we've indicated, a lot of these capital projects are paying off. So we can -- we're very comfortable with the number."

But I think more than anything, we just remained very prudent in how we go about looking at that use of cash and being mindful that every dollar is extremely valuable. And again, quite frankly, currently, I would rather take $1 of cash and put it into a good capital project in a box plant or a mill because we get immediate return for it, low-risk, high-return opportunity.

We had a lot of offshoring of manufacturing activity that created a decrease in corrugated product demand.

It wasn't a one-to-one correlation, but there was a high correlation. To the 1980s into the 1990s, that correlation separated. And again, in the GDP equation, service industry became a bigger factor in GDP, manufacturing was less of a component.
What we're seeing is more onshoring of manufacturing, more American businesses investing here in the United States and manufacturing. Box demand tied to that factor.

And then in the summer, we had that one tropical system that came through in June, came up through the Southeast. But we've gone through wet periods before, but what's also a major factor is the availability of the trucking side of the equation in terms of log hauling to a mill is dependent on trucks.
And so those truck drivers have a choice. They can go and work over the road, hauling various goods or go into the woods and haul logs. And so there's been extreme competition for truck drivers. So I would think, though, that if we get a dry period or a normal weather period in the south, you'll see a significant normalization of wood cost relatively quickly. And then everything else, dependent on the economy in terms of labor, driver availability on that side of the equation. So it's a -- there's 2 major factors in that equation."

And so mills across the southern region would be starting to stockpile wood in their laydown yards in their wet storage areas, satellite wet storage areas for the upcoming what would traditionally be a wet late fall, winter period.
So you compound the problem right now that the inventories across the mill system in the south and southeast have been depleted. We're running basically day-to-day short inventories. We're also not able to start our winter wood build as an industry, as you can imagine. So it's going to be important that we do get a dry period because we have to set ourselves up for the late fall and winter when you really get the weather systems coming through with the traditional lows that come out of the Gulf of Mexico and move up through.

Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. 
I'll begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide further details. I'll then wrap things up, and then we'd be glad to take questions. 
Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $207 million or $2.17 per share. Excluding special items, second quarter 2021 net income was also $207 million or $2.17 per share compared to the second quarter of 2020 net income of $132 million or $1.38 per share. 
Second quarter net sales were $1.9 billion in 2021 and $1.5 billion in 2020. Total company EBITDA for the second quarter, excluding special items, was $397 million in 2021 and $299 million in 2020. Reported earnings in the second quarter of 2021 included special items expense and income rounding to a negligible impact while last year's second quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.79 per share related primarily to the impairment of goodwill associated with our Paper segment. 
Details of all special items for the second quarter of 2021 and 2020 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings release conference, a press release. Excluding special items, the $0.79 per share increase in second quarter 2021 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2020 was driven primarily by higher prices and mix of $1.01 and volume $0.74 in our Packaging segment, higher volume in our Paper segment of $0.03; and lower nonoperating pension expense of $0.03. 
These items were partially offset by higher operating costs of $0.57, primarily due to inflation-related increases in the areas of labor and fringes, repairs, materials and supplies, recycled fiber costs as well as other indirect and fixed cost areas. We also had inflation-related increases in our converting costs, which were higher by $0.05 per share, while annual outage expenses were up $0.19 per share compared to last year. 
Freight and logistics expenses were higher by $0.19 per share, driven by historically high load-to-truck ratios, driver shortages, increases in fuel costs and a higher mix of spot pricing to keep pace with the box demand. 
Lastly, depreciation expense was higher by $0.01 per share and Paper segment prices and mix were lower by $0.01 per share. 
Looking at our Packaging business, EBITDA, excluding special items in the second quarter of 2021 of $409 million with sales of $1.7 billion resulted in a margin of 24% versus last year's EBITDA of $313 million and sales of $1.4 billion or a 22% margin. 
Our mills and plants continue to do an outstanding job of meeting our customer needs while managing through certain material and chemical availability issues, a tight labor market, various freight and logistics challenges as well as the planned maintenance outages at 4 of our mills during the second quarter. 
The mills executed the planned outages extremely well. And with the help of the No. 3 machine at our Jackson, Alabama Mill, provided our plants the necessary containerboard to achieve an all-time record for total box shipments. Although we were able to build some much needed inventory, due to very high demand, we ended the second quarter below our targeted levels and at a new low for weeks of inventory supply for this time of the year and ahead of expected very busy third and fourth quarters. 
In the second half of the year, we still anticipate a planned outage at our Jackson, Alabama Mill later in the third quarter as well as a significant planned outage at our DeRidder Mill in the fourth quarter. 
Implementation of the previously announced price increases continues to be executed extremely well by our sales organization while our engineering and technology organization and the employees at all of our mills and corrugated products plants continue to successfully implement numerous initiatives and projects to reduce cost through efficiency, productivity and optimization improvements with inflation-driven cost increases across almost all areas of our company, coupled with truck, rail and barge challenges for both incoming and outgoing products and materials at our facilities, these efforts are absolutely critical to our success. 
In addition, being a primarily virgin fiber-based producer of containerboard minimizes the impact of significant increases in recycled fiber costs over the last several quarters. 
I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business."

As Mark indicated, containerboard and corrugated products demand remains very strong across most of all of our end markets. Our plants achieved a new all-time quarterly record for total box shipments as well as a second quarter record for shipments per day, both of which were up 9.6% compared to last year's second quarter. 
Through the first half of 2021, our box shipment volume is up 9% on a per day basis versus the industry being up 6.8%. Driven by higher domestic demand, outside sales volume of containerboard was about 43,000 tons above the second quarter of 2020, but was down slightly versus the first quarter of this year due to lower export shipments, supplying the record requirements of our box plants and the need to position inventory levels ahead of what appears to be a strong second half of the year. 
We are getting good realization from the implementation of our previously announced price increases across all product lines. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.92 per share above the second quarter of 2020 and up $0.51 per share compared to the first quarter of 2021. 
Export containerboard prices were up $0.09 per share versus last year's second quarter and up $0.04 compared to the first quarter of 2021. 
Finally, I'd like to reemphasize some of what Mark was pointing out regarding the many things we do to help offset inflation and improve our margins beyond just price increases. The benefits from our capital spending strategy in the box plants that we've spoken about over the last few years have been extremely successful and put us in position to serve our customers better than ever before. Our strategy of improving the technology and equipment in our plants and optimizing our footprint through the construction of new facilities as well as closing certain plants to consolidate business with other locations is based upon our customers' needs and demands and improving our capabilities to grow with them. We're seeing this in our volume growth with new and existing customers, operating efficiencies and savings and cost reductions in several conversion areas throughout our plants. 
I'll now turn it back to Mark."

Although about 1% below second quarter 2020 levels, prices and mix moved higher for the first and into the second quarter of 2021 as we continue to implement our announced price increases. 
Volume was 17% above last year when pandemic issues caused us to take both machines at the Jackson, Alabama Mill down for 2 months during the second quarter. While this year, we ran the No. 1 machine at Jackson on paper and the No. 3 machine ran linerboard. Now that we have our finished goods inventory at a new optimal level, sales volume in the second quarter is fairly reflective of what our production capability is as a 3-machine paper system. We'll continue to assess our outlook for paper demand and we'll run our paper system accordingly.

As we move from the second to the third quarter, in our Packaging segment, we expect continued strong demand for containerboard and corrugated products with one additional day for box shipments. Paper segment volume should be relatively flat, primarily due to the scheduled maintenance outage at the Jackson Mill. 
We will also continue to implement our previously announced price increases in both our Packaging and Paper segments. Our annual outage costs will be lower with one outage in the third quarter versus 4 mill outages in the second quarter. Inflation associated with most of the operating costs as well as freight and logistics expenses is expected to continue. 
Energy costs will also be impacted due to higher seasonal usage and wood costs in our southern mills will be higher due to wet weather, low inventory and high demand. Considering these items, we expect third quarter earnings of $2.37 per share. 
With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call today constitute forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties and including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC.

And with that, Stephanie, I'd like to open the call for questions, please."

I can tell you that going into the third quarter, our bookings and billings are running about 7% ahead of last year. Keep in mind that our comps become much tougher so it's not as if volume has slowed down at all. It's remained incredibly robust coming right out of the fourth quarter of last year and all the way through this year. I think that's why we felt quite a bit more comfortable about giving some sort of guidance going forward. 
Also, you asked about the -- some of the lack of supply in the second quarter, maybe bleeding over into the third quarter. We're running lead times that are longer than we're used to and certainly longer than our customers are used to. So the demand remains very high, trying to get it out the door is an issue more related to transportation at this stage than it is certainly about paper. We're able to take care of our own plants through our system. So that's not the issue for us. It's more transportation. And I think that's reflective of most of the industry."

Second price increase, the same way. It's -- it rolls out over a whole 90-day period. Third price increase hasn't been reflected yet in pulp and paper. So obviously we have raised prices to our independent customers and our linerboard and medium customers domestically. Those are in place.

Also, I'll remind you that last year, during COVID, of course, from a mix standpoint, our display business had basically gone to nothing because of the shutdowns and no shopping in brick-and-mortar and things like that so.

And -- but interestingly enough, I'll also point out, our customer base is telling us that they could ship a lot more.

And so what may have taken about 5 years to have occurred took place in a matter of a year, those demands have certainly helped the corrugated box business.

But I think more than anything, we just remained very prudent in how we go about looking at that use of cash and being mindful that every dollar is extremely valuable. And again, quite frankly, currently, I would rather take $1 of cash and put it into a good capital project in a box plant or a mill because we get immediate return for it, low-risk, high-return opportunity. Same thing with dividends, dividend being a board level matter. We continue to discuss that periodically and understand that dividend should be meaningful, but sustainable. 
And then as time goes on, we'll just continue to look at the bigger opportunities. But I think, again, one of our virtues that we've held closely is our patients and that we're extremely patient group. So that's long answer to your question."

How do you retain and how do you attract people when the demand is so high for the current labor pool in this country. So I think we're in a good place. Our retention rates continue to be high.

At the same time, if you went back over the last 60 years for many decades up into that 1980s, 1990s period, box demand was strongly correlated to GDP. It wasn't a one-to-one correlation, but there was a high correlation. To the 1980s into the 1990s, that correlation separated. And again, in the GDP equation, service industry became a bigger factor in GDP, manufacturing was less of a component.
What we're seeing is more onshoring of manufacturing, more American businesses investing here in the United States in manufacturing. Box demand tied to that factor. And I have to believe that as we go forward into the next few decades as an example, that you will see on a trend line basis, the box demand will have a new, very strong correlation to GDP in general.

And then in the summer, we had that one tropical system that came through in June, came up through the Southeast. But we've gone through wet periods before, but what's also a major factor is the availability of the trucking side of the equation in terms of log hauling to a mill is dependent on trucks.
And so those truck drivers have a choice. They can go and work over the road, hauling various goods or go into the woods and haul logs. And so there's been extreme competition for truck drivers. So I would think, though, that if we get a dry period or a normal weather period in the south, you'll see a significant normalization of wood cost relatively quickly. And then everything else, dependent on the economy in terms of labor, driver availability on that side of the equation. So it's a -- there's 2 major factors in that equation."

But again, that's something we can't control. So you do the best you can. But currently, we're okay with where we are. We're just -- again, I'll point out, the industry typically at this time of year would be starting their winter wood build. And so mills across the southern region would be starting to stockpile wood in their laydown yards and their wet storage areas, satellite wet storage areas for the upcoming what would traditionally be a wet late fall, wet winter period.
So you compound the problem right now that the inventories across the mill system in the south and southeast have been depleted. We're running basically day-to-day short inventories. We're also not able to start our winter wood build as an industry, as you can imagine. So it's going to be important that we do get a dry period because we have to set ourselves up for the late fall and winter when you really get the weather systems coming through with the traditional lows that come out of the Gulf of Mexico and move up through.

Good morning, everyone, and again, thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. I am Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, the Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of the third quarter results, and then I will be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide more details. After that, I'll wrap things up, and we'd be glad to take any questions. 
Yesterday, we reported third quarter net income of $251 million or $2.63 per share. Excluding the special items, third quarter 2021 net income was $257 million or $2.69 per share compared to third quarter 2020 net income of $149 million or $1.57 per share. Third quarter net sales were $2 billion in 2021 and $1.7 billion in 2020. Total company EBITDA for the third quarter, excluding the special items, was $464 million in 2021 and $323 million in 2020. 
Third quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.06 per share, primarily for certain costs at the Jackson, Alabama Mill for paper to containerboard conversion related activities. While last year's third quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.11 per share that were related primarily to the impact of Hurricane Laura on the DeRidder, Louisiana Mill. Details of all the special items for the third quarter of 2021 were included in the schedules that accompanied the earnings press release. Excluding the special items, the [ $1.12 ] per share increase in third quarter 2021 earnings compared to the third quarter of 2020, was driven primarily by higher prices and mix of $1.58 and volume $0.62 in our Packaging segment; higher production volume of $0.06 and prices and mix of $0.05 in our Paper segment; and lower nonoperating pension expense, $0.03; and lower interest expense, $0.01. 
Items were partially offset by operating costs, which were $0.84 per share higher, primarily due to inflation-related increases, particularly in the areas of labor and benefits expenses, recycled fiber costs, energy, repairs, materials and supplies as well as several other indirect and fixed cost areas. We also had inflation-related increases in our converting costs, which were $0.10 per share higher. For the last several quarters, freight and logistics costs have risen and were $0.23 per share higher compared to last year, driven by significant increases in fuel costs, tight truck supply, driver shortages and a higher mix of spot pricing to keep up with box demand. And finally, scheduled outage expenses were $0.04 per share higher than last year, and sales volume in our paper segment was lower by $0.02 per share. 
Looking at the Packaging business, excluding special items in the third quarter of 2021 of $467 million with sales of $1.8 billion, resulted in a margin of 26% versus last year's EBITDA of $324 million with sales of $1.5 billion and a 22% margin. Packaging segment demand remained strong, and the teams did a tremendous job of implementing our previously announced containerboard and corrugated products price increases. The containerboard mills set an all-time quarterly sales volume record and our box plants set new third quarter records for total corrugated product shipments as well as shipments per day. 
By utilizing the capability of both machines at our Jackson, Alabama mill to produce containerboard, we were able to reach our desired inventory levels to better serve our customer demand, help minimize the transportation challenges we continue to experience and build some inventory ahead of the DeRidder Mills fourth quarter outage. We manage very effectively the execution of numerous initiatives and capital projects to reduce costs through efficiency, productivity and optimization improvements across our manufacturing locations. We continue to put tremendous effort into managing certain material, equipment and labor availability issues to keep our customers supplied and their needs and their capital projects on track. 
With no relief from the supply chain obstacles that we, our customers and our suppliers continue to face, along with unprecedented inflation-related challenges, the combination of all of these efforts are critical to our success going forward. The improvements in execution our employees deliver constantly across many fronts is what allows us to continuously improve margins. After successfully completing the planned maintenance outage at the Jackson mill during the third quarter, the mill restarted with the No.1 machine making corrugated medium rather than uncoated freesheet grades, utilizing a mix of virgin craft and DLK fiber based on the needs of our customers. This was required to help meet continued strong demand from our box plant customers, meet our targeted inventory levels prior to year-end and help supply the needs of our box plan acquisition that we anticipate acquiring later this quarter. 
Similar to the No. 3 machine at Jackson, the smaller No. 1 machine is highly efficient. It's a versatile machine and with minimal capital required to repurpose a [ de-inking plant ] to handle DLK. The machine was very quickly able to produce high-quality medium for the box plants. Although still capable of producing uncoated freesheet products, we plan to continue producing medium on the machine over the next several months as our internal and external packaging demand warrants. This gives us the opportunity to further evaluate the machine's capabilities and to process -- and the process changes that might be required to potentially produce medium permanently in a cost-effective manner. 
We'll also use the period to further refine our estimates and assumptions to fully understand the potential of the entire mill to produce containerboard on both machines at their optimal cost and quality. This will also allow us to evaluate our strategic containerboard supply capabilities for providing the necessary runway to grow our integrated downstream box demand. We are committed to being fully integrated, and we have a track record of ramping up our internal capacity according to our customers' demand requirements. 
The previously announced conversion of the [ J3 machine ] to linerboard remains on track with no changes to the schedule we discussed on last quarter's call. We'll continue to serve our paper customers with both machines at our International Falls mill, which is capable of producing all of Jackson's paper grades as well as available inventory produced on the No. 1 machine at Jackson. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on containerboard sales, our corrugated business and the box plant acquisition that I mentioned."

We continue to get excellent realization from the implementation of our previously announced price increases across all product lines. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $1.40 per share above the third quarter of 2020 and up $0.55 per share compared to the second quarter of 2021. Export containerboard prices were up $0.18 per share compared to the third quarter of 2020, and up $0.06 per share compared to the second quarter of 2021. 
As Mark mentioned, we achieved a new all-time record for containerboard shipments with continued strong demand in our box plants as well as our domestic and export containerboard markets. We had record third quarter corrugated product shipments, which were up 2.3% in total and per workday over last year's very strong third quarter. Through the first 3 quarters of 2021, our box shipment volume is up 6.7% on a per day basis versus the industry being up 4.5%. In addition to supplying the record internal needs of our box plants, our outside sales volume of containerboard was 73,000 tons above last year's third quarter and 37,000 tons higher than the second quarter of 2021. 
Regarding our third quarter demand and our outlook, I'd like to reemphasize some points I made on previous earning calls and what Mark alluded to earlier. The same issues that impact our ability to get more volume out of our box plants like labor shortages, truck availability, driver shortages, raw material availability issues and supply chain bottlenecks also persist with our customers. They are telling us they have higher demand and could ship more if not for these issues. There is no doubt we view demand as strong, and we expect this to continue even with the economic obstacles most companies are facing. And keep in mind, the fourth quarter will have three less shipping days than the third and fourth quarter comparisons will be against last year's all-time quarterly record for the industry. 
Regarding the box plan acquisition Mark mentioned, last week, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Advanced Packaging Corporation, an independent corrugated products producer and a cash-free transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, PCA will acquire a modern full-line 500,000 square foot corrugated products facility located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The transaction is structured as a purchase of assets resulting in a full step-up of the assets to fair market value. This acquisition is consistent with one of the key strategic focus areas we've discussed many times regarding increasing our vertical integration of containerboard through organic box volume growth and strategic box plant acquisitions. After completion of the acquisition, our containerboard integration is expected to increase by almost 80,000 tons. This also will allow for further optimization and enhancement of our mill capacity and box plant operations as well as other benefits and synergies that we expect to begin realizing soon after closing. 
Although we won't get into financial details at this point, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings immediately with a bottom line purchase price multiple similar to the average of our last four acquisitions. Closing, subject to certain customary conditions and regulatory approval is expected later this quarter, and we will finance the transaction with available cash on hand. Advanced Packaging is a well-capitalized full-service provider of corrugated packaging products, including high-end graphics, retail displays, sustainable shipping containers and protective packaging. They utilize state-of-the-art technology, structural and graphic design and engineering capabilities. And an ISTA, certified test laboratory, to provide customers a solution for nearly any packaging need. 
With a commitment to continuous improvement, innovation and safety in their operations, Advanced Packaging is a great strategic fit for PCA and our culture with an excellent management team, highly skilled and dedicated employees and an outstanding reputation in the marketplace. I'll now turn it back to Mark."

Cash provided by operations during the quarter totaled $284 million, with free cash flow of $134 million. The primary payments of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $150 million, common stock dividends totaled $95 million, $68 million for Federal and State income tax payments. Pension and other post-employment benefit contributions of $51 million and net interest payments of $7 million. 
During the third quarter, we issued $700 million of 30-year 3.05% notes and used the proceeds from these notes to redeem our 4.5%, $700 million 2023 notes in early October. This transaction will lower our average annual cash interest rate from 3.8% to 3.4%, lower our annual interest expense by $11 million per year and extend our average debt maturity from 8.5 years to 16.3 years. Based on the timing of closing the new bonds in September and the redemption of the old bonds occurring in October, our quarter end cash on hand balance included the new bond proceeds. Excluding this transaction, our quarter end cash on hand balance was just over $1 billion or $1.2 billion, including marketable securities, with liquidity at September 30 of $1.5 billion. 
Our planned annual maintenance expense for the quarter is still expected to be about $0.41 per share or about $0.06 per share, primarily due to the DeRidder mill outage. This will result in a negative impact of $0.25 per share moving from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and $0.18 per share higher than last year's fourth quarter. Finally, as Mark mentioned previously, we continue to put tremendous effort into managing certain material equipment and labor availability issues to keep our capital projects on track. While we are managing to keep the key milestones of our more significant projects on schedule, our capital spending across the entire company is now expected to come in below the range we provided previously. We currently expect to end the year with total capital spending around $550 million. I'll now turn it back to Mark."

Looking ahead, as we move from the third into the fourth quarter, we'll continue to implement our previously announced price increases for domestic containerboard, corrugated packaging and paper. And we'll also expect average export containerboard prices to move higher. Packaging segment volume will be lower due to 3 less shipping days as well as the scheduled outage at our DeRidder Mill and paper segment volume would be lower as the Jackson mill is not expected to produce any paper grades. 
With higher energy prices and anticipated colder weather, energy costs will increase. Wood costs, especially in our Southern mill system, will be higher due to the previous wet weather. Low inventory and high demand will also impact wood. We also expect inflation to continue with most of the other operating converting costs, along with higher freight and logistics expenses. And lastly, as Bob mentioned, we expect scheduled outage cost to be approximately $0.25 per share higher than the third quarter. Considering these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings of $2.04 per share.

And where, ultimately, the Jackson mill goes in terms of producing containerboard. Right now, we also mentioned we have not given up the capability to produce paper on either machine, the J3 machine.

I think we've talked all along J3 machine in terms of supplying what we needed and trying to balance the input costs because they were higher. On an annualized basis, the J3 machine has been producing use 400,000 tons is a good number if you want to,",427,"Yes. I think we've talked all along J3 machine in terms of supplying what we needed and trying to balance the input costs because they were higher. On an annualized basis, the J3 machine has been producing use 400,000 tons is a good number if you want to, probably about 100,000 tons a quarter, give or take. And so that's probably a good number to use for your math. If you want to add the annualized production of No. 1 machine, that would be 100,000 tons. So again, on an annualized basis, Jackson is producing 500,000 tons of containerboard now at the mill. Again, I'm not going to get into specific costs. We have reduced in a very appropriate manner. The cost that we can control with the unit operations that we have to work with. The big cost takeout will come next Spring as we do the the really big phase work on the machine conversion and get the productivity up significantly. And when that improvement is made, you'll see a rather big step change in cost reduction. And then the final step change will come -- and the final phase, the following year when we finish up the work on J3. 
Now again, as we look at J1 and we understand what that would imply, it depends on how much medium you would need in the future. And this goes back to what we said for the better part of the last 1.5 decades, you can convert anything to do anything, but there's a capital price for it. And so on an incremental cost if we're producing 100,000 tons today with appropriate capital. We could supply a significant amount of incremental medium off of that machine in future years if we chose to spend the capital. And so I look at Jackson as a tremendous opportunity. We've said this before, when the work is done on J3, the Jackson machine -- the J3 machine appropriately will be in the category of about a 700,000 ton a year machine capable asset in the next few years. And then that would leave the No. 1 machine to balance out our growth opportunity in the box plant system. And so if we're producing 100,000 tons on an annual basis today and you assume you ramp that up, the Jackson mill becomes a significant containerboard producer, if we so choose to and we grow with our demand. But it has a very good opportunity to be one of our low-cost mills over the future years with the appropriate capital."

You called out the $0.25 from maintenance. I think, Bob, you mentioned like $0.10 specific to energy. And then there are a number of other costs, wood, freight, et cetera. At the same time, I guess I would have thought you still would have been getting some more pricing from the August containerboard flowing into boxes. Is there any kind of additional help you can give us to understand why the -- why there be as much of a decline, 4Q versus 3Q? I assume it's mostly cost. And then to the extent that it is, is there a way you can help us parse how much of that might be a seasonal impact, especially in this unusual environment. And so that there's the likelihood of recovery as we get into more seasonally favorable periods versus what may be more systemic changes that one's got to keep an eye on."

As you know, third quarter to fourth quarter is always a negative movement sequentially. It's just -- going back probably as far as you want to look. And a lot of that has to do with some of the seasonal things you see going on with wood, energy and some other items. What's happening this quarter -- yes, we are certainly getting additional price improvement or we expect to from the previously announced price increases in the Packaging segment, but we also have a -- the volume situation is not as a little bit more unfavorable, primarily on the mill side of things with the outage at DeRidder and the fact that we actually expect our inventories to go down as opposed to build inventory. So you always have to consider that inventory change and how that impacts your cost and your cost absorption. Certainly, freight is a bit higher than it normally would be this time of year. And in those operating costs, like I mentioned, what was going on with energy, with wood fiber and the things that Mark was speaking to with trying to get inventories where they need to be and competing with others, forest products, producers that are trying to do the same thing in that part of the country along with shortages, just trying to get drivers to get wood and bring it to the mill. Those costs are up a similar amount to what energy will be. We expect to be very busy in the box plants again in the fourth quarter. And with what we're already struggling with relative to labor availability, just like most other companies are paying additional overtime, doing what you have to do to get the volume out of the door. That's higher than normal. And also just overall repairs and materials, other fixed cost type things it's never seen it quite like this. 
We talked about the maintenance outages being $0.25 a share negative. And we have some things relative to this capital spending in our box plants that we hope to bring several projects on board in the fourth quarter, and that results in some noncapital implementation expense. That's a little bit higher than normal, but it's for a good reason, obviously. So when you net all of those things, Mark, it's -- you're right, it comes to $0.65, which for us is certainly not out of line. If you look at the second half of our results versus the consensus numbers, it looks like we'll end up the year, the second half, $0.25 better than what anyone thought. It's just the timing of the -- between the quarters. Maybe we had a lot more price appreciation in the third than people were realizing and there was more of that in the fourth. I'm not sure, but that's sort of how we see the sequential numbers moving."

Good morning, everyone, and again, thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. I am Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, the Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of the third quarter results, and then I will be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide more details. After that, I'll wrap things up, and we'd be glad to take any questions. 
Yesterday, we reported third quarter net income of $251 million or $2.63 per share. Excluding the special items, third quarter 2021 net income was $257 million or $2.69 per share compared to third quarter 2020 net income of $149 million or $1.57 per share. Third quarter net sales were $2 billion in 2021 and $1.7 billion in 2020. Total company EBITDA for the third quarter, excluding the special items, was $464 million in 2021 and $323 million in 2020. 
Third quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.06 per share, primarily for certain costs at the Jackson, Alabama mill for paper to containerboard conversion related activities. While last year's third quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.11 per share that were related primarily to the impact of Hurricane Laura on the DeRidder, Louisiana mill. Details of all the special items for the third quarter of 2021 were included in the schedules that accompanied the earnings press release. 
Excluding the special items, the $1.12 per share increase in third quarter 2021 earnings compared to the third quarter of 2020 was driven primarily by higher prices and mix of $1.58 and volume $0.62 in our Packaging segment; higher production volume of $0.06 and prices and mix of $0.05 in our Paper segment; and lower nonoperating pension expense, $0.03; and lower interest expense, $0.01. 
Items were partially offset by operating costs, which were $0.84 per share higher, primarily due to inflation-related increases, particularly in the areas of labor and benefits expenses, recycled fiber costs, energy, repairs, materials and supplies as well as several other indirect and fixed cost areas. We also had inflation-related increases in our converting costs, which were $0.10 per share higher. 
For the last several quarters, freight and logistics costs have risen and were $0.23 per share higher compared to last year, driven by significant increases in fuel costs, tight truck supply, driver shortages and a higher mix of spot pricing to keep up with box demand. And finally, scheduled outage expenses were $0.04 per share higher than last year, and sales volume in our Paper segment was lower by $0.02 per share. 
Looking at the Packaging business, EBITDA, excluding special items in the third quarter of 2021 of $467 million with sales of $1.8 billion, resulted in a margin of 26% versus last year's EBITDA of $324 million with sales of $1.5 billion and a 22% margin. Packaging segment demand remained strong, and the teams did a tremendous job of implementing our previously announced containerboard and corrugated products price increases. The containerboard mills set an all-time quarterly sales volume record and our box plants set new third quarter records for total corrugated product shipments as well as shipments per day. 
By utilizing the capability of both machines at our Jackson, Alabama mill to produce containerboard, we were able to reach our desired inventory levels to better serve our customer demand, help minimize the transportation challenges we continue to experience and build some inventory ahead of the DeRidder mills' fourth quarter outage. We manage very effectively the execution of numerous initiatives and capital projects to reduce costs through efficiency, productivity and optimization improvements across our manufacturing locations. We continue to put tremendous effort into managing certain material, equipment and labor availability issues to keep our customers supplied in their needs and their capital projects on track. 
With no relief from the supply chain obstacles that we, our customers and our suppliers continue to face, along with unprecedented inflation-related challenges, the combination of all of these efforts are critical to our success going forward. The improvements in execution our employees deliver constantly across many fronts is what allows us to continuously improve margins. After successfully completing the planned maintenance outage at the Jackson mill during the third quarter, the mill restarted with the number-1 machine making corrugated medium rather than uncoated freesheet grades, utilizing a mix of virgin craft and DLK fiber based on the needs of our customers. This was required to help meet continued strong demand from our box plant customers, meet our targeted inventory levels prior to year-end and help supply the needs of our box plant acquisition that we anticipate acquiring later this quarter. 
Similar to the number-3 machine at Jackson, the smaller number-1 machine is highly efficient. It's a versatile machine and with minimal capital required to repurpose a deinking plant to handle DLK. The machine was very quickly able to produce high-quality medium for the box plants. Although still capable of producing uncoated freesheet products, we plan to continue producing medium on the machine over the next several months as our internal and external packaging demand warrants. This gives us the opportunity to further evaluate the machine's capabilities and to process -- and the process changes that might be required to potentially produce medium permanently in a cost-effective manner. 
We'll also use the period to further refine our estimates and assumptions to fully understand the potential of the entire mill to produce containerboard on both machines at their optimal cost and quality. This will also allow us to evaluate our strategic containerboard supply capabilities for providing the necessary runway to grow our integrated downstream box demand. We are committed to being fully integrated, and we have a track record of ramping up our internal capacity according to our customers' demand requirements.
The previously announced conversion of the J3 machine to linerboard remains on track with no changes to the schedule we discussed on last quarter's call. We'll continue to serve our paper customers with both machines at our International Falls mill, which is capable of producing all of Jackson's paper grades as well as available inventory produced on the number-1 machine at Jackson. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on containerboard sales, our corrugated business and the box plant acquisition that I mentioned."

We continue to get excellent realization from the implementation of our previously announced price increases across all product lines. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $1.40 per share above the third quarter of 2020 and up $0.55 per share compared to the second quarter of 2021. Export containerboard prices were up $0.18 per share compared to the third quarter of 2020, and up $0.06 per share compared to the second quarter of 2021. 
As Mark mentioned, we achieved a new all-time record for containerboard shipments with continued strong demand in our box plants as well as our domestic and export containerboard markets. We had record third quarter corrugated product shipments, which were up 2.3% in total and per workday over last year's very strong third quarter. Through the first 3 quarters of 2021, our box shipment volume was up 6.7% on a per day basis versus the industry being up 4.5%. In addition to supplying the record internal needs of our box plants, our outside sales volume of containerboard was 73,000 tons above last year's third quarter and 37,000 tons higher than the second quarter of 2021.
Regarding our third quarter demand and our outlook, I'd like to reemphasize some points I made on previous earning calls and what Mark alluded to earlier the same issues that impact our ability to get more volume out of our box plants like labor shortages, truck availability, driver shortages, raw material availability issues and supply chain bottlenecks also persist with our customers. They are telling us they have higher demand and could ship more if not for these issues. There is no doubt we view demand as strong, and we expect this to continue even with the economic obstacles most companies are facing. And keep in mind, the fourth quarter will have 3 less shipping days than the third and fourth quarter comparisons will be against last year's all-time quarterly record for the industry. 
Regarding the box plant acquisition Mark mentioned, last week, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Advance Packaging Corporation, an independent corrugated products producer, in a cash-free transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, PCA will acquire a modern full-line 500,000 square foot corrugated products facility located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The transaction is structured as a purchase of assets resulting in a full step-up of the assets to fair market value. This acquisition is consistent with one of the key strategic focus areas we've discussed many times regarding increasing our vertical integration of containerboard through organic box volume growth and strategic box plant acquisitions. 
After completion of the acquisition, our containerboard integration is expected to increase by almost 80,000 tons. This also will allow for further optimization and enhancement of our mill capacity and box plant operations as well as other benefits and synergies that we expect to begin realizing soon after closing. 
Although we won't get into financial details at this point, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings immediately with a bottom line purchase price multiple similar to the average of our last 4 acquisitions. Closing, subject to certain customary conditions and regulatory approval is expected later this quarter, and we will finance the transaction with available cash on hand. Advance Packaging is a well-capitalized full-service provider of corrugated packaging products, including high-end graphics retail displays, sustainable shipping containers and protective packaging. They utilize state-of-the-art technology, structural and graphic design and engineering capabilities and an ISTA-certified test laboratory to provide customers a solution for nearly any packaging need. 
With a commitment to continuous improvement, innovation and safety in their operations, Advance Packaging is a great strategic fit for PCA and our culture with an excellent management team, highly skilled and dedicated employees and an outstanding reputation in the marketplace. I'll now turn it back to Mark."

Prices and mix were up 4% from last year's third quarter and also moved 4% higher from the second and into the third quarter of 2021 as we continue to implement our previously announced price increases. As we mentioned last quarter, with finished goods inventory now at optimal levels for the Paper business, sales volume, which was 19% below last year's level, is fairly reflective of our production capability. As I said earlier, while the Jackson number-1 machine is running medium, we will continue to service our paper customers' needs from both of the International Falls machines, which are capable of producing all of the Jackson paper grades.

Cash provided by operations during the quarter totaled $284 million, with free cash flow of $134 million. The primary payments of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $150 million, common stock dividends totaled $95 million, $68 million for federal and state income tax payments, pension and other post-employment benefit contributions of $51 million and net interest payments of $7 million. 
During the third quarter, we issued $700 million of 30-year 3.05% notes and used the proceeds from these notes to redeem our 4.5%, $700 million 2023 notes in early October. This transaction will lower our average annual cash interest rate from 3.8% to 3.4%, lower our annual interest expense by $11 million per year and extend our average debt maturity from 8.5 years to 16.3 years. Based on the timing of closing the new bonds in September and the redemption of the old bonds occurring in October, our quarter end cash on hand balance included the new bond proceeds. Excluding this transaction, our quarter end cash on hand balance was just over $1 billion or $1.2 billion, including marketable securities, with liquidity at September 30 of $1.5 billion. 
Our planned annual maintenance expense for the quarter is still expected to be about $0.41 per share or about $0.06 per share, primarily due to the DeRidder mill outage. This will result in a negative impact of $0.25 per share moving from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and $0.18 per share higher than last year's fourth quarter. 
Finally, as Mark mentioned previously, we continue to put tremendous effort into managing certain material equipment and labor availability issues to keep our capital projects on track. While we are managing to keep the key milestones of our more significant projects on schedule, our capital spending across the entire company is now expected to come in below the range we provided previously. We currently expect to end the year with total capital spending around $550 million. I'll now turn it back to Mark."

Looking ahead, as we move from the third into the fourth quarter, we'll continue to implement our previously announced price increases for domestic containerboard, corrugated packaging and paper. And we'll also expect average export containerboard prices to move higher. Packaging segment volume will be lower due to 3 less shipping days as well as the scheduled outage at our DeRidder mill and Paper segment volume would be lower as the Jackson mill is not expected to produce any paper grades. 
With higher energy prices and anticipated colder weather, energy costs will increase. Wood costs, especially in our Southern mill system, will be higher due to the previous wet weather. Low inventory and high demand will also impact wood. We also expect inflation to continue with most of the other operating converting costs, along with higher freight and logistics expenses. And lastly, as Bob mentioned, we expect scheduled outage cost to be approximately $0.25 per share higher than the third quarter. Considering these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings of $2.04 per share.

We have a pretty good idea of what we would do under different circumstances if we chose to ramp the machine up in the future. 
But I think, as I said earlier on the call, the fact that we're actually running medium right now is a really good opportunity for us to study all of the unit operations around the paper machine within the mill system to look at the entire balance of the mill and how it would play out in the future with the work we're doing on J3 machine. And where, ultimately, the Jackson mill goes in terms of producing containerboard. Right now, we also mentioned we have not given up the capability to produce paper on either machine, the J3 machine. 
Once it undergoes its outage next spring, we'll not be able to go back to paper after that. But J1 machine remains a flexible machine, and we'll just look at our market opportunities and utilize that machine as it is.

I think we've talked all along J3 machine in terms of supplying what we needed and trying to balance the input costs because they were higher. On an annualized basis, the J3 machine has been producing -- use 400,000 tons is a good number if you want",424,"Yes. I think we've talked all along J3 machine in terms of supplying what we needed and trying to balance the input costs because they were higher. On an annualized basis, the J3 machine has been producing -- use 400,000 tons is a good number if you want to, probably about 100,000 tons a quarter, give or take. And so that's probably a good number to use for your math. If you want to add the annualized production of number-1 machine, that would be 100,000 tons. 
So again, on an annualized basis, Jackson is producing 500,000 tons of containerboard now at the mill. Again, I'm not going to get into specific costs. We have reduced in a very appropriate manner the cost that we can control with the unit operations that we have to work with. The big cost takeout will come next Spring as we do the really big phase work on the machine conversion and get the productivity up significantly. And when that improvement is made, you'll see a rather big step change in cost reduction. And then the final step change will come in the final phase the following year when we finish up the work on J3. 
Now again, as we look at J1 and we understand what that would imply, it depends on how much medium you would need in the future. And this goes back to what we said for the better part of the last 1.5 decades, you can convert anything to do anything, but there's a capital price for it. And so on an incremental cost if we're producing 100,000 tons today with appropriate capital, we could supply a significant amount of incremental medium off of that machine in future years if we chose to spend the capital. And so I look at Jackson as a tremendous opportunity. We've said this before, when the work is done on J3, the Jackson machine -- the J3 machine appropriately will be in the category of about a 700,000 ton a year machine capable asset in the next few years. 
And then that would leave the number-1 machine to balance out our growth opportunity in the box plant system. And so if we're producing 100,000 tons on an annual basis today and you assume you ramp that up, the Jackson mill becomes a significant containerboard producer, if we so choose to and we grow with our demand. But it has a very good opportunity to be one of our low-cost mills over the future years with the appropriate capital."

You called out the $0.25 from maintenance. I think, Bob, you mentioned like $0.10 specific to energy. 
And then there are a number of other costs, wood, freight, et cetera. At the same time, I guess I would have thought you still would have been getting some more pricing from the August containerboard flowing into boxes. Is there any kind of additional help you can give us to understand why the -- why there be as much of a decline, 4Q versus 3Q? I assume it's mostly costs. And then to the extent that it is, is there a way you can help us parse how much of that might be a seasonal impact, especially in this unusual environment? And so that there's the likelihood of recovery as we get into more seasonally favorable periods versus what may be more systemic changes that one's got to keep an eye on."

As you know, third quarter to fourth quarter is always a negative movement sequentially. It's just -- going back probably as far as you want to look, it's -- and a lot of that has to do with some of the seasonal things you see going on with wood, energy and some other items. What's happening this quarter -- yes, we are certainly getting additional price improvement or we expect to from the previously announced price increases in the Packaging segment, but we also have a -- the volume situation is not as -- is a little bit more unfavorable, primarily on the mill side of things with the outage at DeRidder and the fact that we actually expect our inventories to go down as opposed to build inventory. So you always have to consider that inventory change and how that impacts your cost and your cost absorption. 
Certainly, freight is a bit higher than it normally would be this time of year. And then those operating costs, like I mentioned, what was going on with energy, with wood fiber and the things that Mark was speaking to with trying to get inventories where they need to be and competing with others, forest products producers that are trying to do the same thing in that part of the country along with shortages, just trying to get drivers to get wood and bring it to the mill. 
Those costs are up a similar amount to what energy will be. We expect to be very busy in the box plants again in the fourth quarter. And with what we're already struggling with relative to labor availability, just like most other companies are, paying additional overtime, doing what you have to do to get the volume out of the door. That's higher than normal. And also just overall repairs and materials, other fixed cost type things. It's never seen it quite like this. 
We talked about the maintenance outages being $0.25 a share negative. And we have some things relative to this capital spending in our box plants that we hope to bring several projects on board in the fourth quarter, and that results in some noncapital implementation expense. That's a little bit higher than normal, but it's for a good reason, obviously. So when you net all of those things, Mark, it's -- you're right, it comes to $0.65, which for us is certainly not out of line. If you look at the second half of our results versus the consensus numbers, it looks like we'll end up the year, the second half, $0.25 better than what anyone thought. It's just the timing of the -- between the quarters. Maybe we had a lot more price appreciation in the third than people were realizing and there was more of that in the fourth. I'm not sure, but that's sort of how we see the sequential numbers moving."

I mean it's -- and if I could predict exactly when this was going to end, I'd be -- I'd probably be doing something different than what I'm doing right now.

As I said before, I mean, we're also competing with the government here, which makes it even much more difficult. But there are shortages everywhere and the demand remains very high.

Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. 
I'll begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide further details. I'll then wrap things up, and then we'd be glad to take questions. 
Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $207 million or $2.17 per share. Excluding special items, second quarter 2021 net income was also $207 million or $2.17 per share compared to the second quarter of 2020 net income of $132 million or $1.38 per share. 
Second quarter net sales were $1.9 billion in 2021 and $1.5 billion in 2020. Total company EBITDA for the second quarter, excluding special items, was $397 million in 2021 and $299 million in 2020. Reported earnings in the second quarter of 2021 included special items expense and income rounding to a negligible impact while last year's second quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.79 per share related primarily to the impairment of goodwill associated with our Paper segment. 
Details of all special items for the second quarter of 2021 and 2020 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings release conference, a press release. Excluding special items, the $0.79 per share increase in second quarter 2021 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2020 was driven primarily by higher prices and mix of $1.01 and volume $0.74 in our Packaging segment, higher volume in our Paper segment of $0.03; and lower nonoperating pension expense of $0.03. 
These items were partially offset by higher operating costs of $0.57, primarily due to inflation-related increases in the areas of labor and fringes, repairs, materials and supplies, recycled fiber costs as well as other indirect and fixed cost areas. We also had inflation-related increases in our converting costs, which were higher by $0.05 per share, while annual outage expenses were up $0.19 per share compared to last year. 
Freight and logistics expenses were higher by $0.19 per share, driven by historically high load-to-truck ratios, driver shortages, increases in fuel costs and a higher mix of spot pricing to keep pace with the box demand. 
Lastly, depreciation expense was higher by $0.01 per share and Paper segment prices and mix were lower by $0.01 per share. 
Looking at our Packaging business, EBITDA, excluding special items in the second quarter of 2021 of $409 million with sales of $1.7 billion resulted in a margin of 24% versus last year's EBITDA of $313 million and sales of $1.4 billion or a 22% margin. 
Our mills and plants continue to do an outstanding job of meeting our customer needs while managing through certain material and chemical availability issues, a tight labor market, various freight and logistics challenges as well as the planned maintenance outages at 4 of our mills during the second quarter. 
The mills executed the planned outages extremely well. And with the help of the No. 3 machine at our Jackson, Alabama Mill, provided our plants the necessary containerboard to achieve an all-time record for total box shipments. Although we were able to build some much needed inventory, due to very high demand, we ended the second quarter below our targeted levels and at a new low for weeks of inventory supply for this time of the year and ahead of expected very busy third and fourth quarters. 
In the second half of the year, we still anticipate a planned outage at our Jackson, Alabama Mill later in the third quarter as well as a significant planned outage at our DeRidder Mill in the fourth quarter. 
Implementation of the previously announced price increases continues to be executed extremely well by our sales organization while our engineering and technology organization and the employees at all of our mills and corrugated products plants continue to successfully implement numerous initiatives and projects to reduce cost through efficiency, productivity and optimization improvements with inflation-driven cost increases across almost all areas of our company, coupled with truck, rail and barge challenges for both incoming and outgoing products and materials at our facilities, these efforts are absolutely critical to our success. 
In addition, being a primarily virgin fiber-based producer of containerboard minimizes the impact of significant increases in recycled fiber costs over the last several quarters. 
I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business."

As Mark indicated, containerboard and corrugated products demand remains very strong across most of all of our end markets. Our plants achieved a new all-time quarterly record for total box shipments as well as a second quarter record for shipments per day, both of which were up 9.6% compared to last year's second quarter. 
Through the first half of 2021, our box shipment volume is up 9% on a per day basis versus the industry being up 6.8%. Driven by higher domestic demand, outside sales volume of containerboard was about 43,000 tons above the second quarter of 2020, but was down slightly versus the first quarter of this year due to lower export shipments, supplying the record requirements of our box plants and the need to position inventory levels ahead of what appears to be a strong second half of the year. 
We are getting good realization from the implementation of our previously announced price increases across all product lines. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.92 per share above the second quarter of 2020 and up $0.51 per share compared to the first quarter of 2021. 
Export containerboard prices were up $0.09 per share versus last year's second quarter and up $0.04 compared to the first quarter of 2021. 
Finally, I'd like to reemphasize some of what Mark was pointing out regarding the many things we do to help offset inflation and improve our margins beyond just price increases. The benefits from our capital spending strategy in the box plants that we've spoken about over the last few years have been extremely successful and put us in position to serve our customers better than ever before. Our strategy of improving the technology and equipment in our plants and optimizing our footprint through the construction of new facilities as well as closing certain plants to consolidate business with other locations is based upon our customers' needs and demands and improving our capabilities to grow with them. We're seeing this in our volume growth with new and existing customers, operating efficiencies and savings and cost reductions in several conversion areas throughout our plants. 
I'll now turn it back to Mark."

Although about 1% below second quarter 2020 levels, prices and mix moved higher for the first and into the second quarter of 2021 as we continue to implement our announced price increases. 
Volume was 17% above last year when pandemic issues caused us to take both machines at the Jackson, Alabama Mill down for 2 months during the second quarter. While this year, we ran the No. 1 machine at Jackson on paper and the No. 3 machine ran linerboard. Now that we have our finished goods inventory at a new optimal level, sales volume in the second quarter is fairly reflective of what our production capability is as a 3-machine paper system. We'll continue to assess our outlook for paper demand and we'll run our paper system accordingly. 
I'll now turn it over to Bob."

As we move from the second to the third quarter, in our Packaging segment, we expect continued strong demand for containerboard and corrugated products with one additional day for box shipments. Paper segment volume should be relatively flat, primarily due to the scheduled maintenance outage at the Jackson Mill. 
We will also continue to implement our previously announced price increases in both our Packaging and Paper segments. Our annual outage costs will be lower with one outage in the third quarter versus 4 mill outages in the second quarter. Inflation associated with most of the operating costs as well as freight and logistics expenses is expected to continue. 
Energy costs will also be impacted due to higher seasonal usage and wood costs in our southern mills will be higher due to wet weather, low inventory and high demand. Considering these items, we expect third quarter earnings of $2.37 per share.

I can tell you that going into the third quarter, our bookings and billings are running about 7% ahead of last year. Keep in mind that our comps become much tougher so it's not as if volume has slowed down at all. It's remained incredibly robust coming right out of the fourth quarter of last year and all the way through this year. I think that's why we felt quite a bit more comfortable about giving some sort of guidance going forward. 
Also, you asked about the -- some of the lack of supply in the second quarter, maybe bleeding over into the third quarter. We're running lead times that are longer than we're used to and certainly longer than our customers are used to. So the demand remains very high, trying to get it out the door is an issue more related to transportation at this stage than it is certainly about paper. We're able to take care of our own plants through our system. So that's not the issue for us. It's more transportation. And I think that's reflective of most of the industry."

And then lastly, on cost you flagged wood cost, I think, particularly in the South. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing, what kind of headwind that might be for you in the third quarter and fourth quarter?

I mean we did slow down a little bit last year during the 2020 period. We had become a little more targeted in what projects required the attention of the various technical organization just because of the travel restrictions and the concern for people's wellbeing. But this year, that was ramped up to a full activity. And so we're continuing to execute well across the board. But I can give you an example. If you go back over the last 3.5 years, we've executed approximately at 62 of these box plants, $850 million worth of capital project activity. Flexo Folder Gluers converting equipment upgrades, major rebuilds, new corrugators, built the 2 new plants. 
And so we're doing this all in-house, but the pace is ramped up in 2021 over some of 2020. So we're very pleased with what we're seeing. And so we currently have a great deal of activity going on at numerous plants nationwide that will continue to provide the benefits that I spoke about and that Tom spoke about. So we're extremely pleased with the opportunities."

Second price increase, the same way. It's -- it rolls out over a whole 90-day period. Third price increase hasn't been reflected yet in pulp and paper. So obviously we have raised prices to our independent customers and our linerboard and medium customers domestically. Those are in place.

Also, I'll remind you that last year, during COVID, of course, from a mix standpoint, our display business had basically gone to nothing because of the shutdowns and no shopping in brick-and-mortar and things like that so. So that end of the business had dried up quite a bit, and that's back now.

And again, in the GDP equation, service industry became a bigger factor in GDP, manufacturing was less of a component.
What we're seeing is more onshoring of manufacturing, more American businesses investing here in the United States in manufacturing. Box demand tied to that factor.

But we've gone through wet periods before, but what's also a major factor is the availability of the trucking side of the equation in terms of log hauling to a mill is dependent on trucks.
And so those truck drivers have a choice. They can go and work over the road, hauling various goods or go into the woods and haul logs. And so there's been extreme competition for truck drivers. So I would think, though, that if we get a dry period or a normal weather period in the south, you'll see a significant normalization of wood cost relatively quickly.

We are looking at it carefully, as you can imagine but barring -- currently barring any unforeseen hurricane big tropical systems that come up through the southern states right now, we're okay for the time being. I do watch the weather consistently because of that.
But again, that's something we can't control. So you do the best you can. But currently, we're okay with where we are. We're just -- again, I'll point out, the industry typically at this time of year would be starting their winter wood build. And so mills across the southern region would be starting to stockpile wood in their laydown yards and their wet storage areas, satellite wet storage areas for the upcoming what would traditionally be a wet late fall, wet winter period.
So you compound the problem right now that the inventories across the mill system in the south and southeast have been depleted. We're running basically day-to-day short inventories. We're also not able to start our winter wood build as an industry, as you can imagine. So it's going to be important that we do get a dry period because we have to set ourselves up for the late fall and winter when you really get the weather systems coming through with the traditional lows that come out of the Gulf of Mexico and move up through. So that's a longer-term concern."
