In the year of unprecedented macro challenges, I'm pleased to report that Cadence achieved outstanding financial results for both the fourth quarter and 2020. 
For the year, we achieved 15% revenue growth and 35% on GAAP operating margin with strength across the board and all segments growing by double digit. In a moment, John will present more information for Q4 results and our 2021 outlook. The acceleration of digitization due to the pandemic, coupled with exciting generational trends like 5G, AI, ML, data analytics and hyperscale computing, continue to drive strong semiconductor demand. 
Leading hyperscaler, global AI companies continue to aggressively pursue more slow. While 5G wireless, industrial and automotive verticals are leading the charge on the more than [indiscernible] front. Our intelligent system design strategy triples our M, and our broad compelling portfolio of chip, package, board and system design solution uniquely positions us to realize these exciting opportunities. 
In 2020, we accelerated our momentum and marquee accounts, while expanding our system portfolio through compelling acquisitions, enabling us to win new customers in our targeted vertical segments. Of particular note was the strength of our aerospace and defense business as the digital transformation in this vertical continues. And we expanded and deepened our leadership ship with [indiscernible], which includes the use of our custom analog and digital full flow. 
Additionally, we are especially excited by the momentum we have with the hyperscalers as they are accelerating their chip and system design activity. 
Our engagements with the system companies have steadily bitten over the past few years, and revenue from system companies is now closer to 45% of our total revenue. It was a great year for our Cadence Cloud, which now has more than 175 customers. And we further strengthened our partnership with cloud infrastructure and foundry partners. 
Now let us review Q4 highlights. Design excellence is a foundational deal of our strategy and includes our core EDA chip design platforms and IP portfolio. Our design -- our digital signoff solutions, offering superior quality of results and faster convergence continued proliferating as market shipping customers. We engage in well over 100 projects at 5-nanometer and below process technologies, and we are in earlier collaborations under 2-nanometer nodes. Deployment of our full flow accelerated as more than 45 customers adopted our Cadence digital full flow at the most advanced nodes during the year, including MediaTek, Samsung, Micron, Nuvia and a global marquee customer. Based on the superior quality of results, the market-shaping hyperscaler significantly increased the usage of our digital solution. 
Earlier in the year, a marquee shipping automotive semiconductor customer committed to Cadence as its primary EDA vendor for digital design. 
Customers are faced with challenges in system verification and software bring-up and is benefiting from our verification full flow solutions that deliver industry-leading verification throughput. Momentum continued on Xcelium, our digital simulator, with several competitive replacements underway as well as expansion and new customer wins. Our hardware family of Palladium for emulation and Protium for regressions and earlier software development had a strong quarter to finish our best ever year for hardware. 
For the year, Palladium Z1 had 24 new customers and 34 expansions, while Protium had 13 new customers and 14 expansion. Demand was particularly strong at AI and hyperscaler customers. Ericsson renew knew their commitment to Cadence verification hardware, including both Palladium and Protium. A unique differentiator of the Protium X1 is the common front-end compiler with the Palladium Z1 that enables significant faster bring-up. And [ about ] 40% of our hardware business during the year included both Z1 and X1. 
Our IP business had a strong year as our focused strategy and a compelling portfolio leverage on the ongoing IP outsourcing trend. We continue expanding the footprint of our leadership DDR and PCIE IP and have several design wins at a 5-nanometer and lower process nodes. 
High-speed 30 is a critical component of hyperscaler infrastructure and several customers that adopted our 112-gig Serdy IP, including Excise Labs, who has also demonstrated working silicon. Tensilica has strong loyalties and significant wins as a key true wireless studio and mobile application processor customers. Additionally, the automotive segment had a strong -- have a good momentum which wins in functional safety, radar and digital radio, including an ADAS win, a leading self-driving car company. 
In system innovation, we are very excited about our system design and analysis segment, which had a particular strong year with greater than 25% revenue growth. Pricing system complexity for advanced 5G, automotive and HPC applications is driving the needs for a seamless platform solution across design, simulation and analysis. AWR and Integrand delivered strong great results in 2020, and there is a strong customer interest in our integrated Virtuoso, Innovus, Allegro and AWR microwave office solutions with in-design analysis. 
In system analysis, we are executing to our strategy of building out our multi-physics portfolio, offering best-in-class solutions and delivering superior results compared to legacy industry solutions. Strong market adoption continue for our system analysis products. And we are particularly pleased with the growing number of repeat orders with customers, including ST Microelectronics, Beltech and a market-shaping hyperscaler. We triple our system analysis team by adding computational fluid dynamic, CFD technology, through the pending NUMECA acquisition, which will bring leading CFD technology and deep domain expertise of Dr. Charles Hersh and his team for Cadence. 
NUMECA has over 450 customers, including NASA, Honda and Ford across multiple verticals such as aerospace, automotive, industrial and marine. 
For pervasive intelligence, we continue to incorporate machine learning technologies in various tools for improved PPA and faster convergence. 
Xcelium ML has a successful engagement with several market-shaping customers, delivering up to 5x improvement in regressions throughput. We also progressed on providing IP specifically tuned for AI machine learning applications, especially edge influencing applications. 
Cadence continues to invest in fostering innovation and advancing education through endowments at top universities. Building upon previous endowments at Stanford, the University of California at Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University, we announced a $5 million endowment at MIT's assortment college of computing to promote research in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics. 
Now I will turn it over to John to go over Q4 results and present our 2021 outlook."

I'm pleased to report we exceeded all of our key operating metrics for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020. We achieved 50% on the rule of 40 metric for the first time, through a combination of 15% reven",669,"Thanks, Lip-Bu, and good afternoon, everyone. 
I'm pleased to report we exceeded all of our key operating metrics for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020. We achieved 50% on the rule of 40 metric for the first time, through a combination of 15% revenue growth and 35% non-GAAP operating margin. Consistent execution against our strategy and double-digit growth across all product categories helped us achieve this landmark, but we also had the benefit of some tailwinds during the fiscal year, which included a 53rd week, a strong second half in China and the recovery of $26 million that we previously thought to be uncollectible. 
The pandemic brought many challenges, and I'm very proud of our Cadence team for their compassion and resilience in the face of adversity. Their focus on innovation and customer success resulted in continued acceleration of Cadence's 3-year revenue growth CAGR, which is now into double digits. 
Let's go through the key results for the fourth quarter and the year, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $760 million for the quarter and $2.683 billion for the year. Non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 37% for the quarter at approximately 35% for the year. GAAP EPS was $0.62 for the quarter and $2.11 for the year. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.83 for the quarter and $2.80 for the year. 
Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash balance was $928 million at year-end, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $136 million and $905 million for the full year. DSOs were 44 days, and we repurchased $380 million of Cadence shares during the year. 
Before I provide commentary for Q1 and fiscal 2021, I'd like to take a moment to share the assumptions embedded in our outlook. We expect strong revenue growth for the first half, followed by more muted second half growth as we lap some tough second half comps. Our outlook further assumes the pandemic restrictions will gradually ease across the globe this year, resulting in higher T&E expense in 2021 compared to 2020. We've included the expected impact of the pending NUMECA acquisition in our 2021 outlook. And finally, as usual, our outlook assumes that the export limitations that exist today for certain customers will remain in place for all of 2021. 
Embedding these assumptions into our outlook for fiscal 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $2.86 billion to $2.92 billion, non-GAAP operating margin of 34.5% to 36%, GAAP EPS in the range of $2.09 to $2.19 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.95 to $3.05, operating cash flow in the range of $900 million to $950 million, and we expect to use approximately 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares in 2021. 
For Q1 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $710 million to $730 million, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 35%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.59 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.72 to $0.76. And we expect to repurchase $110 million of Cadence shares in Q1. 
Our CFO commentary, which is available on our website, includes our outlook for additional items as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
In conclusion, Cadence delivered another year of strong operating results, achieving 50% on the rule of 40 metric for the very first time. We remain focused on driving profitable revenue growth. And at the midpoint of our outlook for fiscal 2021, I'm pleased that we are on track to grow our annual revenue by over $1 billion since 2016, with more than $0.50 of every dollar of revenue growth, dropping through to non-GAAP operating margin over that period. 
I would like to close by thanking our customers, partners and our hard-working employees for all that they do, and I'd like to remind them all that their health and safety continue to be our first priority. 
And with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

How does that 35.25% operating margin guide in fiscal year '21 compared to level set fiscal year '20?"

Thanks for the question, Gary. The -- yes, it's a pretty -- it's probably a multipart question. But yes, I guess in terms of the collections, the -- we had a collections windfall of $26 million in the second half, most of which came in Q4. And some",491,"Okay. Thanks for the question, Gary. The -- yes, it's a pretty -- it's probably a multipart question. But yes, I guess in terms of the collections, the -- we had a collections windfall of $26 million in the second half, most of which came in Q4. And some of those invoices were very old, which meant that $22 million of the $26 million was recognized in revenue before the end of the year. But -- and that was in relation to, if you recall, in the middle of the year, during the pandemic, we had some smaller customers that weren't able to pay us and we reserved for those. And we helped them out, but our engineers and team at Cadence were determined to help them out, whether they were paying us on us. But some of those customers turned around and managed to survive and were assured they would. So that collections went for kind of historically may be some of the revenue timing in the quarters during the year, but didn't really impact -- that $26 million didn't really impact the year because originally, we had it in the year, then we took it out in the middle of the year. And then like that $22 million of that $26 million collected got recognized. 
In relation to the extra week, we thought that was going to be $45 million, and it was. But the extra week, of course, was a 2% tailwind for -- in terms of helping us achieve 50% on the rule of 40 in 2020? And what was the 2% tailwind in 2020? is a 2% headwind now in 2021 when we go from a 53-week year to a 52-week year. 
And then, I guess, we had a really strong second half in China. I mean, when I step back from individual quarters and halves that I would say this -- our business is very strong in all regions and across all of the product categories. The 3-year revenue CAGRs, they're up to 11% now in 2020. And at the midpoint, it's 11% for 2020. At the midpoint of our outlook for '21, that's 11%, too. So we're already off to a very strong start as well in the in first half of '21, but it's too early really to say if that's sustainable in the longer term. 
So the second half, we have kind of muted revenue guidance. When I look at the second half of 2020 in China. What I noticed was that with a higher than normal proportion of upfront revenue in our recurring revenue mix for the region in China, for our outlook in '21, I've assumed we returned to our usual recurring revenue mix in the region. And that, along with the fact that we won less week in the second half in 2021 versus 2020, that's what contributes to the like conservative revenue growth outlook for the second half."

I mean, bookings and revenue grew strongly in 2020. The operating margin profile there is better than EDA, which allows us to invest in the business while we're generating strong incremental margins that improve our overall operating leverage. 
In relation to NUMECA, when we issued the original press release, we highlighted that the impact to '21 is pretty immaterial. It's pending. We expect it to close -- imminent in terms of close, I would expect it to close this week. And as usual, of course, we'd expect purchase accounting rules to initially limit the revenue that we can recognize on NUMECA in the first year. So we expect that to be temporarily dilutive to earnings in 2021, and that's already embedded in our outlook. 
So from that perspective, we don't -- I don't think we have anywhere near as much revenue in '21 as you're expecting."

And that's about 51% of the revenue growth, if you calculate the revenue growth over that period of time.

But -- and then what we looked at, I was waiting for a view of the pipeline. Pipeline for '21 is very strong. And when I look at that and compared it to what had happened, what was different about the second half of 2020 for China, what I did notice is because of that hardware that we had a higher mix of upfront revenue in the region in the second half than we would normally see. 
I'm not sure if that's sustainable. I mean it looks like we're off to a strong start again in Q1.

So it's a lot of changes to infrastructure and there's a lot of fueling, a lot of design activity. So that's why we see a lot of design activity, not just from the semiconductor players. Now the system player and then the whole industry 4.0, they all move into AI, machine learning, the digital transformation that drive a lot of semiconductor. So overall, the industry is moving in the right direction to us. 
And then meanwhile, I think, clearly, Cadence's Intelligent System Design strategy really tie in really well from the design excellence, providing the tool now we move to the next level of system innovation that Anirudh talked about the system analysis and the CFD and the physics or multi-physics model.

And the growth in expenses through the year that would typically come from that is being offset by some more efficient infrastructure spend that we have planned as the year progresses. 
If you look at our 10-K that we filed, you'll see that we initiated a restructuring plan in Q4 2020 to optimize our spend on infrastructure and the expense mix in 2021.

But if you remember, we also have our Allegro business, which is our packaging business. We do quite well in PCB and packaging with Allegro. And Allegro does have a -- already, we do have an indirect channel. And like Lip-Bu mentioned earlier, cloud is important going forward. 
So for the system business, I envision 3 channels. We will -- we are building 3 channels. One is the direct channel because a lot of the big companies and big system in semi companies, anyway, want system tools, like you mentioned. And expanding our indirect channel like we have for Allegro and expanding it to overall system design in also. And then a SaaS channel, which -- or cloud-based channel for -- especially for smaller companies that don't have a lot of data centers and are more attractive to use on the cloud. 
So as we go to the system design and analysis, we do have to build out these 3 facets of our go-to-market, and we are working all of them in different stages.

First, we've heard for years, of course, from the EDA companies of ongoing design activity among your customers that, that's remained robust. We've also heard of the general direction of design style or types from general purpose chips more to specialty kinds of designs. What we don't often hear about is how customers' design methodology may be evolving. And I'm wondering if there are any issues that you might want to talk about regarding, for example, the hierarchical versus flat, which has been a consideration for chip design now for 2 decades or more. Is -- are there any new implications or issues for that as it might pertain to or affect any of your EDA tools or new technologies, such as spatial or design space exploration? 
And then relatedly, there were a number of questions this evening already regarding system analysis and your broader ambitions in computational software. One thing we see on the other side of engineering software, the world you're approaching towards, are unified data platforms and common platforms for data management and the like, which you don't really seem to have. You do have multiple stacks for your various functional areas. Could you talk about how you're thinking about unifying or moving to a more common platform of that kind?"

Well, first of all, we want to make sure that we have best-in-class products, right, so whether that's digital design or verification and system analysis. 
So we always, as you know, this is technology business, best product wins. And at the same time, have a unified platform to go with it. And this is how we did digital implementation. This is how we did verification. So both parts are important to have best-in-class products, whether that's in finite element, electromagnetics or CFD. And then there are opportunities to combine them in a much more unified way, especially around data, like you mentioned. 
So I completely agree that the need for unification, but we also, at the same time, I want to make sure first that the products are best-in-class. We want a unified team, but each player has to be a strong player. But there are a lot of opportunities for data platforms and analytics like Lip-Bu also mentioned earlier. 
Now in terms of your first question of new methodologies, I mean there are several things happening. If I have to pick 1 or 2 key things that are happening, what we see with the customers, so one big trend, which you probably already know is this move to 3D-IC. I think this is going to be significant for the next several years. And it just changed a lot of methodologies in our customer base. And this is multiple high-end digital chips or even analog RF chips on a package. And that, I think, is driving a lot of change, especially in the cloud, hyperscaler companies all the way to consumer company. And we do have, historically, a lot of strength in package -- packaging with Allegro. Of course, we have a leadership platform, an advanced node with Innovus and then now the analysis tools with Clarity and Celsius because thermal is a big thing for 3D-IC. 
So I think this whole methodology of 3D-IC integration is one significant change that we do see in the customer base. And we are very excited about that because I think Cadence is in a unique position because of historical strength in analog and packaging and digital and the new strength in system analysis. And hierarchically, you mentioned, I think that's always a big thing as things get bigger. And if you look at 3D-IC, this is another way to do hierarchical because if you have 4 chips on a package, you don't have to redesign all 4 of that. This is reuse at a much higher level. So -- but I do think 3D-IC is a significant trend that is going to happen, and we are well positioned for it."

In the year of unprecedented macro challenges, I'm pleased to report that Cadence achieved outstanding financial results for both the fourth quarter and 2020.  
For the year, we achieved 15% revenue growth and 35% on GAAP operating margin with strength across the board and all segments growing by double digit. In a moment, John will present more information for Q4 results and our 2021 outlook. The acceleration of digitization due to the pandemic, coupled with exciting generational trends like 5G, AI, ML, data analytics and hyperscale computing, continue to drive strong semiconductor demand.  
Leading hyperscaler, global AI companies continue to aggressively pursue more slow. While 5G, wireless, industrial and automotive verticals are leading the charge on the more than most front. Our intelligent system design strategy triples our aim, and our broad compelling portfolio of chip, package, board and system design solution uniquely positions us to realize these exciting opportunities.  
In 2020, we accelerated our momentum and marquee accounts, while expanding our system portfolio through compelling acquisitions, enabling us to win new customers in our targeted vertical segments. Of particular note was the strength of our aerospace and defense business as the digital transformation in this vertical continues. And we expanded and deepened our leadership ship with Northrop Grumman, which includes the use of our custom analog and digital full flow.  
Additionally, we are especially excited by the momentum we have with the hyperscalers as they are accelerating their chip and system design activity.  
Our engagements with the system companies have steadily risen over the past few years, and revenue from system companies is now closer to 45% of our total revenue. It was a great year for our Cadence Cloud, which now has more than 175 customers. And we further strengthened our partnership with cloud infrastructure and foundry partners.  
Now let us review Q4 highlights. Design excellence is a foundational layer of our strategy and includes our core EDA chip design platforms and IP portfolio. Our design -- our digital signoff solutions, offering superior quality of results and faster convergence continued proliferating at market-shaping  customers. We engage in well over 100 projects at 5-nanometer and below process technologies, and we are in earlier collaborations under 2-nanometer nodes. Deployment of our full flow accelerated as more than 45 customers adopted our Cadence digital full flow at the most advanced nodes during the year, including MediaTek, Samsung, Micron, Nuvia and a global marquee customer. Based on the superior quality of results, the market-shaping hyperscaler significantly increased the usage of our digital solution.  Earlier in the year, a market-shaping automotive semiconductor customer committed to Cadence as its primary EDA vendor for digital design.  
Customers are faced with bounding challenges in system verification and software bring-up and is benefiting from our verification full flow solutions that deliver industry-leading verification throughput. Momentum continued on Xcelium, our digital simulator, with several competitive replacements underway as well as expansion and new customer wins. Our hardware family of Palladium or Emulation and Protium for regressions and earlier software development had a strong quarter to finish our best ever year for hardware.  
For the year, Palladium Z1 had 24 new customers and 34 expansions, while Protium had 13 new customers and 14 expansion. Demand was particularly strong at AI and hyperscaler customers. Ericsson renewed their commitment to Cadence verification hardware, including both Palladium and Protium. A unique differentiator of the Protium X1 is the common front-end compiler with the Palladium Z1 that enables significant faster bring-up. And about 40% of our hardware business during the year included both Z1 and X1.  
Our IP business had a strong year as our focused strategy and a compelling portfolio leverage on the ongoing IP outsourcing trend. We continue expanding the footprint of our leadership DDR and PCIe IP and have several design wins at a 5-nanometer and lower process nodes.  
High-speed 30 is a critical component of hyperscaler infrastructure and several customers had adopted our 112-gig SerDes IP, including [ X1 apps ] who has also demonstrated working silicon. Tensilica has strong loyalties and significant wins as a key true wireless studio and mobile application processor customers. Additionally, the automotive segment had a strong -- have a good momentum which wins in functional safety, radar and digital radio, including an ADAS win, a leading self-driving car company.  
In system innovation, we are very excited about our system design and analysis segment, which had a particular strong year with greater than 25% revenue growth. Rising system complexity for advanced 5G, automotive and HPC applications is driving the need for a seamless platform solution across design, simulation and analysis. AWR and Integrand delivered strong great results in 2020, and there is a strong customer interest in our integrated Virtuoso, Innovus, Allegro and AWR microwave office solutions with in-design analysis.  
In system analysis, we are executing to our strategy of building out our multi-physics portfolio, offering best-in-class solutions and delivering superior results compared to legacy industry solutions. Strong market adoption continue for our system analysis products. And we are particularly pleased with the growing number of repeat orders with customers, including STMicroelectronics, Realtek and a market-shaping hyperscaler. We triple our system analysis TAM by adding computational fluid dynamic, CFD technology, through the pending NUMECA acquisition, which will bring leading CFD technology and deep domain expertise of Dr. Charles Hirsch and his team for Cadence. NUMECA has over 450 customers, including NASA, Honda and Ford across multiple verticals such as aerospace, automotive, industrial and marine.  
For pervasive intelligence, we continue to incorporate machine learning technologies in various tools for improved PPA and faster convergence. Xcelium ML has a successful engagement with several market-shaping customers, delivering up to 5x improvement in regressions throughput. We also progressed on providing IP specifically tuned for AI machine learning applications, especially edge influencing applications.  
Cadence continues to invest in fostering innovation and advancing education through endowments at top universities. Building upon previous endowments at Stanford, the University of California at Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University, we announced a $5 million endowment at MIT Schwarzman College of Computing to promote research in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics.  
Now I will turn it over to John to go over the Q4 results and present our 2021 outlook."

I'm pleased to report we exceeded all of our key operating metrics for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020. We achieved 50% on the Rule of 40 metric for the first time, through a combination of 15% revenue growth and 35% non-GAAP operating margin. Consistent execution against our strategy and double-digit growth across all product categories helped us achieve this landmark, but we also had the benefit of some tailwinds during the fiscal year, which included a 53rd week, a strong second half in China and the recovery of $26 million that we previously thought to be uncollectible.  
The pandemic brought many challenges, and I'm very proud of our Cadence team for their compassion and resilience in the face of adversity. Their focus on innovation and customer success resulted in continued acceleration of Cadence's 3-year revenue growth CAGR, which is now into double digits.  
Let's go through the key results for the fourth quarter and the year, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $760 million for the quarter and $2.683 billion for the year. Non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 37% for the quarter and approximately 35% for the year. GAAP EPS was $0.62 for the quarter and $2.11 for the year. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.83 for the quarter and $2.80 for the year.  
Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash balance was $928 million at year-end, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $136 million and $905 million for the full year. DSOs were 44 days, and we repurchased $380 million of Cadence shares during the year. 
Before I provide commentary for Q1 and fiscal 2021, I'd like to take a moment to share the assumptions embedded in our outlook. We expect strong revenue growth for the first half, followed by more muted second half growth as we lap some tough second half comps. Our outlook further assumes the pandemic restrictions will gradually ease across the globe this year, resulting in higher T&E expense in 2021 compared to 2020. We've included the expected impact of the pending NUMECA acquisition in our 2021 outlook. And finally, as usual, our outlook assumes that the export limitations that exist today for certain customers will remain in place for all of 2021. 
Embedding these assumptions into our outlook for fiscal 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $2.86 billion to $2.92 billion; non-GAAP operating margin of 34.5% to 36%; GAAP EPS in the range of $2.09 to $2.19; and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.95 to $3.05; operating cash flow in the range of $900 million to $950 million; and we expect to use approximately 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares in 2021. 
For Q1 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $710 million to $730 million, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 35%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.59 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.72 to $0.76. And we expect to repurchase $110 million of Cadence shares in Q1. 
Our CFO commentary, which is available on our website, includes our outlook for additional items as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
In conclusion, Cadence delivered another year of strong operating results, achieving 50% on the Rule of 40 metric for the very first time. We remain focused on driving profitable revenue growth. And at the midpoint of our outlook for fiscal 2021, I'm pleased that we are on track to grow our annual revenue by over $1 billion since 2016, with more than $0.50 of every dollar of revenue growth, dropping through to non-GAAP operating margin over that period. 
I would like to close by thanking our customers, partners and our hard-working employees for all that they do, and I'd like to remind them all that their health and safety continue to be our first priority. 
And with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

Thanks for the question, Gary. The -- yes, it's a pretty -- it's probably a multipart question. But yes, I guess in terms of the collections, the -- we had a collections windfall of $26 million in the second half, most of which came in Q4. And some",486,"Okay. Thanks for the question, Gary. The -- yes, it's a pretty -- it's probably a multipart question. But yes, I guess in terms of the collections, the -- we had a collections windfall of $26 million in the second half, most of which came in Q4. And some of those invoices were very old, which meant that $22 million of the $26 million was recognized in revenue before the end of the year. But -- and that was in relation to, if you recall, in the middle of the year, during the pandemic, we had some smaller customers that weren't able to pay us and we reserved for those. And we helped them out, but our engineers and team at Cadence were determined to help them out, whether they were paying us on us. 
But some of those customers turned around and managed to survive and we're assured they would. So that collections windfall kind of distorted maybe some of the revenue timing in the quarters during the year, but didn't really impact -- that $26 million didn't really impact the year because originally, we had it in the year, then we took it out in the middle of the year. And then like that $22 million of that $26 million collected got recognized. 
In relation to the extra week, we thought that was going to be $45 million, and it was. But the extra week, of course, was a 2% tailwind for -- in terms of helping us achieve 50% on the Rule of 40 in 2020. And what was the 2% tailwind in 2020 is a 2% headwind now in 2021 when we go from a 53-week year to a 52-week year. And then, I guess, we had a really strong second half in China. I mean when I step back from individual quarters and halves that I would say this, our business is very strong in all regions and across all of the product categories. 
The 3-year revenue CAGRs, they're up to 11% now in 2020. And at the midpoint, it's 11% for 2020. At the midpoint of our outlook for '21, that's 11%, too. So we're already off to a very strong start as well in the first half of '21, but it's too early really to say if that's sustainable in the longer term. 
So the second half, we have kind of muted revenue guidance. When I look at the second half of 2020 in China. What I noticed was that with a higher-than-normal proportion of upfront revenue in our recurring revenue mix for the region in China, for our outlook in '21, I've assumed we return to our usual recurring revenue mix in the region. And that, along with the fact that we have 1 less week in the second half in 2021 versus 2020, that's what contributes to the like conservative revenue growth outlook for the second half."

In relation to NUMECA, when we issued the original press release, we highlighted that the impact to '21 is pretty immaterial. It's pending. We expect it to close -- is imminent in terms of close, I would expect it to close this week. And as usual, of course, we'd expect purchase accounting rules to initially limit the revenue that we can recognize on NUMECA in the first year. So we expect that to be temporarily dilutive to earnings in 2021, and that's already embedded in our outlook. 
So from that perspective, we don't have -- I don't think we have anywhere near as much revenue in '21 as you're expecting."

I'm not sure if that's sustainable. I mean it looks like we're off to a strong start again in Q1. But for the purposes of determining an outlook for 2021, I assume -- I thought it was safest to assume a return to our usual recurring revenue mix, which could prove to be conservative for the second half. But  I'd rather go out with outlook assuming that we return to the usual recurring revenue mix than assume that that growth that we saw in the second half of 2020 continues. 
I mean if it does -- when we have increased visibility into revenue in the second half, we can uplift -- we can update our outlook at that time when we see it. But I just -- I didn't want to go with too strong a second half right now until I have a clear visibility into the pipeline in the second half."

Where I had some difficulty was projecting what upfront revenue might be out in Q3 and Q4. So the outlook for the second half is more conservative than the -- the first half is very, very predictable in terms of great visibility into the pipeline. We're off to a really strong start in Q1 already on the upfront business. And so much of that revenue is recurring in the first half that -- yes, we're seeing accelerating revenue growth.

So it's a lot of changes to infrastructure and there's a lot of fueling, a lot of design activity. So that's why we see a lot of design activity, not just from the semiconductor players. Now the system player and then the whole Industry 4.0, they all move into AI, machine learning, the digital transformation that drive a lot of semiconductor. So overall, the industry is moving in the right direction to us. 
And then meanwhile, I think, clearly, Cadence's Intelligent System Design strategy really tie in really well from the design excellence, providing the tool in IP. Now we move to the next level of system innovation that Anirudh talked about the system analysis and the CFD and the physics or multi-physics model. Then the next thing is move up into the Pervasive intelligence that's using AI machine learning, data analytics, drive all the vertical industry, that is major transformation going on.

So that will be -- you'll see a slight uptick there in expense in Q3 and Q4. And the growth in expenses through the year that would typically come from that is being offset by some more efficient infrastructure spend that we have planned as the year progresses. 
If you look at our 10-K that we filed, you'll see that we initiated a restructuring plan in Q4 2020 to optimize our spend on infrastructure. But -- and the expense mix in 2021, I think if you compare '21 versus '20, you'll probably see in '21, we're spending more on people and less on places than we were in '20.

First, we've heard for years, of course, from the EDA companies of ongoing design activity among your customers that that's remained robust. We've also heard of the general direction of design style or types from general purpose chips more to specialty kinds of designs. What we don't often hear about is how customers' design methodology may be evolving. 
And I'm wondering if there are any issues that you might want to talk about regarding, for example, the hierarchical versus flat, which has been a consideration for chip design now for 2 decades or more. Is -- are there any new implications or issues for that as it might pertain to or affect any of your EDA tools or new technologies, such as iSpatial or design space exploration? 
And then relatedly, there were a number of questions this evening already regarding system analysis and your broader ambitions in computational software. One thing we see on the other side of engineering software, the world you're approaching towards, are unified data platforms and common platforms for data management and the like, which you don't really seem to have. You do have multiple stacks for your various functional areas. Could you talk about how you're thinking about unifying or moving to a more common platform of that kind?"

Well, first of all, we want to make sure that we have best-in-class products, right, so whether that's digital design or verification and system analysis. 
So we always, as you know, this is technology business, best product wins. And at the same time, have a unified platform to go with it. And this is how we did digital implementation. This is how we did verification. So both parts are important to have best-in-class products, whether that's in finite element, electromagnetics or CFD. And then there are opportunities to combine them in a much more unified way, especially around data, like you mentioned. 
So I completely agree that the need for unification, but we also, at the same time, I want to make sure first that the products are best-in-class. We want a unified team, but each player has to be a strong player. But there are a lot of opportunities for data platforms and analytics like Lip-Bu also mentioned earlier. 
Now in terms of your first question of new methodologies, I mean there are several things happening. If I have to pick 1 or 2 key things that are happening, what we see with the customers, so one big trend, which you probably already know is this move to 3D-IC. I think this is going to be significant for the next several years. And it just changed a lot of methodologies in our customer base. And this is multiple high-end digital chips or even analog RF chips on a package. And that, I think, is driving a lot of change, especially in the cloud, hyperscaler companies all the way to consumer company. 
And we do have, historically, a lot of strength in package -- packaging with Allegro. Of course, we have a leadership platform, an advanced node with Innovus and then now the analysis tools with Clarity and Celsius because thermal is a big thing for 3D-IC. So I think this whole methodology of 3D-IC integration is one significant change that we do see in the customer base. And we are very excited about that because I think Cadence is in a unique position because of historical strength in analog and packaging and digital and the new strength in system analysis. And hierarchically, you mentioned, I think that's always a big thing as things get bigger. 
And if you look at 3D-IC, this is another way to do hierarchical because if you have 4 chips on a package, you don't have to redesign all 4 of that. This is reuse at a much higher level. So -- but I do think 3D-IC is a significant trend that is going to happen, and we are well positioned for it."

In the year of unprecedented macro challenges, I'm pleased to report that Cadence achieved outstanding financial results for both the fourth quarter and 2020.  
For the year, we achieved 15% revenue growth and 35% on GAAP operating margin with strength across the board and all segments growing by double digit. In a moment, John will present more information for Q4 results and our 2021 outlook. The acceleration of digitization due to the pandemic, coupled with exciting generational trends like 5G, AI, ML, data analytics and hyperscale computing, continue to drive strong semiconductor demand.  
Leading hyperscaler, global AI companies continue to aggressively pursue more slow. While 5G, wireless, industrial and automotive verticals are leading the charge on the more than most front. Our intelligent system design strategy triples our aim, and our broad compelling portfolio of chip, package, board and system design solution uniquely positions us to realize these exciting opportunities.  
In 2020, we accelerated our momentum and marquee accounts, while expanding our system portfolio through compelling acquisitions, enabling us to win new customers in our targeted vertical segments. Of particular note was the strength of our aerospace and defense business as the digital transformation in this vertical continues. And we expanded and deepened our leadership ship with Northrop Grumman, which includes the use of our custom analog and digital full flow.  
Additionally, we are especially excited by the momentum we have with the hyperscalers as they are accelerating their chip and system design activity.  
Our engagements with the system companies have steadily risen over the past few years, and revenue from system companies is now closer to 45% of our total revenue. It was a great year for our Cadence Cloud, which now has more than 175 customers. And we further strengthened our partnership with cloud infrastructure and foundry partners.  
Now let us review Q4 highlights. Design excellence is a foundational layer of our strategy and includes our core EDA chip design platforms and IP portfolio. Our design -- our digital signoff solutions, offering superior quality of results and faster convergence continued proliferating at market-shaping  customers. We engage in well over 100 projects at 5-nanometer and below process technologies, and we are in earlier collaborations under 2-nanometer nodes. Deployment of our full flow accelerated as more than 45 customers adopted our Cadence digital full flow at the most advanced nodes during the year, including MediaTek, Samsung, Micron, Nuvia and a global marquee customer. Based on the superior quality of results, the market-shaping hyperscaler significantly increased the usage of our digital solution.  Earlier in the year, a market-shaping automotive semiconductor customer committed to Cadence as its primary EDA vendor for digital design.  
Customers are faced with bounding challenges in system verification and software bring-up and is benefiting from our verification full flow solutions that deliver industry-leading verification throughput. Momentum continued on Xcelium, our digital simulator, with several competitive replacements underway as well as expansion and new customer wins. Our hardware family of Palladium or Emulation and Protium for regressions and earlier software development had a strong quarter to finish our best ever year for hardware.  
For the year, Palladium Z1 had 24 new customers and 34 expansions, while Protium had 13 new customers and 14 expansion. Demand was particularly strong at AI and hyperscaler customers. Ericsson renewed their commitment to Cadence verification hardware, including both Palladium and Protium. A unique differentiator of the Protium X1 is the common front-end compiler with the Palladium Z1 that enables significant faster bring-up. And about 40% of our hardware business during the year included both Z1 and X1.  
Our IP business had a strong year as our focused strategy and a compelling portfolio leverage on the ongoing IP outsourcing trend. We continue expanding the footprint of our leadership DDR and PCIe IP and have several design wins at a 5-nanometer and lower process nodes.  
High-speed SerDes is a critical component of hyperscaler infrastructure and several customers had adopted our 112-gig SerDes IP, including [ Xsight Labs ] who has also demonstrated working silicon. Tensilica has strong loyalties and significant wins as a key true wireless studio and mobile application processor customers. Additionally, the automotive segment had a strong -- have a good momentum which wins in functional safety, radar and digital radio, including an ADAS win, a leading self-driving car company.  
In system innovation, we are very excited about our system design and analysis segment, which had a particular strong year with greater than 25% revenue growth. Rising system complexity for advanced 5G, automotive and HPC applications is driving the need for a seamless platform solution across design, simulation and analysis. AWR and Integrand delivered strong great results in 2020, and there is a strong customer interest in our integrated Virtuoso, Innovus, Allegro and AWR microwave office solutions with in-design analysis.  
In system analysis, we are executing to our strategy of building out our multi-physics portfolio, offering best-in-class solutions and delivering superior results compared to legacy industry solutions. Strong market adoption continue for our system analysis products. And we are particularly pleased with the growing number of repeat orders with customers, including STMicroelectronics, Realtek and a market-shaping hyperscaler. We triple our system analysis TAM by adding computational fluid dynamic, CFD technology, through the pending NUMECA acquisition, which will bring leading CFD technology and deep domain expertise of Dr. Charles Hirsch and his team for Cadence. NUMECA has over 450 customers, including NASA, Honda and Ford across multiple verticals such as aerospace, automotive, industrial and marine.  
For pervasive intelligence, we continue to incorporate machine learning technologies in various tools for improved PPA and faster convergence. Xcelium ML has a successful engagement with several market-shaping customers, delivering up to 5x improvement in regressions throughput. We also progressed on providing IP specifically tuned for AI machine learning applications, especially edge influencing applications.  
Cadence continues to invest in fostering innovation and advancing education through endowments at top universities. Building upon previous endowments at Stanford, the University of California at Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University, we announced a $5 million endowment at MIT Schwarzman College of Computing to promote research in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics.  
Now I will turn it over to John to go over the Q4 results and present our 2021 outlook."

I'm pleased to report we exceeded all of our key operating metrics for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020. We achieved 50% on the Rule of 40 metric for the first time, through a combination of 15% revenue growth and 35% non-GAAP operating margin. Consistent execution against our strategy and double-digit growth across all product categories helped us achieve this landmark, but we also had the benefit of some tailwinds during the fiscal year, which included a 53rd week, a strong second half in China and the recovery of $26 million that we previously thought to be uncollectible.  
The pandemic brought many challenges, and I'm very proud of our Cadence team for their compassion and resilience in the face of adversity. Their focus on innovation and customer success resulted in continued acceleration of Cadence's 3-year revenue growth CAGR, which is now into double digits.  
Let's go through the key results for the fourth quarter and the year, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $760 million for the quarter and $2.683 billion for the year. Non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 37% for the quarter and approximately 35% for the year. GAAP EPS was $0.62 for the quarter and $2.11 for the year. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.83 for the quarter and $2.80 for the year.  
Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash balance was $928 million at year-end, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $136 million and $905 million for the full year. DSOs were 44 days, and we repurchased $380 million of Cadence shares during the year. 
Before I provide commentary for Q1 and fiscal 2021, I'd like to take a moment to share the assumptions embedded in our outlook. We expect strong revenue growth for the first half, followed by more muted second half growth as we lap some tough second half comps. Our outlook further assumes the pandemic restrictions will gradually ease across the globe this year, resulting in higher T&E expense in 2021 compared to 2020. We've included the expected impact of the pending NUMECA acquisition in our 2021 outlook. And finally, as usual, our outlook assumes that the export limitations that exist today for certain customers will remain in place for all of 2021. 
Embedding these assumptions into our outlook for fiscal 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $2.86 billion to $2.92 billion; non-GAAP operating margin of 34.5% to 36%; GAAP EPS in the range of $2.09 to $2.19; and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.95 to $3.05; operating cash flow in the range of $900 million to $950 million; and we expect to use approximately 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares in 2021. 
For Q1 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $710 million to $730 million, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 35%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.59 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.72 to $0.76. And we expect to repurchase $110 million of Cadence shares in Q1. 
Our CFO commentary, which is available on our website, includes our outlook for additional items as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
In conclusion, Cadence delivered another year of strong operating results, achieving 50% on the Rule of 40 metric for the very first time. We remain focused on driving profitable revenue growth. And at the midpoint of our outlook for fiscal 2021, I'm pleased that we are on track to grow our annual revenue by over $1 billion since 2016, with more than $0.50 of every dollar of revenue growth, dropping through to non-GAAP operating margin over that period. 
I would like to close by thanking our customers, partners and our hard-working employees for all that they do, and I'd like to remind them all that their health and safety continue to be our first priority. 
And with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

Thanks for the question, Gary. The -- yes, it's a pretty -- it's probably a multipart question. But yes, I guess in terms of the collections, the -- we had a collections windfall of $26 million in the second half, most of which came in Q4. And some",486,"Okay. Thanks for the question, Gary. The -- yes, it's a pretty -- it's probably a multipart question. But yes, I guess in terms of the collections, the -- we had a collections windfall of $26 million in the second half, most of which came in Q4. And some of those invoices were very old, which meant that $22 million of the $26 million was recognized in revenue before the end of the year. But -- and that was in relation to, if you recall, in the middle of the year, during the pandemic, we had some smaller customers that weren't able to pay us and we reserved for those. And we helped them out, but our engineers and team at Cadence were determined to help them out, whether they were paying us on us. 
But some of those customers turned around and managed to survive and we're assured they would. So that collections windfall kind of distorted maybe some of the revenue timing in the quarters during the year, but didn't really impact -- that $26 million didn't really impact the year because originally, we had it in the year, then we took it out in the middle of the year. And then like that $22 million of that $26 million collected got recognized. 
In relation to the extra week, we thought that was going to be $45 million, and it was. But the extra week, of course, was a 2% tailwind for -- in terms of helping us achieve 50% on the Rule of 40 in 2020. And what was the 2% tailwind in 2020 is a 2% headwind now in 2021 when we go from a 53-week year to a 52-week year. And then, I guess, we had a really strong second half in China. I mean when I step back from individual quarters and halves that I would say this, our business is very strong in all regions and across all of the product categories. 
The 3-year revenue CAGRs, they're up to 11% now in 2020. And at the midpoint, it's 11% for 2020. At the midpoint of our outlook for '21, that's 11%, too. So we're already off to a very strong start as well in the first half of '21, but it's too early really to say if that's sustainable in the longer term. 
So the second half, we have kind of muted revenue guidance. When I look at the second half of 2020 in China. What I noticed was that with a higher-than-normal proportion of upfront revenue in our recurring revenue mix for the region in China, for our outlook in '21, I've assumed we return to our usual recurring revenue mix in the region. And that, along with the fact that we have 1 less week in the second half in 2021 versus 2020, that's what contributes to the like conservative revenue growth outlook for the second half."

The operating margin profile there is better than EDA, which allows us to invest in the business while we're generating strong incremental margins that improve our overall operating leverage. 
In relation to NUMECA, when we issued the original press release, we highlighted that the impact to '21 is pretty immaterial. It's pending. We expect it to close -- is imminent in terms of close, I would expect it to close this week. And as usual, of course, we'd expect purchase accounting rules to initially limit the revenue that we can recognize on NUMECA in the first year.

So I think it's kind of accumulation of the last 12 years, continue working on it. So we are delighted, we're now getting closer to the 45% of the revenue.

And that's about 51% of the revenue growth, if you calculate the revenue growth over that period of time.

And when I was looking for signs of a pull-in in Q3 and -- to try and figure out that -- was there some acceleration of purchasing that came out in '21 or did it come out of Q4 where people just preparing with the pandemic, where they're just trying to get their hardware delivered earlier for fears of delays due to the pandemic. But -- and then what we looked at, I was waiting for a view of the pipeline. Pipeline for '21 is very strong. 
And when I look at that and compared it to what had happened, what was different about the second half of 2020 for China, what I did notice is because of that hardware that we had a higher mix of upfront revenue in the region in the second half than we would normally see. 
I'm not sure if that's sustainable. I mean it looks like we're off to a strong start again in Q1.

But -- and we have 1 less week in the second half of 2021. 
We're very, very pleased with the growth we're seeing in China. It looks like it's continuing on. We're seeing that strength continue on into Q1. The pipeline is strong.

NUMECA will come into the mix, we hope, for the second half of Q1 and then the remainder of the year from an expense perspective. We expect merit to hit this in -- merit increases will be July again. So that will be -- you'll see a slight uptick there in expense in Q3 and Q4. And the growth in expenses through the year that would typically come from that is being offset by some more efficient infrastructure spend that we have planned as the year progresses. 
If you look at our 10-K that we filed, you'll see that we initiated a restructuring plan in Q4 2020 to optimize our spend on infrastructure. But -- and the expense mix in 2021, I think if you compare '21 versus '20, you'll probably see in '21, we're spending more on people and less on places than we were in '20.

And especially for the system business, there are multiple facets to it. In the semiconductor business or the big large system companies, we operate mostly through a direct channel, okay. But if you remember, we also have our Allegro business, which is our packaging business. We do quite well in PCB and packaging with Allegro. And Allegro does have a -- already, we do have an indirect channel. And like Lip-Bu mentioned earlier, cloud is important going forward. 
So for the system business, I envision 3 channels. We will -- we are building 3 channels. One is the direct channel because a lot of the big companies and big system in semi companies, anyway, want system tools, like you mentioned. And expanding our indirect channel like we have for Allegro and expanding it to overall system design analysis, and then a SaaS channel, which -- or cloud-based channel for -- especially for smaller companies that don't have a lot of data centers and are more attractive to use on the cloud. 
So as we go to the system design and analysis, we do have to build out these 3 facets of our go-to-market. And we are working all of them in different stages.

First, we've heard for years, of course, from the EDA companies of ongoing design activity among your customers that that's remained robust. We've also heard of the general direction of design style or types from general purpose chips more to specialty kinds of designs. What we don't often hear about is how customers' design methodology may be evolving. 
And I'm wondering if there are any issues that you might want to talk about regarding, for example, the hierarchical versus flat, which has been a consideration for chip design now for 2 decades or more. Is -- are there any new implications or issues for that as it might pertain to or affect any of your EDA tools or new technologies, such as iSpatial or design space exploration? 
And then relatedly, there were a number of questions this evening already regarding system analysis and your broader ambitions in computational software. One thing we see on the other side of engineering software, the world you're approaching towards, are unified data platforms and common platforms for data management and the like, which you don't really seem to have. You do have multiple stacks for your various functional areas. Could you talk about how you're thinking about unifying or moving to a more common platform of that kind?"

Well, first of all, we want to make sure that we have best-in-class products, right, so whether that's digital design or verification and system analysis. 
So we always, as you know, this is technology business, best product wins. And at the same time, have a unified platform to go with it. And this is how we did digital implementation. This is how we did verification. So both parts are important to have best-in-class products, whether that's in finite element, electromagnetics or CFD. And then there are opportunities to combine them in a much more unified way, especially around data, like you mentioned. 
So I completely agree that the need for unification, but we also, at the same time, I want to make sure first that the products are best-in-class. We want a unified team, but each player has to be a strong player. But there are a lot of opportunities for data platforms and analytics like Lip-Bu also mentioned earlier. 
Now in terms of your first question of new methodologies, I mean there are several things happening. If I have to pick 1 or 2 key things that are happening, what we see with the customers, so one big trend, which you probably already know is this move to 3D-IC. I think this is going to be significant for the next several years. And it just changed a lot of methodologies in our customer base. And this is multiple high-end digital chips or even analog RF chips on a package. And that, I think, is driving a lot of change, especially in the cloud, hyperscaler companies all the way to consumer company. 
And we do have, historically, a lot of strength in package -- packaging with Allegro. Of course, we have a leadership platform, an advanced node with Innovus and then now the analysis tools with Clarity and Celsius because thermal is a big thing for 3D-IC. So I think this whole methodology of 3D-IC integration is one significant change that we do see in the customer base. And we are very excited about that because I think Cadence is in a unique position because of historical strength in analog and packaging and digital and the new strength in system analysis. And hierarchically, you mentioned, I think that's always a big thing as things get bigger. 
And if you look at 3D-IC, this is another way to do hierarchical because if you have 4 chips on a package, you don't have to redesign all 4 of that. This is reuse at a much higher level. So -- but I do think 3D-IC is a significant trend that is going to happen, and we are well positioned for it."

Generation trends by 5G, hyperscale computing, autonomous driving and industrial IoT continue to propel the need for innovation in compute, memory, networking and storage from the edge to the cloud. With massive amounts of new data being generated every day, AI, ML and data analytics are helping transforming the data through intelligence, providing actionable insights and accelerating digital transformation of several industries. These trends are continuing to drive strong semiconductor demand and design activity across a broad spectrum of end markets. And our intelligent system design strategy ideally positions us to capture these sizing opportunities. 
Now let me talk about the Q1 highlights, starting off with core EDA and IP in the design excellent layer of our IST strategy. We had ongoing strength in aerospace and defense. And we significantly expanded our collaboration with a marquee aerospace defense systems company that included the proliferation of our digital full flow as well as our functional and custom simulation solutions. 
Our digital and signoff business had a strong revenue quarter, with multiple market-shaping customers successfully [ dipping ] out at 5-nanometer-and-below process nodes using our digital full flow. Increasing design complexity continues driving a circular trend for hardware-assisted certification, and Q1 was a standout quarter for our palladium simulation and protium prototyping platform. Significant expansions as well as multiple new wins contributed to Q1 being our best hardware revenue quarter ever. 
Additionally, we announced our new Palladium Z2 and Protium X2 platforms, delivering 2x capacity and 1.5x higher performance than our current leading Z1 and X1 systems. These next-generation systems enable the highest throughput hardware debug and pre-silicon software validation of million -- [ multibillion-gig ] SoC designs and were endorsed by NVIDIA, AMD and ARM. 
Our IP business also delivered double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. There was strong demand for our high-speed IP by market-shaping customers for their next-generation data center and networking environments as well as continued strength in our memory interface IP business. And silica continued to expand its footprint in true wireless studio and Bluetooth assets, and our Vision Q6 and hi-fi products were [indiscernible] in the ratable and smart speakers end markets. 
It was another exciting quarter for system design and analysis segment, delivering over 30% year-over-year revenue growth. Early this month, we acquired Pointwise, a leader in mesh generation for computational fluid dynamics. The addition of Pointwise technologies and experienced team further broaden our system analysis portfolio, complements our recent acquired NUMECA CFD technology and our organic multiphysics products. 
Pointwise provides highly innovative mesh and generation technology to enable high [indiscernible] CSD analysis. And these solutions are being used by several marquee customers, especially in the aerospace segment. We want to congratulate our NUMECA team for the role their product played in the design of the [indiscernible] in New Zealand racing boat that won American Cup for New Zealand for the fourth [indiscernible] The winning team used a simulator base on the NUMECA biomarine CFD software for their computation fluid dynamic modeling. And thanks to the unprecedented accuracy and really some of the simulators were about to accurately test new ideas and concepts long before first boat ever touched the water. 
We introduced Sigrity X, our next-generation signal and power integrity solution with endorsements from Samsung, MediaTek and Renesas. This solution leverage new simulation engines and massively cellular architecture to deliver over 10% -- up to 10% performance and capacity gain for system-level simulation of the most demanding hyperscaler, 5G, automotive and aerospace applications. And Celcom expanded their usage of our flagship Virtuoso and AWR products for advanced RFIC design and for system analysis. 
Let me conclude with a few comments on some macro-level topics. We continue to monitor the semiconductor supply chain situation, and so far, we are not seeing any slowdown in design activity across our customer base. Next, in regarding evolving state of the COVID-19 pandemic. While some countries are edging towards normalcy, there is a growing concern with the escalating number of cases in certain regions, especially in India. As always, the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners is paramount, and we will continue doing what is in their best interest while working closely with local regulatory agencies. 
Lastly, in the past year that's brought to life many social justice challenges, including a recent of violence against Asian-Americans. I strongly believe that we have an obligation as individuals and as a company to take a stand against racism and further example for inclusiveness and understanding. At Cadence, we are committed to listening with empathy, the inclusive of different points of view and, as a result, ensure that our diversity enhance our experience and our innovative spirit. Now I will turn it over to John to go over the Q1 results and present our Q2 and updated 2021 outlook."

I'm pleased to report that we exceeded all of our key operating metrics for the quarter.

I'm pleased to report that we exceeded all of our key operating metrics for the quarter. Broad-based growth across many lines of our business, combined with some earlier-than-anticipated hardware sales, resulted in strong revenue growth in Q1. We continue to invest heavily in building out a multiphysics platform for system design and analysis. We completed our second acquisition of the year in the CFD space when we acquired Pointwise in April, a leader in CFD mesh generation. The focus over the past few months on completing acquisitions contributed to some delays to our expected pace of hiring in Q1, but we expect to get hiring back on track by the second half of the year. 
Now let's go through the key results for the first quarter, beginning with the P&L. Total revenue was $736 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 38%. GAAP EPS was $0.67 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.83. Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, cash totaled $743 million while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $208 million. DSOs were 48 days, and during Q1, we repurchased $172 million of Cadence shares. 
Before I provide our updated outlook for fiscal 2021 and what we expect for Q2, I'd like to take a moment to share the assumptions embedded in our outlook. The ongoing chip capacity constraints, along with the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in India, are expected to create a headwind for IP revenue for the remainder of this year. The revenue impact has been factored into our outlook. We expect expenses to increase in the second half of the year, primarily due to headcount growth as we continue to invest in our expanding multiphysics platform. We've included the Pointwise acquisition in our 2021 outlook. And finally, our outlook assumes that the export limitations that exist today for certain customers will remain in place for all of 2021. 
Embedding these assumptions into our outlook for fiscal 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $2.88 billion to $2.93 billion; non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 35% to 36%; GAAP EPS in the range of $2.01 to $2.09; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.99 to $3.07; operating cash flow in the range of $900 million to $950 million; and we expect to use at least 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares in 2021. 
For Q2 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $705 million to $725 million; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 36%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.44 to $0.48; and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.74 to $0.78. Our CFO commentary, which is available on our website, includes our outlook for additional items as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
In conclusion, the Cadence team delivered another quarter of strong operating results and remain focused on driving profitable revenue growth. We'd like to thank our customers, partners and, of course, our employees for a solid start to 2021. And I'd like to remind them all that their health and safety continues to be our first priority. And with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

If you recall, we had similar challenges back in Q2 last year in North America. And we're hoping we can do the same for them now, but it could cause some fluctuation in revenue timing between quarters. 
The bigger impact on the year is probably in relation to chip capacity constraints. Last quarter, when we talked about that, my expectation was royalties might be flat year-over-year. I now expect them to be slightly down. So a slight headwind built into the guide this quarter for that."

Could there be any effect how you price and/or package your software or anything else? 
And then secondly, with respect to system design strategy and the overall computational software strategy, how would you compare the R&D and AE intensity or requirements of system analysis, particularly as you add more in CFD and other physics versus core or classical EDAs such as synthesis, implementation, RTL simulation and the like?

Those are very good question. Let me take the second 1 first. So as you may know, Jay, even in our EDA business, our EDA software business, maybe 1/4 of it is more simulation-based, like circuit simulation and logic simulation. So invariably, those simulation-based businesses are more profitable than overall EDA. So like Spectre usually is more profitable than place and route, for example. 
So I expect a similar trend to happen in system analysis. So system analysis by nature is simulation-based, whether it's Clarity, it's electromagnetics or CFD. So in steady state, I do expect that system analysis to be more profitable than core EDA. Now as we build up and we scale revenue, there are some transient nature. But in steady state, I do expect that to be the case. And so far, we are pleased with the -- not just the revenue growth but actually even the margin performance of system analysis business.

There's the interactive tools where every license needs a driver, and then there's like simulation tools where they're kind of batch process tools. where 1 engineer can kick off like 1,000 simulations if they want. 
And that's partly why the system analysis part of the business or the simulation part of the business is the most profitable part of our software business because in all cases, our expenses are generally tethered to the R&D and AE engineers required to support the software, but the revenue is not tethered in relation to simulation. It's not tethered to the number of engineers in simulation licenses. And I think that's why we see that being more profitable."

And I wasn't happy that -- I wasn't to extrapolate that for all of 2021 because I felt that the second half looked like an anomaly. So I thought for guidance purposes and to be conservative, we would assume that we mean revert back to our normal recurring revenue mix right in the middle of that 85% to 90% range that we normally have for the company, even though China is probably slightly more upfront than that. 
And that would kind of -- my expectation then is that China is -- it's very hard to predict but somewhere in the 12% to 13% range for revenue. And that's where it came out for Q1. So that's what we've embedded into the guide. We'll have better visibility once we get to the middle of the year and we'll update then.

And at the end of the day, it's the foundry, the EDA and then how to meet our customer requirements and they want to move into a new foundry, they need a lot of different tools and optimization and process and rivalry. And overall, I think will be a net improvement for us."

What you're seeing in the impact, the reason that operating margins are slightly lower in the second half, it's the combination of 2 acquisitions and delayed hiring activity into the second half. But also, we have a merit cycle that kicks in, in July 1. But with all that said, we're heavily investing in building out our multiphysics platform for the future.

I'm pleased to report that Cadence had a good start to the year, delivering outstanding financial results for the first quarter, with broad-based demand for our innovative solutions driving strong revenue growth, profitability and cash flow. John will provide the details in a moment as well as our updated outlook. 
Generation trends by 5G, hyperscale computing, autonomous driving and industrial IoT continue to propel the need for innovation in compute, memory, networking and storage from the edge to the cloud. With massive amounts of new data being generated every day, AI, ML and data analytics are helping transforming the data through intelligence, providing actionable insights and accelerating digital transformation of several industries. These trends are continuing to drive strong semiconductor demand and design activity across a broad spectrum of end markets. And our intelligent system design strategy ideally positions us to capture these sizing opportunities. 
Now let me talk about the Q1 highlights, starting off with core EDA and IP in the design excellent layer of our IST strategy. We had ongoing strength in aerospace and defense, and we significantly expanded our collaboration with a marquee aerospace defense systems company that included the proliferation of our digital full flow as well as our functional and custom simulation solutions. 
Our digital signoff business had a strong revenue quarter, with multiple market-shaping customers successfully fitting out at 5-nanometer-and-below process nodes using our digital full flow. Increasing design complexity continues driving a circular trend for hardware-assisted certification, and Q1 was a standout quarter for our palladium simulation and protium prototyping platforms. Significant expansions as well as multiple new wins contributed to Q1 being our best hardware revenue quarter ever. 
Additionally, we announced our new Palladium Z2 and Protium X2 platforms, delivering 2x capacity and 1.5x higher performance than our current leading Z1 and X1 systems. These next-generation systems enable the highest throughput hardware debug and pre-silicon software validation of million -- multibillion-gig SoC designs and were endorsed by NVIDIA, AMD and ARM. 
Our IP business also delivered double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. There was strong demand for our high-speed IP by market-shaping customers for their next-generation data center and networking environments as well as continued strength in our memory interface IP business. And silica continued to expand its footprint in true wireless studio and Bluetooth headsets, and our Vision Q6 and hi-fi products proliferated in the ratable and smart speakers end markets. 
It was another exciting quarter for system design and analysis segment, delivering over 30% year-over-year revenue growth. Early this month, we acquired Pointwise, a leader in mesh generation for computational fluid dynamics. The addition of Pointwise technologies and experienced team further broaden our system analysis portfolio, complements our recent acquired NUMECA CFD technology and our organic multiphysics products. 
Pointwise provides highly innovative mesh and grid-generation technology to enable high-fidelity CSD analysis. And these solutions are being used by several marquee customers, especially in the aerospace segment. We want to congratulate our NUMECA team for the role their product played in the design of the Emirates in New Zealand racing boat that won American Cup for New Zealand for the fourth. The winning team used a simulator base on the NUMECA biomarine CFD software for their computation fluid dynamic modeling. And thanks to the unprecedented accuracy and really some of the simulators were about to accurately test new ideas and concepts long before first boat ever touched the water. 
We introduced Sigrity X, our next-generation signal and power integrity solution with endorsements from Samsung, MediaTek and Renesas. This solution leverage new simulation engines and massively cellular architecture to deliver over 10% -- up to 10% performance and capacity gain for system-level simulation of the most demanding hyperscaler, 5G, automotive and aerospace applications. And Qualcomm expanded their usage of our flagship Virtuoso and AWR products for advanced RFIC design and clarity for system analysis. 
Let me conclude with a few comments on some macro-level topics. We continue to monitor the semiconductor supply chain situation, and so far, we are not seeing any slowdown in design activity across our customer base. Next, in regarding evolving state of the COVID-19 pandemic. While some countries are edging towards normalcy, there is a growing concern with the escalating number of cases in certain regions, especially in India. As always, the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners is paramount, and we will continue doing what is in their best interest while working closely with local regulatory agencies. 
Lastly, in the past year that's brought to life many social justice challenges, including a recent of violence against Asian-Americans. I strongly believe that we have an obligation as individuals and as a company to take a stand against racism and further example for inclusiveness and understanding. At Cadence, we are committed to listening with empathy, the inclusive of different points of view and, as a result, ensure that our diversity enhance our experience and our innovative spirit. 
Now I will turn it over to John to go over the Q1 results and present our Q2 and updated 2021 outlook."
25941,710900679,2258493,"Cadence Design Systems, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2021",2021-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Cadence Design Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lip-Bu, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we exceeded all of our key operating metrics for the quarter.

I'm pleased to report that we exceeded all of our key operating metrics for the quarter. Broad-based growth across many lines of our business, combined with some earlier-than-anticipated hardware sales, resulted in strong revenue growth in Q1. We continue to invest heavily in building out a multiphysics platform for system design and analysis. We completed our second acquisition of the year in the CFD space when we acquired Pointwise in April, a leader in CFD mesh generation. The focus over the past few months on completing acquisitions contributed to some delays to our expected pace of hiring in Q1, but we expect to get hiring back on track by the second half of the year. 
Now let's go through the key results for the first quarter, beginning with the P&L. Total revenue was $736 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 38%. GAAP EPS was $0.67 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.83. Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, cash totaled $743 million while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $208 million. DSOs were 48 days, and during Q1, we repurchased $172 million of Cadence shares. 
Before I provide our updated outlook for fiscal 2021 and what we expect for Q2, I'd like to take a moment to share the assumptions embedded in our outlook. The ongoing chip capacity constraints, along with the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in India, are expected to create a headwind for IP revenue for the remainder of this year. The revenue impact has been factored into our outlook. We expect expenses to increase in the second half of the year, primarily due to headcount growth as we continue to invest in our expanding multiphysics platform. We've included the Pointwise acquisition in our 2021 outlook. And finally, our outlook assumes that the export limitations that exist today for certain customers will remain in place for all of 2021. 
Embedding these assumptions into our outlook for fiscal 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $2.88 billion to $2.93 billion; non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 35% to 36%; GAAP EPS in the range of $2.01 to $2.09; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.99 to $3.07; operating cash flow in the range of $900 million to $950 million; and we expect to use at least 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares in 2021. 
For Q2 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $705 million to $725 million; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 36%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.44 to $0.48; and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.74 to $0.78. Our CFO commentary, which is available on our website, includes our outlook for additional items as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
In conclusion, the Cadence team delivered another quarter of strong operating results and remain focused on driving profitable revenue growth. We'd like to thank our customers, partners and, of course, our employees for a solid start to 2021. And I'd like to remind them all that their health and safety continues to be our first priority.

If you recall, we had similar challenges back in Q2 last year in North America. And we're hoping we can do the same for them now, but it could cause some fluctuation in revenue timing between quarters. 
The bigger impact on the year is probably in relation to chip capacity constraints. Last quarter, when we talked about that, my expectation was royalties might be flat year-over-year. I now expect them to be slightly down. So there's a slight headwind built into the guide this quarter for that."

So first of all, we are excited about CFD, like we mentioned last time, and it is a very big segment in system analysis, close to $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion. So we are excited, focused on that. And Pointwise is a leader in meshing technology so we are glad to work with them and bring them in-house. So we think combining Pointwise with NUMECA, and our organic capability in battle and distributed computing can give a very, very state-of-the-art solution for the CFD market, okay? 
So we want to make sure we do well in CFD. And as you know, we are already in electromagnetics with Clarity and thermal with Celsius. So I think these are our focus areas for now and then we see how things go in these segments. But so far, we are optimistic. And actually, if you look at our Q1 results, we had good growth versus Q1 of last year. So we -- like John said, we are continuing to invest in this space. And we are still early in CFD but optimistic about it."

So John, I get kind of the timing and the incentivizing of the older generation, but could it be possible that just the performance on the new generation means that the net demand ultimately is maybe higher than being forecasted?

First, for Anirudh, on the fourth quarter call 3 months ago, as you may recall, we talked about how customers' design flows and methodologies are evolving. The follow-up therefore to that observation you made at the time is, how might that affect, as that takes place, Cadence's pricing and/or product packaging commensurate with customers' evolution of their methodologies? Could there be any effect on how you price and/or package your software or anything else? 
And then secondly, with respect to system design strategy and the overall computational software strategy, how would you compare the R&D and AE intensity or requirements of system analysis, particularly as you add more in CFD and other physics versus core or classical EDAs such as synthesis, implementation, RTL simulation and the like?

Those are very good question. Let me take the second one first. So as you may know, Jay, even in our EDA business, our EDA software business, maybe 1/4 of it is more simulation-based, like circuit simulation and logic simulation. So invariably, those simulation-based businesses are more profitable than overall EDA. So like Spectre usually is more profitable than place and route, for example. 
So I expect a similar trend to happen in system analysis. So system analysis by nature is simulation-based, whether it's Clarity, it's electromagnetics or CFD. So in steady state, I do expect that system analysis to be more profitable than core EDA. Now as we build up and we scale revenue, there are some transient nature. But in steady state, I do expect that to be the case. And so far, we are pleased with the -- not just the revenue growth but actually even the margin performance of system analysis business. 
And on your first question, I think we are looking at it carefully in terms of packaging and pricing. We are pretty disciplined in that. I think 1 big trend, like I mentioned last time, there's more and more full flow used like nodes as you know already, so we are selling a lot of these tools together.

There's the interactive tools where every license needs a driver, and then there's like simulation tools where they're kind of batch process tools. where one engineer can kick off like 1,000 simulations if they want. 
And that's partly why the system analysis part of the business or the simulation part of the business is the most profitable part of our software business because in all cases, our expenses are generally tethered to the R&D and AE engineers required to support the software, but the revenue is not tethered in relation to simulation. It's not tethered to the number of engineers in simulation licenses. And I think that's why we see that being more profitable."

And that would kind of -- my expectation then is that China is -- it's very hard to predict but somewhere in the 12% to 13% range for revenue. And that's where it came out for Q1.

At the same time, we will enhance them with our organically -- our organic technologies of parallel and distributed computing. So we will definitely enhance them further. 
And like Lip-Bu and John mentioned, I think all these investments are built into our guidance, and we feel good already in terms of -- so we -- at this point, we already have significant scale R&D investment in system analysis, okay, so because of Clarity and other products. So we feel good in terms of the amount of R&D we have already invested and we'll go from there. But I think at the bottom line, we feel that this point with NUMECA and our organic development, we have a lot of capabilities to scale it and to see it evolve."

We are significantly raising our financial outlook for the year, highlighted by a $14 million increase in revenue guidance or 10% year-over-year revenue growth. John will provide the details in a moment of both our Q2 results and the updated outlook for the year. 
Before I get into more details for the quarter -- about the quarter, I would like to talk about CEO transition news that we announced earlier this afternoon. We announce Anirudh Devgan, our President, will take over as CEO on December 15, 2021, and I will transition to the role of Executive Chairman at that time. 
It has been a privilege to serve as the CEO of Cadence for the past 12-plus years. Over that period, I'm very pleased that we instilled a sustainable culture center on need for innovation and customer delight. Watch very close partnership with our customers and partners and build an extremely talented Cadence team of over 9,000 employees. 
Cadence is now firmly established, not just as a top end-to-end EDA provider of choice, but a company that is well on its way and expanding beyond EDA by executing our exciting IST strategy that triple our TAM to $30 billion. 
The Board and are very excited that Anirudh will become CEO in December. And we cannot think of anyone more uniquely qualified lead Cadence to even higher high. He's a proven leader with both strategy vision, a relentless focus on innovation and execution, and passion for driving customer success. Over the past 4 years, since he became President, Anirudh and I have jointly led the company. And the Board and I think this is the right time to execute the next phase of our succession plan and hand over the baton to him. You can expect to see a lot of continuity going forward as we view this transition as more of a formalization of our current responsibilities. 
As Executive Chairman, I will focus more on new market opportunities key strategic initiatives and deepening our relationship with customers and partners and on maximizing shareholder value. And now let me move on to the business highlights. 
Generation trends such as 5G, hyperscaler and autonomous vehicles under PI, AI, machine learning and data analytics are accelerating digital transformation across multiple industries. With semiconductors at this foundation, these trends are driving strong design activity across a growing spectrum of semi and system companies, and we are very well positioned for this to be a sustainable long-term growth drivers for us. 
Delighting customers and accelerating growth requires relentless amendment to innovation. With the launch of the 4 new products, we have now introduced 8 significant innovative products so far this year across all the business groups and will contribute to future growth. We continue to expand our business with market-shaping customers and our differentiated solution that to a broad-based expansion of our partnership with Samsung, including proliferation of our digital full flow. It was an outstanding quarter for our digital and signoff business with revenue growing 16% year-over-year. 
Our digital full flow delivering industry-leading quality of results at the most advanced nodes, adding 13 new customers that included key competitive displacements while expanding significantly at several market-shaping customers. Not working among them were a large U.S. data infrastructure company, further expansion of a marquee U.S. aerospace and defense firm, a major Asia Pacific hyperscaler and an exciting AI startup. We have been steadily incorporating passing AIML technology into our solutions, and we significantly advanced that with last week's introduction of new Cerebras intelligent chip Explorer. Cerebras unique reinforcement learning model, increased effectiveness with each use and enables to 20% TPA improvement and 10x productivity gain. Cerebras was endorsed by Samsung and Renesas, and several customers have realized meaningful benefits across multiple process nodes and end applications. 
It was also a great quarter for our Verification business with 23% year-over-year revenue growth. Our verification suite and pricing of best-in-class engine and delivering the best verification throughput so continued strong customer adoption and expansion at several leading customers. 
Circular demand for our hardware continue unabated leading to best Q2 ever for our palladium and protium platform. There is a robust customer interest in the new Z2 and X2 systems with sales ramping nicely. Our sales of Z1 and X1 remain strong. Our hardware family had 15 new orders and over 65 repeat orders in the quarter with the 3 largest transactions being with hyperscalers and included our largest Protium transaction to date, which was for new X2. 
Strong momentum continued for our system design and analysis segment, with 20% year-over-year revenue growth. We expanded our system footprint with multiple verticals, including aerospace and defense, 5G wireless and communications. Growing system complexity for high-frequency applications is driving the need for an integrated platform solution across system design, simulation and analysis. As we continue building our system portfolio, we are pleased to see earlier indication of customers increasingly choosing a broader set of our solution across this domains. For instance, in Q2, a large U.S. data infrastructure company, make a significant commitment to our PCB, IC packaging, RF and system analysis solutions. We introduced our next generation PCB and IC packaging design platform, LegroX that provides a unified engineering platform incorporating innovative merchant-lending techniques and delivering up to for improvement in overall design team productivity. 
AWR and Integral have a record quarter and the integration of our recent meta and point-wise acquisition is progressing well. We have added several hundred system customers as we enhance our go-to-market and channel organization to help accelerate our business. 
Next, I want to make a few macro level comments. We continue to monitor the ongoing semiconductor supply chain situation. As I reported last quarter, so far, we are not seeing any slowdown in design activity across our customer base. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 dynamic continues to evolve in our unpredictable manner in an unpredictable manner with overall progress being threatened by new variants. As always, the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners is paramount, and we will continue doing what is their best interest while working closely with local regulatory agencies. Now I will turn it over to Anirudh to say a few words."

I'm pleased to report that we exceeded all of our key financial metrics for the quarter with broad-based demand for our innovative solutions, driving stronger-than-expected revenue growth, profitability and cash flow. As a result, we are raising our financial outlook for the year across all key metrics. 
Before getting into the numbers, I'd like to say a particular thank you to our India team. As we all know, India was particularly hard hit by the pandemic in Q2, and we are deeply grateful to our Indian leaders we're going above and beyond the call of duty to put people first. We commend them for their heroic work in helping the local relief efforts and it's reassuring to see the situation in India improve over the past few weeks. 
Now let's go through the key results for the second quarter, beginning with the P&L. Total revenue was $728 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 39.5%. GAAP EPS was $0.56 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.86. 
Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, cash totaling $847 million, while the principal -- cash totaled $847 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow for Q2 was $380 million. DSOs were 49 days. And during Q2, we repurchased $220 million of Cadence shares. 
Before I provide our updated outlook for fiscal 2021, I'd like to take a moment to share the assumptions embedded in our outlook. We continue to expect that our new [indiscernible] and point-wise acquisitions will be slightly dilutive this year before becoming accretive next year. Our hiring plans in the first half were delayed by the COVID situation in India, but our outlook currently assumes we catch up on much of that delayed hiring activity in the second half. 
Our outlook for the second half includes the cost of salary and promotion increases for the broad employee base. Those salary increases and promotions were generally affected from July 1. And finally, our outlook assumes there will be no changes to the export limitations that exist today. Embedding these assumptions into our outlook for fiscal [indiscernible]. We expect revenue in the range of $2.925 billion to $2.965 billion; non-GAAP operating margin in the range of to 36% to 36.75%. GAAP EPS in the range of $2.15 to $2.21. Non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.14 to $3.20. Operating cash flow in the range of $925 million to $975 million. And we expect to use at least 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares in 2021. 
For Q3 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $730 million to $750 million; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 34%; the EPS in the range of $0.48 to $0.50 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.74 to $0.76. Our CFO commentary, which is available on our website includes our outlook for additional items as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. In conclusion, Cadence delivered another quarter of strong revenue growth and expanding profitability, and we're pleased to raise our outlook for the year. I would like to close by thanking our customers, partners and our hard-working employees for all that they do, and I'd like to remind them all that their health and safety continues to be our first priority.

I believe Cerebras is a fundamental breakthrough using reinforcement learning to basically drive our digital follow. So I mean, Jay, as you know Tempus can give great quality of results, but the design as still run them and based on their inclusion run them again and you do the design that way. And Cerebras can do that much more in a much more mathematical way to explore the design options and parameters. And we announced that last week, as you said, and some of the results or some of the endorsement. For example, Samsung said they got 8% power improvement, and this could be done in days versus months. And Renesas said that they've got 10% improvement, but in frequency. So these are definitely very promising results. 
I mean it's still early. We are continuing to work with more and more customers. But so far, we are happy with how well Cerebras is performing. And these are based on fundamental kind of new optimization methods. And one thing I would like to remind you is that we have a lot of expertise in computational software and a lot of it can be applied to AI. So it's still early days, and I think these can be definitely applied to other areas. So for example, we also announced LegroX a couple of months ago, and that also has new machine learning technology to try and more automate place in route for PCB. So I think it's still early days, but we are very pleased by what Cerebras can do and the application of AI met general to EDA and to simulation and system design."

And because I think clearly, this fire generation are driving a lot of innovation. And one particular when I call out is hyperscalers, but because as you know, the data is explosive. And then the hyperscalers, they are really trying to scale their infrastructure in terms of network, storage, and the workloads have changed and moved towards more in the domain-specific, application specific application. So there's a lot of different processors required and that drives a lot of innovation, a lot of design activity. And that's feeding very well with our Cadence ISD intelligent system design strategy that besides the silicon, beside the IP, you move up into the system innovation that tie in very well to underattentionabout this whole system modeling, system analysis and packaging and all this is going to be a lot of new requirements. And that's why we are very well positioned to capture this opportunity, and it's a double-digit growth opportunity for us."

So we've been careful with the guide. 
But now having seen the strength in Q2, I think one of the sales guys told me that Q2 was the best Q4 we've ever had, and they were really impressed with the strength of bookings that were coming through, but I think we feel much more confident in the region.

And there is a lot of design activity, which continues to accelerate, especially at advanced node where we do particularly well. So we see a lot of design activity at increasing at N5 and N3 and some early work with foundries at N2. So I think the whole trend of people moving to more advanced nodes is continuing at a strong pace. And I think that helps us in our digital business. 
And also, we are getting more full flow adoption, not just placing out the full flow mean synthesis, place and we would signoff. So customers are more and more comfortable running our entire flow. And that's, again, a trend that we have worked on for a while to give a full integrated flow to our digital customers. 
And then there are other trends like 3D-IC becoming more travel and, of course, mixed signal, we are always strong in mixed signal. So overall, we are confident in our digital position.

But I would like to remind you that in Q2 2020, we did back out some revenue for expected bad debt. But that -- and some of that we later recovered in Q4.

But there are also some onetime things that kind of distort the margin picture in the second half. As part of our succession planning efforts, we did a voluntary early severance program at the same time as the promotion round and there will be some temporary overlap in expense in the second half as the impending retirees transition to the -- their roles to their replacements. So we kind of double up on expense for 6 months there, and that's a temporary phenomenon. There's also the purchase accounting treatment of the acquisitions we had in the first half with [indiscernible] and Point Wise, they cause our second half margins to be lower than they would otherwise be. And yes, we're planning to do a lot of hiring in the second half, and I've embedded that into the guidance. But my team and I will review all of that and make sure it's absolutely necessary. So there could be some upside to that margin outlook following our review. 
As I mentioned earlier, the quarterly numbers can be a little bit distorted during the pandemic. It's better to look at the annual view. And I think when I look at the annual guide, 36% to 36.75%, that's closer to the margin levels at which the business is currently performing."

So there's just a little bit of lumpiness. But overall, the trends are strong, the whole outsourcing trend for IP continues as you would expect. And there is more and more design activity, more foundry activity. So we are pleased with where we are in the IP business and make sure we have the right kind of star IP to serve the customers."

And over the last few years, we've seen consistently accelerating revenue growth year-over-year when you look at the 3-year CAGR, and we're on track again for that for this year to improve on last year. But -- so generally, I think with all of our accounts, we keep providing greater value to our customers, they're buying more products. It's a virtuous cycle, so to speak. I think a few years ago, we often talked about we released 20  significant new products in the previous 3 years. We've launched 8 new products in the last 6 months.

That is another part. So I think those 5 areas are going to be driving a lot of new applications and new solution needed -- So a lot of innovation needed. And so in some way, our IST strategy really playing very well from the silicon all the way to the system and how to provide some of this solution especially in the workload has changed a lot. And so not just the CPO computing, and there's a lot of new domain-specific application driving the solution. and that creates a lot of new design. So that's why we don't see any slowdown in design. In the contrary, actually, we see a lot of increase in design activity and that gave me a lot of hope going forward."

So we do have solutions, which are being optimized for gate dollar, and we are happy with the progress there. 
And like I said earlier, we're also starting work on N2. So I think this is good for the industry. 3 should be a very, very strong note and also N2 after that or the 2-nanometer node after that. And one key thing is that 3-nanometer, what we noticed is that it's good news for for EDA and Cadence, the role of tools and methodologies becomes even more critical than, let's say, 6, 7 or 5-nanometer because there is a little bit of slowing of pure performance scaling from Moore's Law. I mean Moore's Law is still giving a lot of area scaling or a number of transistors keep going up, but the performance you get from each transistor is not as much as before. So then there is more demand for Cadence tools and EDA solutions and IT solutions to deliver that that performance. So I think the role of EDA will become more and more critical at lower nodes and then combined with other advances like Cerebras and machine learning. So overall, we are pretty pleased with our position at these advanced nodes. And I think it is overall good news for the industry."

Cadence delivered outstanding financial results for the second quarter as broad-based customer demand for our innovative solutions drove stronger-than-expected revenue growth, profitability and cash flow. We are significantly raising our financial outlook for the year, highlighted by a $14 million increase in revenue guidance or 10% year-over-year revenue growth. John will provide the details in a moment for both our Q2 results and the updated outlook for the year.
Before I get into more details for the quarter -- about the quarter, I would like to talk about CEO transition news that we announced earlier this afternoon. We announced Anirudh Devgan, our President, will take over as CEO on December 15, 2021, and I will transition to the role of Executive Chairman at that time. It has been a privilege to serve as the CEO of Cadence for the past 12-plus years. Over that period, I'm very pleased that we instilled a sustainable culture center on leapfrog innovation and customer delight, forged very close partnership with our customers and partners and built an extremely talented Cadence team of over 9,000 employees.
Cadence is now firmly established, not just as a top end-to-end EDA provider of choice, but a company that is well on its way and expanding beyond EDA by executing our exciting ISD strategy that triples our TAM to 30 billion. The Board and I are very excited that Anirudh will become CEO in December, and we cannot think of anyone more uniquely qualified to lead Cadence to even higher heights. He's a proven leader with both strategy vision, a relentless focus on innovation and execution, and passion for driving customer success.
Over the past 4 years, since he became President, Anirudh and I have jointly led the company, and the Board and I think this is the right time to execute the next phase of our succession plan and hand over the baton to him. You can expect to see a lot of continuity going forward. As we view this transition as more of a formalization of our current responsibilities.
As Executive Chairman, I will focus more on new market opportunities, key strategic initiatives and deepening our relationship with customers and partners and on maximizing shareholder value. And now let me move on to the business highlights.
Generation trends, such as 5G, hyperscaler and autonomous vehicles underpinned by AI, machine learning and data analytics are accelerating a digital transformation across multiple industries. With semiconductors at its foundation, these trends are driving strong design activity across a growing spectrum of semi and system companies, and we are very well positioned for this to be a sustainable long-term growth driver for us.
Delighting customers and accelerating growth requires a relentless commitment to innovation. With the launch of the 4 new products, we have now introduced 8 significant innovative products so far this year across all the business groups, and will contribute to future growth. We continue to expand our business with market-shaping customers and our differentiated solution that to a broad-based expansion of our partnership with Samsung, including proliferation of our digital full flow.
It was an outstanding quarter for our digital and signoff business, with revenue growing 16% year-over-year. Our digital full flow delivering industry-leading quality of results at the most advanced nodes, adding 13 new customers that included key competitive displacements while expanding significantly at several market-shaping customers. Noteworthy, among them, were a large U.S. data infrastructure company, further expansion of a marquee U.S. aerospace and defense firm, a major Asia Pacific hyperscaler and an exciting AI start-up.
We have been steadily incorporating cutting-edge AIML technology into our solutions. And we significantly advanced that with last week's introduction of new Cerebrus Intelligent Chip Explorer. Cerebrus' unique reinforcement learning model increase effectiveness with each use and enables to 20% PPA improvement and 10x productivity gain. Cerebrus was endorsed by Samsung and Renesas, and several customers have realized meaningful benefits across multiple process nodes and end applications.
It was also a great quarter for our verification business, with 23% year-over-year revenue growth. Our verification suite comprising of best-in-class engines and delivering the best verification throughput saw continued strong customer adoption and expansion at several leading customers. Circular demand for our hardware continued unabated, leading to best Q2-ever for our Palladium and Protium platforms.
There is a robust customer interest in the new Z2 and X2 system, with sales ramping nicely while sales of Z1 and X1 remained strong. Our hardware family had 15 new orders and over 65 repeat orders in the quarter, with the 3 largest transactions being with hyperscalers and included our largest Protium transaction to date, which was for new X2.
Strong momentum continue for our system design and analysis segment, with 20% year-over-year revenue growth. We expanded our system footprint with multiple verticals, including aerospace and defense, 5G wireless and communications. Growing system complexity for high-frequency applications is driving the need for an integrated platform solution across system design, simulation and analysis. As we continue building our system portfolio, we are pleased to see earlier indication of customers increasingly choosing a broader set of our solutions across this domain.
For instance, in Q2, a large U.S. data infrastructure company, made a significant commitment to our PCB, IC packaging, RF and system analysis solutions. We introduced our next-generation PCB and IC packaging design platform, Allegro X, that provides a unified engineering platform incorporating innovative machine-learning techniques and delivering up to 4x improvement in overall design team productivity.
AWR and Integrand had a record quarter, and the integration of our recent NUMECA and Pointwise acquisitions are progressing well. We have added several hundred system customers as we enhance our go-to-market and channel organization to help accelerate our business.
Next, I want to make a few macro-level comments. We continue to monitor the ongoing semiconductor supply chain situation. As I reported last quarter, so far, we are not seeing any slowdown in design activity across our customer base. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 dynamic continues to evolve in our unpredictable manner -- in an unpredictable manner, with overall progress being threatened by new variants. As always, the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners is paramount, and we will continue doing what is in their best interest while working closely with local regulatory agencies. Now I will turn it over to Anirudh to say a few words."

This is a great day for Cadence.
Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we exceeded all of our key financial metrics for the quarter, with broad-based demand for our innovative solutions driving stronger-than-expected revenue growth, profitability and cash flow. As a result, we are raising our financial outlook for the year across all key metrics.
Before getting into the numbers, I'd like to say a particular thank you to our India team. As we all know, India was particularly hard-hit by the pandemic in Q2, and we are deeply grateful to our India leaders for going above and beyond the call of Judy to put people first. We commend them for their heroic work in helping the local relief efforts, and it's reassuring to see the situation in India improve over the past few weeks.
Now let's go through the key results for the second quarter, beginning with the P&L. Total revenue was $728 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 39.5%. GAAP EPS was $0.56, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.86.
Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, cash totaling $847 million, while the principal -- cash totaled $847 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow for Q2 was $380 million. DSOs were 49 days. And during Q2, we repurchased $220 million of Cadence shares.
Before I provide our updated outlook for fiscal 2021, I'd like to take a moment to share the assumptions embedded in our outlook. We continue to expect that our NUMECA and Pointwise acquisitions will be slightly dilutive this year before becoming accretive next year. Our hiring plans in the first half were delayed by the COVID situation in India, but our outlook currently assumes we catch up on much of that delayed hiring activity in the second half.
Our outlook for the second half includes the cost of salary and promotion increases for the broad employee base. Those salary increases and promotions were generally affected from July 1. And finally, our outlook assumes there will be no changes to the export limitations that exist today. Embedding these assumptions into our outlook for fiscal 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $2.925 billion to $2.965 billion; non-GAAP operating margin in the range of to 36% to 36.75%. GAAP EPS in the range of $2.15 to $2.21. Non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.14 to $3.20. Operating cash flow in the range of $925 million to $975 million. And we expect to use at least 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares in 2021.
For Q3 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $730 million to $750 million, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 34%. GAAP EPS in the range of $0.48 to $0.50, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.74 to $0.76. Our CFO commentary, which is available on our website, includes our outlook for additional items as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.
In conclusion, Cadence delivered another quarter of strong revenue growth and expanding profitability, and we're pleased to raise our outlook for the year. I would like to close by thanking our customers, partners and our hard-working employees for all that they do, and I'd like to remind them all that their health and safety continues to be our first priority.

With regard to last week's product announcement of Cerebrus, the application of AIML to EDA, it would seem fair to say that perhaps the most significant methodological advance in EDA since the days that synthesis, place and route 20 years or so ago.
The question I have for you, is Cerebrus extensible to your nondigital businesses such as custom and PCB and your new computational software ambitions and similarly, to the extent that there's a growing design trend towards specialty or domain-specific designs because Cerebrus have to be tuned to an increasingly specialty chip market?
And then for Lip-Bu, the follow-up is, in your keynote last month at Cadence sight, you listed all your market opportunities such as 5G, IoT and so forth. Interestingly, you referred to hyperscaler market as ""the most exciting"". Could you explain why you said that? And was that just circumstantial to Q2? Or is that an ongoing view of world?"

I believe Cerebrus is a fundamental breakthrough using reinforcement learning to basically drive our digital full flow. So I mean Genus, Innovus, Tempus can give great quality of results, but the design are still, run them, and based on their intuition run them again and you do the design that way. And Cerebrus can do that much more -- in a much more mathematical way to explore the design options and parameters.
And we announced that last week, as you said, and some of the results or some of the endorsement, for example, Samsung said they got 8% power improvement, and this could be done in days versus months. And Renesas said that they've got 10% improvement in frequency. So these are definitely very promising results. I mean it's still early. We are continuing to work with more and more customers. But so far, we are happy with how well Cerebrus is performing.
And these are based on fundamental kind of new optimization methods. And one thing I would like to remind you is that we have a lot of expertise in computational software, and a lot of it can be applied to AI. So it's still early days, and I think these can be definitely applied to other areas. So for example, we also announced Allegro X a couple of months ago, and that also has new machine learning technology to try and more automate place and route for PCB. So I think it's still early days, but we are very pleased by what Cerebrus can do and the application of AIML in general to EDA and to simulation and system design."

And because I think clearly, this PI generation are driving a lot of innovation. And one particular one I call out is hyperscalers, because, as you know, data is explosive. And then the hyperscalers, they are really trying to scale their infrastructure in terms of network, storage, and the workloads have changed and moved towards more in the domain-specific, application-specific application.
So there's a lot of different processors required, and that drives a lot of innovation, a lot of design activity. And that's feeding very well with our Cadence ISD, Intelligent System Design, strategy that besides the silicon, besides the IP, the move up into the system innovation that tie in very well that Anirudh mentioned about this whole system modeling, system analysis and RF packaging, and all of this is going to be a lot of new requirements.

In relation to RPOs, I think that's what you're referring to, RPOs bounced back a little bit. But as you recall, Q1 was a light renewal quarter for software, Q2 was a heavier renewal quarter for software, but the annual value of those contracts in Q2 jumped and that allowed us to raise our guidance for revenue for the year.

But now having seen the strength in Q2, I think one of the sales guys told me that Q2 was the best Q4 we've ever had, and that they were really impressed with the strength of bookings that were coming through, but I think we feel much more confident in the region. And there's broad-based strength across all the bookings activity in Q2. So yes, I think that the year is probably going to be more like Q2 than Q1."

So I think the whole trend of people moving to more advanced nodes is continuing at a strong pace. And I think that helps us in our digital business.
And also, we are getting more full flow adoption, not just place and route, the full flow means synthesis, place and route, signoff. So customers are more and more comfortable running our entire flow. And that's, again, a trend that we have worked on for a while to give a full integrated flow to our digital customers.
And then there are other trends like 3D-IC becoming more prevalent and, of course, mixed signal, we are always strong in mixed signal. So overall, we are confident in our digital position.

I would advise anyone not to look at any 1 quarter, but maybe focus on the year's numbers. But because the quarter -- since the pandemic started, the quarters can be distorted. I mean digital was great growth this quarter over last Q2 2020, but I would like to remind you that in Q2 2020, we did back out some revenue for expected bad debt.

So we kind of double up on expense for 6 months there, and that's a temporary phenomenon.
There's also the purchase accounting treatment of the acquisitions we had in the first half with NUMECA and Pointwise, they cause our second half margins to be lower than they would otherwise be. And yes, we're planning to do a lot of hiring in the second half, and I've embedded that into the guidance. But my team and I will review all of that and make sure it's absolutely necessary.

As I mentioned earlier, the quarterly numbers can be a little bit distorted during the pandemic. It's better to look at the annual view. And I think when I look at the annual guide, 36% to 36.75%, that's closer to the margin levels at which the business is currently performing."

That's -- so generally, I think with all of our accounts, we keep providing greater value to our customers, they're buying more products. It's a virtuous cycle, so to speak. I think a few years ago, we often talked about we released 20  significant new products in the previous 3 years. We've launched 8 new products in the last 6 months.

So I think those 5 areas are going to be driving a lot of new applications and new solutions needed. So a lot of innovation needed. And so in some way, our ISD strategy is really playing very well from the silicon all the way to the system and how to provide some of this solution, especially in the workload has changed a lot. And so not just the CPO computing, and there's a lot of new domain-specific application driving the solution. and that creates a lot of new design. So that's why we don't see any slowdown in design.

So we do have solutions, which are being optimized for gate-all-around, and we are happy with the progress there. 
And like I said earlier, we're also starting work on N2. So I think this is good for the industry. 3 should be a very, very strong note and also N2 after that or the 2-nanometer node after that. And one key thing is that 3-nanometer, what we noticed is that it's good news for EDA and Cadence. The role of tools and methodologies becomes even more critical than, let's say, 7- or 5-nanometer because there is a little bit of slowing of pure performance scaling from Moore's Law.
I mean Moore's Law is still giving a lot of area scaling or a number of transistors keep going up, but the performance you get from each transistor is not as much as before. So then there is more demand for Cadence tools and EDA solutions and IT solutions to deliver that performance. So I think the role of EDA will become more and more critical at lower nodes and then combined with other advances like Cerebrus and machine learning. So overall, we are pretty pleased with our position at these advanced nodes. And I think it is overall good news for the industry."

Our intelligent system design strategy leverages our strong computational software expertise as we expand beyond EDA into new markets. And we are uniquely positioned to capture the exciting opportunity that Lip-Bu talked about. As we execute to our strategy, we are especially pleased to see our EDA, IP and system solutions be increasingly adopted by a growing number of system companies. 
For instance, Tesla utilized a broad set of Cadence EDA software solutions and hardware platforms to enable the successful delivery of their innovative Dojo system, delighting customers and accelerating growth requires a relentless commitment to innovation. This quarter, we launched the Integrity 3D-IC Platform, Tensilica AI Platform, Midas Safety Platform and the Helium Virtual and Hybrid Studio. We have now introduced 13 significant innovative products this year across all of our business groups, and these will be key drivers of our future growth. 
Let me share some of the business highlights, starting with digital and signoff, which had another strong quarter with 18% year-over-year revenue growth. Our digital full flow delivering industry's leading quality results at the most advanced nodes, continue to proliferate with market-shaping customers and was adopted by 13 new customers. We are very pleased with the growing momentum of our transformative Cadence Cerebrus Solution that incorporates unique reinforcement learning, AIML technology to deliver significant PPA, power performance and area, and productivity gains. 
In addition to Samsung and Renesas endorsement at the time of launch, several market-shaping customers have added Cadence Cerebrus to their production flows and are realizing great benefit. As an example, a global mobile semiconductor company used Cadence Cerebrus on their manually-tuned CPU design to reduce total power by almost 10% and improved timing by over 25% automatically in only 8 days. Additionally, Cadence Cerberus enabled a marquee mobile system company to reduce the power consumption of their 4-nanometer design by over 25% and get over 10x improvement in productivity. We continued growing our business with hyperscaler customers, including a broad expansion of our EDA software with a marquee hyperscaler that included a significant commitment to our digital products. 
Next, I will talk about our verification business, which had a strong quarter with 13% year-over-year revenue growth. Growing system design complexity and need to get first-time right silicon continues to drive strong demand for our verification suite, which provides a comprehensive solution across IP, SoC and system verification, hardware, software regressions and early software development. This momentum is especially noticeable in our hardware business, where customers are deploying a significant additional capacity as they reap the performance, quality and productivity benefits of our industry-leading hardware platform. 
Accelerating adoption of our new dynamic duo, the Palladium Z2 and Protium X2 led by hyperscaler and global marquee customers drove the majority of hardware orders in this quarter. In verification software, Xcelium ML, our machine learning optimized logic simulator, delivered up to 5x faster regression, was adopted by marquee customers in North America and Asia. We launched the helium Virtual and Hybrid Studio, a new platform that accelerates the creation of hybrid and virtual prototypes of complex systems, enabling early software bring-up. Helium was endorsed by NVIDIA and several other engagements with leading customers are underway. We also announced the Midas Safety Platform, which is part of the comprehensive Cadence safety solution, featuring integrated digital and analog safety flows and engines for faster certification of safety critical automotive design. 
Moving on to system design and analysis, I'm particularly pleased that this segment, which is driving our market expansion beyond EDA, continues to deliver strong double-digit growth, increasing revenue by 17% year-over-year as we grow our footprint in several verticals, including aerospace and defense and 5G communications. With 5G and AIML applications pushing silicon vertical limits and transistor scaling is slowing down, there is an accelerated move to disaggregate SoC into a heterogeneous set of discrete dice that can be integrated together with sophisticated packaging technology. 
Leveraging over 2 decades of pioneering packaging expertise, we are very excited to have launched Integrity 3D-IC, the industry's first and only comprehensive platform that ties together our best-in-class system planning, implementation and thermal timing and power analysis technology, along with a multi-technology database, all in a unified cockpit. This third-generation 3D-IC solution enables designers to achieve system-driven PPA with reduced design complexity and faster time to market. And we are engaged with several leading semi and system houses, foundries and packaging companies. 
Our organically-developed system analysis products continue to make good headway. With Clarity, our electromagnetic 3D simulator, displacing the incumbent solution and becoming plan of record at a marquee hyperscaler. And Celsius, our electrothermal 3D simulator, was deployed at a global marquee system customer. Our recently acquired CFD solutions also delivered strong results, winning new business with several automotive and aerospace and defense customers. 
And now before I turn it over to John, I want to say a few words about the upcoming CEO transition on December 15. On behalf of the Cadence Board and our employees, I want to thank Lip-Bu for his outstanding leadership and his numerous illustrious accomplishments over the past 13 years. That has made a lasting impact on our industry and on Cadence. With his laser focus on creating a highly-innovative and result-based culture, he drove a cultural transformation at Cadence that was rooted in customer and shareholder success, leading to a trusted partnership with leading customers and delivering shareholder return of over 3,500%. 
I'm especially grateful to Lip-Bu for his mentorship and guidance and look forward to continuing our partnership in our new roles. As along with our talented team, we relentlessly drive to deliver strong business results and delight our customer and shareholders. 
Now I will turn it over to John to go through the Q3 results and present our Q4 and updated 2021 outlook."

I've also heard it said that legacy is not something you do for yourself, but it's something you leave for the benefit of the next generation. And on behalf of all Cadence stakeholders, I'd like to thank you both for conducting such a smooth CEO transition. We haven't missed a beat. Focused execution by the entire Cadence team, combined with broad-based strength across our product portfolio and customer base, drove another strong quarter of top and bottom line results. We exceeded our expectations for all key financial metrics, and we are raising our financial outlook for the year. 
Now let's go through the key results for the third quarter, beginning with the P&L. Total revenue was $751 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 35.7%, GAAP EPS was $0.63 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.80. For the balance sheet and cash flow, cash totaled $1.014 billion at quarter end, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow was $296 million. DSOs were 40 days, and we repurchased $110 million of Cadence shares during the quarter. 
Next, let's turn to our updated outlook. Our outlook continues to assume that there will be no changes to the export limitations that exist today. For fiscal 2021, we now expect revenue in the range of $2.96 billion to $2.98 in billion; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 37%; GAAP EPS in the range of $2.36 to $2.40; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.24 to $3.28; and operating cash flow in the range of $975 million to $1.025 billion. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $745 million to $765 million; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 35%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.49 to $0.53; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.76 to $0.80; and we expect to repurchase $110 million of Cadence stock in Q4. Our CFO commentary, which is available on our website, includes our outlook for additional items as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
In closing, I am pleased that revenue growth continues to accelerate with our 3-year revenue CAGR now approximately 11.5% at the midpoint of guidance.

So the road to the future goes through 3D-IC for multiple reasons, which I mean putting multiple chips on a package, ability to make technology ability to do bigger and bigger systems. And I do believe that Cadence is uniquely positioned for that. And it affects multiple technology. 
Now some of it is because of our history. So we have had a leading platform in packaging for a while with Allegro and a leading platform in analog with Virtuoso for a while. And then over the last 5 years, we have done very well in digital. And then if you remember, over the last 2, 3 years, we have done a lot of investment in system analysis, like Clarity and Celsius are also critical for 3D-IC, given that thermal is a big challenge when you put these things together. So I believe Cadence is uniquely positioned. And with Integrity, we put this all together. And it's not just Integrity draws into the other parts of Cadence like I mentioned. 
And then as a comparison, as we work with customers and leading foundries to do something similar in other products, it's not even one company can, you need 3 or 4 companies to do the same thing, whereas if you come to Cadence, we have a comprehensive solution across multiple segments. So I think as 3D-IC takes more momentum going forward, I believe we are well positioned."

And then to answer your question in terms of automotive by cycle, yes, you're absolutely correct. It's a multi-year increment. And then lately because of more and more electronics in the automotive, so we see a lot of design activity like autonomous driving. And I think Anirudh mentioned about the Tesla in terms of driving the AI chips, and using our broad-based Cadence tool, that's one good example and many more coming.

So first question Anirudh, at the Cadence Live Europe Conference a week or so ago, Cadence said in one of your presentations that Allegro had recently undergone a ""major overhaul,"" which we certainly saw with Allegro X. 
The question is what's next in terms of anything you might be working on for an additional major overhaul? We do see this periodically in EDA. For example, Synopsis a few years ago, significantly ramped up its internal investments in synthesis, and they launched their new version of DC. And I'm wondering based on what seems to be your internal investment patterns, if you're undergoing a rejuvenation or reinvestment cycle, for your synthesis or what else you might be able to talk about in terms of any major overhauls? 
Secondly, with regard to the ingredients you need to succeed with the computational software strategy, there was an interesting announcement 2 weeks ago of a relationship between Synopsys and Dassault.

I mean the reason for doing also Protium X2 with having the same front end as Palladium is to expand our reach to more and more software build up. And if you -- this quarter, when we launched Helium, it's for the same reason. So not only we can run RTL, but with Helium, we can run hybrid models, higher-level models with RTL, all this is for softer bring-up. And historically, I think Cadence has done well in RTL breakout with Palladium, but not as well. The market is growing more in the software bring-up. And now we are doing pretty well with Palladium -- with the combination of Palladium and Protium and Helium for software bring-up. 
So I think in terms of the market, of course, it's difficult to quantify, but at a high level, I think the market opportunity is maybe 1.5 to 2x larger once you combine the software and the hardware bring-up together. Of course, it takes several years to fully realize all this. But I think the market opportunity for Cadence with Protium, Palladium and Helium is much expanded because of the software in the car."

Cadence delivered strong financial results for the third quarter driven by accelerating customer demand for our innovative solutions and continued strong execution by the team. 
Driven by the broad-based strength of our business, we are raising our financial outlook for the third time this year and are expecting about 11% revenue growth and 37% non-GAAP operating margin for 2021. John will provide the details in a moment of both our Q3 results and the updated outlook for the year. 
The data-driven era is being fueled by generation trends, by 5G, hyperscale computing, autonomous driving and industrial IoT, that are accelerating the digital transformation of several industries. This requires continued innovation in key areas such as compute, connectivity, storage and data analysis which is, in turn, driving secular semiconductor growth and design activity across a wide range of end markets. 
Before I ask Anirudh go through the business and further highlights for the quarter, I would like to remind you that I will be transitioning to the role of Executive Chairman on December 15, with Anirudh becoming our President and CEO at that time. It has truly been an honor leading Cadence for the past 13 years. I'm very proud of the team's accomplishments and grateful for the confidence and trust that our customers and shareholders have placed in us. Cadence is extremely well positioned. And as I hand the baton over to Anirudh, I can't think of no other better to lead the company to the next phase of growth. And I'm eagerly looking forward to him taking Cadence to new heights. While I will remain engaged with shareholders, this will be my last earnings call. Thank you very much for your continued support.

Our Intelligent System Design strategy leverages our strong computational software expertise as we expand beyond EDA into new markets. And we are uniquely positioned to capture the exciting opportunity that Lip-Bu talked about. 
As we execute to our strategy, we are especially pleased to see our EDA, IP and system solutions be increasingly adopted by a growing number of system companies. For instance, Tesla utilized a broad set of Cadence EDA software solutions and hardware platforms to enable the successful delivery of their innovative Dojo system. 
Delighting customers and accelerating growth requires a relentless commitment to innovation. This quarter, we launched the Integrity 3D-IC Platform, Tensilica AI Platform, Midas Safety Platform and the Helium Virtual and Hybrid Studio. We have now introduced 13 significant innovative products this year across all of our business groups, and these will be key drivers of our future growth. 
Let me share some of the business highlights, starting with Digital and Signoff, which had another strong quarter with 18% year-over-year revenue growth. Our digital full flow, delivering industry's leading quality results at the most advanced nodes, continue to proliferate with market-shaping customers and was adopted by 13 new customers. We are very pleased with the growing momentum of our transformative Cadence Cerebrus solution that incorporates unique reinforcement learning, AIML technology to deliver significant PPA, power performance and area, and productivity gains. 
In addition to Samsung and Renesas endorsement at the time of launch, several market-shaping customers have added Cadence Cerebrus to their production flows and are realizing great benefits. As an example, a global mobile semiconductor company used Cadence Cerebrus on their manually-tuned CPU design to reduce total power by almost 10% and improved timing by over 25% automatically in only 8 days. Additionally, Cadence Cerebrus enabled a marquee mobile system company to reduce the power consumption of their 4-nanometer design by over 25% and get over 10x improvement in productivity. 
We continued growing our business with hyperscaler customers, including a broad expansion of our EDA software with a marquee hyperscaler that included a significant commitment to our digital products. 
Next, I will talk about our verification business, which had a strong quarter with 13% year-over-year revenue growth. Growing system design complexity and need to get first-time right silicon continues to drive strong demand for our verification suite, which provides a comprehensive solution across IP, SoC and system verification, hardware/software regressions and early software development. This momentum is especially noticeable in our hardware business where customers are deploying a significant additional capacity as they reap the performance, quality and productivity benefits of our industry-leading hardware platform. 
Accelerating adoption of our new dynamic duo, the Palladium Z2 and Protium X2, led by hyperscaler and global marquee customers drove the majority of hardware orders in this quarter. In verification software, Xcelium ML, our machine learning optimized logic simulator, delivered up to 5x faster regression, was adopted by marquee customers in North America and Asia. We launched the Helium Virtual and Hybrid Studio, a new platform that accelerates the creation of hybrid and virtual prototypes of complex systems, enabling early software bring-up. Helium was endorsed by NVIDIA, and several other engagements with leading customers are underway. We also announced the Midas Safety Platform, which is part of the comprehensive Cadence safety solution, featuring integrated digital and analog safety flows and engines for faster certification of safety critical automotive design. 
Moving on to System Design and Analysis. I'm particularly pleased that this segment, which is driving our market expansion beyond EDA, continues to deliver strong double-digit growth, increasing revenue by 17% year-over-year as we grow our footprint in several verticals, including aerospace and defense and 5G communications. With 5G and AIML applications pushing silicon vertical limits and transistor scaling is slowing down, there is an accelerated move to disaggregate SoC into a heterogeneous set of discrete dies that can be integrated together with sophisticated packaging technology. 
Leveraging over 2 decades of pioneering packaging expertise, we are very excited to have launched Integrity 3D-IC, the industry's first and only comprehensive platform that ties together our best-in-class system planning, implementation and thermal timing and power analysis technology, along with a multi-technology database, all in a unified cockpit. This third-generation 3D-IC solution enables designers to achieve system-driven PPA with reduced design complexity and faster time to market. And we are engaged with several leading semi and system houses, foundries and packaging companies. 
Our organically-developed system analysis products continued to make good headway. With Clarity, our electromagnetic 3D simulator displacing the incumbent solution and becoming plan of record at a marquee hyperscaler. And Celsius, our electrothermal 3D simulator, was deployed at a global marquee system customer. Our recently acquired CFD solutions also delivered strong results, winning new business with several automotive and aerospace and defense customers. 
And now before I turn it over to John, I want to say a few words about the upcoming CEO transition on December 15. On behalf of the Cadence Board and our employees, I want to thank Lip-Bu for his outstanding leadership and his numerous illustrious accomplishments over the past 13 years that has made a lasting impact on our industry and on Cadence. With his laser focus on creating a highly innovative and results-based culture, he drove a cultural transformation at Cadence that was rooted in customer and shareholder success, leading to trusted partnerships with leading customers and delivering shareholder return of over 3,500%. I'm especially grateful to Lip-Bu for his mentorship and guidance and look forward to continuing our partnership in our new roles as, along with our talented team, we relentlessly drive to deliver strong business results and delight our customer and shareholders. 
Now I will turn it over to John to go through the Q3 results and present our Q4 and updated 2021 outlook."

Your impact on Cadence has been significant and will last for many, many years to come. It's been a truly remarkable run over the past 13 years, and I feel blessed to have had the chance to work so closely with you. I've also heard it said that legacy is not something you do for yourself, but it's something you leave for the benefit of the next generation. And on behalf of all Cadence stakeholders, I'd like to thank you both for conducting such a smooth CEO transition. We haven't missed a beat. 
Focused execution by the entire Cadence team, combined with broad-based strength across our product portfolio and customer base, drove another strong quarter of top and bottom line results. We exceeded our expectations for all key financial metrics, and we are raising our financial outlook for the year. 
Now let's go through the key results for the third quarter, beginning with the P&L. Total revenue was $751 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 35.7%, GAAP EPS was $0.63 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.80. For the balance sheet and cash flow, cash totaled $1.014 billion at quarter end, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow was $296 million. DSOs were 40 days, and we repurchased $110 million of Cadence shares during the quarter. 
Next, let's turn to our updated outlook. Our outlook continues to assume that there will be no changes to the export limitations that exist today. For fiscal 2021, we now expect revenue in the range of $2.96 billion to $2.98 in billion, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 37%, GAAP EPS in the range of $2.36 to $2.40, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.24 to $3.28 and operating cash flow in the range of $975 million to $1.025 billion. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $745 million to $765 million, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 35%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.49 to $0.53, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.76 to $0.80 and we expect to repurchase $110 million of Cadence stock in Q4. 
Our CFO commentary, which is available on our website, includes our outlook for additional items as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
In closing, I am pleased that revenue growth continues to accelerate with our 3-year revenue CAGR now approximately 11.5% at the midpoint of guidance. We are expecting approximately $1 billion of operating cash flow for 2021 at the midpoint, and we are on track to deliver over 50% incremental operating margin for the year. 
As always, I want to thank our customers, partners and of course, our employees for their continued support. 
And with that, operator, we will now take questions."

So the road to the future goes through 3D-IC for multiple reasons, which I mean putting multiple chips on a package, the ability to make technology, ability to do bigger and bigger systems. And I do believe that Cadence is uniquely positioned for that. And it affects multiple technology. 
Now some of it is because of our history. So we have had a leading platform in packaging for a while with Allegro and a leading platform in analog with Virtuoso for a while. And then over the last 5 years, we have done very well in digital. And then if you remember, over the last 2, 3 years, we have done a lot of investment in system analysis. Like Clarity and Celsius are also critical for 3D-IC given that thermal is a big challenge when you put these things together. So I believe Cadence is uniquely positioned. And with Integrity, we put this all together. And it's not just Integrity, it draws into the other parts of Cadence, like I mentioned. 
And then as a comparison, as we work with customers and leading foundries, to do something similar in other products, it's not even one company, you need 3 or 4 companies to do the same thing. Whereas if you come to Cadence, we have a comprehensive solution across multiple segments. So I think as 3D-IC takes more momentum going forward, I believe we are well positioned."

So if we went back like a few years ago, the engagement would start with Innovus, and that was the leading kind of product that we would do well in. But now I think overall market has accepted our full flow, and we see more and more signs of that. So that includes synthesis and signoff along with Innovus. And that is becoming more the norm than anything else. 
So to answer your question, not only Innovus does well, but now synthesis and signoff, which is Genus and Tempus and Voltus. We are pretty happy with the proliferation. And I think that trend is here to stay."

But first, on a personal note, Lip-Bu, it's been a pleasure working with you for the last 13 years and certainly look forward to continuing the dialogue with Anirudh. 
So first question, Anirudh, at the Cadence Live Europe Conference a week or so ago, Cadence said, in one of your presentations, that Allegro had recently undergone a ""major overhaul,"" which we certainly saw with Allegro X. The question is what's next in terms of anything you might be working on for an additional major overhaul? We do see this periodically in EDA. For example, Synopsys a few years ago significantly ramped up its internal investments in synthesis, and they launched their new version of DC. And I'm wondering, based on what seems to be your internal investment patterns, if you're undergoing a rejuvenation or reinvestment cycle for your synthesis or what else you might be able to talk about in terms of any major overhauls.
Secondly, with regard to the ingredients you need to succeed with the computational software strategy, there was an interesting announcement 2 weeks ago of a relationship between Synopsys and Dassault. And I'm wondering if you see you're having to partner more for both technical and channel expansion reasons to succeed in computational software."

I think in terms of new kind of -- you said new products or revamp of existing products, so we are continuously looking at that all the time. We want to make sure all our products are doing well. As you can see this year, we have launched 13 new products. Several of them are improvement of existing products like Allegro X or Sigrity X. So I think this is a continuous process. As you know, we have a very high investment in R&D compared to our peers. So we are constantly looking at that, and you will see more things come out, of course, as we go forward. 
On the second one, we are confident in our computational software strategy. That's delivering good results. I think we have a lot of organic ability to innovate, which we demonstrated with Clarity and Celsius. And at the same time, we are definitely looking at new partnerships that make sense, like you said, both on the product side and on the go-to-market side. So I think we will talk about them when they're ready. But Cadence always has a culture of partnering. We partner, for example, with MATLAB. That was a great partnership at the system level. We partnered with National Instruments when we bought AWR from them. We have a partnership with Green Hills. So we are always looking for win-win partnerships, and that continues to be the case going forward."

We thought IP would have a soft middle to the year and it would recover toward the end of the year, it started recovering a bit earlier.

And on the software side, all lines of business are performing really, really well. 
And like you say, if you look over our contract cycle, over a 3-year a CAGR basis, we're continuing to see accelerated revenue growth. So on the operating leverage side, we're delighted with the operating margin performance. Second half of the year includes some double-up on expenses. We did an early retirement program.

And the same then on the hardware side, we're happy with our supply chain, and you see inventory growing a little bit.

I mean the reason for doing also Protium X2 with having the same front end as Palladium is to expand our reach to more and more software build-up.

All this is for software bring-up. And historically, I think Cadence has done well in RTL bring-up with Palladium, but not as well. The market is growing more in the software bring-up. And now we are doing pretty well with the combination of Palladium and Protium and Helium for software bring-up. 
So I think in terms of the market, of course, it's difficult to quantify. But at a high level, I think the market opportunity is maybe 1.5 to 2x larger once you combine the software and the hardware bring-up together. Of course, it takes several years to fully realize all this. But I think the market opportunity for Cadence with Protium, Palladium and Helium is much expanded because of the software."

And John, I know we've got to wait another 90 days before you give us a full outlook for calendar year '22. But it's impressive that you guys have seen this acceleration over the last 2 years in the midst of sort of a global pandemic. And if you look at Street consensus numbers for next year, they've got growth that goes back to that high-single digits. And yet you talked earlier about demand outstripping supply. Just wondering if you think these double-digit CAGRs are sort of here to stay. And if so, to what extent is this sort of the fruits of your labor and some of your SAM expansion efforts versus some of the dynamics on the core business?"

But yes, I think the nature of our revenue model is such that I wouldn't expect any dramatic changes in our 3-year revenue CAGRs because 85% to 90% of the revenue is recurring in nature. So I mean when we calculate 3-year CAGRs, by the end of '22, we'll be including '20 and '21 in that. So you're not going to -- you shouldn't really have a dramatic change. And I think if you have a look at the CFO commentary, you'll see the kind of step function that we've seen over the last few years. It's been slowly accelerating, but it's pleasing to see that it continues to accelerate. And that we're just up over 11.5% now, so running up to 12% this year. So yes, very pleased with the way the business is going. 
Again, we will refrain from talking anymore about '22. We need another 90 days just to get through Q4 for that. But yes, very, very pleased with the way it's going. And because of the recurring revenue nature of so much of our business, I wouldn't expect the 3-year CAGR to change pretty much."

Some are more interposer-based, which is a more digital technology. But all in all, Cadence is the most unique platform. We have leadership in packaging with Allegro, with analog in Virtuoso, with digital in Innovus and all the analysis tools with Clarity and Celsius. And they're all integrated and best-of-class solutions, okay? So we are pretty confident of our position and the response we are getting. 
And to your question with TSMC, TSMC is a great partner of Cadence. And we are working with them on a variety of things, including Integrity 3D-IC. And actually, to give you an example, one of the leading mobile customers did a 3D-IC solution with us and TSMC. And one of the key things there was the thermal profile, and they use Celsius to do silicon validation that Celsius is accurate for, for 3D-IC temperature simulation. So I think 3D-IC is going to be big, and it requires multiple products and multiple implementation flows, and we are pretty confident in our position."

John will provide the details in a moment for both our Q3 results and the updated outlook for the year. 
The data-driven era is being fueled by generation trends, by 5G, hyperscale computing, autonomous driving and industrial IoT, that are accelerating the digital transformation of several industries. This requires continued innovation in key areas such as compute, connectivity, storage and data analysis which is, in turn, driving secular semiconductor growth and design activity across a wide range of end markets. 
Before I ask Anirudh to go through the business and product highlights for the quarter, I would like to remind you that I will be transitioning to the role of Executive Chairman on December 15, with Anirudh becoming our President and CEO at that time.

Our Intelligent System Design strategy leverages our strong computational software expertise as we expand beyond EDA into new markets. And we are uniquely positioned to capture the exciting opportunity that Lip-Bu talked about. 
As we execute to our strategy, we are especially pleased to see our EDA, IP and system solutions be increasingly adopted by a growing number of system companies. For instance, Tesla utilized a broad set of Cadence EDA software solutions and hardware platforms to enable the successful delivery of their innovative Dojo system. 
Delighting customers and accelerating growth requires a relentless commitment to innovation. This quarter, we launched the Integrity 3D-IC Platform, Tensilica AI Platform, Midas Safety Platform and the Helium Virtual and Hybrid Studio. We have now introduced 13 significant innovative products this year across all of our business groups, and these will be key drivers of our future growth. 
Let me share some of the business highlights, starting with Digital and Signoff, which had another strong quarter with 18% year-over-year revenue growth. Our digital full flow, delivering industry's leading quality of results at the most advanced nodes, continue to proliferate with market-shaping customers and was adopted by 13 new customers. We are very pleased with the growing momentum of our transformative Cadence Cerebrus solution that incorporates unique reinforcement learning, AI/ML technology to deliver significant PPA, power performance and area, and productivity gains. 
In addition to Samsung and Renesas endorsement at the time of launch, several market-shaping customers have added Cadence Cerebrus to their production flows and are realizing great benefits. As an example, a global mobile semiconductor company used Cadence Cerebrus on their manually-tuned CPU design to reduce total power by almost 10% and improve timing by over 25% automatically in only 8 days. Additionally, Cadence Cerebrus enabled a marquee mobile system company to reduce the power consumption of their 4-nanometer design by over 25% and get over 10x improvement in productivity. 
We continued growing our business with hyperscaler customers, including a broad expansion of our EDA software with a marquee hyperscaler that included a significant commitment to our digital products. 
Next, I will talk about our verification business, which had a strong quarter with 13% year-over-year revenue growth. Growing system design complexity and need to get first-time right silicon continues to drive strong demand for our verification suite, which provides a comprehensive solution across IP, SoC and system verification, hardware/software regressions and early software development. This momentum is especially noticeable in our hardware business where customers are deploying a significant additional capacity as they reap the performance, quality and productivity benefits of our industry-leading hardware platform. 
Accelerating adoption of our new dynamic duo, the Palladium Z2 and Protium X2, led by hyperscaler and global marquee customers drove the majority of hardware orders in this quarter. In verification software, Xcelium ML, our machine learning optimized logic simulator, delivered up to 5x faster regression, was adopted by marquee customers in North America and Asia. We launched the Helium Virtual and Hybrid Studio, a new platform that accelerates the creation of hybrid and virtual prototypes of complex systems, enabling early software bring-up. Helium was endorsed by NVIDIA, and several other engagements with leading customers are underway. We also announced the Midas Safety Platform, which is part of the comprehensive Cadence safety solution, featuring integrated digital and analog safety flows and engines for faster certification of safety critical automotive design. 
Moving on to System Design and Analysis. I'm particularly pleased that this segment, which is driving our market expansion beyond EDA, continues to deliver strong double-digit growth, increasing revenue by 17% year-over-year as we grow our footprint in several verticals, including aerospace and defense and 5G communications. With 5G and AI/ML applications pushing silicon reticle limits and transistor scaling slowing down, there is an accelerated move to disaggregate SoC into a heterogeneous set of discrete dies that can be integrated together with sophisticated packaging technology. 
Leveraging over 2 decades of pioneering packaging expertise, we are very excited to have launched Integrity 3D-IC, the industry's first and only comprehensive platform that ties together our best-in-class system planning, implementation and thermal timing and power analysis technology, along with a multi-technology database, all in a unified cockpit. This third-generation 3D-IC solution enables designers to achieve system-driven PPA with reduced design complexity and faster time to market. And we are engaged with several leading semi and system houses, foundries and packaging companies. 
Our organically-developed system analysis products continued to make good headway. With Clarity, our electromagnetic 3D simulator displacing the incumbent solution and becoming plan of record at a marquee hyperscaler. And Celsius, our electrothermal 3D simulator, was deployed at a global marquee system customer. Our recently acquired CFD solutions also delivered strong results, winning new business with several automotive and aerospace and defense customers. 
And now before I turn it over to John, I want to say a few words about the upcoming CEO transition on December 15. On behalf of the Cadence Board and our employees, I want to thank Lip-Bu for his outstanding leadership and his numerous illustrious accomplishments over the past 13 years that have made a lasting impact on our industry and on Cadence. With his laser focus on creating a highly innovative and results-based culture, he drove a cultural transformation at Cadence that was rooted in customer and shareholder success, leading to trusted partnerships with leading customers and delivering shareholder return of over 3,500%. I'm especially grateful to Lip-Bu for his mentorship and guidance and look forward to continuing our partnership in our new roles as, along with our talented team, we relentlessly drive to deliver strong business results and delight our customer and shareholders.

Your impact on Cadence has been significant and will last for many, many years to come. It's been a truly remarkable run over the past 13 years, and I feel blessed to have had the chance to work so closely with you. I've also heard it said that legacy is not something you do for yourself, but it's something you leave for the benefit of the next generation. And on behalf of all Cadence stakeholders, I'd like to thank you both for conducting such a smooth CEO transition. We haven't missed a beat. 
Focused execution by the entire Cadence team, combined with broad-based strength across our product portfolio and customer base, drove another strong quarter of top and bottom line results. We exceeded our expectations for all key financial metrics, and we are raising our financial outlook for the year. 
Now let's go through the key results for the third quarter, beginning with the P&L. Total revenue was $751 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 35.7%, GAAP EPS was $0.63 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.80. For the balance sheet and cash flow, cash totaled $1.014 billion at quarter end, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow was $296 million. DSOs were 40 days, and we repurchased $110 million of Cadence shares during the quarter. 
Next, let's turn to our updated outlook. Our outlook continues to assume that there will be no changes to the export limitations that exist today. For fiscal 2021, we now expect revenue in the range of $2.96 billion to $2.98 in billion, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 37%, GAAP EPS in the range of $2.36 to $2.40, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.24 to $3.28 and operating cash flow in the range of $975 million to $1.025 billion. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $745 million to $765 million, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 35%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.49 to $0.53, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.76 to $0.80 and we expect to repurchase $110 million of Cadence stock in Q4. 
Our CFO commentary, which is available on our website, includes our outlook for additional items as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
In closing, I am pleased that revenue growth continues to accelerate with our 3-year revenue CAGR now approximately 11.5% at the midpoint of guidance. We are expecting approximately $1 billion of operating cash flow for 2021 at the midpoint, and we are on track to deliver over 50% incremental operating margin for the year. 
As always, I want to thank our customers, partners and of course, our employees for their continued support. 
And with that, operator, we will now take questions."

This is Anirudh. So we believe that 3D-IC is the future, right? So the road to the future goes through 3D-IC for multiple reasons, which I mean putting multiple chips on a package, the ability to mix technology, ability to do bigger and bigger systems. And I do believe that Cadence is uniquely positioned for that. And it affects multiple technology. 
Now some of it is because of our history. So we have had a leading platform in packaging for a while with Allegro and a leading platform in analog with Virtuoso for a while. And then over the last 5 years, we have done very well in digital. And then if you remember, over the last 2, 3 years, we have done a lot of investment in system analysis. Like Clarity and Celsius are also critical for 3D-IC given that thermal is a big challenge when you put these things together. So I believe Cadence is uniquely positioned. And with Integrity, we put this all together. And it's not just Integrity, it draws into the other parts of Cadence, like I mentioned. 
And then as a comparison, as we work with customers and leading foundries, to do something similar in other products, it's not even one company, you need 3 or 4 companies to do the same thing. Whereas if you come to Cadence, we have a comprehensive solution across multiple segments. So I think as 3D-IC takes more momentum going forward, I believe we are well positioned."

And I mentioned earlier, the generations drivers have been really driving a lot of increase in the design activity. 
And then to answer your question in terms of automotive design cycle, yes, you're absolutely correct. It's a multiple-year increment. And then lately because of more and more electronics in the automotive, so we see a lot of design activity like autonomous driving. And I think Anirudh mentioned about Tesla in terms of driving their AI chips and using our broad-based Cadence tool. That's one good example and many more coming. And so I think clearly, we're excited about the automotive platform that will create opportunity in the multiyears to come."

But first, on a personal note, Lip-Bu, it's been a pleasure working with you for the last 13 years and certainly look forward to continuing the dialogue with Anirudh. 
So first question, Anirudh, at the Cadence Live Europe Conference a week or so ago, Cadence said, in one of your presentations, that Allegro had recently undergone a ""major overhaul,"" which we certainly saw with Allegro X. The question is what's next in terms of anything you might be working on for an additional major overhaul? We do see this periodically in EDA. For example, Synopsys a few years ago significantly ramped up its internal investments in synthesis, and they launched their new version of DC. And I'm wondering, based on what seems to be your internal investment patterns, if you're undergoing a rejuvenation or reinvestment cycle for your synthesis or what else you might be able to talk about in terms of any major overhauls.
Secondly, with regard to the ingredients you need to succeed with the computational software strategy, there was an interesting announcement 2 weeks ago of a relationship between Synopsys and Dassault. And I'm wondering if you see you're having to partner more for both technical and channel expansion reasons to succeed in computational software."

On the second one, we are confident in our computational software strategy. That's delivering good results. I think we have a lot of organic ability to innovate, which we demonstrated with Clarity and Celsius. And at the same time, we are definitely looking at new partnerships that make sense, like you said, both on the product side and on the go-to-market side. So I think we will talk about them when they're ready. But Cadence always has a culture of partnering. We partner, for example, with MATLAB. That was a great partnership at the system level.

Is there a way to kind of quantify that from your perspective in order to kind of understand the magnitude of the impact, that kind of demand is there but were kind of limited by the supply side?"

Like I say, the majority of our revenue comes from part of the design cycle. The chip capacity constraints that you're referring to has really impact the production side of the cycle. And that's where it touches us in terms of royalty revenue. I think last year, royalty revenue for Cadence was around $50 million. But this year, it will be slightly lower than $50 million, but we expect that to recover again next year. Yes, so the impact is pretty small. 
And the same then on the hardware side, we're happy with our supply chain, and you see inventory growing a little bit. We talked a couple of years ago about moving from just in time to just in case in terms of our inventory management. So we carry a lot of inventory. So I think we're well protected, certainly for the next few quarters, on the supply chain side. But yes, we're very happy with where we're positioned right now."

I mean the reason for doing also Protium X2 with having the same front end as Palladium is to expand our reach to more and more software build-up. And this quarter, when we launched Helium, it's for the same reason. So not only we can run RTL, but with Helium, we can run hybrid models, higher-level models with RTL. All this is for software bring-up. And historically, I think Cadence has done well in RTL bring-up with Palladium, but not as well. The market is growing more in the software bring-up. And now we are doing pretty well with the combination of Palladium and Protium and Helium for software bring-up. 
So I think in terms of the market, of course, it's difficult to quantify. But at a high level, I think the market opportunity is maybe 1.5 to 2x larger once you combine the software and the hardware bring-up together. Of course, it takes several years to fully realize all this. But I think the market opportunity for Cadence with Protium, Palladium and Helium is much expanded because of the software."

And of course, anyone we hired in the second half of Q3, we'll have a full quarter of their expense in Q4 where you didn't have a full quarter of expense in Q3. So there's slight uptick to that. And then secondly, I expect a little bit more on commission cost because we expect bookings to be stronger in Q4 because I would anticipate that we will finish the year with a stronger RPO than we started the year. So expect a good bookings quarter in Q4, which will add a little bit of commissions expense. And then also, we have slightly higher T&E embedded in the forecast."

I feel very good about the continuing operating leverage that, sorry, I don't think there's any near-term ceiling on operating leverage.

I feel very good about the continuing operating leverage that, sorry, I don't think there's any near-term ceiling on operating leverage. I mean you'll see that we're up to 37% now, but it's the fifth year in a row that we've delivered more than 50% incremental margins. So every dollar of revenue growth from 2017 until now, we're dropping through more than $0.50 of that revenue growth through to operating income. So as long as we're delivering incremental margins of over 50%, that operating leverage should continue to rise."
