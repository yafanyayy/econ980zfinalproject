As we all know, 2020 was a very trying year, and I could not be more proud of the unwavering commitment of our team to serve our customers, communities and each other during this unprecedented time. It has been truly remarkable. When I assumed the role of Chairman in January, the fundamentals of the economy were strong, and I was looking forward to working with our executive team to execute our relationship banking strategy. 
Then in March, our focus shifted due to COVID. Despite the many challenges the pandemic posed, we have proven our resilience and achieved many important accomplishments along the way. This includes the bank and the Comerica Charitable Foundation together providing $11 million in assistance to local communities and businesses. We funded $3.9 billion in PPP loans to small and medium-sized companies. 
We were able to quickly enable the majority of our employees to work remotely and introduce programs to provide support, such as promise paid dependent care stipends. As consumers' desire to utilize digital channels increased, we enhanced our online capabilities for deposit accounts as well as loan originations. Also, we achieved our 2020 environmental goals set in 2012 to meaningfully reduce our water, waste, paper and GHG emissions. 
Our commitment to corporate responsibility was recognized, including receiving high marks from Newsweek, Diversity Inc., Civic 50, CDP and Corporate Nights. The compassion and tireless efforts of our colleagues across the bank has allowed Comerica to persevere and remain in a strong position as we move forward. 
Slide 4 provides a review of our 2020 financial results, which included solid loan performance and a record level of deposits. This growth, combined with prudent management of loan-to-deposit pricing, an action we took to deploy excess liquidity, helped offset the pressure of rates dropping to ultra-low levels. In light of the swift deterioration in the economy, we significantly increased our credit reserve and took a large provision in the first quarter. 
While we saw some negative credit migration through the year, it has been manageable, and our net charge-offs for the year were 38 basis points or 14 basis points, excluding Energy, a true testament to our relationship banking strategy and deep credit experience. Card fees and securities trading income were strong, while other fees, such as deposit service charges and commercial lending fees, were impacted by the slowdown in economic activity. 
Expenses remained well controlled and included COVID-related costs. We maintained our strong capital levels, and book value grew 7% to over $55 per share. In summary, a solid performance, particularly considering the difficult environment. Our fourth quarter performance is outlined on Slide 5. We generated earnings of $215 million or $1.49 per share, a 3% increase over the third quarter, driven by an increase in revenue and strong credit quality. Compared to the third quarter, loans essentially performed as we expected. 
While lower on a quarter-over-quarter basis, average loans increased in December rather to November by nearly $300 million, excluding PPP loan repayments. Our loan pipeline continued to grow through the year to pre-COVID levels at year-end. Average deposits increased by nearly $1.5 billion to an all-time high, with 55% of the growth derived from noninterest-bearing accounts. 
Customers continue to prudently manage their cash, cutting costs and reducing leverage. Yet they remain cautiously optimistic that the economy will pick up in the back half of this year. Net interest income increased $11 million, benefiting from our continued careful management of loan-to-deposit pricing, combined with the contribution from fees related to PPP loan forgiveness. This was partly offset by lower loan balances. In addition, lower yields on our securities portfolio were mostly offset by actions we took in the third quarter to deploy a portion of excess liquidity by increasing the size of the portfolio. As far as credit, our metrics remained strong, and our provision was a credit of $17 million. 
Criticized loans declined, and net charge-offs were only 22 basis points. Positive portfolio migration and a slight improvement in the economic forecasts, resulting in a reduction of the credit reserve to just under $1 billion or nearly 3x nonperforming assets. Through the cycles, our credit performance relative to the industry has been a key differentiator, and I believe we will continue to outperform. 
Noninterest income increased $13 million or 5%, as customer activity continued to rebound. This included strong derivative income and commercial lending fees. We continue to maintain our expense discipline as we invest for the future. While expenses were higher in the fourth quarter, this was primarily driven by performance incentives as well as outside process related to our card platform. 
Our capital levels remained strong. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.35%, above our target of 10%. And as always, our priority is to use our capital to support our customers and drive growth while providing an attractive return to our shareholders. And now I will turn the call over to Jim."

Average loans decreased approximately $600 million or 1%, which compared favorably to the industry HA data. Loans in Corporate Banking and general Middle Market decreased as customers are performing well, prudently managing their business to increase cash flow and reduce debt. For the fourth consecutive quarter, Energy loans decreased and are at the lowest level since 2011. 
The U.S. rig count is less than half of what it was a year ago. However, it has been gradually increasing since late summer, as oil prices began to recover. Technology and Life Sciences loans declined about $180 million, mainly due to M&A and increased liquidity, driven by fundraising activity and company's reducing cash burn. Equity Fund Services, which provides capital call lines to investment companies, increased $244 million as activity has picked up with new fund formation. 
National Dealer increased $190 million as inventory levels are rebuilding, yet remains $2 billion below fourth quarter 2019. Mortgage Banker reached a new record with strong activity in both refi and home sales. Period-end loans were stable and included a decline in PPP balances of $298 million, primarily due to loan forgiveness. Line utilization at year-end for the total portfolio remained relatively low at 48%. 
Loan yields increased 7 basis points with accelerated fees from PPP forgiveness and continued pricing actions, particularly adding LIBOR floors when possible as loans renew. Average deposits increased 2% or $1.5 billion to a new record of $70.2 billion, as shown on Slide 7. The largest driver continues to be noninterest-bearing deposits and growth has been broad-based with increases in nearly every business line. 
Customers continue to conserve and maintain excess cash balances. Period-end deposits increased over $4.4 billion. Timing of monthly benefit activity in our government prepaid card business increased balances by $2.2 billion at quarter end. However, this does not include the latest stimulus payments which were received in early January. With strong deposit growth, our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 72%. 
The average cost of interest-bearing deposits reached an all-time low of 11 basis points, a decrease of 6 basis points from the third quarter, and our total funding costs fell to only 10 basis points. As you since Slide 8, the average balance of the securities portfolio increased. This was due to the third quarter purchase of $2.25 billion in additional securities, primarily treasuries, as we took some action to put some of our excess liquidity to work. 
The additional securities, combined with lower rates on the replacement of prepays, which totaled about $1 billion, resulted in the yield on the portfolio declining to 1.95%. We expect repayments of MBS to continue to be about $1 billion per quarter and yields on reinvestments to be in the low-to-mid 100 basis point range. 
Turning to Slide 9. Net interest income increased to 11 million dollars 469 million, and the net interest margin was up 3 basis points to 2.36%. Interest income on loans increased $6 million, adding 4 basis points to the margin. Higher fees, mostly related to PPP loan forgiveness and continued pricing actions as loans renew, together added $10 million and 4 basis points to the margin. Other portfolio dynamics, including higher nonaccrual income added $1 million. The decrease in loans had a $5 million unfavorable impact. 
Lower securities yields had a $6 million or 3 basis point negative impact. This was mostly offset by the higher balance, which added $5 million. Average balances of the Fed increased over $500 million, impacting the margin by 1 basis point. Our extraordinarily high Fed balances of $13 billion continue to weigh heavily on the margin with a gross impact of approximately 43 basis points. Finally, prudent management of deposit pricing added $5 million and 3 basis points to the margin and lower rates on wholesale funding added $1 million. 
Given the nature of our portfolio, our loans were priced very quickly as rates dropped earlier last year. So the bulk of the impact from lower rates has been absorbed. Also, while deposit rates are at record lows, we continue to manage deposit pricing with a close eye on the competitive environment and our liquidity position. Overall, credit quality was strong, as shown on Slide 10. Gross charge-offs were only $39 million, a decrease of $14 million from the third quarter. Net charge-offs were $29 million or 22 basis points. 
Nonperforming assets increased $24 million, yet remained below our historical norm at 69 basis points of total loans. Inflows to nonaccrual were about half of the amount of the third quarter and the lowest level of any quarter since the pandemic began. Criticized loans declined $459 million and comprised 6% of the total portfolio. We believe our discipline in underwriting and a diverse portfolio are assisting us in managing through the pandemic issues. Positive migration in the portfolio, combined with a modestly improved economic outlook, resulted in a small decrease in our allowance for credit losses. 
As the path to full economic recovery remains uncertain due to the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, our reserve ratio remains elevated at 1.9% or 2.03%, excluding PPP loans. We are well positioned with a relatively high credit reserve and overall improving credit quality. Slide 11 provides detail on segments that we believe pose higher risk in the current environment. Period-end loans in the social distancing segment declined slightly. Criticized loans were stable, and nonaccruals remain under 1%. This segment has performed better than expected, but issues can be lumpy and and resulted in a net charge-off of $21 million in the fourth quarter. 
The new round of PPP will certainly be helpful for customers that are challenged by the current environment. Energy loans decreased 13% to $1.6 billion at quarter end, representing 3% of our total loans. Oil prices have increased, and credit quality has improved with reductions in criticized, nonaccruals and net charge-offs. We have seen a little more capital markets activity and a redeterminations resulted in only a slight decrease in borrowing basis due to lower reserves. Additional information can be found in the appendix. 
While we are pleased with the performance of these segments, we have applied a more severe economic forecast to them and believe we are well reserved. Noninterest income increased $13 million, as outlined on Slide 12, continuing the positive trend we've seen since post the shutdown of the economy earlier last year. Fourth quarter includes increased customer activity in most categories. Customer derivative income increased $8 million with higher volume due to interest rate swaps and Energy hedges, combined with the change in the impact from the credit valuation adjustment. Specifically, there was an unfavorable adjustment of $6 million in the third quarter and a favorable adjustment of less than $1 million in the fourth quarter. 
Commercial lending fees increased $5 million with a seasonal pickup in syndication activity and higher unutilized line fees. We had smaller increases in fiduciary, foreign exchange and letters of credit. Also, card fees remained very strong due to government card and merchant activity spurred by the economic stimulus and changes in customer behavior related to the COVID environment. 
Securities trading income, which includes fair market adjustments for investments we hold related to our Technology and Life Sciences business, decreased $5 million from elevated levels generated over the last couple of quarters. Note, deferred comp asset returns were $9 million, a $1 million increase from the third quarter and are offset in noninterest expenses.  All in all, a strong quarter for fee income. 
Turning to expenses on Slide 13. Salaries and benefits increased $14 million with higher performance-based incentives, severance, staff insurance expense and technology-related labor. Note that on a full year basis, salary and benefit expense was stable, with a reduction in incentive compensation, offsetting annual merit, higher deferred comp and COVID-related costs. We realized a $7 million increase in outside processing due to card activity, technology spend as well as PPP program costs. 
Occupancy increased $2 million due to a catch-up in maintenance projects that were delayed due to COVID as well as seasonal expenses. There is also a seasonal increase in advertising expense. Our strong expense discipline is and is assisting us in navigating this low rate environment as we invest for the future. Our capital levels remained strong, as shown on Slide 14. Our CET1 ratio increased to an estimated 10.35%, above our target of 10%. As always, our priority is to use our capital to support our customers and drive growth while providing an attractive return to our shareholders. 
In this regard, we've maintained a very competitive dividend yield. As far as share repurchases, we have a long track record of actively managing our capital and returning excess capital generated to shareholders. As we sit here today, a great deal of uncertainty remains about the ultimate pace of the economic recovery, whether it be faster or slower than economists forecast. 
For that reason, we have positive share repurchases and look forward to restarting the program as soon as we deem it prudent to do so. Slide 15 provides our outlook for the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter as well as some color on the year ahead. In the first quarter, we expect National Dealer loans to continue to increase at a moderate pace as auto inventory rebuilds. Also, Middle Market is expected to grow as a result of increased economic activity. However, this will be more than offset by Mortgage Banker coming from its record high due to seasonally lower purchase and refi volumes. 
Energy is expected to decrease due to higher oil prices, driving improved cash flow and capital markets activity. As far as PPP loans, we expect the pace of loan forgiveness could potentially exceed the second round of fundings. Looking past the first quarter, excluding PPP loan activity and based on improving economic conditions, we expect loans to grow throughout the year. We expect average deposits to remain strong in the first quarter as customers continue to carefully manage their liquidity. 
As far as net interest income, continued management of loan and deposit pricing is expected to be accretive, albeit to a lesser degree than we've seen so far. We are currently in the process of deploying some excess liquidity by repaying $2.8 billion of FHLB advances over an 8-week period, which will provide a modest lift. These benefits are expected to be more than offset by reduced loan balances, lower yields on securities, slightly lower LIBOR as well as 2 fewer days in the quarter. 
As we move through the year, assuming there's no change from rates that we experienced in the fourth quarter, we expect quarterly pressure on securities yields and swap maturities to be mostly offset by loan growth, excluding PPP impacts. We expect net charge-offs to increase from low levels we've seen recently. However, with our credit reserve at year-end at over 2% of loans, excluding PPP, we believe we are well positioned to manage through this period of economic uncertainty. 
We expect noninterest income in the first quarter to benefit from higher deposit service charges, fiduciary and brokerage fees. As deferred comp is difficult to predict, we assume it will not be repeated. We expect a seasonal decline in syndication activity. Also, card, warrants and securities trading income are expected to decline from elevated levels. As we progress through the year, we believe that customer fee categories, in general, should grow with improving economic conditions. We expect expenses to be lower in the first quarter. 
Our pension expense is expected to decline $9 million in the first quarter to get to the new run rate for 2021. The decline is primarily due to strong investment performance in 2020. And as I mentioned, we do not forecast deferred comp of $9 million to repeat. Also, marketing and occupancy expenses are expected to be seasonally lower and there are days in the quarter. Partly offsetting all of this, first quarter includes annual stock comp and associated higher payroll taxes. 
We remain focused on maintaining our expense discipline while we invest in the future. Therefore, on a full year basis, we expect higher salary expense related to normal merit and incentive comp as well as higher tech spend will be mostly offset by lower pension and deferred comp returns. We expect a 22% tax rate, excluding discrete items. 
Finally, as mentioned on the previous slide, we remain focused on maintaining our strong capital levels and providing an attractive return to shareholders. Now I'll turn the call back to Curt."

While difficult and uncertain conditions persist, I'm confident that our team will continue to adapt and thrive as we have over the past year. We expect the economy will improve in 2021. We believe firming trade and manufacturing conditions increasing business and consumer confidence as well as pent-up demand will support solid economic growth, particularly in the back half of the year. 
Comerica has a long history of successfully managing through challenging times. We have demonstrated our resiliency and unwavering dedication to provide a high level of customer service as we navigate the COVID pandemic. We maintain a culture that drives continuous efficiency improvement. We believe this will assist us in preserving our cost base as the economy improves, and we continue to invest in our future.

Utilizing our deep expertise and experience to help our customers navigate these difficult times, builds and solidifies long-term relationships. These key strengths provide the foundation to continue to deliver long-term shareholder value.

Thanks for the question. Regarding the severance that we had in the fourth quarter, I would say that, that was specifically targeted in certain areas just to restructure and make sure that we have the right staffing both to fit the skill sets that we need in certain areas and also as part of some of the transition we've had with new leaders. So it's really more optimizing our org structure as well as to an expense reduction play. 
Regarding just core expenses going forward, I'll just say that we clearly had some expenses in the fourth quarter that elevated our run rate. And I certainly would not look at the fourth quarter as an example of what the run rate will be going forward. As we look into the full year for 2021, as we mentioned in the opening remarks, I do expect that lower pension expense and deferred comp will mostly offset merit, tech spend and a little bit of a reset of stock comp given the COVID year that we had this year. So we'd expect expenses just to be slightly up on a year-to-year basis."

Assuming no material change to the credit profile, which based on all the factors that we see today, we're not expecting any material credit deterioration and that the macroeconomic outlook stays stable to slightly -- continuing to improve as we go throughout 2021. 
And probably most importantly that the current level of uncertainty has started to abate, i.e., we get past the next couple of months of this COVID resurgence, the vaccine rollout accelerates and the efficacy is proven out, reserve levels are definitely going to come down. It's impossible to tell you exactly how that's going to play out. As you know, CECL is a very complex accounting exercise that we go through each quarter.

So as I mentioned earlier, we will exclude that from the guidance. Overall, we will have more PPP income in 2021, certainly than we did in 2020. And and as we mentioned during the script, I do expect the impact from rates. Even though the yield curve has deepened, as you point out, we're still adding securities in that low 100 bp range, and so we are adding securities at a lower rate than what we are running off. 
And then on top of that, you'll notice in the appendix, we are going to have in the second half of the year some lumpy treasury maturities as well as some hedges that start to mature, not in a big way. But due to all those factors, we will see a little bit of rate pressure each quarter. And I do that -- I do see that mostly offsetting or perhaps a little more than offsetting the loan growth benefit that we get. 
Now PPP would be totally separate from that. And again, we will see some significant amounts of accelerated fee income as the year goes on, both due to round 1 as well as round 2. So hopefully, that helps make it a little bit more clear."

I might just talk a little bit about our sort of income-generating potential and just sort of our outlook from a growth perspective going forward. And your question was specifically about efficiency ratio, but I might first just comment that the last 2 quarters, we were able to generate double-digit ROE in what has been a pretty challenging environment. And we continue to feel really good about our long-term financial model and really our long-term financial outlook and our business model. 
And as always, we're focused on the things that we can control. We think we've got a very attractive franchise. We're in a lot of very high-growth markets that we do believe should perform better than the U.S. as a whole as we come out of the COVID situation and hit the second half of the year. So we do believe that we'll see higher customer demand, loan activity, et cetera. 
And as you know, we've got a lot of depth and expertise in Middle Market, Business Banking, a number of sort of unique businesses. And beyond just sort of the balance sheet growth opportunity, we continue to maintain a very attractive deposit base. And most financial institutions are flush with deposits right now. But we really feel like what we've got is very relationship-oriented deposits, and we've done a very good job of relationship pricing with those deposits. 
Credit continues to do very well. We think we will outperform relative to our peer group in that area, which we think we're newer to our overall financial performance. And then we're very focused on 2 other things I would mention is just income and how we can generate more fee income as an institution, especially in the card area, treasury management, wealth management. We've got strong capabilities there. We've been doing a lot to continue to invest in those areas. And we, again, think that will help in terms of our overall financial performance. And while expenses were up some for the quarter. 
We do feel like that's not necessarily run rate, but just some unique items that hit us in the fourth quarter, and our expense discipline is very ingrained in our culture, and we're always looking for opportunities to continue to manage tightly on the expense front. And then just maybe lastly, as I said in my formal comments, we've managed through lots of different cycles, and this is just another cycle that we're managing through. 
And as an institution, we have always struck a good balance between growth and conservative management of our balance sheet and credit. And we think that will help us manage through whatever happens in the next 3 or 4 months, but position us well longer term, given all the factors that I just outlined."

So overall, as you already sort of highlighted and Jim and Curt did in their opening comments, I mean, we're really pleased with the performance of the portfolio as a whole. And although these are at-risk industries, they have actually held up, I think, better than what we would have expected coming into this. The segment called social businessing specifically are those companies that are most directly impacted by any social mitigation. Actions that are taking place. So obviously, in the near term, given the current coronavirus surging, it's probably the portfolio that we are watching the closest and probably has the most opportunity for some additional migration. 
All of these 4 portfolios that are listed on Slide 11, although they have elevated credit metrics, we have not seen a high level of migration into the NPA category, which obviously NPAs would need to increase in order to see significantly increasing losses. The Energy portfolio, although it has the most stressed credit metrics, actually has stabilized quite nicely. And certainly, prices at $50 a barrel, supply demand dynamics have changed. And that portfolio, I would call, much more stabilized, even though it has elevated credit metrics. 
And certainly, charge-offs the last 2 quarters have shown that we may be through the worst of that. That can change really quickly with energy, obviously, given the commodity nature. So we are continuing to work with those borrowers. So overall, again, we feel pretty good about all these at-risk industries.

We've talked before about the fact that we've been on this path of migration to the cloud and are making good progress there. We also talked about the fact that while we don't necessarily have the same scale as many of our larger competitors. We can leverage both the good blend and proprietary capabilities with third parties and really achieve scale where needed if we don't necessarily have it in-house. And there are a number of things that we've got in-flight. Right now, we rolled out a new digital onboarding platform last year that will benefit really across all of our business lines in terms of originating new relationships. 
The mobile and web channels. We've brought out a new loan origination platform for our consumer bank. We've done a lot around just how we leverage data and push data to our employees in terms of customer information. We're making a number of enhancements to our treasury management platform. Then we've been going through some upgrades in our wealth management business line and new trust platform and a new wealth management portal sort of single sign-on portal for our wealth management clients. 
So I think we remain competitive. We feel good about our positioning. I think it's always important to remember that we are, first and foremost, primarily a commercial bank and relationships still really matter in that business. The intellectual capital we bring, the advice we bring, every deal we do is highly customized. It's not something that you push out over a sort of a digital channel. But we've got to have products and services that support the treasury side of the house, the Treasurer, the CFO, et cetera, in that space, and we believe we do. 
And then even in the other business lines, wealth management, even in our Retail bank, we tend to serve a more affluent client relationship is still really important there. Advice is still really important, but again, enabled through digital and mobile and other channels as well. And we feel like we're well positioned."

And so I suspect that would be part of the turn and frankly, a good indicator that loan direction is moving in that -- is moving up, while deposits are coming down. 
So regardless of the -- which of those necessarily occurs first, we still feel pretty encouraged that the second half of the year based on most of the macro indicators that we're seeing so far would lead us to believe that we're going to see a better second half of the year when it comes to loan growth. And -- but I don't think you're necessarily wrong or I wouldn't disagree with that idea that you would like to see deposits come down first, and I think those together would directionally be really good for loans."

That is something that we are going to have to examine on an ongoing basis. We have been and we are taking incremental steps to invest the excess liquidity, but we're being careful not to jump in all at once and place a big bet at any one time, given that we just don't know where things are headed. So as you look at where we've been and where we're going, certainly starting in late second quarter of '20, third quarter of '20, we did prepay a material amount of purchase funds. 
Midway through third quarter, of course, we bought the $2.25 billion of securities, which had a fourth quarter benefit also. Then, as I mentioned in the first quarter of this year, we're prepaying $2.8 billion of FHLB funding. So we are attempting to take steps that show some time of beat each quarter in terms of doing something with the excess liquidity, but we want to do it in a very measured way. We don't necessarily want to sit on the sidelines forever, but we don't want to jump in all at once either. 
And so you'll see us continue to evaluate this as time goes on and take incremental steps as the quarters go on. And then when there's more of a line of sight, we may take even a bigger step. But we do think caution is in order, but totally sitting in the sidelines, it doesn't make sense either. So the measured pace is kind of where we're managing ourselves to."

And one thing I continue to say about the pipeline is that it feels and the numbers look good, they look pre-COVID. What is less certain is just the timing of some of this. And so much of it right now is M&A, it's dividend recaps. It's not necessarily core requests that companies have for CapEx or things like that. 
So it's a little bit lumpy. But it does feel better than it did, certainly, 90 days ago. It's just still a little bit hard to determine when exactly all of that's going to happen. So hopefully, that gives you a little double-click down, Brian, as to what you were looking for."

So you're not going to drive down the Street and see to Comerica banking centers across the Street from each other. And so we've kind of eliminated any sort of redundancy in the platform and feel pretty good about the network we have overall. 
Having said that, just like all financial services firms, we have been selectively continuing to prune that portfolio. We've been changing the configuration in the banking centers. We've been leveraging technology more doing away with things like traditional teller lines, having more sort of universal bankers in the banking center that can handle all things for clients, whether it's a loan or deposit need or whatever advisory type capabilities we need to deliver. And that's allowed us to reduce headcount in the banking centers over time and reduce the FTEs and the banking centers. 
And so I do think that, that trend of just sort of continued to slowly decreasing the size of the number of banking centers will continue. But I don't think you should expect necessarily that we're going to announce some huge restructuring of our banking center banking center platform.

We do focus on efficiencies on an ongoing basis, and we do plan on leveraging technology both in terms of the IA to make departments more efficient as well as the distribution systems, whether that be in the commercial banking side with treasury management systems or the banking centers that you mentioned.

As we all know, 2020 was a very trying year, and I could not be more proud of the unwavering commitment of our team to serve our customers, communities and each other during this unprecedented time. It has been truly remarkable. 
When I assumed the role of Chairman in January, the fundamentals of the economy were strong, and I was looking forward to working with our executive team to execute our relationship banking strategy. Then in March, our focus shifted due to COVID. Despite the many challenges the pandemic posed, we have proven our resilience and achieved many important accomplishments along the way. This includes the bank and the Comerica Charitable Foundation together providing $11 million in assistance to local communities and businesses. We funded $3.9 billion in PPP loans to small and medium-sized companies.
We were able to quickly enable the majority of our employees to work remotely and introduce programs to provide support, such as Promise Pay and dependent care stipends. As consumers' desire to utilize digital channels increased, we enhanced our online capabilities for deposit accounts as well as loan originations. Also, we achieved our 2020 environmental goals set in 2012 to meaningfully reduce our water, waste, paper and GHG emissions. Our commitment to corporate responsibility was recognized, including receiving high marks from Newsweek, DiversityInc, Civic 50, CDP and Corporate Knights. The compassion and tireless efforts of our colleagues across the bank has allowed Comerica to persevere and remain in a strong position as we move forward.
Slide 4 provides a review of our 2020 financial results, which included solid loan performance and a record level of deposits. This growth, combined with prudent management of loan-to-deposit pricing, an action we took to deploy excess liquidity, helped offset the pressure of rates dropping to ultra-low levels. In light of the swift deterioration in the economy, we significantly increased our credit reserve and took a large provision in the first quarter. While we saw some negative credit migration through the year, it has been manageable, and our net charge-offs for the year were 38 basis points or 14 basis points, excluding Energy, a true testament to our relationship banking strategy and deep credit experience. 
Card fees and securities trading income were strong, while other fees, such as deposit service charges and commercial lending fees, were impacted by the slowdown in economic activity. Expenses remained well controlled and included COVID-related costs. We maintained our strong capital levels, and our book value grew 7% to over $55 per share. In summary, a solid performance, particularly considering the difficult environment. 
Our fourth quarter performance is outlined on Slide 5. We generated earnings of $215 million or $1.49 per share, a 3% increase over the third quarter, driven by an increase in revenue and strong credit quality. Compared to the third quarter, loans essentially performed as we expected. While lower on a quarter-over-quarter basis, average loans increased in December rather to November by nearly $300 million, excluding PPP loan repayments. Our loan pipeline continued to grow through the year to pre-COVID levels at year-end. Average deposits increased by nearly $1.5 billion to an all-time high, with 55% of the growth derived from noninterest-bearing accounts.
Customers continue to prudently manage their cash, cutting costs and reducing leverage. Yet they remain cautiously optimistic that the economy will pick up in the back half of this year. Net interest income increased $11 million, benefiting from our continued careful management of loan-to-deposit pricing, combined with the contribution from fees related to PPP loan forgiveness. This was partly offset by lower loan balances. In addition, lower yields on our securities portfolio were mostly offset by actions we took in the third quarter to deploy a portion of excess liquidity by increasing the size of the portfolio. 
As far as credit, our metrics remained strong, and our provision was a credit of $17 million. Criticized loans declined, and net charge-offs were only 22 basis points. Positive portfolio migration and a slight improvement in the economic forecasts resulted in a reduction of the credit reserve to just under $1 billion or nearly 3x nonperforming assets. Through the cycles, our credit performance relative to the industry has been a key differentiator, and I believe we will continue to outperform.
Noninterest income increased $13 million or 5%, as customer activity continued to rebound. This included strong derivative income and commercial lending fees. We continue to maintain our expense discipline as we invest for the future. While expenses were higher in the fourth quarter, this was primarily driven by performance incentives as well as outside process related to our card platform. Our capital levels remained strong. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.35%, above our target of 10%. As always, our priority is to use our capital to support our customers and drive growth, while providing an attractive return to our shareholders. 
And now, I will turn the call over to Jim."

Turning to Slide 6, average loans decreased approximately $600 million or 1%, which compared favorably to the industry HA data. Loans in Corporate Banking and General Middle Market decreased as customers are performing well, prudently managing their business to increase cash flow and reduce debt. For the fourth consecutive quarter, Energy loans decreased and are at the lowest level since 2011.
The U.S. rig count is less than half of what it was a year ago. However, it has been gradually increasing since late summer, as oil prices began to recover. Technology and Life Sciences loans declined about $180 million, mainly due to M&A and increased liquidity, driven by fundraising activity and company's reducing cash burn. Equity Fund Services, which provides capital call lines to investment companies, increased $244 million as activity has picked up with new fund formation. National Dealer increased $190 million as inventory levels are rebuilding, yet remains $2 billion below fourth quarter 2019. Mortgage Banker reached a new record with strong activity in both refi and home sales. 
Period-end loans were stable and included a decline in PPP balances of $298 million, primarily due to loan forgiveness. Line utilization at year-end for the total portfolio remained relatively low at 48%. Loan yields increased 7 basis points with accelerated fees from PPP forgiveness and continued pricing actions, particularly adding LIBOR floors when possible as loans renew. Average deposits increased 2% or $1.5 billion to a new record of $70.2 billion, as shown on Slide 7. The largest driver continues to be noninterest-bearing deposits and growth has been broad-based with increases in nearly every business line.
Customers continue to conserve and maintain excess cash balances. Period-end deposits increased over $4.4 billion. Timing of monthly benefit activity in our government prepaid card business increased balances by $2.2 billion at quarter end. However, this does not include the latest stimulus payments, which were received in early January. With strong deposit growth, our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 72%. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits reached an all-time low of 11 basis points, a decrease of 6 basis points from the third quarter, and our total funding costs fell to only 10 basis points. 
As you can see on Slide 8, the average balance of the securities portfolio increased. This was due to the third quarter purchase of $2.25 billion in additional securities, primarily treasuries, as we took some action to put some of our excess liquidity to work. The additional securities, combined with lower rates on the replacement of prepays, which totaled about $1 billion, resulted in the yield on the portfolio declining to 1.95%. We expect repayments of MBS to continue to be about $1 billion per quarter and yields on reinvestments to be in the low-to-mid 100 basis point range.
Turning to Slide 9. Net interest income increased $11 million to $469 million, and the net interest margin was up 3 basis points to 2.36%. Interest income on loans increased $6 million, adding 4 basis points to the margin. Higher fees, mostly related to PPP loan forgiveness and continued pricing actions as loans renew, together added $10 million and 4 basis points to the margin. Other portfolio dynamics, including higher nonaccrual income, added $1 million. The decrease in loans had a $5 million unfavorable impact.
Lower securities yields had a $6 million or 3 basis point negative impact. This was mostly offset by the higher balance, which added $5 million. Average balances of the Fed increased over $500 million, impacting the margin by 1 basis point. Our extraordinarily high Fed balances of $13 billion continue to weigh heavily on the margin with a gross impact of approximately 43 basis points. Finally, prudent management of deposit pricing added $5 million and 3 basis points to the margin and lower rates on wholesale funding added $1 million.
Given the nature of our portfolio, our loans were priced very quickly as rates dropped earlier last year. So the bulk of the impact from lower rates has been absorbed. Also, while deposit rates are at record lows, we continue to manage deposit pricing with a close eye on the competitive environment and our liquidity position. Overall, credit quality was strong, as shown on Slide 10. Gross charge-offs were only $39 million, a decrease of $14 million from the third quarter. Net charge-offs were $29 million or 22 basis points.
Nonperforming assets increased $24 million, yet remained below our historical norm at 69 basis points of total loans. Inflows to nonaccrual were about half of the amount of the third quarter and the lowest level of any quarter since the pandemic began. Criticized loans declined $459 million and comprised 6% of the total portfolio. We believe our disciplined underwriting and diverse portfolio are assisting us in managing through the pandemic conditions. Positive migration in the portfolio, combined with a modestly improved economic outlook, resulted in a small decrease in our allowance for credit losses.
As the path to full economic recovery remains uncertain due to the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, our reserve ratio remains elevated at 1.90% or 2.03%, excluding PPP loans. We are well positioned with a relatively high credit reserve and overall improving credit quality. Slide 11 provides detail on segments that we believe pose higher risk in the current environment. Period-end loans in the social distancing segment declined slightly. Criticized loans were stable, and nonaccruals remain under 1%. This segment has performed better than expected, but issues can be lumpy and sudden and resulted in a net charge-offs of $21 million in the fourth quarter.
The new round of PPP will certainly be helpful for customers that are challenged by the current environment. Energy loans decreased 13% to $1.6 billion at quarter end, representing 3% of our total loans. Oil prices have increased, and credit quality has improved with reductions in criticized, nonaccruals and net charge-offs. We have seen a little more capital markets activity and fall redeterminations resulted in only a slight decrease in borrowing basis due to lower reserves. Additional information can be found in the appendix. While we're pleased with the performance of these segments, we have applied a more severe economic forecast to them and believe we're well reserved. 
Noninterest income increased $13 million, as outlined on Slide 12, continuing the positive trend we've seen since post the shutdown of the economy earlier last year. Fourth quarter includes increased customer activity in most categories. Customer derivative income increased $8 million with higher volume due to interest rate swaps and energy hedges, combined with the change in the impact from the credit valuation adjustment. Specifically, there was an unfavorable adjustment of $6 million in the third quarter and a favorable adjustment of less than $1 million in the fourth quarter.
Commercial lending fees increased $5 million with a seasonal pickup in syndication activity and higher unutilized line fees. We had smaller increases in fiduciary, foreign exchange and letters of credit. Also, card fees remained very strong due to government card and merchant activity spurred by the economic stimulus and changes in customer behavior related to the COVID environment. Securities trading income, which includes fair market adjustments for investments we hold related to our Technology and Life Sciences business, decreased $5 million from elevated levels generated over the last couple of quarters. Note, deferred comp asset returns were $9 million, a $1 million increase from the third quarter and are offset in noninterest expenses. All in all, a strong quarter for fee income.  
Turning to expenses on Slide 13. Salaries and benefits increased $14 million, with higher performance-based incentives, severance, staff insurance expense and technology-related labor. Note that on a full year basis, salary and benefit expense was stable, with a reduction in incentive compensation, offsetting annual merit, higher deferred comp and COVID-related costs. We realized a $7 million increase in outside processing due to card activity, technology spend as well as PPP program costs.
Occupancy increased $2 million due to a catch-up in maintenance projects that were delayed due to COVID as well as seasonal expenses. There is also a seasonal increase in advertising expense. Our strong expense discipline is well ingrained and is assisting us in navigating this low rate environment as we invest for the future. Our capital levels remained strong, as shown on Slide 14. Our CET1 ratio increased to an estimated 10.35%, above our target of 10%. As always, our priority is to use our capital to support our customers and drive growth, while providing an attractive return to our shareholders. In this regard, we've maintained a very competitive dividend yield. 
As far as share repurchases, we have a long track record of actively managing our capital and returning excess capital generated to shareholders. As we sit here today, a great deal of uncertainty remains about the ultimate pace of the economic recovery, whether it'd be faster or slower than economists forecast. For that reason, we have paused our share repurchases and look forward to restarting the program as soon as we deem it prudent to do so. 
Slide 15 provides our outlook for the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter as well as some color on the year ahead. In the first quarter, we expect National Dealer loans to continue to increase at a moderate pace as auto inventory rebuilds. Also, Middle Market is expected to grow as a result of increased economic activity. However, this will be more than offset by Mortgage Banker declining from its record high due to seasonally lower purchase and refi volumes.
Energy is expected to decrease due to higher oil prices, driving improved cash flow and capital markets activity. As far as PPP loans, we expect the pace of loan forgiveness could potentially exceed the second round of fundings. Looking past the first quarter, excluding PPP loan activity and based on improving economic conditions, we expect loans to grow throughout the year. We expect average deposits to remain strong in the first quarter as customers continue to carefully manage their liquidity.
As far as net interest income, continued management of loan and deposit pricing is expected to be accretive, albeit to a lesser degree than we've seen so far. We are currently in the process of deploying some excess liquidity by repaying $2.8 billion of FHLB advances over an 8-week period, which will provide a modest lift. These benefits are expected to be more than offset by reduced loan balances, lower yields on securities, slightly lower LIBOR as well as 2 fewer days in the quarter.
As we move through the year, assuming there's no change from rates that we experienced in the fourth quarter, we expect quarterly pressure on securities yields and swap maturities to be mostly offset by loan growth, excluding PPP impacts. We expect net charge-offs to increase from low levels we've seen recently. However, with our credit reserve at year-end at over 2% of loans, excluding PPP, we believe we are well positioned to manage through this period of economic uncertainty.
We expect noninterest income in the first quarter to benefit from higher deposit service charges, fiduciary and brokerage fees. As deferred comp is difficult to predict, we assume it will not be repeated. We expect a seasonal decline in syndication activity. Also, card, warrants and securities trading income are expected to decline from elevated levels. As we progress through the year, we believe that customer-driven fee categories, in general, should grow with improving economic conditions. We expect expenses to be lower in the first quarter.
Our pension expense is expected to decline $9 million in the first quarter to get to the new run rate for 2021. The decline is primarily due to strong investment performance in 2020. As I mentioned, we do not forecast deferred comp of $9 million to repeat. Also, marketing and occupancy expenses are expected to be seasonally lower and there are 2 less days in the quarter. Partly offsetting all of this, first quarter includes annual stock comp and associated higher payroll taxes.
We remain focused on maintaining our expense discipline while we invest in the future. Therefore, on a full year basis, we expect higher salary expense related to normal merit and incentive comp as well as higher tech spend will be mostly offset by lower pension and deferred comp returns. We expect a 22% tax rate, excluding discrete items. Finally, as mentioned on the previous slide, we remain focused on maintaining our strong capital levels and providing an attractive return to shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Curt."

Regarding the severance that we had in the fourth quarter, I would say that, that was specifically targeted in certain areas just to restructure and make sure that we had the right staffing both to fit the skill sets that we need in certain areas and also as part of some of the transition we've had with new leaders. So it's really more optimizing our org structure as opposed to an expense reduction play.
Regarding just core expenses going forward, I'll just say that we clearly had some expenses in the fourth quarter that elevated our run rate. And I certainly would not look at the fourth quarter as an example of what the run rate will be going forward. As we look into the full year for 2021, as we mentioned in the opening remarks, I do expect that lower pension expense and deferred comp will mostly offset merit, tech spend and a little bit of a reset of stock comp given the COVID year that we had this year. So we'd expect expenses just to be slightly up on a year-to-year basis."

Assuming no material change to the credit profile, which, based on all the factors that we see today, we're not expecting any material credit deterioration and that the macroeconomic outlook stays stable to slightly -- continuing to improve as we go throughout 2021.
And probably most importantly that the current level of uncertainty has started to abate, i.e., we get past the next couple of months of this COVID resurgence the vaccine rollout accelerates and the efficacy is proven out. Reserve levels are definitely going to come down. It's impossible to tell you exactly how that's going to play out.

And I do that -- I do see that mostly offsetting or perhaps a little more than offsetting the loan growth benefit that we get. Now PPP would be totally separate from that.

In fact, the 1.95% you mentioned, right now, we're adding securities in the low 1s. And so it would take quite a bit of steep things to head off that  deterioration that we're seeing. And in addition, we are seeing some lumpy maturities with treasuries, as you see, again, in the appendix as well as swaps. And that has quite a delta between what we'd either reinvest those in or if they just fell to cash at the Fed. So it really would take a change in short-term rates to see any kind of material movement upward in our ongoing net interest income on a quarter-to-quarter basis."

I might just talk a little bit about our sort of income-generating potential and just sort of our outlook from a growth perspective going forward. And your question was specifically about efficiency ratio, but I might first just comment that the last 2 quarters, we were able to generate double-digit ROE in what has been a pretty challenging environment. And we continue to feel really good about our long-term financial model and really our long-term financial outlook and our business model. And as always, we're focused on the things that we can control. We think we've got a very attractive franchise. We're in a lot of very high-growth markets that we do believe should perform better than the U.S. as a whole as we come out of the COVID situation and hit the second half of the year. 
So we do believe that we'll see higher customer demand, loan activity, et cetera. And as you know, we've got a lot of depth and expertise in Middle Market, Business Banking, a number of sort of unique businesses. And beyond just sort of the balance sheet growth opportunity, we continue to maintain a very attractive deposit base. And most financial institutions are flush with deposits right now. But we really feel like what we've got is very relationship-oriented deposits, and we've done a very good job of relationship pricing with those deposits. 
Credit continues to do very well. We think we will outperform relative to our peer group in that area, which we think we're newer to our overall financial performance. And then we're very focused on 2 other things I would mention is just fee income and how we can generate more fee income as an institution, especially in the card area, treasury management, wealth management. We've got strong capabilities there. We've been doing a lot to continue to invest in those areas. And we, again, think that will help in terms of our overall financial performance. And while expenses were up some for the quarter, we do feel like that's not necessarily run rate, but just some unique items that hit us in the fourth quarter. 
And our expense discipline is very ingrained in our culture, and we're always looking for opportunities to continue to manage tightly on the expense front. And then just maybe lastly, as I said in my formal comments, we've managed through lots of different cycles, and this is just another cycle that we're managing through. And as an institution, we have always struck a good balance between growth and conservative management of our balance sheet and credit. And we think that will help us manage through whatever happens in the next 3 or 4 months, but position us well longer term, given all the factors that I just outlined."

So overall, as you already sort of highlighted and Jim and Curt did in their opening comments, I mean, we're really pleased with the performance of the portfolio as a whole. And although these are at-risk industries, they have actually held up, I think, better than what we would have expected coming into this. The segment called social distancing specifically are those companies that are most directly impacted by any social mitigation actions that are taking place. So obviously, in the near term, given the current coronavirus surging, it's probably the portfolio that we are watching the closest and probably has the most opportunity for some additional migration.
All of these 4 portfolios that are listed on Slide 11, although they have elevated credit metrics, we have not seen a high level of migration into the NPA category, which obviously NPAs would need to increase in order to see significantly increasing losses. The Energy portfolio, although it has the most stressed credit metrics, actually has stabilized quite nicely, certainly prices at $50 a barrel, supply-demand dynamics have changed. And that portfolio, I would call, much more stabilized, even though it has elevated credit metrics. 
And certainly, charge-offs the last 2 quarters have shown that we may be through the worst of that. That can change really quickly with Energy, obviously, given the commodity nature. So we are continuing to work with those borrowers. So overall, again, we feel pretty good about all these at-risk industries. We certainly are well reserved with almost $1 billion of reserves and feel like anything that does migrate into that NPA category, we are more than well reserved to handle."

We're in great lines of business where we have deep expertise and scale and in great markets where we still have a lot of room to continue to grow. And so we're going to be primarily focused on that. I do think there's a lot of uncertainty around the environment on a go-forward basis and how the credit cycle will play out. And so I don't have a crystal ball as to what M&A activity looks like in 2021, but really no change for us, focus on organic growth. We've only done 2 deals in the last 20 years. We have said repeatedly that if we were going to look at opportunities, we are probably, first and foremost, interested in Texas and California, given the growth dynamics of both of those markets. 
And that a deal would have to make great sort of strategic and cultural sense for us. And so while there have been a number of deals announced last year, that really doesn't change our overall view, and we're going to be a patient acquirer. It doesn't mean that we wouldn't look at opportunities, but again, first and foremost, focused on organic growth. We would, as we have been in the past, be interested in things that are non-bank acquisitions. So if we have a GAAP and fee income or we see an opportunity there, then those are the types of things we might look at as well, nothing on the immediate horizon."

And the COVID situation has accelerated that path as we've seen more migration to digital and mobile online channels for consumers as well as businesses. We believe that we remain in a well position there. We've got really strong talent on the IT side.  And this past year, we recruited a new Executive Director of Technology and Operations, Megan Crespi, and a new CIO, Bruce Mitchell, and they've been bringing a lot of new thoughts and ideas to us. And it's always for us sort of focused on 2 areas. One is the things that we can do to continue to enable our customers and provide attractive products and services for our customers. And then, secondly, how we use technology to help reduce expenses across the company, things like AI, et cetera. 
We've talked before about the fact that we've been on this path of migration to the cloud and are making good progress there. And we've also talked about the fact that while we don't necessarily have the same scale as many of our larger competitors, we can leverage both a good blend of proprietary capabilities with third parties and really achieve scale, where needed, if we don't necessarily have it in-house. And there are a number of things that we've got in-flight right now. We rolled out a new digital onboarding platform last year that will benefit really across all of our business lines in terms of originating new relationships. The mobile and web channels. We've rolled out a new loan origination platform for our consumer bank. We've done a lot around just how we leverage data and push data to our employees in terms of customer information. 
We're making a number of enhancements to our treasury management platform. And then we've been going through some upgrades in our Wealth Management business line, our new Trust platform and a new Wealth Management portal sort of single sign-on portal for our Wealth Management clients. So I think we remain competitive. We feel good about our positioning. I think it's always important to remember that we are, first and foremost, primarily a commercial bank and relationships still really matter in that business. 
The intellectual capital we bring, the advice we bring, every deal we do is highly customized. It's not something that you push out over a sort of a digital channel. But we've got to have products and services that support the treasury side of the house, the Treasurer, the CFO, et cetera, in that space, and we believe we do. And then even in the other business lines, Wealth Management, and even in our Retail Bank, we tend to serve a more affluent client relationship, still really important there. Advice still really important, but again, enabled through digital and mobile and other channels as well. And we feel like we're well positioned."

But we're being careful not to jump in all at once and place a big bet at any one time, given that we just don't know where things are headed. So as you look at where we've been and where we're going, certainly starting in late second quarter of '20, third quarter of '20, we did prepay a material amount of purchase funds. Midway through third quarter, of course, we bought the $2.25 billion of securities, which had a fourth quarter benefit also. 
And then, as I mentioned in the first quarter of this year, we're prepaying $2.8 billion of FHLB funding. So we are attempting to take steps that show some type of benefit each quarter in terms of doing something with the excess liquidity, but we want to do it in a very measured way. We don't necessarily want to sit on the sidelines forever, but we don't want to jump in all at once either. And so you'll see us continue to evaluate this as time goes on and take incremental steps as the quarters go on. And then when there's more of a line of sight, we may take even a bigger step. But we do think caution is in order, but totally sitting in the sidelines doesn't make sense either. So the measured pace is kind of where we're managing ourselves to."

And one thing I continue to say about the pipeline is that it feels -- and the numbers look good. They look pre-COVID. What is less certain is just the timing of some of this. And so much of it right now is M&A. It's dividend recaps. It's not necessarily core requests that companies have for CapEx or things like that. So it's a little bit lumpy. But it does feel better than it did, certainly, 90 days ago. It's just still a little bit hard to determine when exactly all of that's going to happen. So hopefully, that gives you a little double-click down, Brian, as to what you were looking for."

First of all, just from a size standpoint, we have roughly 430, 435 banking centers. So we don't have the same sort of scale that some players have, and we have less redundancy in markets. So you're not going to drive down the street and see two Comerica banking centers across the street from each other. And so we've kind of eliminated any sort of redundancy in the platform and feel pretty good about the network we have overall. 
Having said that, just like all financial services firms, we have been selectively continuing to prune that portfolio. We've been changing the configuration in the banking centers. We've been leveraging technology more doing away with things like traditional teller lines, having more sort of universal bankers in the banking center that can handle all things for clients, whether it's a loan or deposit need or whatever advisory type capabilities we need to deliver. And that's allowed us to reduce headcount in the banking centers over time and reduce the FTEs and the banking centers. 
And so I do think that, that trend of just sort of continue to slowly decreasing the size of the number of banking centers will continue. But I don't think you should expect necessarily that we're going to announce some huge restructuring of our banking center platform. We have other ways, I think, to continue to fund our technology journey, and we've been able to do that within our overall expense base."

Our ROE grew to",583,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. The year is off to a good start. In the first quarter, we generated earnings of $2.43 per share, a 59% increase over the fourth quarter, primarily driven by strong credit quality. Our ROE grew to over 18% and our ROA was 1.68%. 
I am pleased to report that we are hearing more optimism among our customers and colleagues across our markets. Stimulus payments to individuals and enhanced unemployment benefits along with PPP loans, the small and medium-sized businesses have provided much needed relief to those that are struggling. Also, the infrastructure bill that is being considered is expected to spread spending over many years. 
This physical stimulus and the ramp-up in the vaccine distribution in combination with ample liquidity and low borrowing costs has the potential to spur substantial activity. Economic metrics are improving quickly and the outlook for the back half of the year is for strong economic growth. 
As the economy continues to reopen and pre-pandemic conditions return, many businesses are beginning to experience accelerating activity. I remain very proud of the unwavering commitment of our team to serve our customers, communities and each other. We have again stepped up our efforts to support those affected by the pandemic. 
Last month, Comerica and the Comerica Charitable Foundation pledged approximately $16 million to support small businesses and communities impacted by COVID. This support is in addition to the $11 million committed in 2020. 
As you know, last year, we funded $3.9 billion in the first round of PPP loans. Also, so far this year, through the hard work of colleagues across the bank, we further assisted businesses by funding close to $1 billion in the second round of PPP. In addition, in the first quarter, we processed over $600 million in PPP loan repayments, mainly through forgiveness. 
Turning to our first quarter financial performance on Slide 4. Compared to the fourth quarter, average loans decreased with seasonally lower home purchase volumes impacting our mortgage banker business. Also, total line utilization across nearly all businesses that remain low. 
However, our loan pipeline has continued to grow. Average deposits increased over $1 billion to another all-time high as customers receive additional stimulus payments. Net interest income was impacted by $17 million in lease residual adjustments in an expiring legacy portfolio. 
Excluding this impact, pretax pre-provision net revenue increased 5% despite the shorter quarter of the decline in loan volume. This increase in PP&R was due to continued robust fee-generating activity and our expense discipline. 
As far as credit, our conservative culture, diverse portfolio as well as deep expertise has served us well. Strong credit performance and an improvement in our economic forecast resulted in a negative provision of $182 million. The credit reserve remains healthy at 1.59%. Net charge-offs were only 3 basis points. Through the cycles, our net charge-offs have typically been at or below our peer group average, including during the past year as we navigated the pandemic. 
With more confidence in the economic recovery, and an estimated CET1 ratio of 11.09%, we plan to restart share repurchases. In the second quarter, we expect to make significant strides towards our 10% target giving careful consideration to earnings generation as well as capital needs to fund future loan growth. Our ongoing goal is to provide an attractive return to our shareholders, which includes a dividend that currently has a yield of about 4%. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Jim."

Turning to Slide 5. Average loans decreased approximately $800 million. As Curt mentioned, the biggest driver was mortgage banker which declined from its record high in the fourth quarter due to lower purchase volumes. Energy decreased as higher oil prices are resulting in improved cash flow and capital markets activity. 
We had expected National Dealer loans would begin to rebound in the first quarter. However, supply chain issues, most notably with computer chips have STIMI production. In addition, March auto sales were the second highest of all-time for that month, further depleting inventory. Dealer loans were $1.5 billion below the first quarter of 2020. 
We remain confident that floor plan balances will eventually rebuild to historical levels. Equity fund services was a bright spot, increasing over $200 million with strong fund formation. Total period-end loans reflected decreases of $900 million in dealer and $700 million in mortgage banker. Line utilization for the total portfolio declined to 47%. 
We feel good about the pipeline, which now sits above pre-pandemic levels. It increased in nearly every business line and loans in the last stage of the pipeline nearly doubled over the fourth quarter. Ultimately, we would expect this to translate into loan growth. 
As far as loan yields, there were $17 million in lease residual value adjustments mostly on aircraft and an expiring legacy portfolio. We've not done business in this segment for many years and no further adjustments are expected. Excluding the 14 basis point impact from the residual adjustment, loan yields increased 3 basis points with the benefit of accelerated fees from PPP forgiveness. Continued pricing actions, particularly adding rate floors when possible as loans renew, offset the decline in LIBOR. 
Average deposits increased 2% or $1.1 billion to a new record, as shown on Slide 6. Consumer deposits increased nearly $1 billion, primarily due to seasonality and the additional stimulus received in January. Customers continue to conserve and maintain excess cash balances. With strong deposit growth, our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 69%. 
The average cost of interest-bearing deposits reached an all-time low of 8 basis points, a decrease of 3 basis points from the fourth quarter, and our total funding costs fell to only 9 basis points. Slide 7 provides details on our securities portfolio. Period end balances are up modestly as we recently began to gradually deploy some of our excess liquidity by opportunistically increasing the size of the portfolio. 
Lower rates on the replacement of about $1 billion in payments received during the quarter resulted in the yield on the portfolio declining to 1.89%. Yields on repayments averaged approximately 235 basis points while recent reinvestments have been in the low 180s. 
We expect to mostly offset the yield pressure on MBS in the near-term with a modestly larger portfolio. However, maturing treasuries will likely be a slight headwind in the back half of the year, depending on the mix of MBS and treasuries we would likely replace them with as well as market conditions. 
Turning to Slide 8. Excluding the impact of the lease residual adjustment and 2 fewer days in the quarter, net interest income was roughly stable, and the net interest margin would have increased 2 basis points. As far as the details, interest income on loans decreased $28 million and reduced the net interest margin by 8 basis points. This was primarily due to the $17 million of lease residual adjustment, which had a 9 basis point impact on the margin as well as 2 fewer days in the quarter, which had a $7 million impact. 
Lower loan balances had a $5 million impact and were partially offset by a $3 million increase in fees related to PPP loans. Other portfolio dynamics had a $2 million unfavorable impact and included lower LIBOR, partially offset by pricing actions. Lower securities yields, as I outlined in the previous slide, had a $2 million or 1 basis point negative impact. 
Continued prudent management of deposit pricing added $3 million and 1 basis point to the margin and a reduction in wholesale funding added $1 million and 1 basis point. Average balances of the Fed were relatively steady and remained extraordinarily high at $12.5 billion. This continues to weigh heavily on the margin with a gross impact of approximately 41 basis points. 
Credit quality was strong and metrics are moving in the right direction, as shown on Slide 9. Net charge-offs were only $3 million or 3 basis points. Nonperforming assets decreased $34 million and at 64 basis points of total loans, they are about only half of our 20-year average. 
Inflows to nonaccrual were also very low. Criticized loans declined $366 million and comprised 5% of the total portfolio. Positive migration in the portfolio, combined with growing confidence in improving economic forecasts, resulted in a decrease in our allowance for credit losses. Of note, both the social distancing-related segments as well as the Energy portfolio have performed better than expected. However, we continue to apply a more severe economic forecast to these areas. Our total reserve ratio is very healthy at 1.59% or 1.72% excluding PPP loans and remains well above pre-pandemic levels. 
Noninterest income increased $5 million, as outlined on Slide 10, sustaining the positive trend we've seen for the past year. Derivative income increased $11 million as volumes remain robust, particularly for Energy hedges, combined with a $10 million benefit from a change in the credit valuation adjustment. 
Note that we have made a change in reporting, we have combined foreign exchange and customer derivative income, which was previously included in other noninterest income into a combined derivative income line item. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. Warrant and investment banking fees moved higher and we had smaller increases in fiduciary and deposit service charges. Partly offsetting this commercial lending fees decreased $6 million with the seasonal decline in syndication activity. Deferred comp asset returns were $3 million, a $6 million decrease from the fourth quarter and are offset in noninterest expenses. 
Note, card fees remained elevated. They were over 20% higher than a year ago due to government card and merchant activity spurred by the economic stimulus and changes in customer behavior related to the COVID environment. All in all, another strong quarter for fee income. 
Turning to expenses on Slide 11, which decreased $18 million or 4%. Starting with salaries and benefits, which were up $11 million due to seasonal factors. This increase was driven by annual stock compensation and payroll taxes resetting, providing a partial offset was a decrease in deferred comp as well as a reduction due to 2 fewer days in the quarter and seasonally lower staff insurance costs. 
All other expenses decreased $29 million. As discussed last quarter, strong investment performance in 2020 has resulted in an $8 million reduction in pension costs, which is included in other noninterest expense. In addition, effective January 1, we adopted a change in the accounting method for our pension plan. Previous quarters have been adjusted, specifically, fourth quarter pension expense was reduced by $8 million. This change also decreased AOCI and increased retained earnings at year-end by $104 million, which resulted in a 16 basis point increase to our CET1 ratio. 
Finally, we realized seasonal decreases in advertising and occupancy, lower operating losses and FDIC expense as well as smaller decreases in other categories. Our strong expense discipline is assisting us in navigating this low rate environment as we invest for the future. Our CET1 ratio increased to an estimated 11.09%, as shown on Slide 12. As always, our priority is to use our capital to support our customers and drive growth while providing an attractive return to our shareholders. In this regard, we have maintained a very competitive dividend yield. 
As far as share repurchases, we have a long track record of actively managing our capital and returning excess capital to shareholders. With more confidence in the path of the economic recovery, we plan to resume share repurchases in the second quarter. We expect to make significant strides towards our CET1 target of 10%. Slide 13 provides our outlook for the second quarter relative to the first quarter. In addition, we have provided expected trends for the second half of the year relative to the second quarter outlook. In the second quarter, excluding PPP loans, we expect loan volume to be stable. We expect growth in several lines of business, led by Middle Market as a result of increasing M&A as well as working capital and CapEx needs. However, this will be offset by continuing headwinds in Mortgage Banker, National Dealer and Energy. 
In line with the MBA forecast, Mortgage Banker is expected to decline as refi volumes begin to cool with higher rates. We expect National Dealer to continue to decrease as auto inventory levels are challenged by strong demand, combined with supply issues. Also, Energy loans are expected to remain on the current declining trend as higher oil prices are driving improved cash flow and capital markets activity. As far as PPP loans, it is difficult to predict. However, we believe loan forgiveness will pick up towards the end of the second quarter and the bulk should be repaid by year-end. Excluding PPP loan activity, we believe loans should grow across nearly all business lines in the second half of the year. 
This is based on our robust pipeline and expectations that the economy will continue to strengthen. We expect average deposits to remain strong with the second quarter benefiting from the latest federal stimulus. These record levels are expected to wane in the back half of the year as customers start to put cash to work. As far as net interest income, the $17 million lease residual adjustment we took in the first quarter will not recur. That aside, all other factors, including PPP, are expected to offset each other in the second quarter. 
For example, headwinds from lower reinvestment yields and securities should be offset by a modestly larger portfolio. As we move into the second half of the year, we expect pressure on securities yields and swap maturities to be roughly offset by non-PPP loan growth. 
In addition, lower PPP loan volume and accelerated fees are expected to be a headwind. Of course, PPP activity is difficult to predict and may result in variability. Credit quality is expected to remain strong. Assuming the economy remains on the current path, we expect our allowance should move towards pre-pandemic levels. We expect noninterest income in the second quarter to benefit from higher card fees driven by recent stimulus payments as well as increased syndication fees following lower seasonal activity in the first quarter. 
Also, we expect growth in fiduciary income, reflecting annual tax-related activity and new business generation. This growth is expected to be more than offset by a decline in derivatives and warrant income from elevated levels as well as deferred comp, which is not assumed to repeat. 
As we progress through the year, we believe customer-driven fee categories, in general, should grow with improving economic conditions. However, card fees are expected to be a headwind as the benefit from growing merchant and corporate volumes could be more than offset by lower government card activity due to the absence of further individual stimulus payments. We expect expenses to be stable in the second quarter. Salary and benefit expenses are expected to decrease in the second quarter with lower stock comp as well as lower payroll taxes, partly offset by annual merit and 1 additional day. 
Offsetting this decrease, we expect a rise in outside processing tied to growth in card fees as well as seasonally higher marketing and occupancy expenses. As far as the second half of the year, by maintaining our focus on expenses, we expect to offset higher tech spend. In addition, we expect increases in certain line items due to seasonality and revenue growth. 
Finally, as I indicated on the previous slide, we plan to restart share repurchases in the second quarter. Now I'll turn the call back to Curt."

It is hard to believe that just over a year ago, we drastically changed the ways in which we work and live. We've demonstrated the resilience of our business model as we embraced our core values and rose to the occasion to support our customers, communities and each other. Our success is anchored by our ability to provide our expertise and experience to build and solidify deep, enduring relationships, particularly during challenging times. 
I'm extremely proud of the work our team has done to ensure we continue to deliver the same high level of service. We are focused on delivering a more diversified and balanced revenue base with an emphasis on fee generation. And our progress is demonstrated in our results as noninterest income has increased in each of the past 4 quarters.

We're going to be monitoring the environment throughout the second quarter. And one of the things on our mind is that we are looking at the potential for some pretty good loan growth in the second half of the year, if not late in the second quarter. And so it's important to us to make sure that we have a buffer above 10%, just to make sure that we accommodate our customers and their needs and have the capital to support that growth. 
So we do expect to make significant strides towards that 10% level. But we don't want to throw the needle too tightly there. We think it's important to leave some type of buffer there for potential loan growth. That could pop up late in the quarter or in the couple of quarters following the second quarter."

Just the supply constraints, getting chips, getting cars produced, it's not just chips, it's lots of other supplies. Raw materials, in general, I think, are in short supply. 
So all of that said, we think it's probably more like 2022 before dealer starts to see floor plan balances increased.

And we'll certainly consider doing so in upcoming quarters. So much of the excess liquidity is going to be dependent upon what the Federal Reserve does, what happens with economic activity. So it's really hard to say where it's going to go, but I do think it's fair to say that a pretty good portion of that excess liquidity is likely here to stay for some short to medium term. And we would expect some of it to be put to use in the back half of the year. 
Regarding your securities question, for the remainder of this year, we do expect for the securities to continue to roll off and pay off at rates that are higher than what we're putting on the books. So we will have some continued kind of reduction in the loan yield as each quarter progresses. But as you saw on the chart and on the slide, that decrease in yield is getting smaller each quarter as those yields start to converge on each other, but we don't expect for that crossover point to occur this year. So we'll continue to monitor that and make the right opportunistic purchases with the right structure, but we do think for the remainder of the year, we will continue to see yields roll off that are higher than what we're putting on."

And interesting that you mentioned hedging as well as the securities book. In a sense, we are hedging with securities right now. And we feel like we're in the fortunate position in that we have an alignment of 2 different objectives in a sense by using securities to hedge. 
We can reduce a sensitivity right now, moving some earnings into the current period while maintaining some upside still. But we think we can do so in a way that efficiently uses the excess liquidity to buy securities that are yielding significantly more than synthetic hedges would. Right now, the hedges would carry about 50 bps of positive carry. The securities were buying about 170 bps of positive carry and frankly, we're a little agnostic as to what line item or geography we achieve both that earnings accretion and the reduction in asset sensitivity. So right now, we see a lot of percentage in using excess liquidity and securities. And as that excess liquidity begins to wane, you may see us start to transition to more synthetic approaches."

Also, we do think the economy is going to be in pretty good shape in the second half of the year. And so we want to make sure we're in a position to support that. So there will be some modest expense increase in the second half of the year as we support that growth. 
Certainly, as an example, as card starts to take off throughout the year with additional stimulus that's just coming to the system. We expect outside processing to step in or step up, and we do want to make sure we're there for the customers. So there will be some modest expense growth as we move through the latter 2 quarters of the year. Beyond that, we'll have to assess 2022 as we move through this year, as always, we've done a pretty good job on expenses. They're always very front of mind, and that's something that we have a bit of a maniacal emphasis on in terms of making sure we challenge every expense. We don't think there are any big wholesale changes that we're going to make to our expense structure at this point, but we do challenge expenses as we move through the year, and we expect to maintain that very modest, flat to modest expense growth as we move from year-to-year."

Now as the economy continues to progress, you expect 2 things to happen in coordination with each other. You would expect to see rates rise, which is the genesis of your question. But typically, that would be accompanied by improving economic conditions, which will probably result in either the Fed, drying up some of that liquidity or our customers putting that cash to use. 
So I would expect to see that $156 million sensitivity marker that you see on Page 8 start to come down a little bit as we invest in more securities and as excess cash comes down to the Fed. But having said that, there is no doubt that we are going to benefit significantly if rates do go up."

PPP is to be recognized, it remains to be seen how much of them are recognized through typical amortization. The longer these loans stay in the books, the more we're going to see amortized through time. Obviously, the quicker they're forgiven,",364,"Yes, Gary. PPP is to be recognized, it remains to be seen how much of them are recognized through typical amortization. The longer these loans stay in the books, the more we're going to see amortized through time. Obviously, the quicker they're forgiven, the more we get accelerated fees, likely all at 1 time. Currently, in terms of fees outstanding, we have between the 2 rounds, about $76 million of fees on the book right now. In terms of how that might play out, we're going to recognize a fair amount of that throughout this year is just amortization as part of that 2% that we're getting on PPP loans. We'll get obviously some of it next year for those loans to stay on the books. But just to give you a feel for how this year might progress and what you might see in terms of earnings impact. 
The accelerated fees, if you look at those just in a vacuum, we had about $12 million of accelerated fees in Q1 and that's compared to $5 million in Q4 of '20. So we did have a $7 million increase. It's very unpredictable as to how this might play out. But in some of the guidance that we've offered you in the script, we would expect that $12 million of accelerated fees to be somewhat stable in the second quarter. We would expect it to be higher in the third quarter. It could be 50% higher, it could be double, remains to be seen. 
And then we would see it kind of come back to the first and second quarter level in the fourth quarter. So those are the types of blips you might see in our net interest income quarter-to-quarter related to accelerated PPP fees. Now if you take that and you join it to some gradual rundown of the loans that are on the books right now, essentially the $3.5 billion that are on the books, and you assume that runs down at a typical 2% rate. You put those together, and it gives you a feel for what PPP is going to do to net interest income as we move from quarter-to-quarter."

Our ROE grew to",583,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. The year is off to a good start. In the first quarter, we generated earnings of $2.43 per share, a 59% increase over the fourth quarter, primarily driven by strong credit quality. Our ROE grew to over 18% and our ROA was 1.68%.  
I am pleased to report that we are hearing more optimism among our customers and colleagues across our markets. Stimulus payments to individuals and enhanced unemployment benefits along with PPP loans to small and medium-sized businesses have provided much needed relief to those that are struggling. Also, the infrastructure bill that is being considered is expected to spread spending over many years.  
This physical stimulus and the ramp-up in the vaccine distribution in combination with ample liquidity and low borrowing costs has the potential to spur substantial activity. Economic metrics are improving quickly, and the outlook for the back half of the year is for strong economic growth.  
As the economy continues to reopen and pre-pandemic conditions return, many businesses are beginning to experience accelerating activity. I remain very proud of the unwavering commitment of our team to serve our customers, communities and each other. We have again stepped up our efforts to support those affected by the pandemic.  
Last month, Comerica and the Comerica Charitable Foundation pledged approximately $16 million to support small businesses and communities impacted by COVID. This support is in addition to the $11 million committed in 2020.  
As you know, last year, we funded $3.9 billion in the first round of PPP loans. Also, so far this year, through the hard work of colleagues across the bank, we further assisted businesses by funding close to $1 billion in the second round of PPP. In addition, in the first quarter, we processed over $600 million in PPP loan repayments, mainly through forgiveness.  
Turning to our first quarter financial performance on Slide 4. Compared to the fourth quarter, average loans decreased with seasonally lower home purchase volumes impacting our mortgage banker business. Also, total line utilization across nearly all businesses had remained low.  
However, our loan pipeline has continued to grow. Average deposits increased over $1 billion to another all-time high as customers receive additional stimulus payments. Net interest income was impacted by $17 million in lease residual adjustments in an expiring legacy portfolio.  
Excluding this impact, pretax pre-provision net revenue increased 5% despite the shorter quarter and the decline in loan volume. This increase in PPNR was due to continued robust fee-generating activity and our expense discipline.  
As far as credit, our conservative culture, diverse portfolio as well as deep expertise has served us well. Strong credit performance and an improvement in our economic forecast resulted in a negative provision of $182 million. The credit reserve remains healthy at 1.59%. Net charge-offs were only 3 basis points. Through the cycles, our net charge-offs have typically been at or below our peer group average, including during the past year as we navigated the pandemic.  
With more confidence in the economic recovery, and an estimated CET1 ratio of 11.09%, we plan to restart share repurchases. In the second quarter, we expect to make significant strides towards our 10% target giving careful consideration to earnings generation as well as capital needs to fund future loan growth. Our ongoing goal is to provide an attractive return to our shareholders, which includes a dividend that currently has a yield of about 4%.  
And now I'll turn the call over to Jim."

Turning to Slide 5. Average loans decreased approximately $800 million. As Curt mentioned, the biggest driver was mortgage banker which declined from its record high in the fourth quarter due to lower purchase volumes. Energy decreased as higher oil prices are resulting in improved cash flow and capital markets activity.  
We had expected National Dealer loans would begin to rebound in the first quarter. However, supply chain issues, most notably with computer chips have [indiscernible] production. In addition, March auto sales were the second highest of all-time for that month, further depleting inventory. Dealer loans were $1.5 billion below the first quarter of 2020.  
We remain confident that floor plan balances will eventually rebuild to historical levels. Equity fund services was a bright spot, increasing over $200 million with strong fund formation. Total period-end loans reflected decreases of $900 million in dealer and $700 million in mortgage banker. Line utilization for the total portfolio declined to 47%.  
We feel good about the pipeline, which now sits above pre-pandemic levels. It increased in nearly every business line and loans in the last stage of the pipeline nearly doubled over the fourth quarter. Ultimately, we would expect this to translate into loan growth.  
As far as loan yields, there were $17 million in lease residual value adjustments mostly on aircraft and an expiring legacy portfolio. We've not done business in this segment for many years and no further adjustments are expected. Excluding the 14 basis point impact from the residual adjustment, loan yields increased 3 basis points with the benefit of accelerated fees from PPP forgiveness. Continued pricing actions, particularly adding rate floors when possible as loans renew, offset the decline in LIBOR.  
Average deposits increased 2% or $1.1 billion to a new record, as shown on Slide 6. Consumer deposits increased nearly $1 billion, primarily due to seasonality and the additional stimulus received in January. Customers continue to conserve and maintain excess cash balances. With strong deposit growth, our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 69%.  
The average cost of interest-bearing deposits reached an all-time low of 8 basis points, a decrease of 3 basis points from the fourth quarter, and our total funding costs fell to only 9 basis points. 
Slide 7 provides details on our securities portfolio. Period end balances are up modestly as we recently began to gradually deploy some of our excess liquidity by opportunistically increasing the size of the portfolio.  
Lower rates and the replacement of about $1 billion in payments received during the quarter resulted in the yield on the portfolio declining to 1.89%. Yields on repayments averaged approximately 235 basis points while recent reinvestments have been in the low 180s.  
We expect to mostly offset the yield pressure on NBS in the near-term with a modestly larger portfolio. However, maturing treasuries will likely be a slight headwind in the back half of the year, depending on the mix of MBS and treasuries we would likely replace them with as well as market conditions.  
Turning to Slide 8. Excluding the impact of the lease residual adjustment and 2 fewer days in the quarter, net interest income was roughly stable, and the net interest margin would have increased 2 basis points. As far as the details, interest income on loans decreased $28 million and reduced the net interest margin by 8 basis points. This was primarily due to the $17 million of lease residual adjustments, which had a 9 basis point impact on the margin as well as 2 fewer days in the quarter, which had a $7 million impact.  
Lower loan balances had a $5 million impact and were partially offset by a $3 million increase in fees related to PPP loans. Other portfolio dynamics had a $2 million unfavorable impact and included lower LIBOR, partially offset by pricing actions. Lower securities yields, as I outlined in the previous slide, had a $2 million or 1 basis point negative impact.  
Continued prudent management of deposit pricing added $3 million and 1 basis point to the margin and a reduction in wholesale funding added $1 million and 1 basis point. Average balances of the Fed were relatively steady and remained extraordinarily high at $12.5 billion. This continues to weigh heavily on the margin with a gross impact of approximately 41 basis points.  
Credit quality was strong and metrics are moving in the right direction, as shown on Slide 9. Net charge-offs were only $3 million or 3 basis points. Nonperforming assets decreased $34 million and at 64 basis points of total loans, they are about only half of our 20-year average.  
Inflows to nonaccrual were also very low. Criticized loans declined $366 million and comprised 5% of the total portfolio. Positive migration in the portfolio, combined with growing confidence in improving economic forecasts, resulted in a decrease in our allowance for credit losses. Of note, both the social distancing-related segments as well as the Energy portfolio have performed better than expected. However, we continue to apply a more severe economic forecast to these areas. Our total reserve ratio is very healthy at 1.59% or 1.72% excluding PPP loans and remains well above pre-pandemic levels.  
Noninterest income increased $5 million, as outlined on Slide 10, sustaining the positive trend we've seen for the past year. Derivative income increased $11 million as volumes remain robust, particularly for Energy hedges, combined with a $10 million benefit from a change in the credit valuation adjustment.  
Note that we have made a change in reporting, we have combined foreign exchange and customer derivative income, which was previously included in other noninterest income into a combined derivative income line item. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. Warrant and investment banking fees moved higher and we had smaller increases in fiduciary and deposit service charges. Partly offsetting this commercial lending fees decreased $6 million with the seasonal decline in syndication activity. Deferred comp asset returns were $3 million, a $6 million decrease from the fourth quarter and are offset in noninterest expenses.  
Note, card fees remained elevated. They were over 20% higher than a year ago due to government card and merchant activity spurred by the economic stimulus and changes in customer behavior related to the COVID environment. All in all, another strong quarter for fee income.  
Turning to expenses on Slide 11, which decreased $18 million or 4%. Starting with salaries and benefits, which were up $11 million due to seasonal factors. This increase was driven by annual stock compensation and payroll taxes resetting. Providing a partial offset was a decrease in deferred comp as well as a reduction due to 2 fewer days in the quarter and seasonally lower staff insurance costs.  
All other expenses decreased $29 million. As discussed last quarter, strong investment performance in 2020 has resulted in an $8 million reduction in pension costs, which is included in other noninterest expense. In addition, effective January 1, we adopted a change in the accounting method for our pension plan. Previous quarters have been adjusted, specifically, fourth quarter pension expense was reduced by $8 million. This change also decreased AOCI and increased retained earnings at year-end by $104 million, which resulted in a 16 basis point increase to our CET1 ratio.  
Finally, we realized seasonal decreases in advertising and occupancy, lower operating losses and FDIC expense as well as smaller decreases in other categories. Our strong expense discipline is assisting us in navigating this low rate environment as we invest for the future. Our CET1 ratio increased to an estimated 11.09%, as shown on Slide 12. As always, our priority is to use our capital to support our customers and drive growth while providing an attractive return to our shareholders. In this regard, we have maintained a very competitive dividend yield.  
As far as share repurchases, we have a long track record of actively managing our capital and returning excess capital to shareholders. With more confidence in the path of the economic recovery, we plan to resume share repurchases in the second quarter. We expect to make significant strides towards our CET1 target of 10%. 
Slide 13 provides our outlook for the second quarter relative to the first quarter. In addition, we have provided expected trends for the second half of the year relative to the second quarter outlook. In the second quarter, excluding PPP loans, we expect loan volume to be stable. We expect growth in several lines of business, led by Middle Market as a result of increasing M&A as well as working capital and CapEx needs. However, this will be offset by continuing headwinds in Mortgage Banker, National Dealer and Energy.  
In line with the MBA forecast, Mortgage Banker is expected to decline as refi volumes begin to cool with higher rates. We expect National Dealer to continue to decrease as auto inventory levels are challenged by strong demand, combined with supply issues. Also, Energy loans are expected to remain on the current declining trend as higher oil prices are driving improved cash flow and capital markets activity. As far as PPP loans, it is difficult to predict. However, we believe loan forgiveness will pick up towards the end of the second quarter and the bulk should be repaid by year-end. Excluding PPP loan activity, we believe loans should grow across nearly all business lines in the second half of the year.  
This is based on our robust pipeline and expectations that the economy will continue to strengthen. We expect average deposits to remain strong with the second quarter benefiting from the latest federal stimulus. These record levels are expected to wane in the back half of the year as customers start to put cash to work. As far as net interest income, the $17 million lease residual adjustment we took in the first quarter will not recur. That aside, all other factors, including PPP, are expected to offset each other in the second quarter.  
For example, headwinds from lower reinvestment yields and securities should be offset by a modestly larger portfolio. As we move into the second half of the year, we expect pressure on securities yields and swap maturities to be roughly offset by non-PPP loan growth. 
In addition, lower PPP loan volume and accelerated fees are expected to be a headwind. Of course, PPP activity is difficult to predict and may result in variability. Credit quality is expected to remain strong. Assuming the economy remains on the current path, we expect our allowance should move towards pre-pandemic levels. We expect noninterest income in the second quarter to benefit from higher card fees driven by recent stimulus payments as well as increased syndication fees following lower seasonal activity in the first quarter. 
Also, we expect growth in fiduciary income, reflecting annual tax-related activity and new business generation. This growth is expected to be more than offset by a decline in derivatives and warrant income from elevated levels as well as deferred comp, which is not assumed to repeat. 
As we progress through the year, we believe customer-driven fee categories, in general, should grow with improving economic conditions. However, card fees are expected to be a headwind as the benefit from growing merchant and corporate volumes could be more than offset by lower government card activity due to the absence of further individual stimulus payments. We expect expenses to be stable in the second quarter. Salary and benefit expenses are expected to decrease in the second quarter with lower stock comp as well as lower payroll taxes, partly offset by annual merit and 1 additional day. 
Offsetting this decrease, we expect a rise in outside processing tied to growth in card fees as well as seasonally higher marketing and occupancy expenses. As far as the second half of the year, by maintaining our focus on expenses, we expect to offset higher tech spend. In addition, we expect increases in certain line items due to seasonality and revenue growth. 
Finally, as I indicated on the previous slide, we plan to restart share repurchases in the second quarter. Now I'll turn the call back to Curt."

As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we're off to a good start, and we expect the economy will continue to improve throughout this year. We believe firming manufacturing conditions, increasing business and consumer confidence as well as pent-up demand will support strong economic growth. 
It is hard to believe that just over a year ago, we drastically changed the ways in which we work and live. We've demonstrated the resilience of our business model as we embraced our core values and rose to the occasion to support our customers, communities and each other. Our success is anchored by our ability to provide our expertise and experience to build and solidify deep, enduring relationships, particularly during challenging times. 
I'm extremely proud of the work our team has done to ensure we continue to deliver the same high level of service. We are focused on delivering a more diversified and balanced revenue base with an emphasis on fee generation. And our progress is demonstrated in our results as noninterest income has increased in each of the past 4 quarters. Our robust card platform is a great example, has helped position us for the recent and likely ongoing changes in customer behavior. Also, our fiduciary business is growing with strong collaboration between Wealth Management, Commercial and Retail Bank divisions. 
In February, we increased the breadth and scale of our Trust Alliance business through the acquisition of a small group with expertise in this area. In addition, we are committed to maintaining our strong expense discipline. Our technology investments are enhancing the customer and colleague experience, helping to attract and retain customers and improving colleague efficiency. 
Finally, our disciplined credit culture and strong capital base continue to serve us well. These key strengths provide the foundation to continue to deliver long-term shareholder value. Thank you for your time, and now we'll be happy to take your questions."

And one of the things on our mind is that we are looking at the potential for some pretty good loan growth in the second half of the year, if not late in the second quarter. And so it's important to us to make sure that we have a buffer above 10%, just to make sure that we can accommodate our customers and their needs and have the capital to support that growth. 
So we do expect to make significant strides towards that 10% level. But we don't want to throw the needle too tightly there. We think it's important to leave some type of buffer there for potential loan growth that could pop up late in the quarter or in the couple of quarters following the second quarter."

And we'll certainly consider doing so in upcoming quarters. So much of the excess liquidity is going to be dependent upon what the Federal Reserve does, what happens with economic activity. So it's really hard to say where it's going to go, but I do think it's fair to say that a pretty good portion of that excess liquidity is likely here to stay for some short to medium term. And we would expect some of it to be put to use in the back half of the year. 
Regarding your securities question, for the remainder of this year, we do expect for the securities to continue to roll off and pay off at rates that are higher than what we're putting on the books. So we will have some continued kind of reduction in the loan yield as each quarter progresses. But as you saw on the chart and on the slide, that decrease in yield is getting smaller each quarter as those yields start to converge on each other, but we don't expect for that crossover point to occur this year.

And interesting that you mentioned hedging as well as the securities book. In a sense, we are hedging with securities right now. And we feel like we're in the fortunate position in that we have an alignment of 2 different objectives in a sense by using securities to hedge. 
We can reduce assets and sensitivity right now, moving some earnings into the current period while maintaining some upside still. But we think we can do so in a way that efficiently uses the excess liquidity to buy securities that are yielding significantly more than synthetic hedges would. Right now, the hedges would carry about 50 bps of positive carry. The securities were buying about 170 bps of positive carry and frankly, we're a little agnostic as to what line item or geography we achieve both that earnings accretion and the reduction in asset sensitivity. So right now, we see a lot of percentage in using excess liquidity and securities. And as that excess liquidity begins to wane, you may see us start to transition to more synthetic approaches."

Certainly, as an example, as card starts to take off throughout the year with additional stimulus that's just coming to the system. We expect outside processing to step in or step up, and we do want to make sure we're there for the customers. So there will be some modest expense growth as we move through the latter 2 quarters of the year. Beyond that, we'll have to assess 2022 as we move through this year.

I really like to look at it in terms of net interest income since the cash of the Fed really has no capital consuming characteristics. So we do expect net interest income to be somewhat stable like PPP. We will see a little bit of decrease as we move late into '21 just due to the fact that the -- once you lose several billion dollars of PPP loans that are yielding around 2%. That's -- it's unavoidable that, that's going to have some negative impact on net interest income, and that's very hard to make up. So I would say relatively stable PPP and then PPP will put some downward pressure late in the year. And hopefully, as the economy picks up, you start to replace those PPP loans with real traditional loans and customers start investing for the future."

Even though we have invested in securities over the last 2 or 3 quarters fixed rate securities, we do continue to be very asset sensitive. That's why one of the reasons we're comfortable making those investments in longer duration securities. You'll see on Slide 18 that we're actually showing more asset sensitivity than we had traditionally. You see the 100 bp linear nonparallel shift in rates would produce $156 million of income. That's higher than we would typically see. And one of the reasons for that is all the excess cash that we have on deposit at the Fed. 
Now as the economy continues to progress, you expect 2 things to happen in coordination with each other. You would expect to see rates rise, which is the genesis of your question. But typically, that would be accompanied by improving economic conditions, which will probably result in either the Fed, drying up some of that liquidity or our customers putting that cash to use. 
So I would expect to see that $156 million sensitivity marker that you see on Page 18 start to come down a little bit as we invest in more securities and as excess cash comes down to the Fed. But having said that, there is no doubt that we are going to benefit significantly if rates do go up."

PPP is to be recognized, it remains to be seen how much of them are recognized through typical amortization. The longer these loans stay in the books, the more we're going to see amortized through time. Obviously, the quicker they're forgiven,",364,"Yes, Gary. PPP is to be recognized, it remains to be seen how much of them are recognized through typical amortization. The longer these loans stay in the books, the more we're going to see amortized through time. Obviously, the quicker they're forgiven, the more we get accelerated fees, likely all at one time. Currently, in terms of fees outstanding, we have, between the 2 rounds, about $76 million of fees on the book right now. In terms of how that might play out, we're going to recognize a fair amount of that throughout this year is just amortization as part of that 2% that we're getting on PPP loans. We'll get obviously some of it next year for those loans to stay on the books. But just to give you a feel for how this year might progress and what you might see in terms of earnings impact, the accelerated fees, if you look at those just in a vacuum, we had about $12 million of accelerated fees in Q1, and that's compared to $5 million in Q4 of '20. So we did have a $7 million increase. 
It's very unpredictable as to how this might play out. But in some of the guidance that we've offered you in the script, we would expect that $12 million of accelerated fees to be somewhat stable in the second quarter. We would expect it to be higher in the third quarter. It could be 50% higher, it could be double, remains to be seen. 
And then we would see it kind of come back to the first and second quarter level in the fourth quarter. So those are the types of blips you might see in our net interest income quarter-to-quarter related to accelerated PPP fees. Now if you take that and you join it to some gradual rundown of the loans that are on the books right now, essentially the $3.5 billion that are on the books, and you assume that runs down at a typical 2% rate, you put those together, and it gives you a feel for what PPP is going to do to net interest income as we move from quarter-to-quarter."

Our second quarter results showed continuation of several favorable trends, including strong deposit growth, robust fee income and excellent credit quality. Revenue increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year despite the low rate environment. We remain focused on expense control while supporting our revenue-generating activities. 
Also, we repurchased nearly 6 million shares reducing our share count by over 4%. We generated earnings of $2.32 per share and an ROE of over 17% and an ROA of 1.5%, remain above our historic norm. We continue to demonstrate our unwavering dedication to providing a high level of service and support for our customers, communities and each other. 
During the quarter, we committed $5 billion to small business lending over a 3-year period. Also, we appointed a National Asian-American Business Development Manager, who joined our Hispanic and African-American development managers to support and strengthen relationships in our communities. In conjunction with this announcement, we made a deposit into an Asian-American minority Depository Institution. 
With regard to sustainability, our ESG Council recently defined the most significant ESG issues for our company, specifically those that are most impactful for our customers and colleagues and in which we feel we can make a meaningful difference. We call this our ESG commitment as outlined on the slide. I look forward to sharing with you our continued progress in this critically important areas. 
Turning to our second quarter financial performance on Slide 4. We saw a solid loan growth in several business lines, led by general Middle Market. This was more than offset by a large decline in auto dealer floor plan due to supply constraints as well as mortgage banker due to lower refi volumes. Our pipeline again increased as companies ramped up with the economy reopening. 
Deposit growth continued to be very strong. Average balances increased 6% or over $4 billion to another all-time high. The full quarter benefit of federal stimulus payments, along with seasonality, contributed to a $1.7 billion increase in consumer deposits. Commercial deposit growth mostly reflects our customers' solid profitability and capital markets activity. 
Net interest income increased $22 million. You may recall the first quarter was impacted by a $17 million in lease residual adjustments. We continue to carefully manage loan and deposit pricing as well as the securities portfolio in this ultra-low rate environment. 
Credit improved from already strong levels. We had net recoveries of $11 million, the highest level of net recoveries in at least 20 years. Criticized and nonaccrual loans declined, a true reflection of our disciplined credit culture, diverse portfolio and expertise in the industries we serve. 
Our credit reserve continued to decrease and resulted in a negative provision of $135 million as the portfolio continues to perform better than expected going into the pandemic. The reserve ratio remains healthy at 1.44%, excluding PPP loans. 
Fee generating activity was again robust. Noninterest income grew 5% with increases in card, commercial lending and fiduciary income. Also, expenses were well controlled and our efficiency ratio improved. 
As I previously mentioned, we repurchased nearly 6 million shares during the second quarter. We expect to continue to make strides towards our 10% CET1 target, keeping a close eye on the loan growth trends and capital generation. Using our capital to support our customers and drive growth remains our top priority while providing an attractive return to our shareholders. 
Our customers and colleagues across our markets remain optimistic about the future. We expect economic metrics to remain strong in the back half of the year despite labor and supply chain constraints. We believe that these issues will fade with sustained economic momentum. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Jim."

Turning to Slide 5. Average loans decreased $761 million.

Turning to Slide 5. Average loans decreased $761 million. As Curt mentioned, the biggest driver was an $870 million decrease in National Dealer Services as auto inventory levels are very low due to supply chain challenges. 
Looking back 2 years, floor plan loans were down over $3 billion. We believe that we are close to the bottom and over the next few months, inventory should start to slowly rebuild and return to normal levels sometime next year. 
Mortgage Banker declined approximately $300 million coming off of the record levels reached at the end of last year. Seasonally higher purchase volume was more than offset by lower refi volume, which is expected to continue. Of note, our purchase-related volume was 67% in the quarter compared to the industry at 44%. 
On the other hand, activity in several other businesses has begun to pick up, including general Middle Market, environmental services, commercial real estate, entertainment, equity fund services and corporate banking. 
As far as PPP, average loans decreased a little over $100 million during the quarter. However, on a period-end basis, PPP loans declined nearly $1 billion as the forgiveness process accelerated at the end of the quarter. Excluding the decline in PPP loans, period-end loans were up $613 million due to increases in general Middle Market, environmental services and commercial real estate, partly offset by a decrease in deal order. 
Total line commitments increased $1.5 billion with growth in most business lines led by general Middle Market. Usage also grew, resulting in line utilization holding steady at 47%. Our pipeline increased despite the strong level of commitments closed during the quarter and the portion in the last stage of the pipeline, again, grew significantly. This bodes well for future loan growth. 
Loan yields increased 16 basis points, including the 14 basis points impact from the lease residual adjustment in the first quarter and 2 basis points from fees, including accelerated fees on PPP loan forgiveness. All other factors offset each other. 
Average deposits increased $4.1 billion, climbing to a new record, as shown on Slide 6. Noninterest bearing deposits accounted for almost 75% of the growth. The full quarter benefit of recent fiscal stimulus, along with strong cash generation, drove the increase. With strong deposit growth, our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 66%. The average cost of interest bearing deposits reached an all-time low of 6 basis points, a decrease of 2 basis points from the first quarter, and our total funding costs fell to only 7 basis points. 
Slide 7 provides details on our securities portfolio. During the quarter, we purchased approximately $2 billion of MBS to replace about $1 billion in MBS repayments and $750 million in treasury maturities as well as continue to deploy some of our excess liquidity. The net result was about a $250 million increase in the portfolio at period end and a slightly higher proportion of MBS. By increasing the size of the MBS portfolio by over $1.5 billion since year-end, we have been able to mitigate the rate headwind and maintain approximately the same level of securities income. 
MBS purchases in the second quarter had average durations of 6 to 7 years and yields of about 185 basis points. This compared to securities rolling off at 230 to 250 basis points, which resulted in a decline in the portfolio yield of 1.82%. Our goal is to continue offsetting the pressure from lower reinvestment yields by gradually and opportunistically increasing the portfolio size. 
Turning to Slide 8. Net interest income increased $22 million, including the $17 million in lease residual adjustments recorded in the first quarter. The net interest margin was stable as the impact from the lease residual adjustments was offset by the large increase in excess liquidity. 
As far as the details, interest income on loans increased $18 million and added 8 basis points to the net interest margin. This was primarily due to the lease residual adjustments. One additional day in the quarter added $4 million and fees, primarily PPP related, added $2 million and 1 basis point to the margin. Lower loan balances had a $3 million impact and lower LIBOR and nonaccrual interest recovery each had a $1 million impact. The benefit from a modestly larger securities portfolio was mostly offset by the lower securities yields. 
Average balances of the Fed increased over $3 billion, which added $1 billion and had an 8 basis point negative impact on the margin. Fed deposits remained extraordinarily high at nearly $16 billion and weigh heavily on the margin with a gross impact of approximately 50 basis points. Continued prudent management of deposit pricing added $2 million and 1 basis point to the margin. 
Credit quality was very strong, as shown on Slide 9. Net recoveries of $11 million were comprised of a decrease in gross charge-offs to only $8 million combined with a relatively high level of recoveries of $19 million. Nonperforming assets decreased slightly and remained low at 64 basis points of loans. Also, criticized loans declined in nearly every business line and are now close to pre-pandemic levels. 
Strong credit metrics combined with our growing confidence in sustainable economic growth resulted in a decrease in our allowance for credit losses. Of note, the social distancing-related segments continue to perform better than we expected. Also, with help from an increase in oil prices, the Energy portfolio had significant decreases in nonaccrual and criticized loans as well as net recoveries of $12 million. However, we continue to apply a more severe economic forecast to both of these areas. Our total reserve ratio is very healthy at 1.36% or 1.44%, excluding PPP loans. 
Noninterest income increased $14 million or 5% as outlined on Slide 10, continuing the positive trend we've seen over the last 5 quarters. Card fees increased $13 million and are 23% higher than a year ago, primarily due to government card and to a lesser extent, also merchant, consumer and commercial card activity. These have all been spurred by economic stimulus, changes in customer behavior as well as new and expanded customer relationships. 
Commercial lending fees increased $9 million to the highest level we've seen in over 5 years, primarily driven by an increase in syndication fees. Fiduciary income set a record with a $7 million increase, mainly due to annual tax service fees, a full quarter benefit of the Trust Advisory business we acquired in March as well as equity market performance. 
Deferred comp asset returns were $6 million, a $3 million increase over the first quarter and are offset in noninterest expenses. Partly offsetting these increases, derivative income decreased $8 million as there was a $1 million benefit from a change in the credit valuation adjustment compared to the $10 million benefit in the first quarter. Aside from this change, underlying derivative activity remains robust. Following strong performance in the first quarter, warrant income decreased $4 million and BOLI declined $2 million. In summary, we are pleased with another strong quarter for fee income. 
As shown on Slide 11, expenses were up $16 million in the quarter. The primary drivers were a $7 million increase in outside processing in line with higher revenue and elevated litigation costs related to pending resolution of certain legal matters. Also, we had a seasonal increase in advertising and higher operational losses, which returned to a more normal level. 
Salaries and benefits decreased $5 million, mainly due to annual stock compensation and payroll taxes resetting in the first quarter. Providing a partial offset was an increase in performance-based incentives, annual merit, tech-related labor as well as deferred comp. We continue to demonstrate that we are committed to maintaining our strong expense discipline as we invest for the future. 
Slide 12 provides details on capital management. With our CET1 sitting well above our target, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program for $400 million at the end of April. We also repurchased an additional $50 million of shares in June. Our CET1 ratio decreased to an estimated 10.39%, and our goal is to continue to make strides towards our CET1 target of 10% while carefully watching loan growth trends and capital generation. In addition, we have maintained a very competitive dividend yield, which is currently yielding about 4%. 
Slide 13 provides our outlook for the expected trends for the second half of the year relative to the second quarter. Excluding PPP loans, we expect loan growth in most businesses, led by middle market as a result of increasing working capital and CapEx needs. This is supported by a robust pipeline and expectations that the economy will continue to grow. 
Of note, we believe mortgage banker will decline modestly due to lower refi volumes and seasonality. In addition, we believe National Dealer is close to a bottom as auto inventory levels are expected to start to rebound as we get closer to year-end. 
As far as PPP loans, it is difficult to predict. However, we expect loan forgiveness will continue to pick up and the bulk should be repaid by year-end. We expect average deposits to remain strong. Customers continue to maintain excess balances However, at some point, we believe they will start to put the cash to work. We expect net interest income to benefit from loan growth, excluding PPP and additional days. However, we believe this will be more than offset by the anticipated decrease in PPP loans. 
Credit quality is expected to remain strong. Assuming the economy remains on the current path, we believe the allowance should continue to move towards pre-pandemic levels. We expect customer-driven fee categories to continue to benefit from strong economic conditions along with our focus on attracting and enhancing customer relationships. However, card fees are expected to decrease as the benefit from growing merchant and corporate volumes could be more than offset by lower government card activity as truck stimulus payments wane. 
In addition, in the second quarter, there were categories that were also somewhat elevated such as fiduciary due to the second quarter tax preparation fees and deferred comp, which is difficult to predict. On a year-over-year basis, we expect to see solid growth in the second half. 
We expect expenses to decrease. Certain line items should be seasonally higher, such as occupancy, advertising and travel and entertainment. In addition, as we continue to invest for the future, technology investments are expected to rise modestly as they typically do in the second half of the year. However, more than offsetting these factors, we expect second quarter levels of litigation-related expense and deferred comp will not repeat. Finally, as I indicated on the previous slide, we plan to continue share repurchases. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Curt."

As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are seeing many favorable trends, including some loan growth momentum in certain business lines, including general Middle Market. With strong ISM services and manufacturing indices and a record number of job openings, business and consumer confidence remains positive and is supportive of continued growth in the back half of the year. 
As we continue to navigate this ultra-low interest rate environment, we are focused on delivering a more diversified and balanced revenue base with an emphasis on fee generation. And our progress is demonstrated in the consistent increase in noninterest income over the past 5 quarters. 
We are investing for the future to ensure we can provide high-caliber products, such as our treasury management services. In the second quarter, America became one of the first banks to offer commercial banking customers the ability to send real-time payments. In addition, business deposit capture now includes the ability to scan images of checks for the -- for deposit with a mobile device. 
Finally, utilizing intelligent automation, we improved our integrated receivables offering. Our expertise and experience continues to help us build and solidify long-term relationships, particularly in extraordinary times like these. We are uniquely positioned with our nimble asset size, large customer deposit funding base and commercial bank weighting complemented by robust retail and wealth management capabilities. 
Finally, we are committed to maintaining our conservative credit culture, strong capital base and expense discipline. These key strengths provide the foundation for creating long-term shareholder value.

It may look on the surface like a modest increase in our securities portfolio, but there was a lot of wood to chop in the second quarter. We did have $750 million of what I'll call lumpy treasury maturities up and beyond the almost $1.1 billion of MBS. So we feel we are very busy on the securities front, even in the second quarter, going after good quality securities just to get the average up to $250 million of the purchases up. So we feel like we have some good momentum in the second quarter. 
Our plan for the second half of the year is, of course, to replace the MBS maturities as we always do. We do have $400 million of treasury maturities in the third quarter and another dose in the fourth quarter, and we outlined these on Slide 18 in the appendix. And so we plan on replacing not only the MBS maturities but also those lumpy treasury maturities, and then we plan on also find some modest additional amount above that to offset the rate pressures in the securities portfolio. 
So having said that, we certainly have a lot of excess liquidity to deploy, and we are deploying some of it as we did in the second quarter. At the same time, if you look at what the market is doing right now, we're not sure we want to rush into that and dramatically increase the size of the portfolio given all the maturities and given the MBS as we're putting on to replace them. So we will continue to make steady progress in deploying the excess liquidity making sure that we're going forward on the overall securities balance as well as offsetting any rate pressures. But I wouldn't look for the excess liquidity to take a massive dive in the next quarter or 2. We want to be very measured about how we increase the securities portfolio."

We have been very strong in noninterest income, not just in this quarter, but if you look at the slides on Page 10, the numbers and the trend, we have gradually been increasing every quarter for the last 5 quarters. 
And I'll remind everyone that our run rate for noninterest income prior to the pandemic was about $1 billion a year, which we hit in the third quarter of '20 as we came back in the recovery of the pandemic. Since then, we continue to elevate. And you see some of the unusual items for the current quarter over on the right side of the slide. 
I don't think we're going to slide back to the old $1 billion a year that we used to run at, but we are not going to stay at these current levels either. That would be a very dramatic increase in a short period of time. So card fees will certainly take a step back from where we're at today. Now I don't think they will go back to pre-pandemic levels because we've had a change in customer behavior. There's a lot more electronic use of cards and other channels beyond some of the cash usage we used to see. So card fees will probably end up somewhere in between where they started during the pandemic and where they're at now. 
Commercial lending fees obviously high this quarter, one of the highest quarters we've ever seen. Fiduciary income, we will maintain half of that increase you see in this quarter. We have added customers, and we did make a small acquisition for a trust advisory business. So you will see a portion of that continue. Deferred comp of $3 million, that's the increase, but the absolute number of deferred comp was $6 million, and we always assume that's 0 each quarter. And so you do some extraordinary levels of noninterest income currently occurring. We will take a small step back, but we will not return to the old pre-pandemic levels either.
 So overall, we think going forward, we're going to show some nice percentage growth on our year-to-year noninterest income, if you go back to the base year of 2019."

As far as middle market, I would tell you, and I think John to affirm what he said, it does feel across the board really, really encouraging. And in just about all of our many of our verticals, we are seeing the pipeline growth. We're seeing activity pick up. Michigan had a fantastic quarter, followed by Texas and then kind of California.

Our net interest income is really going to be driven by loan volume over the coming quarters. If you look at deposit pay rates, securities for which we're going to try to offset any rate pressures with volume, purchase funds, they're all going to be likely very stable from an income standpoint going forward. So that takes you right back to loans as the big driver. So let's talk about loan and their impact on the net interest income line item. 
As Peter was saying, ex-PPP, we do think we're going to get some good loan growth in the second half of the year in our core businesses. And so you can do the math on that, and that will be a nice pickup to net interest income. However, the major headwind will be the PPP volume and the pay downs that occur there. That will certainly more than overpower any core growth we get on the other end. 
And just to kind of throw out the numbers here, as we disclosed in the package, I think, on Page 19, our quarterly average in the second quarter for PPP was $3.5 billion. And as we disclosed, the ending balance at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion. So when you look at the third quarter average and what we're headed for versus relative to what we're seeing, we're probably going to end up with a third quarter average that's probably half. It could be a little bit less than half of what we saw in the second quarter. So that's approaching a $2 billion drop in PPP balances. Keep in mind, those are earning about 2%. So that's a pretty significant headwind. And then as we move to the fourth quarter, you'll probably see that PPP balance going half yet again. 
Now putting aside the normal yield, which includes amortized fees, we think our accelerated fees in the third quarter will likely be around the same $15 million that we saw in the second quarter, but it's probably going to be about half of that in the fourth quarter. And so when you look at those factors just from PPP more than overshadowing what's going on in the core portfolio, that will create a headwind. 
Now just some smaller items to consider. We do some smaller headwinds from swap maturities that we itemize on Page 18, that includes a second maturity -- second quarter maturity in June that will have a small impact on Q3. And then I'll just say, LIBOR, success with floors, loan mix, competitive pressures, all of those things can move it up or down slightly. We'll see where those go. But again, I'll just summarize it as it's really going to be a function of loan volume for the most part and to what extent we can offset the PPP average rundown. So hopefully, that helps."

Thank you for the thin and by the way, welcome to the coverage. When we look at our decisioning around securities portfolio and how we grow it and the type of securities we add to it, there are a lot of considerations, but we think we're in a very advantageous position to take advantage of what good rates might be out there for certain types of securities. 
When I look at Comerica, our asset sensitivity is high and it actually has grown since the end of the year since we added all these securities. It's mostly a function of deposit growth, but there are some other factors also. And so we feel like with all the asset sensitivity we have, certainly adding securities, fixed rate securities is something we can afford to do and we can afford to spend some of that asset sensitivity. 
We did add securities with longer duration over the last couple of quarters. But again, if you look at our average duration, it's pretty reasonable, and we think it's pretty manageable, especially when you consider the rest of the complexion of our balance sheet and some of our long-term deposits. We consider the fact that we have excess liquidity. That's certainly not an issue. We can probably afford to do more. 
And then just when you look at the kind of the sweet spot out there in terms of what's available, swaps really aren't at the value right now. Treasuries, not a good value. We think given the capacity we have to add some longer duration securities to the balance sheet and the yield that offers is really the right way to go for us, and we feel like we can continue to go this direction. 
Having said that, no one knows where rates are going. There's no free lunch out there. There could be regret either direction. But we think given the complexion of our balance sheet and our business model, this duration is something that we can afford to add to the balance sheet."

I think that we'll probably see it -- I hope we'll see it sort of bounce along there to slightly up as we go forward. I don't know that you're going to see a tremendous increase in utilization. 
I mean, obviously, the big question in the industry is when does this liquidity deposits get used up first versus borrowings occurring second and when is all of that going to occur. I think that as you get into the back half of the year, you'll see a little bit of utilization increase. But I think customers are going to do a little of both is what I've said. I think they're going to maintain higher cash balances. I think they'll start to use a little more credit. I don't think they're going to swing heavily one way or another just because despite the encouraging outlook across the country, all of our customers are more cautious about the future than they have been as we all are. 
So I think that think the timing of those 2 things occurring are going to be interesting to unfold, but we're encouraged by the utilization we saw in Q2.

As Jim mentioned in his comments, we do expect, based on the performance, the strong performance of the credit portfolio and what we believe to be the economic forecast at this time that we're going to continue to see reserve levels moderating down to a pre-pandemic levels or Day 1 CECL. Day 1 CECL was about 123. We're at about 144 right now. So it's reasonable to assume that we'll continue to trend downward over the course of the next couple of quarters. 
Given the fact that CECL is new, I don't know that anybody really knows where the bottom ""of CECL is,"" but I do think it's possible that we could see reserve levels fall slightly below that Day 1 CECL number."

And in the meanwhile, I just see this fiscal stimulus continuing to occur. The economy is running at a very high rate right now and will for some time, and that creates a bit of a velocity factor or multiplier, which creates deposits in the system. 
And I do see these deposits, they'll move around the banking system, but I don't see them leaving it to any large extent. And so I do see deposits waiting a little bit for Comerica. We do have some businesses that are specific to some of the stimulus that's occurred and some of those businesses will lose some of the deposits over time. But I think we're going to be very flush with deposits for some time to come. We will see loan growth start to eat into that, but I don't see us getting back in the foreseeable future to the more minimal levels of cash that we are holding prior to the pandemic.

And for us, it's anecdotal. A lot of that's not in the run rate at this point in time, but just as we stay in touch with the market, it does feel like there's a bit of a challenge there just as other manufacturers and service industries we're seeing in terms of getting the talent in for the same price that we used to.

Our second quarter results showed continuation of several favorable trends, including strong deposit growth, robust fee income and excellent credit quality. Revenue increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year despite the low rate environment. We remained focused on expense control while supporting our revenue-generating activities. Also, we repurchased nearly 6 million shares, reducing our share count by over 4%. We generated earnings of $2.32 per share and an ROE of over 17% and an ROA of 1.5%, remain above our historic norm. We continue to demonstrate our unwavering dedication to providing a high level of service and support for our customers, communities and each other.
During the quarter, we committed $5 billion to small business lending over a 3-year period. Also, we appointed a National Asian-American Business Development Manager, who joined our Hispanic and African-American development managers to support and strengthen relationships in our communities. In conjunction with this announcement, we made a deposit into an Asian-American minority depository institution.
With regard to sustainability, our ESG council recently defined the most significant ESG issues for our company, specifically those that are most impactful for our customers and colleagues and in which we feel we can make a meaningful difference. We call this our ESG commitment as outlined on the slide. I look forward to sharing with you our continued progress in this critically important areas.
Turning to our second quarter financial performance on Slide 4. We saw a solid loan growth in several business lines, led by general middle market. This was more than offset by a large decline in auto dealer floor plan due to supply constraints as well as mortgage banker due to lower refi volumes. Our pipeline again increased as companies ramped up with the economy reopening. Deposit growth continued to be very strong. Average balances increased 6% or over $4 billion to another all-time high. The full quarter benefit of federal stimulus payments, along with seasonality, contributed to a $1.7 billion increase in consumer deposits. Commercial deposit growth mostly reflects our customers' solid profitability and capital markets activity.
Net interest income increased $22 million. You may recall the first quarter was impacted by a $17 million in lease residual adjustments. We continued to carefully manage loan and deposit pricing as well as the securities portfolio in this ultra-low rate environment. Credit improved from already strong levels. We had net recoveries of $11 million, the highest level of net recoveries in at least 20 years. Criticized and nonaccrual loans declined, a true reflection of our disciplined credit culture, diverse portfolio and expertise in the industries we serve. Our credit reserve continued to decrease and resulted in a negative provision of $135 million as the portfolio continues to perform better than expected going into the pandemic. The reserve ratio remains healthy at 1.44%, excluding PPP loans. Fee generating activity was again robust. Noninterest income grew 5% with increases in card, commercial lending and fiduciary income. Also, expenses were well controlled and our efficiency ratio improved.
As I previously mentioned, we repurchased nearly 6 million shares during the second quarter. We expect to continue to make strides towards our 10% CET1 target, keeping a close eye on the loan growth trends and capital generation. Using our capital to support our customers and drive growth remains our top priority while providing an attractive return to our shareholders. Our customers and colleagues across our markets remain optimistic about the future. We expect economic metrics to remain strong in the back half of the year despite labor and supply chain constraints. We believe that these issues will fade with sustained economic momentum.
And now I'll turn the call over to Jim."

Turning to Slide 5. Average loans decreased $761 million.

Turning to Slide 5. Average loans decreased $761 million. As Curt mentioned, the biggest driver was an $870 million decrease in National Dealer Services as auto inventory levels were very low due to supply chain challenges. Looking back 2 years, floor plan loans were down over $3 billion. We believe that we are close to the bottom and over the next few months, inventory should start to slowly rebuild and return to normal levels sometime next year.
Mortgage Banker declined approximately $300 million coming off of the record levels reached at the end of last year. Seasonally higher purchase volume was more than offset by lower refi volume, which is expected to continue. Of note, our purchase-related volume was 67% in the quarter compared to the industry at 44%. On the other hand, activity in several other businesses has begun to pick up, including general middle market, environmental services, commercial real estate, entertainment, equity fund services and corporate banking.
As far as PPP, average loans decreased a little over $100 million during the quarter. However, on a period-end basis, PPP loans declined nearly $1 billion as the forgiveness process accelerated at the end of the quarter. Excluding the decline in PPP loans, period-end loans were up $613 million due to increases in general middle market, environmental services and commercial real estate, partly offset by a decrease in deal order. Total line commitments increased $1.5 billion with growth in most business lines led by general middle market. Usage also grew, resulting in line utilization holding steady at 47%. Our pipeline increased despite the strong level of commitments closed during the quarter and the portion in the last stage of the pipeline, again, grew significantly. This bodes well for future loan growth.
Loan yields increased 16 basis points, including the 14 basis points impact from the lease residual adjustment in the first quarter and 2 basis points from fees, including accelerated fees on PPP loan forgiveness. All other factors offset each other. Average deposits increased $4.1 billion, climbing to a new record, as shown on Slide 6. Noninterest bearing deposits accounted for almost 75% of the growth. The full quarter benefit of recent fiscal stimulus, along with strong cash generation, drove the increase. With strong deposit growth, our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 66%. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits reached an all-time low of 6 basis points, a decrease of 2 basis points from the first quarter, and our total funding costs fell to only 7 basis points.
Slide 7 provides details on our securities portfolio. During the quarter, we purchased approximately $2 billion of MBS to replace about $1 billion in MBS repayments and $750 million in  treasury maturities as well as continued to deploy some of our excess liquidity. The net result was about a $250 million increase in the portfolio at period end and a slightly higher proportion of MBS. By increasing the size of the MBS portfolio by over $1.5 billion since year-end, we have been able to mitigate the rate headwind and maintain approximately the same level of securities income.
MBS purchases in the second quarter had average durations of 6 to 7 years and yields of about 185 basis points. This compared to securities rolling off at 230 to 250 basis points, which resulted in a decline in the portfolio yield to 1.82%. Our goal is to continue offsetting the pressure from lower reinvestment yields by gradually and opportunistically increasing the portfolio size.
Turning to Slide 8. Net interest income increased $22 million, including the $17 million in lease residual adjustments recorded in the first quarter. The net interest margin was stable as the impact from the lease residual adjustments was offset by the large increase in excess liquidity. As far as the details, interest income on loans increased $18 million and added 8 basis points to the net interest margin. This was primarily due to the lease residual adjustments. One additional day in the quarter added $4 million and fees, primarily PPP related, added $2 million and 1 basis point to the margin. Lower loan balances had a $3 million impact and lower LIBOR and nonaccrual interest recovery each had a $1 million impact. The benefit from a modestly larger securities portfolio was mostly offset by the lower securities yields.
Average balances of the Fed increased over $3 billion, which added $1 billion and had an 8 basis point negative impact on the margin. Fed deposits remained extraordinarily high at nearly $16 billion and weigh heavily on the margin with a gross impact of approximately 50 basis points. Continued prudent management of deposit pricing added $2 million and 1 basis point to the margin.
Credit quality was very strong, as shown on Slide 9. Net recoveries of $11 million were comprised of a decrease in gross charge-offs to only $8 million combined with a relatively high level of recoveries of $19 million. Nonperforming assets decreased slightly and remained low at 64 basis points of loans. Also criticized loans declined in nearly every business line and are now close to pre-pandemic levels. Strong credit metrics combined with our growing confidence and sustainable economic growth resulted in a decrease in our allowance for credit losses. Of note, the social distancing-related segments continue to perform better than we expected.
Also, with help from an increase in oil prices, the Energy portfolio had significant decreases in nonaccrual and criticized loans as well as net recoveries of $12 million. However, we continue to apply a more severe economic forecast to both of these areas. Our total reserve ratio is very healthy at 1.36% or 1.44%, excluding PPP loans. 
Noninterest income increased $14 million or 5% as outlined on Slide 10, continuing the positive trend we've seen over the last 5 quarters. Card fees increased $13 million and are 23% higher than a year ago, primarily due to government card and to a lesser extent, also merchant, consumer and commercial card activity. These have all been spurred by economic stimulus, changes in customer behavior as well as new and expanded customer relationships.
Commercial lending fees increased $9 million to the highest level we've seen in over 5 years, primarily driven by an increase in syndication fees. Fiduciary income set a record with a $7 million increase, mainly due to annual tax service fees, a full quarter benefit of the Trust Advisory business we acquired in March as well as equity market performance.
Deferred comp asset returns were $6 million, a $3 million increase over the first quarter and are offset in noninterest expenses. Partly offsetting these increases, derivative income decreased $8 million as there was a $1 million benefit from a change in the credit valuation adjustment compared to the $10 million benefit in the first quarter. Aside from this change, underlying derivative activity remains robust. Following strong performance in the first quarter, warrant income decreased $4 million and BOLI declined $2 million. In summary, we are pleased with another strong quarter for fee income.
As shown on Slide 11, expenses were up $16 million in the quarter. The primary drivers were a $7 million increase in outside processing in line with higher revenue and elevated litigation costs related to pending resolution of certain legal matters. Also, we had a seasonal increase in advertising and higher operational losses, which returned to a more normal level. Salaries and benefits decreased $5 million, mainly due to annual stock compensation and payroll taxes resetting in the first quarter. Providing a partial offset was an increase in performance-based incentives, annual merit, tech-related labor as well as deferred comp. We continue to demonstrate that we are committed to maintaining our strong expense discipline as we invest for the future.
Slide 12 provides details on capital management. With our CET1 sitting well above our target, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program for $400 million at the end of April. We also repurchased an additional $50 million of shares in June. Our CET1 ratio decreased to an estimated 10.39%, and our goal is to continue to make strides towards our CET1 target of 10% while carefully watching loan growth trends and capital generation. In addition, we have maintained a very competitive dividend yield, which is currently yielding about 4%.
Slide 13 provides our outlook for the expected trends for the second half of the year relative to the second quarter. Excluding PPP loans, we expect loan growth in most businesses, led by middle market as a result of increasing working capital and CapEx needs. This is supported by a robust pipeline and expectations that the economy will continue to grow. Of note, we believe mortgage banker will decline modestly due to lower refi volumes and seasonality. In addition, we believe National Dealer is close to a bottom as auto inventory levels are expected to start to rebound as we get closer to year-end.
As far as PPP loans, it is difficult to predict. However, we expect loan forgiveness will continue to pick up and the bulk should be repaid by year-end. We expect average deposits to remain strong. Customers continue to maintain excess balances. However, at some point, we believe they will start to put the cash to work. We expect net interest income to benefit from loan growth, excluding PPP and additional days. However, we believe this will be more than offset by the anticipated decrease in PPP loans.
Credit quality is expected to remain strong. Assuming the economy remains on the current path, we believe the allowance should continue to move towards pre-pandemic levels. We expect customer-driven fee categories to continue to benefit from strong economic conditions along with our focus on attracting and enhancing customer relationships. However, card fees are expected to decrease as the benefit from growing merchant and corporate volumes could be more than offset by lower government card activity as truck stimulus payments wane.
In addition, in the second quarter, there were categories that were also somewhat elevated such as fiduciary due to the second quarter tax preparation fees and deferred comp, which is difficult to predict. On a year-over-year basis, we expect to see solid growth in the second half. We expect expenses to decrease. Certain line items should be seasonally higher, such as occupancy, advertising and travel and entertainment. In addition, as we continue to invest for the future, technology investments are expected to rise modestly as they typically do in the second half of the year. However, more than offsetting these factors, we expect second quarter levels of litigation-related expense and deferred comp will not repeat. Finally, as I indicated on the previous slide, we plan to continue share repurchases.
Now I'll turn the call back to Curt."

As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are seeing many favorable trends, including some loan growth momentum in certain business lines, including general middle market. With strong ISM services and manufacturing indices and a record number of job openings, business and consumer confidence remains positive and is supportive of continued growth in the back half of the year.
As we continue to navigate this ultra-low interest rate environment, we are focused on delivering a more diversified and balanced revenue base with an emphasis on fee generation. And our progress is demonstrated in the consistent increase in noninterest income over the past 5 quarters. We are investing for the future to ensure we can provide high-caliber products, such as our treasury management services. In the second quarter, Comerica became one of the first banks to offer commercial banking customers the ability to send real-time payments. In addition, business deposit capture now includes the ability to scan images of checks for deposit with a mobile device.
Finally, utilizing intelligent automation, we improved our integrated receivables offering. Our expertise and experience continues to help us build and solidify long-term relationships, particularly in extraordinary times like these. We are uniquely positioned with our nimble asset size, large customer deposit funding base and commercial bank weighting complemented by robust retail and wealth management capabilities.
Finally, we are committed to maintaining our conservative credit culture, strong capital base and expense discipline. These key strengths provide the foundation for creating long-term shareholder value.
Thank you for your time, and now we'd be happy to take your questions."

You're right, it may look on the surface like a modest increase in our securities portfolio, but there was a lot of wood to chop in the second quarter. We did have $750 million of what I'll call lumpy treasury maturities up and beyond the almost $1.1 billion of MBS. So we feel we are very busy on the securities front even in the second quarter, going after good quality securities just to get the average up to $250 million where the purchase is up. So we feel like we had some good momentum in the second quarter.
Our plan for the second half of the year is, of course, to replace the MBS maturities as we always do. We do have $400 million of treasury maturities in the third quarter and another [ dose ] in the fourth quarter, and we outlined these on Slide 18 in the appendix. And so we plan on replacing not only the MBS maturities but also those lumpy treasury maturities. And then we plan on also find some modest additional amount above that to offset the rate pressures in the securities portfolio.
So having said that, we certainly have a lot of excess liquidity to deploy, and we are deploying some of it as we did in the second quarter. At the same time, if you look at what the market is doing right now, we're not sure we want to rush into that and dramatically increase the size of the portfolio given all the maturities and given the MBSs we're putting on to replace them. So we will continue to make steady progress in deploying the excess liquidity, making sure that we're going forward on the overall securities balance as well as offsetting any rate pressures. But I wouldn't look for the excess liquidity to take a massive dive in the next quarter or 2. We want to be very measured about how we increase the securities portfolio."

Ken, it's Jim. Yes, I'll be happy to answer that. We have been very strong in noninterest income, not just in this quarter, but if you look at the slides on Page 10, the numbers and the trend, we have gradually been increasing every quarter for the last 5 quarters. And I'll remind everyone that our run rate for noninterest income prior to the pandemic was about $1 billion a year, which we hit in the third quarter of '20 as we came back in the recovery of the pandemic. Since then, we continue to elevate. And you see some of the unusual items for the current quarter over on the right side of the slide.
I don't think we're going to slide back to the old $1 billion a year that we used to run at, but we are not going to stay at these current levels either. That would be a very dramatic increase in a short period of time. So card fees will certainly take a step back from where we're at today. Now I don't think they will go back to pre-pandemic levels because we've had a change in customer behavior. There's a lot more electronic use of cards and other channels beyond some of the cash usage we used to see. And so card fees will probably end up somewhere in between where they started during the pandemic and where they're at now.
Commercial lending fees, obviously, high this quarter, one of the highest quarters we've ever seen. Fiduciary income, we will maintain half of that increase you see in this quarter. We have added customers, and we did make a small acquisition for a trust advisory business. So you will see a portion of that continue. Deferred comp of $3 million, that's the increase, but the absolute number of deferred comp was $6 million, and we always assume that's 0 each quarter. And so you do some extraordinary levels of noninterest income currently occurring. We will take a small step back, but we will not return to the old pre-pandemic levels either. So overall, we think going forward, we're going to show some nice percentage growth on our year-to-year noninterest income, if you go back to the base year of 2019."

As far as middle market, I would tell you, and I think, Jon, to affirm what you said, it does feel across the board really, really encouraging. And in just about all of our geographies, many of our verticals, we are seeing the pipeline growth. We're seeing activity pick up. Michigan had a fantastic quarter, followed by Texas and then kind of California. And I think that's just a little bit indicative of the size of the books in those markets and the number of customers and opportunities.

Our net interest income is really going to be driven by loan volume over the coming quarters. If you look at deposit pay rates, securities for which we're going to try to offset any rate pressures with volume, purchase funds, they're all going to be likely very stable from an income standpoint going forward. So that takes you right back to loans as the big driver. So let's talk about loan and their impact on the net interest income line item.
As Peter was saying, ex PPP, we do think we're going to get some good loan growth in the second half of the year in our core businesses. And so you can do the math on that, and that will be a nice pickup in net interest income. However, the major headwind will be the PPP volume and the pay downs that occur there. That will certainly more than overpower any core growth we get on the other end. And just to kind of throw out the numbers here, as we disclosed in the package, I think, on Page 19, our quarterly average in the second quarter for PPP was $3.5 billion. And as we disclosed, the ending balance at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion. So when you look at the third quarter average and what we're headed for versus relative to what we're seeing, we're probably going to end up with a third quarter average that's probably half. It could be a little bit less than half of what we saw in the second quarter. 
So that's approaching a $2 billion drop in PPP balances. Keep in mind, those are earning about 2%. So that's a pretty significant headwind. And then as we move to the fourth quarter, you'll probably see that PPP balance going half yet again. Now putting aside the normal yield, which includes amortized fees, we think our accelerated fees in the third quarter will likely be around the same $15 million that we saw in the second quarter, but it's probably going to be about half of that in the fourth quarter. And so when you look at those factors just from PPP more than overshadowing what's going on in the core portfolio, that will create a headwind.
Now just some smaller items to consider. We do have some smaller headwinds from swap maturities that we itemize on Page 18, that includes a second maturity -- second quarter maturity in June that will have a small impact on Q3. And then I'll just say, LIBOR, success with floors, loan mix, competitive pressures, all of those things can move it up or down slightly. We'll see where those go. But again, I'll just summarize it as it's really going to be a function of loan volume for the most part and to what extent we can offset the PPP average rundown. So hopefully that helps."

Thank you for the question, and by the way, welcome to the coverage. When we look at our decisioning around securities portfolio and how we grow it and the type of securities we add to it, there are a lot of considerations, but we think we're in a very advantageous position to take advantage of what good rates might be out there for certain types of securities. When I look at Comerica, our asset sensitivity is high and it actually has grown since the end of the year since we added all these securities. It's mostly a function of deposit growth, but there are some other factors also. And so we feel like with all the asset sensitivity we have, certainly adding securities, fixed rate securities is something we can afford to do and we can afford to spend some of that asset sensitivity.
We did add securities with longer duration over the last couple of quarters. But again, if you look at our average duration, it's pretty reasonable, and we think it's pretty manageable, especially when you consider the rest of the complexion of our balance sheet and some of our long-term deposits. We consider the fact that we have excess liquidity. That's certainly not an issue. We can probably afford to do more. And then just when you look at the kind of the sweet spot out there in terms of what's available, swaps really aren't a good value right now. Treasuries, not a good value. We think given the capacity we have to add some longer duration securities to the balance sheet and the yield that offers is really the right way to go for us, and we feel like we can continue to go this direction.
Having said that, no one knows where rates are going. There's no free lunch out there. There could be regret either direction. But we think given the complexion of our balance sheet and our business model, this duration is something that we can afford to add to the balance sheet."

I think that we'll probably see it -- I hope we'll see it sort of bounce along there to slightly up as we go forward. I don't know that you're going to see a tremendous increase in utilization. I mean, obviously, the big question in the industry is when does this liquidity deposits get used up first versus borrowings occurring second and when is all of that going to occur. I think that as you get into the back half of the year, you'll see a little bit of utilization increase. But I think customers are going to do a little of both is what I've said. I think they're going to maintain higher cash balances. I think they'll start to use a little more credit. I don't think they're going to swing heavily one way or another just because despite the encouraging outlook across the country, all of our customers are more cautious about the future than they have been as we all are.
So I think that the timing of those 2 things occurring are going to be interesting to unfold, but we're encouraged by the utilization we saw in Q2. We think that it's going to hang in there, start to increase a little bit. And I think it will probably be into next year or maybe even further before we get back to ""normal utilization levels"" that you might have seen in years past or pre-pandemic."

As Jim mentioned in his comments, we do expect, based on the performance, the strong performance of the credit portfolio and what we believe to be the economic forecast at this time that we're going to continue to see reserve levels moderating down to a pre-pandemic levels of Day 1 CECL. Day 1 CECL was about 1 23. We're at about 1 44 right now. So it's reasonable to assume that we'll continue to trend downward over the course of the next couple of quarters.
Given the fact that CECL is new, I don't know that anybody really knows where the ""bottom"" of CECL is, but I do think it's possible that we could see reserve levels fall slightly below that Day 1 CECL number."

I'm wondering if that's at all on the table as you kind of consider broader ALCO strategies?"

We have very accommodative monetary policy. And that is driving a large amount of excess liquidity. The Fed will start tapering at some point, but taper doesn't mean stop. It just means taper. And in the meanwhile, I just see this fiscal stimulus continuing to occur. The economy is running at a very high rate right now and will for some time, and that creates a bit of a velocity factor or multiplier, which creates deposits in the system. And I do see these deposits, they'll move around the banking system, but I don't see them leaving it to any large extent.
And so I do see deposits waiting a little bit for Comerica. We do have some businesses that are specific to some of the stimulus that's occurred and some of those businesses will lose some of the deposits over time. But I think we're going to be very flush with deposits for some time to come. We will see loan growth start to eat into that, but I don't see us getting back in the foreseeable future to the more minimal levels of cash that we are holding prior to the pandemic.

And for us, it's anecdotal. A lot of that's not in the run rate at this point in time, but just as we stay in touch with the market, it does feel like there's a bit of a challenge there just as other manufacturers and service industries we're seeing in terms of getting the talent in for the same price that we used to.

We generated earnings of $1.90 per share and an ROE of 13.53% in the third quarter. Our results included solid loan growth in a number of business lines, which was overshadowed by headwinds from PPP loan forgiveness and reduced auto dealer loans due to supply constraints. We continue to drive strong deposit growth, robust fee income and excellent credit quality. Revenue increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year despite the low rate environment. Our focus remains on managing expenses while supporting our revenue-generating activities.
Also during the quarter, we repurchased over 3 million shares, reducing our share count by over 2%. We expect economic metrics to remain relatively strong over the next year, which bodes well for growth. Our corporate mission is to create shareholder value by providing a higher level of banking that nurtures long-lasting relationships. Key to achieving this mission is our dedication to our customers, employees and communities. Our green loans and commitments continue to increase and totaled $1.5 billion at quarter end. Recently, we launched a national Asian and Pacific Islanders Resource Group. We now have 10 employee resource groups covering all of our markets. These groups support our diverse team members and strengthen relationships in our communities. I encourage you to review our diversity, equity and inclusion report as well as our 13th Annual Corporate Responsibility related report, which were recently published. These reports include updates on our strategies and progress in these important areas.
Turning to our third quarter financial performance on Slide 4. Significant progress was made on PPP forgiveness, reducing these loans by $1.8 billion or 64% on a period-end basis. Supply constraints continue to impact auto dealer floor plan loans, which averaged only $600 million relative to the historical run rate of about $4 billion. Putting PPP and dealer side, the average loans in the remainder of our portfolio grew about $600 million or nearly 1.5% over the second quarter, including a 3% increase in general middle market. Our pipeline is strong and loan commitments continue to increase.
Average deposits increased 5% or $3.6 billion to another all-time high. This is due to our customers' solid profitability and capital markets activity, as well as the liquidity injected into the economy through physical and monetary actions. Net interest income increased $10 million, benefiting from an additional day in the quarter, higher loan fees and deployment of excess liquidity, partly offset by lower rates. Credit quality was excellent with net charge-offs of only 1 basis points and criticized loans have declined to well below our long-term average. As a result, our reserve declined again, and we had a negative provision. Reserve ratio of 1.33% reflects the positive outlook for the economy and our portfolio.
Fee-generating activity remained robust. Third quarter noninterest income was up 11% on a year-over-year basis. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, record warrant income and commercial lending fees were offset by a decline in card fees from elevated levels due to lower levels of government stimulus. Our efficiency ratio held steady at 62% as we continue to focus on supporting revenue-generating activity. This includes our technology investments, which help us attract and retain customers and colleagues by enhancing their overall experience and efficiency. We remain focused on our digital transformation by enabling our business with products and services, modernizing our platform and building our digital future with the right talent, skills and strategy.
As we stated earlier, we continue to manage our capital levels, keeping a close eye on loan trends and capital generation. Using our capital to support our customers and drive growth remains our top priority while providing an attractive return to our shareholders. We, along with our customers and colleagues across our markets, remain optimistic about the future. We expect economic metrics to remain relatively strong over the next year. Our chief economist forecast real GDP to increase 4.5% in 2022, with each of our 3 primary markets of California, Texas and Michigan above that level, which bodes well for growth. And now I will turn the call over to Jim."
318670,695375252,2407970,"Comerica Incorporated, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5. PPP loans decreased $1.8 billion to end the quarter at $1 billion as the forgiveness process accelerated. Excluding the decline in PPP loans, we have good momentum in several business lines. Sp",1772,"Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5. PPP loans decreased $1.8 billion to end the quarter at $1 billion as the forgiveness process accelerated. Excluding the decline in PPP loans, we have good momentum in several business lines. Specifically, we have driven consistent growth in general middle market, equity fund services, environmental services and entertainment. This growth was partially offset by decreases in National Dealer Services and Mortgage Banker. Industry data shows that auto and dealer inventory levels are at a 20- to 25-day supply versus the typical 60 to 70 days due to challenges resulting from chip shortages, labor constraints and foreign nameplate shipping issues. We believe our dealer floor plan balances are very close to the bottom and inventory levels should start to slowly rebuild.
Mortgage Banker loans also declined. Of note, our mix is beneficial with 71% of our loans tied to purchase activity. The expectation is that refi volume should continue to fall as rates increase, however, purchase activity should remain relatively strong. As far as line commitments, we posted another strong quarter with an increase of over $800 million in growth in most business lines. Usage also grew, resulting in the line utilization rate holding steady at 47%. Loan yields increased 14 basis points, including 14 basis points from the net impact of PPP loans and 3 basis points from higher non-PPP fees. This was partly offset by a 3 basis point impact from lower rates, which included swap maturities.
Deposits continue to grow in nearly every business line hitting a new record as shown on Slide 6. The majority of our deposits are noninterest-bearing and the average cost of interest-bearing deposits remained at an all-time low, just below 6 basis points. Our total funding costs held steady at 7 basis points. With strong deposit growth, our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 59%.
Slide 7 provides details on our securities portfolio. We deployed some of our excess liquidity by increasing the size of the securities portfolio by $1 billion or $566 million on average. This allowed us to mitigate the rate headwind resulting in approximately the same level of securities income quarter-over-quarter. MBS purchases in the third quarter had average durations of around 6 years and yields of about 170 basis points. With securities rolling off of rates over 200 basis points, the total portfolio yield declined to 1.76%. Our goal is to continue to offset any pressure from lower reinvestment yields by gradually and opportunistically increasing the portfolio size.
Turning to Slide 8. Net interest income grew $10 million primarily due to an increase in the contribution from loans. However, the net interest margin declined 6 basis points due to the large increase in excess liquidity. As far as the details, interest income on loans increased $7 million and added 6 basis points to the net interest margin. This was driven by 1 additional day in the quarter, which added $4 million, higher loan fees and balances on non-PPP loans together added $5 million and the impact of PPP with higher fees netted against lower balances added $2 million. This was partly offset by lower LIBOR and swap maturity, which together had a $4 million unfavorable impact.
As I mentioned, we neutralized from lower securities yields on interest income by increasing the portfolio size. A $4.5 billion increase in average balances of the Fed combined with a 5 basis point increase in the rate paid on these balances, added $3 million and had a 10 basis point negative impact on the margin. Fed deposits remained extraordinarily high at over $20 billion and weighed heavily on the margin with a gross impact of approximately 65 basis points. Given our asset-sensitive balance sheet, the recent steepening of the yield curve is a positive sign for the future. Our models estimate an 11% increase in annual net interest income in the first year when rates gradually rise 100 basis points and of course, the incremental income in year 2 compared to the year 1 increase would be yet higher.
Credit quality was excellent, as shown on Slide 9. Net charge-offs were only $2 million and included $16 million in net recoveries from our Energy business line. Nonperforming assets decreased and remained low at 62 basis points of loans. Also, criticized loans declined in nearly every business line and are now below 4% of total loans. With help from the rise in oil and gas prices, the Energy portfolio had significant decreases in both nonaccrual and criticized loans. Strong credit metrics combined with our growing confidence in sustainable economic growth resulted in a decrease in our allowance for credit losses. Our total reserve ratio remains healthy at 1.33%. Overall, our customers quickly adapted and navigated a very challenging environment. However, we remain vigilant given the potential stress on our customers from supply chain disruptions, labor constraints and inflation.
Noninterest income declined modestly to $280 million following a very strong second quarter as outlined on Slide 10. Warrant related income increased $7 million to an all-time high due to robust IPO and M&A activity. Similarly, commercial lending fees were also a record, driven by a large increase in syndication fees. Deposit service charges grew $3 million as a result of an acceleration in customer activity. Also BOLI income increased primarily due to the receipt of the annual dividend. As expected, government card activity declined as stimulus-related volume waned, however, this was partly offset by increases in merchant, consumer and commercial card activity. Deferred comp asset returns, which is offset in noninterest expenses for less than $1 million compared to $6 million in the second quarter.
Also, derivative income declined $2 million due to reduced customer appetite for interest rate hedges partly offset by robust energy derivative transactions with oil and gas prices hitting multiyear highs. Fiduciary income decreased from a record level in the second quarter as continued strong equity market performance was more than offset by the absence of annual tax service fees.
In summary, we are pleased with another very strong quarter for fee income. As shown on Slide 11, expenses were up $2 million in the quarter. Salaries and benefits increased $5 million, mainly due to an increase in performance-based incentives, which was partly offset by a decline in deferred comp. Also, we had higher software and consulting costs as we progressed on our digital transformation journey and occupancy expense was seasonally higher. In line with lower card fee income, Outside processing decreased $6 million. Litigation costs decreased following the elevated second quarter levels. And finally, FDIC insurance declined due to strong credit quality and higher capital ratios at the bank level. Our stable efficiency ratio is consistent with our commitment to maintaining our strong expense discipline as we invest for the future.
Slide 12 provides details on capital management. Our CET1 ratio decreased to an estimated 10.21%. We repurchased 3 million shares in the third quarter under our share repurchase program. We continue to closely monitor loan growth trends and capital generation as we manage our way towards our 10% CET1 target. In addition, we have maintained a very competitive dividend yield.
Slide 13 provides our outlook for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. Excluding PPP loans, we expect loan growth in several businesses, including general middle market and large corporate. Partly offsetting this growth, we expect continued decline in mortgage banker due to lower refi volumes and seasonality. Of note, we believe auto dealer floor plan loans are close to a bottom. PPP forgiveness is expected to continue and the bulk should be repaid by year-end. As we look forward to next year, we believe loan growth from year-end '21 to year-end '22 should be relatively strong supported by our robust pipeline and expectations that the economy will remain strong.
We expect average deposits to remain elevated as customers continue to generate and maintain excess balances. We expect net interest income in the fourth quarter to be impacted by a decrease in PPP related income from $34 million in the third quarter to be $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter. Ex PPP, we expect net interest income to be relatively stable. Lower fees from elevated third quarter levels and to a lesser extent, maturing swaps are expected to mostly offset the benefit from non-PPP loan growth. As far as next year, putting aside the headwind from the decline in PPP income, we expect to benefit from loan growth.
As I discussed earlier, we are highly sensitive to rate movements, so assumptions for rates are a key determinant for net interest income expectations, including the impact of maturing loan floors and swaps. Credit quality is expected to remain strong. Assuming the economy remains on the current path, we believe the allowance should continue to move towards our prepandemic day 1 CECL reserve of 1.23%. As far as fourth quarter noninterest income, we expect continued solid performance in several customer-driven fee categories, such as deposit service charges, card and derivatives, particularly foreign exchange. More than offsetting this growth, we expect a decrease from record levels of warrant and commercial loan fees as well as elevated BOLI.
We expect 2021 noninterest income will be 1 of the highest we've ever recorded. Certain line items such as card, warrants and derivatives, including CVA, may be difficult to repeat as we look into next year. And we assume deferred comp, which is offset in noninterest expense, will not repeat. However, we expect strength and growth across many other fee income categories. We expect expenses in the fourth quarter to be relatively stable as we continue to invest for the future, technology investments are expected to rise as they typically do as we approach year-end. In addition, we expect seasonally higher occupancy, advertising and travel and entertainment expenses. This is expected to be offset by a reduction from the third quarter elevated performance-based incentives.
Our planning process for next year is underway. Big picture, we expect compensation to normalize in 2022; however, inflationary pressures could impact a number of line items, including salaries. Also, we are focused on product and market development as well as driving efficiency, which means continued investment in technology. This is particularly important to ensure we continue to be well positioned to assist customers and colleagues given the prospect of strong economic growth for the foreseeable future.
We expect the tax rate to be 22% to 23%, excluding discrete items. And finally, as I indicated on the previous slide, we plan to continue managing towards our CET1 target as we monitor loan trends.
Now I'll turn the call back to Curt."

It probably gave us about 4 bps more than we would typically have during the quarter. And we did get some pressure, likewise going the other direction from a little bit lower LIBOR and the expiring swap that we had at the end of June that carried through the third quarter. And that probably put about 3 bps of pressure on the yields in the third quarter. As we look to the fourth quarter, we will continue to have a little bit of pressure from LIBOR continuing to sink. It's not significant. And we do have a swap maturing in early October. So I expect between the swap and lower LIBOR to get about 3 bps of pressure in the fourth quarter.
And then, of course, we're going to have the lower loan fees going to other direction, the 4 bps that were elevated going down a little bit. So those are really the big drivers outside of PPP, which obviously has the biggest impact that you would have to back out."

I'm not surprised by that. I mentioned, I think, previously at conferences or earnings that to the extent the Federal Reserve continues to inject liquidity into the economy and to the extent we continue to have some fiscal spending that in my opinion, pushes the velocity of some of the money supply, I think we'll continue to see growth in deposits.
So it will continue to be strong and even, though, the Federal Reserve may begin tapering later this year. They're still going to be injecting liquidity into the economy. Short-term rates will, of course, stay low probably for the next few months at least. So I don't see any of this escaping off balance sheet in the money markets and so on.

I think back to this deposit question though, the one we get a lot is which of these is going to happen first. Deposits come down, utilization go up. And I think our message continues to be a little bit of both.
One thing about the deposit growth is we're adding new customers. And so not all those customers are borrowing a lot of money right now, but we are capturing deposits and treasury management and other business with that customer acquisition. And believe, that eventually their borrowings will pick up on their facilities. So I think, Scott, to answer your question, I think utilization rates will creep up. I don't think they're going to go up quickly because they do -- we do think those deposits and liquidity will stay on the balance sheet. And I do think you'll see it faster in kind of middle market/business banking before you will, per se, in large corporate, who continues to access the capital markets and handle their balance sheets a little differently."

I've been asking myself the same question, what is the last normal year we and the industry has had. And it's certainly not the last couple. There have been an incredible amount of puts and takes over the last couple of years. So I typically like to go back to at least '19 to set a baseline. But having said that, our goal is to be at or below the rate of inflation. That's kind of what we use as a governor. You probably have to go back to kind of a 2019 starting point in CAGR from there, just to see how you measure up to that.
From that standpoint, we feel pretty good about it. We are making some investments in areas that I think are going to pay off and we feel really good about. And of course, we'll be in a position to talk more about that at the January conference call. So we kind of lay out expectations for 2022, but we are keeping our eye on expenses. We are trying to self-fund to the extent we can. We're very committed to making the right investments in the people and the systems.

A lot of leveraging and really changing dynamics in how customers utilize banking services with more customers utilizing mobile banking for online transactions, et cetera, has helped us continue to be very efficient there.
At the same time, we've done a very good job and Peter's area is an example of that of reallocating headcount where we feel like we have a higher growth opportunity in certain business lines. So that remains sort of a key area of focus for us. I do think when you get longer term, we're not -- the industry is not there and we're not there yet either, but with a lot of companies, including us, is of more flexibility and work schedules, there will be a point where we can start really thinking more about real estate.

And I think we can balance both of those.

I mean, $600 million in floor plan balances is about as small as we can get. I suspect the fourth quarter will come down a little bit more.
But what the outlook for dealer is, it is very difficult to determine in this environment. Customers give you feedback that they believe that eventually, we will be in what we've seen in the past and the amount of inventory that's on dealer lots. But today, if you go buy a dealership, there are no cars out there. And I think that's probably going to continue further into next year than maybe many of us have thought.

The shift that we've seen at Comerica and our new leaders in the service company have done a great job of this, as we've seen a little bit of a shift between what we call run the bank versus build the bank.

But having said that, we do have loans coming up for renewals, but never had the opportunity to get a floor. And so we view that as an opportunity. And of course, we have new customer activity where there's an opportunity also.

We generated earnings of $1.90 per share and an ROE of 13.53% in the third quarter. Our results included solid loan growth in a number of business lines, which was overshadowed by headwinds from PPP loan forgiveness and reduced auto dealer loans due to supply constraints. We continue to drive strong deposit growth, robust fee income and excellent credit quality. Revenue increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year despite the low rate environment. Our focus remains on managing expenses while supporting our revenue-generating activities.
Also during the quarter, we repurchased over 3 million shares, reducing our share count by over 2%. We expect economic metrics to remain relatively strong over the next year, which bodes well for growth. Our corporate mission is to create shareholder value by providing a higher level of banking that nurtures long-lasting relationships. Key to achieving this mission is our dedication to our customers, employees and communities. Our green loans and commitments continue to increase and totaled $1.5 billion at quarter end. Recently, we launched a national Asian and Pacific Islanders Resource Group. We now have 10 employee resource groups covering all of our markets. These groups support our diverse team members and strengthen relationships in our communities. I encourage you to review our diversity, equity and inclusion report as well as our 13th Annual Corporate Responsibility related report, which were recently published. These reports include updates on our strategies and progress in these important areas.
Turning to our third quarter financial performance on Slide 4. Significant progress was made on PPP forgiveness, reducing these loans by $1.8 billion or 64% on a period-end basis. Supply constraints continue to impact auto dealer floor plan loans, which averaged only $600 million relative to the historical run rate of about $4 billion. Putting PPP and dealer side, the average loans in the remainder of our portfolio grew about $600 million or nearly 1.5% over the second quarter, including a 3% increase in general middle market. Our pipeline is strong and loan commitments continue to increase.
Average deposits increased 5% or $3.6 billion to another all-time high. This is due to our customers' solid profitability and capital markets activity, as well as the liquidity injected into the economy through physical and monetary actions. Net interest income increased $10 million, benefiting from an additional day in the quarter, higher loan fees and deployment of excess liquidity, partly offset by lower rates. Credit quality was excellent with net charge-offs of only 1 basis points and criticized loans have declined to well below our long-term average. As a result, our reserve declined again, and we had a negative provision. Reserve ratio of 1.33% reflects the positive outlook for the economy and our portfolio.
Fee-generating activity remained robust. Third quarter noninterest income was up 11% on a year-over-year basis. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, record warrant income and commercial lending fees were offset by a decline in card fees from elevated levels due to lower levels of government stimulus. Our efficiency ratio held steady at 62% as we continue to focus on supporting revenue-generating activity. This includes our technology investments, which help us attract and retain customers and colleagues by enhancing their overall experience and efficiency. We remain focused on our digital transformation by enabling our business with products and services, modernizing our platform and building our digital future with the right talent, skills and strategy.
As we stated earlier, we continue to manage our capital levels, keeping a close eye on loan trends and capital generation. Using our capital to support our customers and drive growth remains our top priority while providing an attractive return to our shareholders. We, along with our customers and colleagues across our markets, remain optimistic about the future. We expect economic metrics to remain relatively strong over the next year. Our chief economist forecast real GDP to increase 4.5% in 2022, with each of our 3 primary markets of California, Texas and Michigan above that level, which bodes well for growth. And now I will turn the call over to Jim."
318670,695375252,2408124,"Comerica Incorporated, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5. PPP loans decreased $1.8 billion to end the quarter at $1 billion as the forgiveness process accelerated. Excluding the decline in PPP loans, we have good momentum in several business lines. Sp",1775,"Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5. PPP loans decreased $1.8 billion to end the quarter at $1 billion as the forgiveness process accelerated. Excluding the decline in PPP loans, we have good momentum in several business lines. Specifically, we have driven consistent growth in general middle market, equity fund services, environmental services and entertainment. This growth was partially offset by decreases in National Dealer Services and Mortgage Banker. Industry data shows that auto and dealer inventory levels are at a 20- to 25-day supply versus the typical 60 to 70 days due to challenges resulting from chip shortages, labor constraints and foreign nameplate shipping issues. We believe our dealer floor plan balances are very close to the bottom and inventory levels should start to slowly rebuild.
Mortgage Banker loans also declined. Of note, our mix is beneficial with 71% of our loans tied to purchase activity. The expectation is that refi volume should continue to fall as rates increase, however, purchase activity should remain relatively strong. As far as line commitments, we posted another strong quarter with an increase of over $800 million in growth in most business lines. Usage also grew, resulting in the line utilization rate holding steady at 47%. Loan yields increased 14 basis points, including 14 basis points from the net impact of PPP loans and 3 basis points from higher non-PPP fees. This was partly offset by a 3 basis point impact from lower rates, which included swap maturities.
Deposits continue to grow in nearly every business line hitting a new record as shown on Slide 6. The majority of our deposits are noninterest-bearing and the average cost of interest-bearing deposits remained at an all-time low, just below 6 basis points. Our total funding costs held steady at 7 basis points. With strong deposit growth, our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 59%.
Slide 7 provides details on our securities portfolio. We deployed some of our excess liquidity by increasing the size of the securities portfolio by $1 billion or $566 million on average. This allowed us to mitigate the rate headwind resulting in approximately the same level of securities income quarter-over-quarter. MBS purchases in the third quarter had average durations of around 6 years and yields of about 170 basis points. With securities rolling off of rates over 200 basis points, the total portfolio yield declined to 1.76%. Our goal is to continue to offset any pressure from lower reinvestment yields by gradually and opportunistically increasing the portfolio size.
Turning to Slide 8. Net interest income grew $10 million primarily due to an increase in the contribution from loans. However, the net interest margin declined 6 basis points due to the large increase in excess liquidity. As far as the details, interest income on loans increased $7 million and added 6 basis points to the net interest margin. This was driven by 1 additional day in the quarter, which added $4 million, higher loan fees and balances on non-PPP loans together added $5 million and the impact of PPP with higher fees netted against lower balances added $2 million. This was partly offset by lower LIBOR and swap maturity, which together had a $4 million unfavorable impact.
As I mentioned, we neutralized [indiscernible]  from lower securities yields on interest income by increasing the portfolio size. A $4.5 billion increase in average balances of the Fed combined with a 5 basis point increase in the rate paid on these balances, added $3 million and had a 10 basis point negative impact on the margin. Fed deposits remained extraordinarily high at over $20 billion and weighed heavily on the margin with a gross impact of approximately 65 basis points. Given our asset-sensitive balance sheet, the recent steepening of the yield curve is a positive sign for the future. Our models estimate an 11% increase in annual net interest income in the first year when rates gradually rise 100 basis points and of course, the incremental income in year 2 compared to the year 1 increase would be yet higher.
Credit quality was excellent, as shown on Slide 9. Net charge-offs were only $2 million and included $16 million in net recoveries from our Energy business line. Nonperforming assets decreased and remained low at 62 basis points of loans. Also, criticized loans declined in nearly every business line and are now below 4% of total loans. With help from the rise in oil and gas prices, the Energy portfolio had significant decreases in both nonaccrual and criticized loans. Strong credit metrics combined with our growing confidence in sustainable economic growth resulted in a decrease in our allowance for credit losses. Our total reserve ratio remains healthy at 1.33%. Overall, our customers quickly adapted and navigated a very challenging environment. However, we remain vigilant given the potential stress on our customers from supply chain disruptions, labor constraints and inflation.
Noninterest income declined modestly to $280 million following a very strong second quarter as outlined on Slide 10. Warrant related income increased $7 million to an all-time high due to robust IPO and M&A activity. Similarly, commercial lending fees were also a record, driven by a large increase in syndication fees. Deposit service charges grew $3 million as a result of an acceleration in customer activity. Also BOLI income increased primarily due to the receipt of the annual dividend. As expected, government card activity declined as stimulus-related volume waned, however, this was partly offset by increases in merchant, consumer and commercial card activity. Deferred comp asset returns, which is offset in noninterest expenses for less than $1 million compared to $6 million in the second quarter.
Also, derivative income declined $2 million due to reduced customer appetite for interest rate hedges partly offset by robust energy derivative transactions with oil and gas prices hitting multiyear highs. Fiduciary income decreased from a record level in the second quarter as continued strong equity market performance was more than offset by the absence of annual tax service fees.
In summary, we are pleased with another very strong quarter for fee income. As shown on Slide 11, expenses were up $2 million in the quarter. Salaries and benefits increased $5 million, mainly due to an increase in performance-based incentives, which was partly offset by a decline in deferred comp. Also, we had higher software and consulting costs as we progressed on our digital transformation journey and occupancy expense was seasonally higher. In line with lower card fee income, Outside processing decreased $6 million. Litigation costs decreased following the elevated second quarter levels. And finally, FDIC insurance declined due to strong credit quality and higher capital ratios at the bank level. Our stable efficiency ratio is consistent with our commitment to maintaining our strong expense discipline as we invest for the future.
Slide 12 provides details on capital management. Our CET1 ratio decreased to an estimated 10.21%. We repurchased 3 million shares in the third quarter under our share repurchase program. We continue to closely monitor loan growth trends and capital generation as we manage our way towards our 10% CET1 target. In addition, we have maintained a very competitive dividend yield.
Slide 13 provides our outlook for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. Excluding PPP loans, we expect loan growth in several businesses, including general middle market and large corporate. Partly offsetting this growth, we expect continued decline in mortgage banker due to lower refi volumes and seasonality. Of note, we believe auto dealer floor plan loans are close to a bottom. PPP forgiveness is expected to continue and the bulk should be repaid by year-end. As we look forward to next year, we believe loan growth from year-end '21 to year-end '22 should be relatively strong supported by our robust pipeline and expectations that the economy will remain strong.
We expect average deposits to remain elevated as customers continue to generate and maintain excess balances. We expect net interest income in the fourth quarter to be impacted by a decrease in PPP related income from $34 million in the third quarter to be $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter. Ex PPP, we expect net interest income to be relatively stable. Lower fees from elevated third quarter levels and to a lesser extent, maturing swaps are expected to mostly offset the benefit from non-PPP loan growth. As far as next year, putting aside the headwind from the decline in PPP income, we expect to benefit from loan growth.
As I discussed earlier, we are highly sensitive to rate movements, so assumptions for rates are a key determinant for net interest income expectations, including the impact of maturing loan floors and swaps. Credit quality is expected to remain strong. Assuming the economy remains on the current path, we believe the allowance should continue to move towards our prepandemic day 1 CECL reserve of 1.23%. As far as fourth quarter noninterest income, we expect continued solid performance in several customer-driven fee categories, such as deposit service charges, card and derivatives, particularly foreign exchange. More than offsetting this growth, we expect a decrease from record levels of warrant and commercial loan fees as well as elevated BOLI.
We expect 2021 noninterest income will be 1 of the highest we've ever recorded. Certain line items such as card, warrants and derivatives, including [ CVA ], may be difficult to repeat as we look into next year and we assume deferred comp, which is offset in noninterest expense will not repeat. However, we expect strength and growth across many other fee income categories. We expect expenses in the fourth quarter to be relatively stable as we continue to invest for the future, technology investments are expected to rise as they typically do as we approach year-end. In addition, we expect seasonally higher occupancy, advertising and travel and entertainment expenses. This is expected to be offset by a reduction from the third quarter elevated performance-based incentives.
Our planning process for next year is underway. Big picture, we expect compensation to normalize in 2022; however, inflationary pressures could impact a number of line items, including salaries. Also, we are focused on product and market development as well as driving efficiency, which means continued investment in technology. This is particularly important to ensure we continue to be well positioned to assist customers and colleagues given the prospect of strong economic growth for the foreseeable future.
We expect the tax rate to be 22% to 23%, excluding discrete items. And finally, as I indicated on the previous slide, we plan to continue managing towards our CET1 target as we monitor loan trends.
Now I'll turn the call back to Curt."

It probably gave us about 4 bps more than we would typically have during the quarter. And we did get some pressure, likewise going the other direction from a little bit lower LIBOR and the expiring swap that we had at the end of June that carried through the third quarter and that probably put about 3 bps of pressure on the yields in the third quarter. As we look to the fourth quarter, we will continue to have a little bit of pressure from LIBOR continuing to sink. It's not significant. And we do have a swap maturing in early October. So I expect between the swap and lower LIBOR to get about 3 bps of pressure in the fourth quarter.
And then, of course, we're going to have the lower loan fees going to other direction, the 4 bps that were elevated going down a little bit. So those are really the big drivers outside of PPP, which obviously has the biggest impact that you would have to back out."

I'm not surprised by that. I mentioned, I think, previously at conferences or earnings that to the extent the Federal Reserve continues to inject liquidity into the economy and to the extent we continue to have some fiscal spending that in my opinion, pushes the velocity of some of the money supply, I think we'll continue to see growth in deposits.
So it will continue to be strong and even, though, the Federal Reserve may begin tapering later this year. They're still going to be injecting liquidity into the economy. Short-term rates will of course stay low probably for the next few months at least. So I don't see any of this escaping off balance sheet in the money markets and so on.

One thing about the deposit growth is we're adding new customers and so not all those customers are borrowing a lot of money right now, but we are capturing deposits and treasury management and other business with that customer acquisition. And believe, that eventually their borrowings will pick up on their facilities. So I think, Scott, to answer your question, I think utilization rates will creep up. I don't think they're going to go up quickly because they do -- we do think those deposits and liquidity will stay on the balance sheet and I do think you'll see it faster in kind of middle market/business banking before you will, per se, in large corporate, who continues to access the capital markets and handle their balance sheets a little differently."

That's been ingrained in our company for a long time and we have continued to gradually become more efficient in terms of headcount and reduced headcount over time. A lot of leveraging and really changing dynamics in how customers utilize banking services with more customers utilizing mobile banking for online transactions, et cetera, has helped us continue to be very efficient there.
At the same time, we've done a very good job and Peter's area is an example of that of reallocating headcount where we feel like we have a higher growth opportunity in certain business lines. So that remains sort of a key area of focus for us. I do think when you get longer term, we're not -- the industry is not there and we're not there yet either, but with a lot of companies including us is of more flexibility and work schedules, there will be a point where we can start really thinking more about real estate.

That's a significant swing. And so sort of first and foremost for us is always leveraging liquidity as well as capital to lend to our customers. But short of that, we're going to be prudent in sort of how we allocate the excess liquidity we have and try to generate earnings assets for our shareholders.
And I think we can balance both of those.

I mean, $600 million in floor plan balances is about as small as we can get. I suspect the fourth quarter will come down a little bit more.
But what the outlook for dealer is, it is very difficult to determine in this environment. Customers give you feedback that they believe that eventually, we will be in what we've seen in the past and the amount of inventory that's on dealer lots. But today, if you go buy a dealership, there are no cars out there. And I think that's probably going to continue further into next year than maybe many of us have thought.

The shift that we've seen at Comerica and our new leaders in the service company have done a great job of this as we've seen a little bit of a shift between what we call run the bank versus build the bank.

Those carry a gross floor of 71 bps, which if you net that against the 8 to 9 [ bps ] LIBOR, it's got an average carry -- positive carry of about 62 to 63 bps. In terms of trends, we have -- if you look at the various slides we published externally at earnings and conferences and so on, we have seen the amount of floors continue to grow, but the bps received or the bps of floor is starting to slow down a little bit and is shrinking a little bit each quarter. Up until now, that's been a bit of a wash in the last few months or the last quarter or so. That's something we're monitoring very carefully. We do have more maturities coming up related to floors in the next year and so that's something we have our eye on. And as I kind of implied in my opening comments, it could be a bit of a headwind next year.
But having said that, we do have loans coming up for renewals, but never had the opportunity to get a floor. And so we view that as an opportunity. And of course, we have new customer activity where there's an opportunity also. So depending on where all that nets out, will likely tell us where the net impact and the net positive carrier floors is going. But I would say during 2022, it's more likely to be a modest headwind as opposed to a tailwind going forward."

I will say the 1 in the fourth quarter, as I think I implied earlier, that 1 is very early October. So that will be a full fourth quarter impact."
