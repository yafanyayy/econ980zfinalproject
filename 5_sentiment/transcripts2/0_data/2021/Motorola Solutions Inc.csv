I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results as well as our outlook. First, I'm very pleased with our performance during the quarter. We achieved revenue and earnings per share above our guidance, had our largest quarter ever for LMR orders in North America, and we ended the year with record backlog of $11.4 billion, up $175 million versus last year and up $750 million sequentially. Additionally, we generated $703 million of operating cash flow during the quarter and $1.6 billion for the full year. 
Second, our Software and Services segment had another strong quarter as demand for our LMR services, video security and command center software continues to drive growth. For the full year, the segment grew 9%, expanded operating margins by 290 basis points and accounted for 37% of total revenues and 52% of total operating earnings for the entire company. Additionally, the recurring nature of this segment and record ending backlog provides us with good visibility going forward, and we expect another year of strong growth in this segment in 2021. 
Finally, we saw a number of events during the year that continue to reinforce the importance of having secure, reliable, mission-critical communications for first responders. Whether it was the hurricanes in the southeast, fires in California or, more recently, the explosion in Nashville, our LMR networks continued to provide private, secure voice communication to the men and women on the front lines when other networks were down. 
And while we continue to invest in broadband solutions that augment LMR with valuable data and location capabilities, the redundancy, resiliency and reliability that LMR provides during the most critical moments continues to be foundational and a must-have for our customers. I'll now turn the call back over to Jason to take through your results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts."

Our Q4 results included revenue of $2.3 billion, down 4%, including $60 million from acquisitions and $19 million from favorable currency rates.

Our Q4 results included revenue of $2.3 billion, down 4%, including $60 million from acquisitions and $19 million from favorable currency rates. GAAP operating earnings of $555 million and operating margins of 24.4% compared to 24.8% in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $667 million, down $40 million or 6% and non-GAAP operating margins of 29.3%, down from 29.7% due to lower sales in the Products and SI segment, partially offset by higher sales and improved operating leverage in Software and Services. 
GAAP earnings per share of $2.37 compared to $1.39 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a noncash charge of $1.53 booked in Q4 of 2019 related to the actions taken then to derisk our pension. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.86 versus $2.94 last year, down primarily due to lower sales in Products and SI, partially offset by higher sales and improved operating leverage in Software and Services. 
OpEx in Q4 was $492 million, down $31 million versus last year, primarily due to lower discretionary spend, lower incentives and then partially offset by costs related to acquisitions. The Q4 effective tax rate was 21% compared to 22% in the prior year. 
Moving to the full year 2020. Our revenue was $7.4 billion, down 6%, primarily related to lower sales of public safety LMR and PCR products, partially offset by growth in LMR services, growth in video security and growth in command center software. Revenue from acquisitions was $203 million and currency headwinds were $12 million. GAAP operating earnings were $1.4 billion or 18.7% of sales versus 20% in the year prior. The decrease was primarily driven by lower sales in Products and SI, partially offset by higher sales and improved operating leverage in Software and Services. 
Non-GAAP operating earnings were $1.8 billion, down $140 million and non-GAAP operating margins were 24.8% of sales, a decrease of only 20 bps despite the sales declines in Products and SI, driven by the actions we implemented around costs, lower incentives and growth in Software and Services. GAAP earnings per share was $5.45 compared to $4.95 in the prior year, which included the previously mentioned noncash charge for pension. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $7.69, down 3% from $7.96 in 2019 on lower sales and operating earnings, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count in 2020. For the full year, OpEx was $1.8 billion, down $162 million from last year, primarily driven by lower incentives lower discretionary spend and offset by $75 million from acquisitions. And the effective tax rate for 2020 was 20% compared to 22.4% in the prior year on higher R&D tax credits and higher tax benefits from share-based compensation recognized in the current year. 
Turning to cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $703 million compared with $795 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was $637 million compared with $736 million in the prior year. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.6 billion compared to $1.8 billion in the prior year, and free cash flow was $1.4 billion versus $1.6 billion in the prior year. The decrease in cash flow was driven by lower sales and higher cash taxes in the current year, partially offset by improvements in working capital. 
Capital allocation in 2020 for us included $612 million of share repurchases at an average price of $155.93 per share, $436 million in cash dividends and $287 million for acquisitions. Additionally, during the year, we refinanced outstanding debt maturities with a new $900 million 10-year debt issuance at a rate of 2.3% and raised our dividend 11%. 
Moving to our segment results. Q4 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.5 billion, down 10%, primarily due to lower sales of public safety LMR and lower sales of public -- professional and commercial radio, partially offset by growth in video security. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $44 million. Operating earnings were $408 million or 27% of sales, down from 28.9% in the prior year on lower sales. 
Some notable Q4 wins and achievements in this segment include: $122 million P25 order for Nassau County, New York; a $61 million P25 order for state of New Jersey; over $50 million of P25 orders from several large North America utilities customers; a $26 million P25 order for Morris County, New Jersey; and a $20 million TETRA order in the U.K. Additionally, we had another quarter of double-digit growth in fixed video sales into our government customers. 
For the full year, revenue in the segment was $4.6 billion, down 13% from the prior year, driven by lower sales of public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in video security. Revenue from acquisitions was $119 million. Operating earnings were $880 million or 19% of sales, down from 22% in the prior year on lower sales, partially offset by lower operating expenses. 
Moving next to our Software and Services segment. Q4 revenue was $763 million, up 8% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, growth in video security and growth in command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $16 million. Operating earnings were $259 million or 33.9% of sales, up 220 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage. 
Some notable Q4 wins in this segment include: a $100 million P25 managed services contract with the state of Tasmania, Australia; a $79 million TETRA managed services contract extension in Europe; a $30 million P25 multiyear service contract with the Minnesota DOT; a $29 million P25 multiyear service contract with Austin, Texas; and finally, an $11 million award for our command center software contract in New Jersey -- excuse me, in Norway. 
For the full year, revenue was $2.8 billion, up 9% on growth in LMR services, growth in video security and growth in command center software. Revenue from acquisitions was $84 million. Operating earnings in 2020 were $955 million or 34.3% of sales, up 290 basis points versus the prior year, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage. 
Looking next at our regional results. North America Q4 revenue was $1.6 billion, down 4% on declines in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. For the full year, North America revenue was $5.2 billion, down 5%, with declines in public safety LMR and PCR partially offset by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. 
International Q4 revenue was $725 million, down 6% due to declines in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in video security and LMR services. Revenues declined in Latin America and Asia Pac while EMEA was up 2%. And for the full year, international revenue was $2.4 billion, down 8% on declines in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in video security, command center software and LMR services. Revenue declined for the year in Latin America and Asia Pac while EMEA was flat year-over-year. 
Moving to backlog. Our ending backlog was a record $11.4 billion, up $175 million compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $753 million, driven by record LMR orders in North America during the fourth quarter. Software and Services backlog was up $213 million compared to last year, driven by multiyear agreements in North America, partially offset by revenue recognition for Airwave. Sequentially, backlog was up $518 million with growth in both regions. 
Products and SI backlog was down $38 million compared to last year, driven by delays in sales engagements during the year related to COVID-19. Sequentially, backlog was up $236 million in Products and SI, driven by record LMR orders in North America during the fourth quarter. 
Turning next to our outlook. We expect Q1 sales to be up between 5.5% and 6%, with non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.58 and $1.64. This assumes FX at current spot rates, a share count of approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 19%. And for the full year, we expect sales to be up between 7.25% and 8% with mid-single-digit growth in Products and SI and low double-digit growth in Software and Services. And we expect full year non-GAAP EPS between $8.50 and $8.62 per share. This assumes FX at current spot rates and a share count of 170 -- approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of 22.5% to 23%. 
We expect full year operating cash flow of approximately $1.8 billion, which includes an unfavorable year-over-year impact of approximately $125 million related to higher cash taxes. And we expect full year OpEx to be approximately $1.9 billion, which includes a year-over-year increase of $75 million related to higher incentives as we plan for growth and $60 million related to acquisitions closed in 2020, offset by further cost reductions. 
Finally, I'd like to highlight that we are updating our reporting to incorporate and enhance disclosure around our 3 major technologies across both segments. As a result, in our forthcoming 10-K, you will see net sales in our 2 segments reported in the following 3 technologies: LMR mission-critical communications, video security and analytics and command center software. We have provided a supplemental slide in the back of our earnings presentation representing this view for the previous 3 years, and on an ongoing basis, we will incorporate this into our quarterly reporting. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

But first, I want to take a minute to talk about the substantial progress we're making in video security. 3 years ago, we began our investment in video security with our acquisition of Avigilon. Since that time, we've added acquisitions that leverage our scale across our portfolio and AI-powered analytics, NDAA-compliant manufacturing and go-to-market coverage. As a result, we expect to generate over $1 billion in annual revenue this year across our portfolio of video security technologies. This includes our fixed end-to-end video security and access control solutions embedded with advanced analytics and mobile video, which includes purpose-built body-worn and in-car video solutions that are integrated with back-end evidence management software. Additionally, this quarter, we began shipping cameras from our new global NDAA-compliant video manufacturing facility in Richardson, Texas. 
In fixed video, we launched Avigilon Cloud Services last year to connect customers to cloud-based analytics, system management and continuous updates. As customers embrace analytics that convert video into data and the scalability of the cloud to run their operations, we expect this to be a growth driver for the business. 
And in mobile video, this quarter, we'll begin deploying customers on CommandCentral Evidence, which is our next-generation digital evidence management platform and a fully integrated component of our PremierOne Cloud Suite that includes CAD, mobile and record solutions available on the secure Azure Government Cloud. Currently, we have thousands of customers using either our digital evidence management system or command center software, and we believe the intersection of our installed base in mobile video and the command center positions us well for continued growth. 
Second, the investments we're making to integrate video security, command center software and LMR continue. This past summer, we launched Safety Reimagined, focusing the integration of our products into 1 unified ecosystem, helping our customers be more efficient and proactive in their security and safety operations. We're redefining the ease with which our AI-enabled solutions adapt to the needs of our customers by removing system silos, simplifying management and automating workflows for the effective detection, analysis, communication and response to incidents. 
Imagine a scenario where an unusual activity is detected by our Avigilon camera. All security guards with Motorola radios and the vicinity are notified, and the case is automatically and seamlessly open in the incident management system. Simultaneously, live video streams from the relevant cameras are automatically pumped into the Avigilon Control Center, and an operator is able to verify the presence of a suspicious package by leveraging our appearance search feature. This intuitive, easily customizable interaction between technologies is enabled by our new cloud-based business workflow automation software, Orchestra, which we launched just this past week. 
Finally, as we close out literally a year like no other, I want to take a moment to reflect on everything we accomplished as a company. When COVID-19 hit, we moved swiftly and with focus to make a number of immediate decisions, including implementing a work-from-home policy to ensure the safety of our employees and reducing operating expenses, quickly culminating in a $162 million OpEx reduction year-over-year, inclusive of acquisitions. And yet we remain focused on executing in a challenging environment, with Software and Services growing every quarter and Products and SI improving in the second half as we expected. 
We also continue to deploy capital and invest for the future. We launched several new products, accelerated product migration to the cloud across our 3 technologies, acquired 5 companies, refinanced approximately $900 million of debt at very attractive low rates, repurchased $612 million of shares as well. And additionally, with Gino's retirement, we elevated Jason Winkler to the CFO position, a strong example of our readiness and succession planning. 
I am really proud of the way our team performed during an unprecedented year. All that we've accomplished and the improvement in our sales engagements demonstrate the enduring strength and durability of both our business and our people. Ending the year with a record backlog position is a testament to those efforts, and that momentum helps position us well for a year of strong growth, revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. I'll now turn the call back over to Tim."

And then the second one, maybe for you or Jack. On the video side, can you just talk about 2 of the areas, one is on the government side. Government, it sounds like it's going well. How much more room is there for growth as you further penetrate there? And then secondly, what does it take to do a better job on the body cam side? And how do you see that as an opportunity?"

We're matching supply and demand, given some of the supply constraints that we're currently going through. So that's in -- our guidance is informed by those components, and we think our full year is a prudent view, given where we are. 
But I think that I'm really pleased with Q4, in particular, a record quarter in North America, a record quarter specifically with LMR in North America and finishing the year with record backlog are all positive trends. Environmentally, we transitioned from 1 administration to another. I think that what we do rises to the top of the food chain despite Republican or Democratic presidential administrations. I think our federal business, and Jack could talk about it, in 2020 was solid overall. It was down slightly but it was also coming off 2 back-to-back record years. 
But I think that the Biden administration has opportunities for us. I think it's more likely than not that we'll see stimulus but we'll see. And I think that there's also an opportunity perhaps in the new administration for some bipartisan support for potentially an infrastructure bill, which I think foundationally would serve us well.

If you remember, when we acquired Avigilon, it was essentially a nascent business and very strong growth. In fact, fixed video growth in 2020 was north of 45% so we like that. That feels good. 
We also acquired Pelco. And I think it's important to point out that Pelco gave us federal government contractual mechanisms with which to sell upon and we enjoyed that, those contracts in 2020. So we feel good about that, but more importantly, where we're going moving forward in 2021. 
With respect to mobile video, actually, we had a very strong year. If you look at the second half of the year, both Q3 and Q4, orders for body cams were up for us over 60% in both respective quarters. Fundamentally, what we're hearing from our customer base is customers want an alternative. I think with our market reach, our go-to-market coverage, our channels, I think we've got a reach to start to get into suburban rural municipalities as well, which is where we're going to start seeing the next level of decisions. 
The other piece of it that we haven't talked much about was we acquired a company called Edesix to our Avigilon acquisition. We had 2 international wins of over $1 million last year. And again, we think we're well set for the international market. The last thing, and I think that really ties it all together and Greg hit it on the script is the -- we're obviously launching a new digital evidence management platform this year with CommandCentral Evidence. We've got a differentiator in that we -- our body-worn and how mobile video flows ties into our full workflow with CAD mobile records and are obviously digital evidence management. So we think -- we're excited. We think we're well poised for the body-worn space as well."

The backlog position, as you referenced, serves us well. I think the fact of the matter is we're still early days in February and still in the middle of a pandemic. Things are incrementally getting better. And we're still operating at this point, Adam, with some supply constraints and limitations. Now the demand signals are stronger than the current supply constraints that we have.

We also think the integration, a body-worn video and evidence management into the command center, given our incumbency and strong position across the different modules that broaden the whole suite and command center software is -- I like that position. And look, I also think we can grow internationally with body-worn camera. And at the end of the day, the body-worn video addressable market, we think, is about $500 million all-in with body-worn camera and evidence management. I think we have a great opportunity to take share and be a competitive compelling #2.

But I think that the Services business, as we look at it, continues to operate at a steady pace. As Jason just highlighted, we had a number of good orders, managed service orders internationally that either extended existing networks that we had or also added on new ones like the Tasmania transaction that we just discussed. So the Services business continues to be something that demonstrates also the resiliency of LMR and the demand for that because we see our customers continue to renew the contracts that they have at increased rates and on time, which is a very positive indicator of both the compelling nature of our services but also the importance of LMR."

Will -- will that -- is that obviously come at an ASP appreciation for us? It does. 
But I think more importantly, as you look throughout the portfolio, you look at what Kelly has brought to market in command center software. You look at what we're doing from a PCR perspective. Just this week, we announced a category changer in the ion device, which was -- combines a legacy PCR device but also does private LTE and CBRS in 1 device. And so we think some of the investments we've made from an R&D perspective on device refresh, on converging devices and those experiences will continue to provide kind of an upgrade, upsell opportunity for our customers.

And having said that, we expect the current damages award again, I think it's $544 million, we expect that to increase after a court applies a pre- and post-trial interest as well as a compulsory royalty going forward. So stay tuned. We continue to pursue. It will remain front and center, nothing more important than protecting our intellectual property. But none of what I described is reflective of the numbers we talked about today."

The other thing I want to talk about more of a Motorola strategic perspective, is on prior calls, we've talked about you going after acquisitions and targets. I'm sorry if it was mentioned earlier on this call, and I'm essentially just repeating things -- repeating questions already asked, but what is the appetite of Motorola to go out and do same number of deals in 2021 comparable to 2020? Is there appetite for that right now or are you guys in digestion mode?"

But if you take a step back, we -- my priority is investing organically in the business. We have great markets. The technologies of mobile radio, mission critical communications, all the trends around modernizing 911 and command center software, and of course, all things video, fixed video and access control as well as body-worn but these are big addressable markets, in combination, approaching $40 billion of an addressable market. That's probably 3x greater than it was for this company 5 years ago or so. 
So prioritizing new products, and investments, by the way, an investment like the global manufacturing facility for fixed video in Richardson, Texas, to give us better scale, better capacity, lower unit cost. Jack talked about APX NEXT. He talked about TETRA. He talked about PCR. You know we're investing in the cloud. And by the way, we also bought back stock at attractive rates. We look at the long-range plan. We do the DCF. We look at where we think this stock is attractive to buy back, and we've been active on that front as well. $612 million of share repurchase last year, 287 -- or $289 million of acquisitions. And we did another double-digit raise on dividend of 11% of $436 million. 
So yes, we continue to scan acquisition opportunities. There'll probably be more around video security, software and services. But I think we've been good stewards of capital. We'll continue to be responsible on that front. But we like the prospects both organically and inorganically."

Ben, we invested in the Ion because we believe we had an opportunity to create a new category. So some of the things that it does, obviously, when we make an engineering decision to include higher throughput mechanisms like private LTE, CBRS, we want to do though because we have an eye on a workflow that a customer application. 
So as an example, it does image capture. It does scanning. It does things that no radio that we've ever made for the PCR space has ever done. So fundamentally, that creates new opportunities. Think of things like warehousing, manufacturing, even there's hospitality, stadium security type applications. We also think, as we -- Greg referred to Safety Reimagine, as we start to see our video opportunities, access control, merge with PCR opportunities, we think that kind of device plays well into that environment, too. So again, it would be accretive to what we typically do. It redefines the PCR category."

But our goal is to be the best and compelling across all 3 technologies. I mentioned the size of the addressable market. But I also think, and I referenced this a little bit in the opening remarks, I also think the special sauce is the integration of these technologies. 
Not only does not no one else have them but I think you're going to see us integrate them as well. Automated workflow, machine learning, AI-powered analytics that allow -- I mean, there's volumes of video. And how do you see it? How do you watch it? How do you extract it? How do you redact it? How do you push it to an incident to a dispatcher? And we're working not just having best-in-class point products for these technologies, and I like the hand of cards we're playing, but it's the orchestration and the integration led by our Chief Technology Officer, Mahesh Saptharishi, who's making great progress on the orchestration and integration. 
So you think about the things that are going on, whether it's social unrest, wildfires, immigration. There's a lot of trends, socially and environmentally that I think are favorable. There's a lot of technology trends that I think are favorable.

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results as well as our outlook.
First, I'm very pleased with our performance during the quarter. We achieved revenue and earnings per share above our guidance, had our largest quarter ever for LMR orders in North America and we ended the year with record backlog of $11.4 billion, up $175 million versus last year and up $750 million sequentially. Additionally, we generated $703 million of operating cash flow during the quarter and $1.6 billion for the full year.
Second, our Software and Services segment had another strong quarter as demand for our LMR services, video security and command center software continues to drive growth. For the full year, the segment grew 9%, expanded operating margins by 290 basis points and accounted for 37% of total revenues and 52% of total operating earnings for the entire company. Additionally, the recurring nature of this segment and record ending backlog provides us with good visibility going forward, and we expect another year of strong growth in this segment in 2021.
Finally, we saw a number of events during the year that continue to reinforce the importance of having secure, reliable mission-critical communications for first responders. Whether it was the hurricanes in the southeast, fires in California or, more recently, the explosion in Nashville, our LMR networks continued to provide private, secure voice communication to the men and women on the front lines when other networks were down.
And while we continue to invest in broadband solutions that augment LMR with valuable data and location capabilities, the redundancy, resiliency and reliability that LMR provides during the most critical moments continues to be foundational and a must-have for our customers.
I'll now turn the call back over to Jason to take through your results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts."

Our Q4 results included revenue of $2.3 billion, down 4%, including $60 million from acquisitions and $19 million from favorable currency rates. GAAP operating earnings of $555 million and operating margins of 24.4% compared to 24.8% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $667 million, down $40 million or 6% and non-GAAP operating margins of 29.3%, down from 29.7% due to lower sales in the Products and SI segment, partially offset by higher sales and improved operating leverage in Software and Services.
GAAP earnings per share of $2.37 compared to $1.39 in the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a noncash charge of $1.53 booked in Q4 of 2019 related to the actions taken then to derisk our pension. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.86 versus $2.94 last year, down primarily due to lower sales in Products and SI, partially offset by higher sales and improved operating leverage in Software and Services.
OpEx in Q4 was $492 million, down $31 million versus last year, primarily due to lower discretionary spend, lower incentives and then partially offset by costs related to acquisitions. The Q4 effective tax rate was 21% compared to 22% in the prior year.
Moving to the full year 2020. Our revenue was $7.4 billion, down 6%, primarily related to lower sales of public safety LMR and PCR products, partially offset by growth in LMR services, growth in video security and growth in command center software. Revenue from acquisitions was $203 million and currency headwinds were $12 million.
GAAP operating earnings were $1.4 billion, or 18.7% of sales, versus 20% in the year prior. The decrease was primarily driven by lower sales in Products and SI, partially offset by higher sales and improved operating leverage in Software and Services.
Non-GAAP operating earnings were $1.8 billion, down $140 million, and non-GAAP operating margins were 24.8% of sales, a decrease of only 20 bps despite the sales declines in Products and SI, driven by the actions we implemented around costs, lower incentives and growth in Software and Services.
GAAP earnings per share was $5.45 compared to $4.95 in the prior year, which included the previously mentioned noncash charge for pension. Non-GAAP EPS was $7.69, down 3% from $7.96 in 2019 on lower sales and operating earnings, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count in 2020.
For the full year, OpEx was $1.8 billion, down $162 million from last year, primarily driven by lower incentives, lower discretionary spend and offset by $75 million from acquisitions. And the effective tax rate for 2020 was 20% compared to 22.4% in the prior year on higher R&D tax credits and higher tax benefits from share-based compensation recognized in the current year.
Turning to cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $703 million compared with $795 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was $637 million compared with $736 million in the prior year. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.6 billion compared to $1.8 billion in the prior year, and free cash flow was $1.4 billion versus $1.6 billion in the prior year. The decrease in cash flow was driven by lower sales and higher cash taxes in the current year, partially offset by improvements in working capital.
Capital allocation in 2020 for us included: $612 million of share repurchases at an average price of $155.93 per share, $436 million in cash dividends and $287 million for acquisitions. Additionally, during the year, we refinanced outstanding debt maturities with a new $900 million 10-year debt issuance at a rate of 2.3% and raised our dividend 11%.
Moving to our segment results. Q4 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.5 billion, down 10%, primarily due to lower sales of public safety LMR and lower sales of public -- professional and commercial radio, partially offset by growth in video security. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $44 million. Operating earnings were $408 million or 27% of sales, down from 28.9% in the prior year on lower sales.
Some notable Q4 wins and achievements in this segment include: $122 million P25 order for Nassau County, New York; a $61 million P25 order for state of New Jersey; over $50 million of P25 orders from several large North America utilities customers; a $26 million P25 order for Morris County, New Jersey; and a $20 million TETRA order in the U.K. Additionally, we had another quarter of double-digit growth in fixed video sales into our government customers.
For the full year, revenue in the segment was $4.6 billion, down 13% from the prior year, driven by lower sales of public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in video security. Revenue from acquisitions was $119 million. Operating earnings were $880 million, or 19% of sales, down from 22% in the prior year on lower sales, partially offset by lower operating expenses.
Moving next to our Software and Services segment. Q4 revenue was $763 million, up 8% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, growth in video security and growth in command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $16 million. Operating earnings were $259 million, or 33.9% of sales, up 220 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage.
Some notable Q4 wins in this segment include: a $100 million P25 managed services contract with the state of Tasmania, Australia; a $79 million TETRA managed services contract extension in Europe; a $30 million P25 multiyear service contract with the Minnesota DOT; a $29 million P25 multiyear service contract with Austin, Texas; and finally, an $11 million award for a command center software contract in New Jersey -- excuse me, in Norway.
For the full year, revenue was $2.8 billion, up 9% on growth in LMR services, growth in video security and growth in command center software. Revenue from acquisitions was $84 million. Operating earnings in 2020 were $955 million, or 34.3% of sales, up 290 basis points versus the prior year, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage.
Looking next at our regional results. North America Q4 revenue was $1.6 billion, down 4% on declines in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. For the full year, North America revenue was $5.2 billion, down 5%, with declines in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software.
International Q4 revenue was $725 million, down 6% due to declines in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in video security and LMR services. Revenues declined in Latin America and Asia Pac while EMEA was up 2%. And for the full year, international revenue was $2.4 billion, down 8% on declines in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in video security, command center software and LMR services. Revenue declined for the year in Latin America and Asia Pac while EMEA was flat year-over-year.
Moving to backlog. Our ending backlog was a record $11.4 billion, up $175 million compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $753 million, driven by record LMR orders in North America during the fourth quarter. Software and Services backlog was up $213 million compared to last year, driven by multiyear agreements in North America, partially offset by revenue recognition for Airwave. Sequentially, backlog was up $518 million, with growth in both regions.
Products and SI backlog was down $38 million compared to last year, driven by delays in sales engagements during the year related to COVID-19. Sequentially, backlog was up $236 million in Products and SI, driven by record LMR orders in North America during the fourth quarter.
Turning next to our outlook. We expect Q1 sales to be up between 5.5% and 6%, with non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.58 and $1.64. This assumes FX at current spot rates, a share count of approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 19%. And for the full year, we expect sales to be up between 7.25% and 8%, with mid-single-digit growth in Products and SI and low double-digit growth in Software and Services. And we expect full year non-GAAP EPS between $8.50 and $8.62 per share. This assumes FX at current spot rates and a share count of 170 -- approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of 22.5% to 23%.
We expect full year operating cash flow of approximately $1.8 billion, which includes an unfavorable year-over-year impact of approximately $125 million related to higher cash taxes. And we expect full year OpEx to be approximately $1.9 billion, which includes a year-over-year increase of $75 million related to higher incentives as we plan for growth and $60 million related to acquisitions closed in 2020, offset by further cost reductions.
Finally, I'd like to highlight that we are updating our reporting to incorporate and enhance disclosure around our 3 major technologies across both segments. As a result, in our forthcoming 10-K, you will see net sales in our 2 segments reported in the following 3 technologies: LMR, mission-critical communications, video security and analytics and command center software. We have provided a supplemental slide in the back of our earnings presentation representing this view for the previous 3 years, and on an ongoing basis, we will incorporate this into our quarterly reporting.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

But first, I want to take a minute to talk about the substantial progress we're making in video security. 3 years ago, we began our investment in video security with our acquisition of Avigilon. Since that time, we've added acquisitions that leverage our scale across our portfolio in AI-powered analytics, NDAA-compliant manufacturing and go-to-market coverage. As a result, we expect to generate over $1 billion in annual revenue this year across our portfolio of video security technologies. This includes our fixed end-to-end video security and access control solutions embedded with advanced analytics, and mobile video, which includes purpose-built body-worn and in-car video solutions that are integrated with back-end evidence management software. Additionally, this quarter, we began shipping cameras from our new global NDAA-compliant video manufacturing facility in Richardson, Texas.
In fixed video, we launched Avigilon Cloud Services last year to connect customers to cloud-based analytics, system management and continuous updates. As customers embrace analytics that convert video into data and the scalability of the cloud to run their operations, we expect this to be a growth driver for the business.
And in mobile video, this quarter, we'll begin deploying customers on CommandCentral Evidence, which is our next-generation digital evidence management platform and a fully integrated component of our PremierOne Cloud Suite that includes CAD, mobile and record solutions available on the secure Azure Government Cloud. Currently, we have thousands of customers using either our digital evidence management system or command center software, and we believe the intersection of our installed base in mobile video and the command center positions us well for continued growth.
Second, the investments we're making to integrate video security, command center software and LMR continue. This past summer, we launched Safety Reimagined, focusing the integration of our products into 1 unified ecosystem, helping our customers be more efficient and proactive in their security and safety operations. We're redefining the ease with which our AI-enabled solutions adapt to the needs of our customers by removing system silos, simplifying management and automating workflows for the effective detection, analysis, communication and response to incidents.
Imagine a scenario where an unusual activity is detected by our Avigilon camera, all security guards with Motorola radios in the vicinity are notified, and a case is automatically and seamlessly opened in the incident management system. Simultaneously, live video streams from the relevant cameras are automatically pumped into the Avigilon control center, and an operator is able to verify the presence of a suspicious package by leveraging our appearance search feature. This intuitive, easily customizable interaction between technologies is enabled by our new cloud-based business workflow automation software, Orchestrate, which we launched just this past week.
Finally, as we close out literally a year like no other, I want to take a moment to reflect on everything we accomplished as a company. When COVID-19 hit, we moved swiftly and with focus to make a number of immediate decisions, including implementing a work-from-home policy to ensure the safety of our employees and reducing operating expenses, quickly culminating in a $162 million OpEx reduction year-over-year, inclusive of acquisitions. And yet we remain focused on executing in a challenging environment, with Software and Services growing every quarter and Products and SI improving in the second half as we expected.
We also continued to deploy capital and invest for the future. We launched several new products, accelerated product migration to the cloud across our 3 technologies, acquired 5 companies, refinanced approximately $900 million of debt at very attractive low rates, repurchased $612 million of shares as well. And additionally, with Gino's retirement, we elevated Jason Winkler to the CFO position, a strong example of our readiness and succession planning.
I am really proud of the way our team performed during an unprecedented year. All that we've accomplished and the improvement in our sales engagements demonstrate the enduring strength and durability of both our business and our people, ending the year with a record backlog position is a testament to those efforts, and that momentum helps position us well for a year of strong growth, revenue, earnings and cash flow growth.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tim."

And then the second one, maybe for you or Jack. On the video side, can you just talk about 2 of the areas, one is on the government side. Government, it sounds like it's going well. How much more room is there for growth as you further penetrate there? And then secondly, what does it take to do a better job on the body cam side? And how do you see that as an opportunity?"

So that's in -- our guidance is informed by those components, and we think our full year is a prudent view, given where we are. But I think that I'm really pleased with Q4, in particular, a record quarter in North America, a record quarter specifically with LMR in North America and finishing the year with record backlog are all positive trends.
Environmentally, we transitioned from 1 administration to another. I think that what we do rises to the top of the food chain despite Republican or Democratic presidential administrations. I think our federal business, and Jack could talk about it, in 2020 was solid overall. It was down slightly but it was also coming off 2 back-to-back record years. But I think that the Biden administration has opportunities for us. I think it's more likely than not that we'll see stimulus but we'll see. And I think that there's also an opportunity perhaps in the new administration for some bipartisan support for potentially an infrastructure bill, which I think foundationally would serve us well.

So Tim, just to kind of decompose your 2 questions, number one, in terms of our fixed video government sales, we're really pleased with the progress. If you remember, when we acquired Avigilon, it was essentially a nascent business and very strong growth. In fact, fixed video growth in 2020 was north of 45%. So we like that. That feels good. We also acquired Pelco. And I think it's important to point out that Pelco gave us federal government contractual mechanisms with which to sell upon and we enjoyed that, those contracts in 2020. So we feel good about that, but more importantly, where we're going moving forward in 2021. 
With respect to mobile video, actually, we had a very strong year. If you look at the second half of the year, both Q3 and Q4, orders for body cams were up for us over 60% in both respective quarters. Fundamentally, what we're hearing from our customer base is customers want an alternative. I think with our market reach, our go-to-market coverage, our channels, I think we've got a reach to start to get into suburban rural municipalities as well, which is where we're going to start seeing the next level of decisions.
The other piece of it that we haven't talked much about was we acquired a company called Edesix to our Avigilon acquisition. We had 2 international wins of over $1 million last year. And again, we think we're well set for the international market. The last thing, and I think that really ties it all together and Greg hit it on the script is the -- we're obviously launching a new digital evidence management platform this year with CommandCentral Evidence. We've got a differentiator in that we are body-worn, and how mobile video flows ties into our full workflow with CAD mobile records in our, obviously, digital evidence management. So we think -- we're excited. We think we're well poised for the body-worn space as well."

The backlog position, as you referenced, serves us well. I think the fact of the matter is we're still early days in February and still in the middle of a pandemic. Things are incrementally getting better. And we're still operating, at this point, Adam, with some supply constraints and limitations. Now the demand signals are stronger than the current supply constraints that we have.

Now there's a more compelling viable choice as an alternative in Motorola Solutions. I think Jack referenced the strong order activity that he saw in Q3 and Q4. I think that serves us well.
We also think the integration of body-worn video and evidence management into the command center, given our incumbency and strong position across the different modules that broaden the whole suite in command center software is -- I like that position. And look, I also think we can grow internationally with body-worn camera. And at the end of the day, the body-worn video addressable market, we think, is about $500 million all-in with body-worn camera and evidence management. I think we have a great opportunity to take share and be a competitive compelling #2.
But I also like the fixed video and access control addressable market being a multiple of that. Without China, we think it's about $15 billion. So there's a lot of room to run across the technologies, inclusive of body-worn. But I think historically that market has been served by 1 provider."

But I think that the Services business, as we look at it, continues to operate at a steady pace. As Jason just highlighted, we had a number of good orders, managed service orders internationally that either extended existing networks that we had or also added on new ones like the Tasmania transaction that we just discussed.

But I think more importantly, as you look throughout the portfolio, you look at what Kelly has brought to market in command center software. You look at what we're doing from a PCR perspective. Just this week, we announced a category changer in the Ion device, which was -- combines a legacy PCR device but also does private LTE and CBRS in 1 device.

Now it will be incrementally as these -- a number of different key verticals like transportation, airline, hospitality, oil and gas as they improve. But 2020 was pretty draconian. I look at it as more or less a floor, and our expectation is for PCR to return to growth in 2021. Now having said that, we still have to operate and execute on that against the supply constraints and limitations that are in front of us.

They stole trade secrets. They infringed, and they infringed on a copyright source code. So that's unchanged.
And having said that, we expect the current damages award, again, I think it's $544 million, we expect that to increase after a court applies a pre- and post-trial interest as well as a compulsory royalty going forward.

That's probably 3x greater than it was for this company 5 years ago or so.
So prioritizing new products and investments. By the way, an investment like the global manufacturing facility for fixed video in Richardson, Texas to give us better scale, better capacity, lower unit cost. Jack talked about APX NEXT. He talked about TETRA. He talked about PCR. You know we're investing in the cloud. And by the way, we also bought back stock at attractive rates. We look at the long-range plan. We do the DCF. We look at where we think this stock is attractive to buy back, and we've been active on that front as well. $612 million of share repurchase last year, 287 -- or $289 million of acquisitions. And we did another double-digit raise on dividend of 11% of $436 million.
So yes, we continue to scan acquisition opportunities. They'll probably be more around video security, Software and Services. But I think we've been good stewards of capital. We'll continue to be responsible on that front. But we like the prospects both organically and inorganically."

So as an example, it does image capture. It does scanning. It does things that no radio that we've ever made for the PCR space has ever done. So fundamentally, that creates new opportunities.

How do you push it to an incident, to a dispatcher?

I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through results and our outlook. First, Q1 was an excellent quarter. We achieved Q1 records for sales, operating earnings and cash flow. We expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and ended the quarter with backlog of $11.3 billion, up 8% versus last year. Additionally, demand remains strong, resulting in orders that were higher than any other first quarter in our history. Second, our Software and Services segment had another outstanding quarter and continues to drive revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Sales for the quarter were up 15%, driven by growth across our LMR, video security and command center software technologies. And the segment also finished with operating margins up 310 basis points versus last year. 
And finally, based on the increased demand we're seeing across our business and our strong backlog position, we're raising our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share for the full year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts."

Our Q1 results included revenue of $1.8 billion, up 7%, including $48 million from acquisitions and $32 million from favorable currency. GAAP operating earnings of $298 million and operating margins of 16.8% of sales compared to 15.6% in",996,"Thank you, Greg. Our Q1 results included revenue of $1.8 billion, up 7%, including $48 million from acquisitions and $32 million from favorable currency. GAAP operating earnings of $298 million and operating margins of 16.8% of sales compared to 15.6% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $411 million, up $64 million or 18%, and non-GAAP operating margins of 23.2% of sales, up from 21%, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments. 
GAAP earnings per share of $1.41 compared to $1.12 in the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, improved operating leverage and lower legal fees, partially offset by the gain from the sale of a manufacturing facility recognized in the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.87 compared to $1.49 last year, primarily due to higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments, higher pension income and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. 
OpEx in Q1 was $455 million, up $4 million versus last year, primarily due to costs related to acquisitions, partially offset by lower discretionary spend. 
Turning to cash flow. Our Q1 operating cash flow was $370 million compared with $308 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was $318 million compared with $260 million in the prior year. The increase in cash flow was primarily due to higher sales and improved working capital, partially offset by higher cash taxes. Capital allocation for Q1 included $170 million of share repurchases at an average price of $1.75 and $0.53, $121 million in cash dividends and $52 million of CapEx. 
During the quarter, we entered into a new 5-year $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, replacing our prior $2.2 billion facility. And subsequent to quarter end, the Board of Directors approved a $2 billion increase to the share repurchase program. 
Moving to our segment results. Q1 products and systems integration sales were $1 billion, up 2% and primarily driven by growth in video security and professional and commercial radio, partially offset by lower sales of public safety LMR, which were impacted by supply constraints. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $35 million. 
Operating earnings were $131 million or 12.9% of sales, up from 12.4% in the year prior on higher sales and improved leverage. Some notable Q1 wins and achievements in this segment include a $300 million frame agreement with the German MOD to meet their TETRA LMR requirements with an initial order of $154 million recorded in Q1. $72 million of video sales with government customers, up 32% from last year, a $37 million P25 upgrade for a government agency in Canada, a $33 million TETRA upgrade for a large customer in Europe, and a $12 million P25 order with a large U.S. federal customer. 
Moving to the Software and Services segment. Q1 revenue was $758 million, up 15% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $13 million. Operating earnings were $280 million or 36.9% of sales, up 310 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved leverage. Some notable Q1 wins in the segment include [ over ] $40 million of orders for P25 services, upgrades and body-worn cameras with Nashville, Tennessee. A $35 million push-to-talk over broadband multiyear contract with a large U.S. customer, a $22 million P25 and push-to-talk over broadband contract from a large middle eastern customer $13 million of body-worn cameras with multiple U.K. customers and our largest cloud-based command center software win to date. A $5 million contract with St. Lucie, Florida. 
Additionally, we announced a new product integration between our V300 body 1 camera and our APX P25 radio platform. Looking at our regional results. North America Q1 revenue was $1.2 billion, up 6% on growth in LMR, video security and command center software. International Q1 revenue of $588 million, was up 9%, with growth in EMEA, Asia Pac and Latin America. The growth was driven by video security and LMR. 
Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q1 record of $11.3 billion, up $866 million compared to last year, driven by $639 million of growth in North America and $227 million of growth internationally. Sequentially, backlog was down $130 million, driven by revenue recognition on the Airwave and ESN contracts, partially offset with international growth in LMR products. Software and Services backlog was up $548 million compared to last year, driven by $491 million of growth in multiyear LMR services and command center software contracts in North America, and $58 million of international software growth. The favorable impact of FX to backlog was offset by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN. 
Sequentially, backlog was down $269 million, also driven by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN. Products and SI backlog was $318 million compared -- up $318 million compared to last year. Primarily driven by LMR growth in both regions. Sequentially, backlog was up $139 million, driven by international LMR growth. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up between 19% and 20%, with non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.90 and $1.95 per share. This assumes FX at current spot rates, weighted average diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. And for the full year, we now expect sales to be up between 8% and 9%, an increase from our prior guide of 7.25% to 8%. And we expect full year non-GAAP EPS between $8.70 and $8.80 per share up from our prior guidance of $8.50 to $8.62 per share. This increased outlook includes the ongoing supply chain constraints, primarily in LMR products and assumes FX at current spot rates, a weighted average diluted share count of 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of 22.5% to 23%. 
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

We achieved Q1 record sales, orders, operating earnings and cash flow. Expanded both gross and operating margins, achieved double-digit growth in video security, command center software and LMR services and our PCR business returned to growth. Additionally, we exited the quarter with a record Q1 backlog and continued strong demand that we expect will drive growth for the remainder of the year, inclusive of the supply challenges that we have. We also announced today that the Board approved a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase program. The second thing I would say is demand in our video security business is really strong. And we now expect full year growth to be 20% plus, up from the high teens we referenced on our last call. In fixed video, which makes up approximately 70% of the total video security revenue our investments in AI analytics, cloud services, access control and NDAA compliant manufacturing is differentiating us from our competitors and driving growth faster than the overall market. And in mobile video, the call for more transparency is driving growth for our purpose-built body warn and in-car camera solutions, and we're gaining share in a market that has predominantly been served by 1 vendor. 
During the quarter, we had several large body-worn camera wins, both in the U.S. and internationally. Just this morning, we announced the $17.5 million contract to provide about 30,000 body-worn cameras to the French Ministry of Interior. Additionally, during the quarter, we announced 2 new offerings, the integration of our V300 body-worn camera with our APX P25 radios, which allow us to leverage our market-leading LMR installed base and our $49 per month body-worn camera as a service offering, which offers every police agency in the U.S. with affordable access to a video solution that's fully integrated with our command central software suite. And finally, I'm very pleased with our progress in leveraging our leading installed base in LMR to expand into command center software video security and LMR services. Today, almost half our revenue is generated from these higher growth areas, up from 20% 5 years ago, and our addressable market has tripled over that same period of time. And while we've made significant progress, I absolutely believe we still have a long runway ahead as we continue to deploy capital both organically and inorganically in these areas to drive revenue, margin and cash flow for the company. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tim and look forward to your questions."

How much traction are you seeing there? And then second, maybe Greg or Jack, talk a little bit about the body warn area. It doesn't seem like you guys are seeing more traction there and making it a little bit more of a focus. Can you talk a little bit about kind of go-to-market sales force push there? And if you could just remind us also for that business, how important and how meaningful is kind of the software and on the back end of the actual body-worn camera sale?"

Both fixed video and mobile. I think Molloy and [indiscernible] and the entire team has done a great job on investing in additional go-to-market refreshing the product portfolio, both in fixed video, body-worn camera and mobile video. As I mentioned also, I think the secret sauce for us is to not just have great products in video, but also the integration and orchestration of that with the installed base that we have with thousands of LMR and PCR networks around the world. I'm thrilled with the progress in body-worn camera, both domestically and internationally. We had the big announcement this morning with the French Minister of Interior, but we're taking share. We're clearly -- I think we've been doing that since late last year, the second half of 2020. And it's pretty clear as well that we're taking share and we took share in and Jack may want to talk about the progress in public safety as well, which I'm pleased with."

Just maybe one point to follow-on topic, Greg.

First of all, as it relates to body warn, if you look at the data that was just released by our competitor, Axon and ourselves, they grew their shipments 16% in Q1. That's 7,000 units in an absolute perspective. Whereby, we grew body warn shipments, 104%, which is 11,500 units. So I think that's indicative of the share we've taken. The second thing, Tim, I think you talked about, in general, our video business into government. And if you remember, that was a largely nascent business for us just a few years ago, will eclipse $300 million to start there. And I think that really plays on, as Greg said, both strength in fixed and mobile. And I think we stand at the intersection of 2 really important things: transparency and government efficiency. The last thing I'd close with is the American rescue plan puts us in play for multiyear tailwinds as it relates to incremental public safety spend, spend around education, we're fixing schools with both video security and access control as well. So I feel good, as Greg said, just to reiterate a few of those points and add a little deeper, but feel good all on government."

This past quarter, you may have seen we announced our CC Command Central evidence platform, which is our new Azure based cloud platform, which works seamlessly with all of our body-worn video to help manage the body-worn video and in-car video that comes in. And that's important because it doesn't just work with our body-worn video. It also works seamlessly with the whole command center software suite that we have. Evidence being managing the body-worn video, but it integrates seamlessly with the entirety our records platform as well. So they all play together and work well together, and we're making the investments across the board, as Jack referenced on body-worn and, of course, also on the software that handles at the back end."

It's a bit distorted for us and other companies given the Q2 pronounced COVID effect. But nonetheless, I'm very happy with what we did in Q1. I'm pleased with how we're guiding Q2. And I remind you, Adam, also, $90 million of FX favorability is in the first half. It's more like $30 million to $40 million in the second half. But also as it relates to supply, we're still operating under the current environment, which is generally comparable to what it was when we talked to you a quarter ago. Although I would point out, while it remains challenging, the team did a nice job working with some key suppliers pulling forward key components to execute and print Q1. They're also doing it again, which is informing and driving a very healthy guide in Q2. And so while the supply environment remains challenging, we'll look to continue on those improvements in the back half. But at this point in time, and given the fact that the pandemic is still there, we just thought it was a prudent guide."

If you take operating margins we're now anticipating operating margin expansion in software and services to be up about 140 basis points. That's an increase from what we talked about a quarter ago by 40 basis points, and we expect product segment operating margins to grow as well, more commensurate with volume. In terms of the demand environment, I think it's partially pent-up demand. I think things are reopening as the pandemic, depending upon the geography, relieves itself and the economy starts to get back into a strong rhythm of expansion from a stimulus standpoint, there's a lot of money available to our customers, particularly on the public safety side, both around the Cares Act, which was already in place for 2020 and continues on through 2021 as well as the American Rescue plan, which is new available money in the Biden $1.9 trillion plan. There's $350 billion for state and local funding. There's $170 billion for school funding. There's $38 billion for airports in transit. And a lot of money. The other important thing is that these funds are available for about the next 3 to 3.5 years. So our customers will have available grant money. The environment is remaining strong and gets stronger in public safety the PCR business on the enterprise side grew at 8% in Q1, and we are reaffirming its growth all in for this year.

There's $170 billion directed to school funding that runs through September of '23. So we've really got a duality of opportunities with education.

So think about you get an intrusion on the door, access control sends a signal to a PCR radio, whereby every teacher might have 1 and the level of security that it enhances at schools has been impressive, and I think resonates with our customers. So we're really excited. Actually and my career here, this is probably the best opportunity set we've had in education."

We have a selling process that looks at every technology we make, every government agency or every enterprise decision-maker that we have, and we do really a 3-dimensional view on any account. We're continually talking about not only our core technologies, but our emerging technologies with those customers. So in the mind of a customer, you first of all have to identify a need. The second thing is really how do you fund it. So you asked the question, what is the ARP plan done. It's alleviated a lot of concerns around visibility to money. And so in that sense, in some ways, it's never easy to make a sale. But in a lot of ways, it clears up one of the biggest obstacles to sale. The great news is, albeit that there's some of the deadlines on this funding, go all the way out to 2024. The reality is that there is no reason or no prohibition to spend that money earlier. So our sales team, obviously, has had many, many years at this with funding, and we can provide different incentives, et cetera, to get customers to move faster, if that may be the case. But just knowing they have visibility to that money, I think, provides a very good environment for us."

And this is some of the strongest momentum I've seen in a long time. We have to deliver, we got to execute. We have to navigate supply challenges. There's always a lot to do. But I'm really proud of everybody here on the team. Everybody knows their role. There's no confusion about what we're trying to do. And between the deployment of capital organically and inorganically, and there remains some interesting inorganic opportunities. It's all about driving sustained shareholder value creation. And I don't mean to sound corny. But I think generally, we've been good stewards of capital. We have the expansion of the share repurchase program, although that doesn't -- that's -- we did that because the previous program was running out. But the capital allocation framework that we think about 50% for acquisitions and share repurchase and 30% for dividend and 20% for CapEx and a normalized balance sheet continues. So stay tuned for the opportunities in front, but we're looking to and by the way, it's not just about 2021. I want to make sure that we continue this momentum in 2022 and beyond. So lots more work to do, but I like the cards we have."

First, Q1 was an excellent quarter. We achieved Q1 records for sales, operating earnings and cash flow. We expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and ended the quarter with backlog of $11.3 billion, up 8% versus last year. Additionally, demand remains strong, resulting in orders that were higher than any other first quarter in our history. Second, our Software and Services segment had another outstanding quarter and continues to drive revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Sales for the quarter were up 15%, driven by growth across our LMR, video security and command center software technologies. And the segment also finished with operating margins up 310 basis points versus last year.
And finally, based on the increased demand we're seeing across our business and our strong backlog position, we're raising our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share for the full year.

Our Q1 results included revenue of $1.8 billion, up 7%, including $48 million from acquisitions and $32 million from favorable currency. GAAP operating earnings of $298 million and operating margins of 16.8% of sales compared to 15.6% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $411 million, up $64 million or 18%, and non-GAAP operating margins of 23.2% of sales, up from 21%, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments. 
GAAP earnings per share of $1.41 compared to $1.12 in the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, improved operating leverage and lower legal fees, partially offset by the gain from the sale of a manufacturing facility recognized in the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.87 compared to $1.49 last year, primarily due to higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments, higher pension income and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.
OpEx in Q1 was $455 million, up $4 million versus last year, primarily due to costs related to acquisitions, partially offset by lower discretionary spend.
Turning to cash flow. Our Q1 operating cash flow was $370 million compared with $308 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was $318 million compared with $260 million in the prior year. The increase in cash flow was primarily due to higher sales and improved working capital, partially offset by higher cash taxes. Capital allocation for Q1 included $170 million of share repurchases at an average price of $175.53, $121 million in cash dividends and $52 million of CapEx.
During the quarter, we entered into a new 5-year $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, replacing our prior $2.2 billion facility. And subsequent to quarter end, the Board of Directors approved a $2 billion increase to the share repurchase program.
Moving to our segment results. Q1 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1 billion, up 2%, primarily driven by growth in video security and professional and commercial radio, partially offset by lower sales of public safety LMR, which were impacted by supply constraints. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $35 million.
Operating earnings were $131 million or 12.9% of sales, up from 12.4% in the year prior on higher sales and improved leverage. Some notable Q1 wins and achievements in this segment include a $300 million frame agreement with the German MOD to meet their TETRA LMR requirements with an initial order of $154 million recorded in Q1. $72 million of video sales with government customers, up 32% from last year. A $37 million P25 upgrade for a government agency in Canada. A $33 million TETRA upgrade for a large customer in Europe. And a $12 million P25 order with a large U.S. federal customer.
Moving to the Software and Services segment. Q1 revenue was $758 million, up 15% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $13 million. Operating earnings were $280 million or 36.9% of sales, up 310 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved leverage. 
Some notable Q1 wins in the segment include, over $40 million of orders for P25 services, upgrades and body-worn cameras with Nashville, Tennessee. A $35 million push-to-talk over broadband multiyear contract with a large U.S. customer, a $22 million P25 and push-to-talk over broadband contract from a large middle eastern customer. The $13 million of body-worn cameras with multiple U.K. customers and our largest cloud-based command center software win to date. A $5 million contract with St. Lucie, Florida.
Additionally, we announced a new product integration between our V300 body-worn camera and our APX P25 radio platform. 
Looking at our regional results. North America Q1 revenue was $1.2 billion, up 6% on growth in LMR, video security and command center software. International Q1 revenue of $588 million, was up 9%, with growth in EMEA, Asia Pac and Latin America. The growth was driven by video security and LMR.
Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q1 record of $11.3 billion, up $866 million compared to last year, driven by $639 million of growth in North America and $227 million of growth internationally. Sequentially, backlog was down $130 million, driven by revenue recognition on the Airwave and ESN contracts, partially offset with international growth in LMR products. 
Software and Services backlog was up $548 million compared to last year, driven by $491 million of growth in multiyear LMR services and command center software contracts in North America, and $58 million of international software growth. The favorable impact of FX to backlog was offset by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN.
Sequentially, backlog was down $269 million, also driven by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN. Products and SI backlog was $318 million compared -- up $318 million compared to last year. Primarily driven by LMR growth in both regions. Sequentially, backlog was up $139 million, driven by international LMR growth.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up between 19% and 20%, with non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.90 and $1.95 per share. This assumes FX at current spot rates, weighted average diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. And for the full year, we now expect sales to be up between 8% and 9%, an increase from our prior guide of 7.25% to 8%. And we expect full year non-GAAP EPS between $8.70 and $8.80 per share, up from our prior guidance of $8.50 to $8.62 per share. This increased outlook includes the ongoing supply chain constraints, primarily in LMR products and assumes FX at current spot rates. A weighted average diluted share count of 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of 22.5% to 23%.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

We achieved Q1 record sales, orders, operating earnings and cash flow. Expanded both gross and operating margins, achieved double-digit growth in video security, command center software and LMR services and our PCR business returned to growth. 
Additionally, we exited the quarter with a record Q1 backlog and continued strong demand that we expect will drive growth for the remainder of the year, inclusive of the supply challenges that we have. We also announced today that the Board approved a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase program. 
The second thing I would say is demand in our video security business is really strong. And we now expect full year growth to be 20% plus, up from the high teens we referenced on our last call. In fixed video, which makes up approximately 70% of the total video security revenue, our investments in AI analytics, cloud services, access control and NDAA-compliant manufacturing is differentiating us from our competitors and driving growth faster than the overall market. And in mobile video, the call for more transparency is driving growth for our purpose-built body-worn and in-car camera solutions, and we're gaining share in a market that has predominantly been served by 1 vendor. During the quarter, we had several large body-worn camera wins, both in the U.S. and internationally. Just this morning, we announced the $17.5 million contract to provide about 30,000 body-worn cameras to the French Ministry of Interior. 
Additionally, during the quarter, we announced 2 new offerings, the integration of our V300 body-worn camera with our APX P25 radios, which allow us to leverage our market-leading LMR installed base and our $49 per month body-worn camera as a service offering, which offers every police agency in the U.S. with affordable access to a video solution that's fully integrated with our command central software suite. 
And finally, I'm very pleased with our progress in leveraging our leading installed base in LMR to expand into command center software, video security and LMR services. Today, almost half our revenue is generated from these higher growth areas, up from 20% 5 years ago, and our addressable market has tripled over that same period of time. 
And while we've made significant progress, I absolutely believe we still have a long runway ahead as we continue to deploy capital both organically and inorganically in these areas to drive revenue, margin and cash flow for the company. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tim and look forward to your questions."

I'm thrilled with the progress in body-worn camera, both domestically and internationally. We had the big announcement this morning with the French Minister of Interior, but we're taking share. 
We're clearly -- I think we've been doing that since late last year, the second half of 2020. And it's pretty clear as well that we're taking share, and we took share in. And Jack may want to talk about the progress in public safety as well, which I'm pleased with."

First of all, as it relates to body-worn, if you look at the data that was just released by our competitor, Axon and ourselves, they grew their shipments 16% in Q1. That's 7,000 units in an absolute perspective. Whereby, we grew body-worn shipments 104%, which is 11,500 units. So I think that's indicative of the share we've taken. 
The second thing, Tim, I think you talked about, in general, our video business into government. And if you remember, that was a largely nascent business for us just a few years ago, will eclipse $300 million to start there. And I think that really plays on, as Greg said, both strength in fixed and mobile. And I think we stand at the intersection of 2 really important things: transparency and government efficiency. 
The last thing I'd close with is the American Rescue Plan puts us in play for multiyear tailwinds as it relates to incremental public safety spend, spend around education, we're fixing schools with both video security and access control as well. So I feel good, as Greg said, just to reiterate a few of those points and add a little deeper, but feel good all in on government."

And that's important because it doesn't just work with our body-worn video, it also works seamlessly with the whole command center software suite that we have. Evidence being managing the body-worn video, but it integrates seamlessly with the entirety our records platform as well. 
So they all play together and work well together, and we're making the investments across the board, as Jack referenced on body-worn and, of course, also on the software that handles it at the back end."

Now having said that, right, if you look at first half/second half growth, obviously, first half growth for us this year is very high. It's a bit distorted for us and other companies given the Q2 pronounced COVID effect. But nonetheless, I'm very happy with what we did in Q1. I'm pleased with how we're guiding Q2. 
And I remind you, Adam, also, $90 million of FX favorability is in the first half. It's more like $30 million to $40 million in the second half. But also as it relates to supply, we're still operating under the current environment, which is generally comparable to what it was when we talked to you a quarter ago. Although I would point out, while it remains challenging, the team did a nice job working with some key suppliers pulling forward key components to execute and print Q1. 
They're also doing it again, which is informing and driving a very healthy guide in Q2. And so while the supply environment remains challenging, we'll look to continue on those improvements in the back half. But at this point in time, and given the fact that the pandemic is still there, we just thought it was a prudent guide."

That's an increase from what we talked about a quarter ago by 40 basis points, and we expect product segment operating margins to grow as well, more commensurate with volume. 
In terms of the demand environment, I think it's partially pent-up demand. I think things are reopening as the pandemic, depending upon the geography, relieves itself and the economy starts to get back into a strong rhythm of expansion. From a stimulus standpoint, there's a lot of money available to our customers, particularly on the public safety side, both around the Cares Act, which was already in place for 2020 and continues on through 2021 as well as the American Rescue Plan, which is new available money in the Biden $1.9 trillion plan. There's $350 billion for state and local funding. There's $170 billion for school funding. There's $38 billion for airports and transit. And a lot of money. 
The other important thing is that these funds are available for about the next 3 to 3.5 years. So our customers will have available grant money. The environment is remaining strong and gets stronger in public safety. The PCR business on the enterprise side grew at 8% in Q1, and we are reaffirming its growth all in for this year.

We not only have a regional sales team, but we have a group of business development, vertical specialists that focus and work with schools on directing funding and those kind of things. So we're really pleased there. 
But we also work and -- we have a Safety Reimagined campaign going on that actually pulls together fixed video security and PCR. And that message resonates very well. So think about you get an intrusion on the door, access control sends a signal to a PCR radio, whereby every teacher might have one.

But the signals are strong, certainly stronger. I thought they would be good for PCR, as you heard me say, I thought PCR would return to growth in 2021. We're off to a very good start. Orders are strong, and they're probably ahead of my expectations of where we are as we sit here in May. But we'll update you again in August, but it's very good."

We have a selling process that looks at every technology we make, every government agency or every enterprise decision-maker that we have, and we do really a 3-dimensional view on any account. We're continually talking about not only our core technologies, but our emerging technologies with those customers. So in the mind of a customer, you first of all have to identify a need. The second thing is really how do you fund it. So you asked the question, what has the ARP plan done? It's alleviated a lot of concerns around visibility to money. And so in that sense, in some ways, it's never easy to make a sale. But in a lot of ways, it clears up one of the biggest obstacles to sale. The great news is, albeit that there's some of the deadlines on this funding go all the way out to 2024. The reality is that there is no reason or no prohibition to spend that money earlier. 
So our sales team, obviously, has had many, many years at this with funding, and we can provide different incentives, et cetera, to get customers to move faster, if that may be the case. But just knowing they have visibility to that money, I think, provides a very good environment for us."

But I'm really proud of everybody here on the team. Everybody knows their role. There's no confusion about what we're trying to do. And between the deployment of capital organically and inorganically, and there remains some interesting inorganic opportunities. It's all about driving sustained shareholder value creation. And I don't mean to sound corny. But I think generally, we've been good stewards of capital. We have the expansion of the share repurchase program, although that doesn't -- that's -- we did that because the previous program was running out. But the capital allocation framework that we think about 50% for acquisitions and share repurchase and 30% for dividend and 20% for CapEx and a normalized balance sheet continues. 
So stay tuned for the opportunities in front, but we're looking to -- and by the way, it's not just about 2021. I want to make sure that we continue this momentum in 2022 and beyond. So lots more work to do, but I like the cards we have."

I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook. First, Q2 was an outstanding quarter. We grew revenue 22% earnings per share of 49% and operating cash flow 86% versus the prior year. Additionally, we expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and ended the quarter with $11.2 billion of backlog, up 7% versus last year and a record for Q2. Second, we saw strong demand in both segments of our business during the quarter. In Products and Systems Integration, revenue was up 24% and operating margins expanded 270 basis points driven by growth in our LMR and video security technologies. And in Software and Services, revenue was up 19%, and operating margins expanded by 210 basis points on growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. This strong broad-based performance highlights the strength of our business and value of our mission-critical integrated ecosystem. And finally, based on the strong backlog and momentum that we're seeing across our business, we're raising again our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share. I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts."

Our Q2 results included revenue of $2 billion up 22%, including $47 million from acquisitions and $66 million from favorable FX.

Our Q2 results included revenue of $2 billion up 22%, including $47 million from acquisitions and $66 million from favorable FX. The GAAP operating earnings were $370 million, and operating margins were 18.8% of sales compared to 13.5% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $482 million, up $123 million or 34% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margins of 24.4% of sales up from 22.2% driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments, inclusive also of higher costs related to employee incentive compensation this year. GAAP earnings per share of $1.69 compared to $0.78 in the year ago quarter. This increase was primarily due to increased sales volume, improved operating leverage, a lower tax rate related to the release of valuation allowance and lower reorganization charges in the current quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.07 compared to $1.39 last year, primarily due to higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments. OpEx in Q2 was $477 million, up $51 million versus last year, primarily due to higher compensation-related incentives and higher expenses related to acquisitions. 
Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $388 million compared with $209 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was $326 million compared with $155 million in the prior year. These increases in cash flows were primarily due to higher sales and working capital improvements, partially offset by higher cash taxes. Capital allocation for Q2 included $121 million in cash dividends, $102 million in share repurchases at an average price of $206.85 per share and $62 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, we issued $850 million of new long-term debt and redeemed $324 million of outstanding senior notes due in 2023. We Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired OpenPath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions for $297 million, and we invested $50 million in equity securities of Evolve, whose technology powers our concealed weapons detection solution. 
Moving to our segment results. Q2 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.2 billion, up 24%, driven by strong growth in LMR and video security. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $38 million. Operating earnings were $194 million or 16.2% of sales up from 13.5% in the prior year on higher sales and improved operating leverage, inclusive of higher costs related to incentive compensation. Some notable Q2 wins and achievements in this segment include, a $37 million P25 order for the Kentucky State Police, a $36 million P25 upgrade for a state in the U.S., a $30 million P25 order from MARTA in Atlanta, a $29 million P25 devices order for a large U.S. state and local customer and a $5 million video security order, our largest single fixed video order from a U.S. federal customer to date. 
Moving to the Software and Services segment. Q2 revenue was $773 million, up 19% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $9 million. Operating earnings were $288 million or 37.2% of sales, up 210 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins, improved operating leverage and also inclusive of higher compensation-related incentives this year. 
Some notable Q2 wins in this segment include an $18 million French MOI body-worn camera frame agreement, a $15 million license plate recognition software extension with a U.S.-based customer, a $10 million P25 multiyear services extension for Ohio's statewide network, and a $10 million P25 maintenance renewal with the U.S. federal customer. Additionally, we launched Command Central Suite, Public Safety's, first cloud-native 911 case call to case closure solution. Looking at our regional results, North America Q2 revenue was $1.3 billion, up 20% on growth in LMR, video security and command center software. International Q2 revenue was $659 million, up 25%, also driven by LMR, video security and command center software. We saw strong growth in EMEA during the quarter, while in Asia Pac growth was minimal as the region continues to navigate impacts from COVID-19. 
Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q2 record of $11.2 billion, up $741 million compared to last year, driven by $660 million of growth in North America and $81 million of growth internationally. Sequentially, backlog was down $57 million, driven by revenue recognition on Airwave and ESN partially offset with growth in LMR products. Software and Services backlog was up $257 million compared to last year, primarily driven by North America multiyear service contracts. And sequentially, backlog was down $130 million driven again primarily by the revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN. Products backlog was up $484 million compared to last year and $73 million sequentially, driven primarily by LMR growth in both regions. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be approximately up 10% with non-GAAP EPS between $2.09 and $2.14 per share. This assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24% a year. And for the full year, we now expect sales to be up between 9.5% and 10%, an increase from our prior guide of 8% to 9%, and we now expect full year non-GAAP EPS between $8.88 and $8.98 per share, up from our prior guidance of $8.70 to $8.80 per share. This increased outlook incorporates the ongoing supply chain constraints, primarily in LMR and assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

I thought I'd end with a few thoughts as we conclude the call. First, our results for the quarter were excellent. We achieved Q2 record sales, operating earnings and EPS, expanded operating margins, grew our video security technologies by 66% and achieved strong growth in LMR and command center software technologies as well. 
Additionally, we finished the quarter with record Q2 ending backlog and a robust pipeline that we expect to drive growth for the remainder of the year, inclusive of the continued supply chain challenges that we're navigating primarily in LMR. Second, in video security, demand remains strong. We've continued investing in this area even during the early days of the pandemic, and these investments have positioned us well to capture the increased demand we're now seeing from our customers. 
Additionally, we just announced our acquisition of OpenPath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions Open Path is disrupting the access control industry and extends our value proposition in the $15 billion video security market. As a result, we're also renaming the technology within our revenue disaggregation from video security and analytics to now video security and access control to reflect these investments and the future of video and access control convergence. And finally, as I look to the second half of the year, I'm encouraged. I'm encouraged by our execution across all of the businesses. In LMR, customers are looking to invest in their networks, including several statewide upgrades and we're gaining traction with our Apex next device designed for the highest tier of public safety requirements.
 In video security and command center software, we're leveraging our large installed base and go-to-market footprint to drive continued strong growth. And with respect to ESG, we've recently released our 2020 corporate responsibility report, which highlights our strategy and performance. Our work in this critically important area has been recognized by Forbes who named us as one of the best employers for diversity and Barron's who named us as one of the most sustainable companies. I'm proud of what our teams are doing and look forward to further progress as we continue to deliver mission-critical solutions that create value for employees, customers, communities and our shareholders. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tim."

If you look at this from a segment level, our performance is strong in both segments. Software and services is stronger. But also, we had a given color that we thought product and SI would grow mid-single digits for the full year. Our raise is driven by product and SI now being expected to grow mid- to high single digits for the full year. that stronger growth is driven primarily by video but also by LMR. 
In Q2, PCR had a great quarter, strong double-digit growth. But it's also the area, as Jason referenced, that's probably the most supply constraint. So if I think about, Sam, your question about expectations for PCR growth over the full year, I'd like to think about it as mirroring the mid- to high single digits for the Product and SI segment overall. Q2 was much stronger than that, but in the second half, we have to continue to navigate supply constraints, and that's informing our expectations and guidance for full year PCR. 
On OpenPath, it's not profitable. For the remainder of the year, full year, the stub revenue period, it's probably about $5 million of incremental revenue in the second half of this year, the last 5 months, and it's a nickel dilutive. But having said that, I'm super excited by this acquisition. I think it's leading edge around cloud-based multifactor authentication, access control. I love the products, I love the architecture, I love the management team and the leadership team. Mahesh was instrumental in guiding this along with Raj and John Kozarsky and couldn't be more pleased with it. I don't know if you want to mention anything Mahesh about it."

And as Greg mentioned, specifically most around PCR. Our supply situation did improve incrementally in Q2. And in our guidance for the second half, we've contemplated continuing to have to navigate supply chain-related constraints. Those are factored into our full year guidance in our second half. So we expect to have -- to navigate through them. We're working with key suppliers, a handful of suppliers, handful of critically important parts. We're making progress. The teams are doing well. We have executive relationships that are helping us prioritize. And our suppliers recognize that our equipment is critically important to first responders. So we have good success in getting prioritization. On the cost side, despite the challenging environment, we have not seen material input costs rise significantly in the first half. Of course, we plan every year for material cost reductions, those are becoming more challenging to achieve. That said, we didn't see a big material cost driver in the first half. We'll navigate through some small increases in the second half. One area in the P&L that we are absorbing higher costs is freight. If you control for the volume and the growth that we've had, we're seeing rate increases where by the first half absorbed $20 million more than would have been expected on higher growth which is a reflection of higher air freight, the shift to shorter supply chains, elongated lead times, et cetera, which we're navigating. So that's where we've seen the one input cost rise is in freight."

It helps LMR, public safety LMR primarily P25 and the sustainability of multiyear service contracts that elongate these platforms that allow us to do subscriber and radio refresh like Apex next over a multiyear period.

Looking ahead, is it possible that as hopefully we get mass immunity and COVID hopefully dies down and people return back to the office and meetings in person. Is it possible that your command center business and installations could actually accelerate just because it's been so hard to meet with people and do testing and show all the bells and whistles of your solutions?

I really see video security and access control leading the way, which is why we're raising the technology view from what we thought would be a full year 20% plus performance to approximately 30% and that's driving the segment guide products in SI from mid to mid to high. 
So I think if you're thinking about an anchor tenant of incremental growth from current expectations of where we were. I think it's led by video security and then the second area I'd actually say is LMR. And those 2 areas are driving the increased momentum. With command center software, while it's our smallest component, we're still growing at greater the industry rate. So I'm pleased about that. But we also our offering both on-prem and cloud, and we've got organic work to do on the internal development on cloud. But I think, Jim, looking forward, I think of video security, access control and LMR as being more of an incremental drivers from a trend standpoint."

I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook. First, Q2 was an outstanding quarter. We grew revenue 22%, earnings per share of 49% and operating cash flow 86% versus the prior year. Additionally, we expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and ended the quarter with $11.2 billion of backlog, up 7% versus last year and a record for Q2. 
Second, we saw strong demand in both segments of our business during the quarter. In Products and Systems Integration, revenue was up 24% and operating margins expanded 270 basis points driven by growth in our LMR and video security technologies. And in Software and Services, revenue was up 19%, and operating margins expanded by 210 basis points on growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. This strong broad-based performance highlights the strength of our business and value of our mission-critical integrated ecosystem. 
And finally, based on the strong backlog and momentum that we're seeing across our business, we're raising again our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share. I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts."

Our Q2 results included revenue of $2 billion, up 22%, including $47 million from acquisitions and $66 million from favorable FX.

Our Q2 results included revenue of $2 billion, up 22%, including $47 million from acquisitions and $66 million from favorable FX. GAAP operating earnings were $370 million, and operating margins were 18.8% of sales compared to 13.5% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $482 million, up $123 million or 34% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margins of 24.4% of sales up from 22.2% driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments, inclusive also of higher costs related to employee incentive compensation this year. 
GAAP earnings per share of $1.69 compared to $0.78 in the year ago quarter. This increase was primarily due to increased sales volume, improved operating leverage, a lower tax rate related to the release of valuation allowance and lower reorganization charges in the current quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.07 compared to $1.39 last year, primarily due to higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments. OpEx in Q2 was $477 million, up $51 million versus last year, primarily due to higher compensation-related incentives and higher expenses related to acquisitions. 
Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $388 million compared with $209 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was $326 million compared with $155 million in the prior year. These increases in cash flows were primarily due to higher sales and working capital improvements, partially offset by higher cash taxes. Capital allocation for Q2 included $121 million in cash dividends, $102 million in share repurchases at an average price of $206.85 per share and $62 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, we issued $850 million of new long-term debt and redeemed $324 million of outstanding senior notes due in 2023. Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired Openpath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions for $297 million, and we invested $50 million in equity securities of Evolv, whose technology powers our concealed weapons detection solution. 
Moving to our segment results. Q2 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.2 billion, up 24%, driven by strong growth in LMR and video security. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $38 million. Operating earnings were $194 million or 16.2% of sales, up from 13.5% in the prior year on higher sales and improved operating leverage, inclusive of higher costs related to incentive compensation. Some notable Q2 wins and achievements in this segment include, a $37 million P25 order for the Kentucky State Police, a $36 million P25 upgrade for a state in the U.S., a $30 million P25 order from MARTA in Atlanta, a $29 million P25 devices order for a large U.S. state and local customer and a $5 million video security order, our largest single fixed video order from a U.S. federal customer to date. 
Moving to the Software and Services segment. Q2 revenue was $773 million, up 19% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $9 million. Operating earnings were $288 million or 37.2% of sales, up 210 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins, improved operating leverage and also inclusive of higher compensation-related incentives this year. 
Some notable Q2 wins in this segment include an $18 million French MOI body-worn camera frame agreement, a $15 million license plate recognition software extension with a U.S.-based customer, a $10 million P25 multiyear services extension for Ohio's statewide network, and a $10 million P25 maintenance renewal with the U.S. federal customer. Additionally, we launched CommandCentral suite, public safety's first cloud-native 911 case -- call to case closure solution. 
Looking at our regional results, North America Q2 revenue was $1.3 billion, up 20% on growth in LMR, video security and command center software. International Q2 revenue was $659 million, up 25%, also driven by LMR, video security and command center software. We saw strong growth in EMEA during the quarter, while in Asia Pac growth was minimal as the region continues to navigate impacts from COVID-19. 
Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q2 record of $11.2 billion, up $741 million compared to last year, driven by $660 million of growth in North America and $81 million of growth internationally. Sequentially, backlog was down $57 million, driven by revenue recognition on Airwave and ESN, partially offset with growth in LMR products. Software and Services backlog was up $257 million compared to last year, primarily driven by North America multiyear service contracts. And sequentially, backlog was down $130 million driven, again, primarily by the revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN. Products and SI backlog was up $484 million compared to last year and $73 million sequentially, driven primarily by LMR growth in both regions.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be approximately up 10% with non-GAAP EPS between $2.09 and $2.14 per share. This assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. And for the full year, we now expect sales to be up between 9.5% and 10%, an increase from our prior guide of 8% to 9%, and we now expect full year non-GAAP EPS between $8.88 and $8.98 per share, up from our prior guidance of $8.70 to $8.80 per share. This increased outlook incorporates the ongoing supply chain constraints, primarily in LMR and assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

I thought I'd end with a few thoughts as we conclude the call. First, our results for the quarter were excellent. We achieved Q2 record sales, operating earnings and EPS, expanded operating margins, grew our video security technologies by 66% and achieved strong growth in LMR and command center software technologies as well.
Additionally, we finished the quarter with record Q2 ending backlog and a robust pipeline that we expect to drive growth for the remainder of the year, inclusive of the continued supply chain challenges that we're navigating primarily in LMR. Second, in video security, demand remains strong. We've continued investing in this area even during the early days of the pandemic, and these investments have positioned us well to capture the increased demand we're now seeing from our customers.
Additionally, we just announced our acquisition of Openpath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions. Openpath is disrupting the access control industry and extends our value proposition in the $15 billion video security market. As a result, we're also renaming the technology within our revenue disaggregation from video security and analytics to now video security and access control to reflect these investments and the future video and access control convergence. And finally, as I look to the second half of the year, I'm encouraged. I'm encouraged by our execution across all of the businesses. In LMR, customers are looking to invest in their networks, including several statewide upgrades and we're gaining traction with our APX NEXT device designed for the highest tier of public safety requirements.
 In video security and command center software, we're leveraging our large installed base and go-to-market footprint to drive continued strong growth. And with respect to ESG, we've recently released our 2020 corporate responsibility report, which highlights our strategy and performance. Our work in this critically important area has been recognized by Forbes who named us as one of the best employers for diversity, and Barron's who named us as one of the most sustainable companies. 
I'm proud of what our teams are doing and look forward to further progress as we continue to deliver mission-critical solutions that create value for employees, customers, communities and our shareholders. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tim."

If you look at this from a segment level, our performance is strong in both segments. Software and services is stronger. But also, we had a given color that we thought Product and SI would grow mid-single digits for the full year. Our raise is driven by Product and SI now being expected to grow mid- to high single digits for the full year. That stronger growth is driven primarily by video but also by LMR.
In Q2, PCR had a great quarter. Strong double-digit growth. But it's also the area, as Jason referenced, that's probably the most supply constraint. So if I think about, Sami, your question about expectations for PCR growth over the full year, I'd like to think about it as mirroring the mid- to high single digits for the Product and SI segment overall. Q2 was much stronger than that, but in the second half, we have to continue to navigate supply constraints, and that's informing our expectations and guidance for full year PCR.
On Openpath, it's not profitable. For the remainder of the year, full year, the stub revenue period, it's probably about $5 million of incremental revenue in the second half of this year, the last 5 months, and it's $0.05 dilutive. But having said that, I'm super excited by this acquisition. I think it's leading edge around cloud-based multifactor authentication access control. I love the products, I love the architecture, I love the management team and the leadership team.

So anything on that."

And as Greg mentioned, specifically most around PCR. Our supply situation did improve incrementally in Q2. And in our guidance for the second half, we've contemplated continuing to have to navigate supply chain-related constraints. Those are factored into our full year guidance in our second half. So we expect to have -- to navigate through them. We're working with key suppliers, a handful of suppliers, handful of critically important parts. We're making progress. The teams are doing well. We have executive relationships that are helping us prioritize. And our suppliers recognize that our equipment is critically important to first responders. So we have good success in getting prioritization. 
On the cost side, despite the challenging environment, we have not seen material input costs rise significantly in the first half. Of course, we plan every year for material cost reductions. Those are becoming more challenging to achieve. That said, we didn't see a big material cost driver in the first half. We'll navigate through some small increases in the second half. One area in the P&L that we are absorbing higher costs is freight. If you control for the volume and the growth that we've had, we're seeing rate increases where by the first half absorbed $20 million more than would have been expected on higher growth, which is a reflection of higher air freight, the shift to shorter supply chains, elongated lead times, et cetera, which we're navigating.

So in terms of recurring, our proxy for recurring is the segment that is software and services, which I believe this quarter was 38% of total revenues. That includes a lot of different varieties of recurring business, including service renewals, subscriptions, et cetera, and that was up significantly and has been growing, as you know, even during the pandemic and is growing at a rate that's very positive. With earnings expansion at OE this year, we believe now at 170 bps of OE expansion within the services -- software and services segment. So not only growing but expanding profitability. 
On the technology side, from that same disaggregation, you can see that the video is a strong driver as well as command center software and that LMR is performing well -- as well with up mid-single digits."

And while demand is strong and funding is good, and there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic and encouraged, we just want to be very mindful and aware of what we don't know and the uncertainty that I think is informing and incorporated into the remainder of the full year. 
I do think that there'll be time, Fahad, over time to update all of you in 2022. By the way, I think that we're likely going to have an Analyst Day. We're targeting doing that in Q1 of next year, as we get through this fiscal year, as we get through the large implications of the pandemic, as we get to a point where hopefully the FDA gives general approval for the vaccine, as we get to where many more populations in countries are vaccinated and herd immunity is achieved. And we do think that's a better environment to give an update at that point in time. 
So I'm not going to -- I appreciate your interest and not going to update the model per se yet, but I like we're positioned for the back half of the year, and I think we've got some good momentum to build on."

So I think if you're thinking about an anchor tenant of incremental growth from current expectations of where we were, I think it's led by video security and then the second area I'd actually say is LMR. And those 2 areas are driving the increased momentum. With command center software, while it's our smallest component, we're still growing at greater the industry rate. So I'm pleased about that. But we also are offering both on-prem and cloud, and we've got organic work to do on the internal development on cloud.

First, Q3 results highlight the continued strong demand we're seeing across the business. We grew revenue 13%, earnings per share 21% and expanded operating margins by 150 basis Additionally, we ended the quarter with a record Q3 backlog of $11.4 billion, up 7% from last year. 
Second, we saw strong growth in all 3 technologies during the quarter. In LMR, revenue was up 11% while navigating a very challenging supply chain environment and video security and access control revenue was up 26%, driven by strong broad-based demand for both our fixed and mobile video offerings. And in Command Center Software revenue was up 13% as we continue to expand within our existing installed base and win new customers. 
And finally, based on our strong Q3 results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we're again raising our full year guidance for both sales and EPS.

Our Q3 results included revenue of $2.1 billion, up 13%, including $15 million from acquisitions and $25 million from favorable currency rates. 
GAAP operating earnings of $451 million and operating margins of 21.4% compared to 18.9% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $555 million, up $92 million or 20% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margins of 26.3% of sales, up from 24.8%, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage in both of our segments. 
GAAP earnings per share of $1.76 compared to $1.18 in the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage as well as a loss related to the refinancing of long-term debt that occurred in the third quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.35 compared to $1.95 last year, primarily due to higher sales, higher gross margin and improved operating leverage again in both segments. 
OpEx in Q3 was $496 million, up $41 million versus last year, primarily due to higher compensation related to incentives and higher expenses related to acquisitions. 
Turning to cash flow. Q3 operating cash flow was $376 million compared with $392 million in the prior year, while free cash flow was $315 million compared with $343 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash flow was primarily due to an increase in working capital, inclusive of our higher inventory, partially offset by higher earnings. 
Unit operating cash flow was $1.1 billion, up $225 million compared with last year, and free cash flow was $959 million, up $201 million over last year. The increase in cash flow year-to-date was primarily driven by higher earnings partially offset by higher cash taxes paid during this year. 
Our capital allocation in Q3 included $137 million in share repurchases at an average price of  $234.18, $120 million in cash dividends and $61 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Openpath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions for $297 million, we invested $50 million in equity securities of Evolve, whose technology powers our concealed weapons detection solution. And subsequent to quarter end, we acquired Envision, a leader in enterprise video security and business analytics for $124 million net of cash. 
Moving next to our segment results. Q3 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.3 billion, up 14%, driven by strong growth in LMR and video security. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $12 million. Operating earnings were $273 million or 20.6% of sales, up from 18.9% in the year prior on higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q3 wins and achievements in this segment include $72 million of P25 orders from a large U.S. federal customer, a $70 million TETRA order from the German Navy, a $45 million TETRA upgrade from a large EMEA customer, a $43 million P25 order from a large North America customer, a $22 million P25 upgrade from Metro Sao Paulo in Brazil. And also during the quarter, we grew our GO Security and Access Control product revenue by 23%. 
Moving to the Software and Services segment. Q3 revenue was $782 million, up 11% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $3 million. Operating earnings were $282 million or 36% of sales, up 140 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved OpEx leverage. 
Within this segment, some notable Q3 wins included a $41 million command center software contract with a large U.S. state and local customer, $31 million P25 multiyear extension with a customer in North America, [ $17 million ] push-to-talk over broadband multiyear renewal with a large U.S. customer, a $7 million Command Central suite and video security order with the city of Yonkers, New York, which expanded off of a prior body-worn camera win. 
During the quarter, we grew our video security and access control software revenue by 32%. Additionally, we launched the M500, the first in-car video system enabled by artificial intelligence. 
Moving next to our regional results. Q3 North America revenue was $1.4 billion, up 14% and growth in LMR, video security and command center software. International Q3 revenue was $658 million, up 10%, also driven by LMR, video security and command center software. We saw strong growth in EMEA and Latin America during the quarter, while in Asia Pac, we continue to experience headwinds related to COVID-19 lockdowns in various countries. 
Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q3 record of $11.4 billion, up $710 million compared to last year, driven primarily by growth in North America. Sequentially, backlog was up $144 million, also driven primarily by growth in North America. Software and Services backlog was up $6 million compared to last year, driven by a $479 million increase in multiyear services and software contracts, partially offset by revenue recognition on Airwave and ESN over the last year. 
Sequentially, backlog was down $112 million, driven primarily by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN during the quarter, partially offset by growth in services and software contracts in North America. Products and SI backlog was up $704 million compared to last year and $256 million sequentially, driven primarily by LMR growth in both regions. 
Turning next to our outlook. We now expect full year sales to be up 10% to 10.25% compared to prior guide of 9.5% to 10%. And we now expect full year earnings per share between $9 and $9.04 per share, up from our prior guide of $8.88 to $8.98 per share. This increased outlook includes the video security and access control technology growing greater than 30%. It also includes our current view of supply chain conditions, FX at current spot rates and an effective tax rate of 21.5%, along with a diluted share count of 174 million shares. And finally, we now expect full year OpEx to be $1.95 billion, inclusive of our 2 latest acquisitions, Openpath, and Envision, and we expect full year operating cash flow to be approximately $1.825 billion, up $25 million from our prior estimate. 
With that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to Greg."

I thought I would end with a few thoughts as we conclude the call and before we open it up for questions.First, our results for the quarter were outstanding, and I'm extremely proud of how the team is executing through a very tough supply",363,"Thanks, Jason. I thought I would end with a few thoughts as we conclude the call and before we open it up for questions.
First, our results for the quarter were outstanding, and I'm extremely proud of how the team is executing through a very tough supply chain environment. We achieved record Q3 sales, operating earnings and EPS and expanded operating margins by 150 basis points and finished the quarter with a record Q3 ending backlog. 
Second, I want to share some color on what we're actually seeing in the 2 segments. In Products and SI, demand for both our LMR and video security remained robust, highlighted by the strong revenue growth in Q3 and record ending backlog supply chain constraints continue to impact our LMR business and in particularly, our PCR business as demand outpaced our ability to obtain supply in Q3, and we expect we'll continue to do so in Q4. 
In software and services, we continue to see strong demand, which is driving revenue growth and improved profitability. In fact, as we finish the year, we now expect operating margin to increase by 200 basis points year-over-year for the segment. Our customers continue to increase their investment in our value-added services. And in software, while we now expect Command Center Software revenue growth to be low double digits, our video security and access control software revenue growth will likely be greater than 35% this year and is the fastest growing area within our software portfolio. 
Finally, as I look ahead, I'm encouraged by how we're positioned. Our strong Q3 backlog in both segments provides us with significant demand visibility. We're expanding our relationships within our existing installed base to provide more software and services. The customer funding is as good as I've seen it. And our NDAA compliant manufacturing in North America is providing a key differentiator for our fixed video solutions. And while we expect the challenging supply chain environment to be with us through at least the first half of next year, we're still planning for another year of strong revenue, earnings and cash flow growth in 2022. And I'll now turn the call back over to Tim."

So still really strong robust growth we've rounded out the portfolio. We've refreshed the product portfolio. I think Jack and team have done a great job investing in go-to-market and increasing R&D in a downturn market. 
I think video continues to be more -- and access control, continues to be more and more important with our customers and more of a need to have than a nice to have. As you referenced, the NDAA is helpful for sure, around federal procurement as well as the eligibility for federal grant money.  And look with the SEC, as you know and as you referenced, there's pending, legislation has been done, it's awaiting Biden's signature. If President Biden signs it, when and if he does, that authorizes the FCC to proceed with the rule-making they've undertaken, which would evaluate Chinese vendors in the entire enterprise market. So that clearly would be significant as well. Don't know the timing for that, but that would be a tailwind if that were to materialize. I don't know if Jack, do you want to add anything about the overall demand profile."

But they also know that certain cloud capabilities are just better. Those capabilities are just better delivered through the cloud. And we want to give the customers the flexibility to choose and to move to the cloud in their own time line. And so with relation to that, we're offering flexibility in deployment via hybrid offerings, and we're doing 3 specific things there. 
One, we're offering our on-prem solutions inclusive of CAD and records on a subscription basis we're going to be integrating the capabilities, both existing and new capabilities in CommandCentral Cloud with our on-prem solutions to allow our customers to choose what capabilities they would like to consume from the cloud. And third, Cyber security is a very important consideration regardless of whether the solution is deployed on-prem or whether it's in the cloud, we're integrating cybersecurity monitoring as a service into both those solutions as a whole.

This is something that is very unique to what we do. Record after the fact is a very unique capability that we have within the WatchGuard portfolio. And we have a dedicated display capability in the product, which is something that we have got an extent feedback from our customers on. It allows you to both record, review and ad video with a dedicated play. In addition to that, what M500 brings to the table is ALPR capabilities, ALPR capabilities, not just with watch list but also integrated with our Learn platform, which has the largest database of play treats out there that's time and location stamped which allows for great real-time forensics and investigation capability. And to the rear camera in the M500 platform, we have added passenger analytics capability so that when a passenger is detected, we can actually effectively trigger recordings as an option configurable within the system. The platform itself is AI enabled to the point where now we can add new capabilities in the future via a simple firmer upgrade. So it's actually future proof for customers as well.

It's very early days. We're really, really pleased. So we announced it in '19. Obviously, last year during the COVID year, I would say, we had -- the market was somewhat stalled in the first and second quarter. We've seen a significant ramp-up in terms of orders since then. But all day long. We've talked about -- you've heard me mention before that it's typically a 3- to 5-year cycle where we start getting some material refresh within our customers' base. You asked about an inning, I'd say we're in the top of the second inning potentially. We have room to run here in terms of Apex Next. 
The second question was related to the MXP 600 in Europe. And it's, again, very early days. We've had some market success. But the interesting thing to point out for both the APX NEXT as well as the MXP is those were designed for very high tier part of the market. So that's attractive, but the reality is we're going to be feathering in mid-tier and entry tier on both the Apex Next line as well as the MXP line. So we're really encouraged by that because that starts to get to the meat of the market, so to speak. So I think that handles your question."

The number that we're embedding in the P&L this year for higher premiums is nearly $45 million on the year with a lot of that in the second half. And then as I look to Q4 and the plans we put together for Q4, having to buy and get these materials not only through expedited freight, but also through other means, through brokers and distribution and the like, is adding about $20 million of pressure to what we had planned for, for Q4.

So first of all, Greg said it earlier, and I think it's always important to point out, but we're in a unique position because really what we do is all need to have. It's not nice to have. So I'd kind of decompose the American rescue plan conversation into a few different things. We have public safety. And that's everything from P25 statewide and local networks to a command center software. We're in pretty consistent dialogue with our customers regularly in public safety who had what we call shovel-ready projects or things that maybe would have been a mid-tier kind of mid-term need, and we're in conversations on how they may fund those things now. The other benefit is state and local receipts, actually, particularly at the state level, revenues are up as well. So Greg made a comment earlier about funding environment, the funding environment I would say, doing business and public safety in 28 years, it's the best I've ever seen as well. So I would say we're in a really good position there, both on the P25 landscape, infrastructure upgrades and devices as well as command center software.  Our teams, the one thing our sales team does, we think they're really good at technology. We think they're better and they're experts at getting deals funded. So we think that's going to benefit us there. 
The second thing I would say, the other technology sleeve that's going to benefit significantly is video security and access control. If you think about education alone school funding $170 million pointed to that market. And really when kids have come back to school, the first thing they're talking about is they're talking about how do we bring them back in a safe manner. One of the things our team did over the COVID, we talked about this was to write COVID dashboard. So if you connect to Avigilon cloud services, you get our COVID dashboard, gives social distance saying, who went through what door. This is all really pertinent information. And we think our school superintendents security directors are really interested in our technology here. 
The last thing I would say is there's money being pointed at airports in transit, $35 billion, as they reopen, many of them are upgrading both the radio networks. So we've got opportunities for PCR with all the major airlines as well as their consoles in the command center space and then ultimately, also video security, how do they protect the perimeter security, how do they get better information. So I would say, across all 3 of our technology continuums as well as our services business, the money, the environment, we're in a good spot, and we think our sales team is poised to execute."

But at the customer level, Yonkers is a very progressive technologically savvy police chief man staff. This started I want to say this probably started -- the discussion started probably sometime mid last year, originally around a mobile video, and they've added obviously to that in the command center space. And I think what they're thinking about is they're leveraging how is information sharing. So everything from digital evidence management to how that's shared seamlessly through the rest of the command center. I don't know if anything else you'd add on to that."

Then you have vigilant ALPR solution that was part of that equation as well to enable fast investigations leveraging both the fixed camera solution but also ALPR cameras as well. Body-worn cameras feeding into that same evidence platform adding to the mix. And then mass notification was also part of the story there. So all that together, it really gives you a view of an integration between those products really enabling effective incident response. And I think that was really the value to Yonkers."

First, Q3 results highlight the continued strong demand we're seeing across the business. We grew revenue 13%, earnings per share 21% and expanded operating margins by 150 basis Additionally, we ended the quarter with a record Q3 backlog of $11.4 billion, up 7% from last year. 
Second, we saw strong growth in all 3 technologies during the quarter. In LMR, revenue was up 11% while navigating a very challenging supply chain environment and video security and access control revenue was up 26%, driven by strong broad-based demand for both our fixed and mobile video offerings. And in Command Center Software revenue was up 13% as we continue to expand within our existing installed base and win new customers.
And finally, based on our strong Q3 results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we're again raising our full year guidance for both sales and EPS. 
I'm now going to turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts."

Our Q3 results included revenue of $2.1 billion, up 13%, including $15 million from acquisitions and $25 million from favorable currency rates.  
GAAP operating earnings of $451 million and operating margins of 21.4% compared to 18.9% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $555 million, up $92 million or 20% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margins of 26.3% of sales, up from 24.8%, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage in both of our segments.
GAAP earnings per share of $1.76 compared to $1.18 in the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage as well as a loss related to the refinancing of long-term debt that occurred in the third quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.35 compared to $1.95 last year, primarily due to higher sales, higher gross margin and improved operating leverage again in both segments.
OpEx in Q3 was $496 million, up $41 million versus last year, primarily due to higher compensation related to incentives and higher expenses related to acquisitions.
Turning to cash flow. Q3 operating cash flow was $376 million compared with $392 million in the prior year, while free cash flow was $315 million compared with $343 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash flow was primarily due to an increase in working capital, inclusive of our higher inventory, partially offset by higher earnings.
Year-to-date operating cash flow was $1.1 billion, up $225 million compared with last year, and free cash flow was $959 million, up $201 million over last year. The increase in cash flow year-to-date was primarily driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid during this year.  
Our capital allocation in Q3 included $137 million in share repurchases at an average price of  $234.18, $120 million in cash dividends and $61 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Openpath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions for $297 million, we invested $50 million in equity securities of Evolv, whose technology powers our concealed weapons detection solution. And subsequent to quarter end, we acquired Envysion, a leader in enterprise video security and business analytics for $124 million net of cash.
Moving next to our segment results. Q3 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.3 billion, up 14%, driven by strong growth in LMR and video security. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $12 million. Operating earnings were $273 million or 20.6% of sales, up from 18.9% in the year prior on higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage. 
Some notable Q3 wins and achievements in this segment include $72 million of P25 orders from a large U.S. federal customer, a $70 million TETRA order from the German Navy, a $45 million TETRA upgrade from a large EMEA customer, a $43 million P25 order from a large North America customer, a $22 million P25 upgrade from Metro Sao Paulo in Brazil. And also during the quarter, we grew our Video Security and Access Control product revenue by 23%.  
Moving to the Software and Services segment. Q3 revenue was $782 million, up 11% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $3 million. Operating earnings were $282 million or 36% of sales, up 140 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved OpEx leverage.  
Within this segment, some notable Q3 wins included a $41 million command center software contract with a large U.S. state and local customer, $31 million P25 multiyear extension with a customer in North America, a $17 million push-to-talk over broadband multiyear renewal with a large U.S. customer, a $7 million Command Central suite and video security order with the city of Yonkers, New York, which expanded off of a prior body-worn camera win.  
During the quarter, we grew our video security and access control software revenue by 32%. Additionally, we launched the M500, the first in-car video system enabled by artificial intelligence.
Moving next to our regional results. Q3 North America revenue was $1.4 billion, up 14% and growth in LMR, video security and command center software. International Q3 revenue was $658 million, up 10%, also driven by LMR, video security and command center software. We saw strong growth in EMEA and Latin America during the quarter, while in Asia Pac, we continue to experience headwinds related to COVID-19 lockdowns in various countries.  
Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q3 record of $11.4 billion, up $710 million compared to last year, driven primarily by growth in North America. Sequentially, backlog was up [ $144 ] million, also driven primarily by growth in North America. Software and Services backlog was up $6 million compared to last year, driven by a $479 million increase in multiyear services and software contracts, partially offset by revenue recognition on Airwave and ESN over the last year.  
Sequentially, backlog was down $112 million, driven primarily by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN during the quarter, partially offset by growth in services and software contracts in North America. Products and SI backlog was up $704 million compared to last year and $256 million sequentially, driven primarily by LMR growth in both regions.
Turning next to our outlook. We now expect full year sales to be up 10% to 10.25% compared to prior guide of 9.5% to 10%. And we now expect full year earnings per share between $9 and $9.04 per share, up from our prior guide of $8.88 to $8.98 per share. This increased outlook includes the video security and access control technology growing greater than 30%. It also includes our current view of supply chain conditions, FX at current spot rates and an effective tax rate of 21.5%, along with a diluted share count of 174 million shares. And finally, we now expect full year OpEx to be $1.95 billion, inclusive of our 2 latest acquisitions, Openpath, and Envysion, and we expect full year operating cash flow to be approximately $1.825 billion, up $25 million from our prior estimate.
With that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to Greg."

I thought I would end with a few thoughts as we conclude the call and before we open it up for questions.First, our results for the quarter were outstanding, and I'm extremely proud of how the team is executing through a very tough supply",363,"Thanks, Jason. I thought I would end with a few thoughts as we conclude the call and before we open it up for questions.
First, our results for the quarter were outstanding, and I'm extremely proud of how the team is executing through a very tough supply chain environment. We achieved record Q3 sales, operating earnings and EPS and expanded operating margins by 150 basis points and finished the quarter with a record Q3 ending backlog.
Second, I want to share some color on what we're actually seeing in the 2 segments. In Products and SI, demand for both our LMR and video security remained robust, highlighted by the strong revenue growth in Q3 and record ending backlog. Supply chain constraints continue to impact our LMR business and in particularly, our PCR business as demand outpaced our ability to obtain supply in Q3, and we expect we'll continue to do so in Q4.  
In software and services, we continue to see strong demand, which is driving revenue growth and improved profitability. In fact, as we finish the year, we now expect operating margin to increase by 200 basis points year-over-year for the segment. Our customers continue to increase their investment in our value-added services. And in software, while we now expect Command Center Software revenue growth to be low double digits, our video security and access control software revenue growth will likely be greater than 35% this year and is the fastest growing area within our software portfolio.  
Finally, as I look ahead, I'm encouraged by how we're positioned. Our strong Q3 backlog in both segments provides us with significant demand visibility. We're expanding our relationships within our existing installed base to provide more software and services. The customer funding is as good as I've seen it. And our NDAA compliant manufacturing in North America is providing a key differentiator for our fixed video solutions. And while we expect the challenging supply chain environment to be with us through at least the first half of next year, we're still planning for another year of strong revenue, earnings and cash flow growth in 2022. And I'll now turn the call back over to Tim."

I think Jack and team have done a great job investing in go-to-market and increasing R&D in a downturn market.
I think video continues to be more -- and access control, continues to be more and more important with our customers and more of a need to have than a nice to have. As you referenced, the NDAA is helpful for sure, around federal procurement as well as the eligibility for federal grant money.  And look with the SEC, as you know and as you referenced, there's pending, legislation has been done, it's awaiting Biden's signature. If President Biden signs it, when and if he does, that authorizes the FCC to proceed with the rule-making they've undertaken, which would evaluate Chinese vendors in the entire enterprise market. So that clearly would be significant as well. Don't know the timing for that, but that would be a tailwind if that were to materialize.

I think also you look at it from an acquisition standpoint, we've acquired Openpath, who's really, quite frankly, a game-changer from an access control standpoint. This week, Tim, we announced the acquisition of Envysion. So you can look at that as a way for us to get more vertically focused in terms of our solution. And as Greg has talked about in the past, one of the reasons we acquired Pelco and IndigoVision was to add greater international scale. We've invested heavily in go-to-market in North America.

That's part of our product strategy. Many of our customers have invested in some sophisticated IT infrastructure on premises, and they would like to continue to benefit from those investments. But they also know that certain cloud capabilities are just better. Those capabilities are just better delivered through the cloud. And we want to give the customers the flexibility to choose and to move to the cloud in their own time line. 
And so with relation to that, we're offering flexibility in deployment via hybrid offerings, and we're doing 3 specific things there. One, we're offering our on-prem solutions inclusive of CAD and records on a subscription basis we're going to be integrating the capabilities, both existing and new capabilities in CommandCentral Cloud with our on-prem solutions to allow our customers to choose what capabilities they would like to consume from the cloud. And third, cybersecurity is a very important consideration regardless of whether the solution is deployed on-prem or whether it's in the cloud, we're integrating cybersecurity monitoring as a service into both those solutions as a whole. I think all that combined really accelerates adoption of cloud capabilities across all our customers."

We improved on our synchronized playback capability, which is something that height integration with our Body-worn camera and our in-car video solution so that you can get a perspective of what's happening in the incident in a time synchronized manner. This is something that is very unique to what we do. Record after the fact is a very unique capability that we have within the WatchGuard portfolio. And we have a dedicated display capability in the product, which is something that we have got an excellent feedback from our customers on. It allows you to both record, review and tag video with a dedicated display. 
In addition to that, what M500 brings to the table is ALPR capabilities, ALPR capabilities, not just with watch list but also integrated with our Learn platform, which has the largest database of play treats out there that's time and location stamped, which allows for great real-time forensics and investigation capability. 
And to the rear camera in the M500 platform, we have added passenger analytics capability so that when a passenger is detected, we can actually effectively trigger recordings as an option configurable within the system. The platform itself is AI enabled to the point where now we can add new capabilities in the future via a simple firmware upgrade. So it's actually future proof for customers as well.

So the bulk of that $100 million for the year is in the product segment. So we're expanding operating margins despite overcoming that additional P&L burden.

The number that we're embedding in the P&L this year for higher premiums is nearly $45 million on the year with a lot of that in the second half. And then as I look to Q4 and the plans we put together for Q4, having to buy and get these materials not only through expedited freight, but also through other means, through brokers and distribution and the like, is adding about $20 million of pressure to what we had planned for, for Q4.

So first of all, Greg said it earlier, and I think it's always important to point out, but we're in a unique position because really what we do is all need to have. It's not nice to have. So I'd kind of decompose the American rescue plan conversation into a few different things. We have public safety. And that's everything from P25 statewide and local networks to a command center software. We're in pretty consistent dialogue with our customers regularly in public safety who had what we call shovel-ready projects or things that maybe would have been a mid-tier kind of -- mid-term need, and we're in conversations on how they may fund those things now. 
The other benefit is state and local receipts, actually, particularly at the state level, revenues are up as well. So Greg made a comment earlier about funding environment, the funding environment I would say, doing business in public safety in 28 years, it's the best I've ever seen as well. So I would say we're in a really good position there, both on the P25 landscape, infrastructure upgrades and devices as well as command center software.  Our teams -- the one thing our sales team does, we think they're really good at technology. We think they're better and they're experts at getting deals funded. So we think that's going to benefit us there.
The second thing I would say, the other technology sleeve that's going to benefit significantly is video security and access control. If you think about education alone school funding $170 million pointed to that market. And really when kids have come back to school, the first thing they're talking about is they're talking about how do we bring them back in a safe manner. One of the things our team did over the COVID, we talked about this was to write COVID dashboard. So if you connect to Avigilon cloud services, you get our COVID dashboard, gives social distancing, who went through what door. This is all really pertinent information. And we think our school superintendents, security directors are really interested in our technology here.
The last thing I would say is there's money being pointed at airports in transit, $35 billion, as they reopen, many of them are upgrading both the radio networks. So we've got opportunities for PCR with all the major airlines as well as their consoles in the command center space and then ultimately, also video security, how do they protect the perimeter security, how do they get better information. So I would say, across all 3 of our technology continuums as well as our services business, the money, the environment, we're in a good spot, and we think our sales team is poised to execute."

So as customers have a different -- they're on different investment journey. Some may want to buy from different vendors. What we're incenting our sales team to do, and this is really important, and this actually started in 2020 is incenting them and they have a chance to make some pretty significant incentives to sell full suite integrated networks where they're using all pieces of our command center software technology. That's the goal. We think they've got the right relationships and what they'll need to do is go continue to execute on that and find more and more Yonkers."

I mean there's so many good things going on, but it's a tough environment. I want to thank the people on the front line, the sales organization that's really executing well and contributing to Q3 record backlog. Supply, you hear it with every company, you hear it all the time, but the supply chain environment, as we said, challenging in Q3, remains challenging in Q4. And I just think the team here in mixing and matching and there's more fluidity and uncertainty in supply chain in Q3 and Q4 than we've had in prior periods. 
And I think the adaptability of staying in touch in close touch with key suppliers, I appreciate all that. Everybody on the support teams and back office and support functions in particularly HR and Karen Dunning and Terry Bell because we have -- it's a tough environment. We have vaccine mandate, compliance requirements. We're always following rules and regulations by facility and by state and Karen and Terry Mark Hacker, phenomenal. I'm thrilled with Q3 results across the board. I'm proud that we're able to, for 3 consecutive quarters raise top and bottom line. And I think we're really well positioned going into 2022 despite the challenges we have, but we'll stick together, like we always do, we'll be flexible and we'll continue to be steadfast and focused, and I appreciate everybody's contribution onward and upward, and thank you, everybody."
