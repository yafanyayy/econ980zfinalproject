We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. We hope you and your families are and will continue to be safe and healthy. 2020 represented another year of strong earnings growth for Vulcan, despite the many challenges associated with the pandemic. Our results demonstrated the strength, flexibility and resilient nature of our aggregates business. But most of all, 2020 demonstrated the commitment of Vulcan employees as they face uncertainty and had to make adjustments both in their professional and their personal lives. Our team stayed focused on operating safely, servicing our customers and making progress on our 4 strategic disciplines. Congratulations on a job well done. In a few minutes, Suzanne will share some fourth quarter highlights with you, but first, I'd like to summarize our full year 2020 accomplishments and discuss broad themes and where we are headed. 
Our full year financial results were strong. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 4% to $1.324 billion, and EBITDA margin expanded by 150 basis points. Cash generation continued to be strong with operating cash flows increasing by 9% to $1.1 billion. And finally, one of our principal measures, return on invested capital, improved by 40 basis points to 14.3%. These results were particularly noteworthy considering our annual aggregates volume declined by 3% as compared to 2019. Higher average selling prices and effective cost control were key drivers of this performance, as pricing improved by just over 3% on both a reported and mixed adjusted basis. Importantly, these pricing gains were widespread across our footprint. Our total cost of sales per ton increased by 2%, while our unit cash cost of sales, which is more controllable, only grew by 1%. This led to a 5.5% gain in our aggregate cash gross profit per ton. At $7.11, we are making good progress toward our longer-term goal of $9 per ton. This improvement in unit profitability was supported by our 4 strategic disciplines: Commercial excellence, operations excellence, logistics innovation and strategic sourcing. We also experienced improvements in each of our non aggregates business segments. Collectively, gross profit improved 12% across these 3 segments. Europe profitability increased in both asphalt and country. Asphalt gross profit increased $12 million or 19% over the prior year, even though volumes declined 7%. This improvement in profitability resulted from stable sales prices and lower liquid asphalt cost. Our ready-mix concrete unit profitability increased 8%. Average selling prices increased by 2% and volume declined by 5%, primarily as a result of the Summit shortages in California. The higher profitability in each of our business segments and our improving overall EBITDA margin set us up well for 2021. We are well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities in our geographic footprint. The demand environment is also improving, particularly in residential construction and highway construction. Let's take each market segment in turn. 
Residential continues to show strength, especially in single family. The market fundamentals of low interest rates, and reduce supply suggests that the growth will continue. This represents a clear opportunity for us as both permits and starts are growing faster in Vulcan served markets. Highway lettings and awards returned to growth in the fourth quarter. State DOT budgets have stabilized, with most of our states showing budgets flat to up from 2020. The caution in this market segment is that it will require time to turn awards into shipments given the midyear 2020 loan awards due to the pandemic. While timing of shipments is a variable, we will see improvement in highway shipments throughout 2021. As we said in the third quarter, the near-term outlook for the nonresidential construction sector provides the lease forward visibility. Dodge construction starts are still down year-over-year, but certainly, indicators are beginning to improve, perhaps signaling that potential improvement is just around the corner. Weakness lingers in the office space and hospitality related sectors, but there is growth in the heavier nonresidential categories like distribution facilities and data centers. In fact, warehouses are now the largest nonresidential category as measured by square feet and represent approximately 1/3 of construction awards. These projects are typically more aggregate intensive, and 90% of the near-term growth in this sector will occur in Vulcan service states according to Dodge. The administration and Congress are committed to an infrastructure-led economic recovery and have indicated that they will focus on an infrastructure built mix after the COVID-19 relief package. Clearly, our leading market positions will mean broad participation in infrastructure-related spending. We believe demand for aggregates will continue to improve as we progress through 2021. That being said, the timing of shipments to highway projects and nonresidential construction projects remains a variable. We consider these factors as we thought about our 2021 prospects and guidance. That said, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.34 billion and $1.44 billion. We anticipate 2021 aggregate shipments could follow a range of a 2% decline to a 2% increase as compared to 2020. Regardless of volume swings, we will improve our full year unit profitability in aggregates. We expect aggregate freight adjusted average selling prices to increase by 2% to 4% in 2021. And gross profit in our non aggregate segments was forecast to improve by mid-single to mid-high single digits. To sum it up, 2021 will turn out to be a year of solid earnings growth. Now I'll turn it over to Suzanne for further comments. Suzanne?"

Before I discuss fourth quarter 2020 highlights, I'll fill in some additional details on our 2021 guidance.

Before I discuss fourth quarter 2020 highlights, I'll fill in some additional details on our 2021 guidance. We made significant reductions in our selling, general and administrative expenses in 2020, and we expect to further leverage our overhead cost in 2021 and anticipate our SG&A expenses to be between $365 million and $375 million. We anticipate interest expense to approximate $130 million for the full year. Barring any changes to federal tax law, our effective tax rate will be about 21%. And the category of depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization expenses will be around $400 million. 
Now with respect to capital expenditures, we invested $361 million in 2020. We expect to spend between $450 million and $475 million 2021. This includes fully restarting and advancing growth projects that were delayed last spring, such as the opening of a new quarry in California, capacity expansion at other quarries and improvements to our logistics and distribution network. It also reflects a catch-up of operating CapEx that was postponed at the start of the pandemic. As always, we'll carefully monitor the economic environment and adjust our capital spending as necessary. As you model, you'll note that the combination of our assumptions for 2021 leads to another healthy year of cash generation. I'll now give a little color on the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $311 million, up 4% from last year's fourth quarter. Aggregates volume declined by 1%, while reported pricing increased by 3% and mix adjusted pricing by 2%. Costs were slightly higher in the quarter due to additional stripping costs in advance of future shipping growth and the timing of repairs. There were 2 items that affected the comparability of our fully diluted earnings per share in both the fourth quarter and full year 2020 as compared to those same periods in 2019. The first, we recorded a onetime noncash pension settlement charge of $23 million or $0.13 per diluted share in connection with the voluntary lump sum distribution of benefits to certain fully vested plan participants. This liability management action will benefit future pension expense and funding requirements. And second, the tax rate for fourth quarter and full year 2020 was higher than in the comparable periods in 2019. And last year, the tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and R&D credits were greater than the same benefits in 2020. The resulting EPS effect was $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and $0.18 per diluted share for the full year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position remains very strong, with a weighted average debt maturity of 13 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was 1.6x as of December 31, reflecting $1.2 billion of cash on hand. Approximately $500 million of this cash will be used to repay a debt maturity coming due next month. As Tom mentioned, our cash flow was robust in 2020 and contributed to year-over-year leverage reduction. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and the resulting slowdown in economic activity, M&A was lighter than usual in 2020. We returned $206 million to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases. Our capital allocation priorities which have helped to drive an improvement of 220 basis points and our return on invested capital over the last 3 years remain unchanged. And now I'll turn the call back over to Tom for closing remarks."

As you saw, our guidance was negative 2% to positive to volume. I would tell you that the aggregate demand outlook is improving and it seems to get brighter kind of week in and week out. And we would expect shipments to continue to improve sequentially as we march through 2021. Residential construction is very good and continues to grow. At the same time, heavy nonresidential construction is good, and it's important because of its aggregate intensity. At the same time, light nonresidential construction has been a challenge, and I think will be a headwind for us in the first half of 2021 probably getting better later in the year. And then highway lettings are much better. They were much better in the fourth quarter, and we think they'll continue to be strong throughout 2021. So this all adds up to starts and demand picture improving and will continue to prove as we march through the year. But as you know, the demand outlook environment due to pandemic has been quite volatile. So as we set our guidance to you for 2021, we try to be both transparent and thoughtful about 2 really important things with a given that we know residential is strong and growing. So the first one of those is nonresidential construction shipments. We know warehouses and distribution centers are good. They're growing. They're intensive. They're aggregate intensive. We believe that overall, non-res has stabilized from the fall we saw throughout 2020. Now how fast that returns, we don't know. The other thing that we're seeing now, which is a bright spot is we're seeing the LNG projects start to pop up on the Gulf Coast that were postponed from last year. So we'll just have to see what transpires with the rest of nonresidential construction. And then the second thing we try to be thoughtful about was the timing of highway work. Lettings were, if you remember, were light in Q3 of last year's DOTs tried to assess their funds or what was going to happen to their budgets. As once that stabilized, Q4 saw great lettings as should Q1 and the rest of 2021 as most DOTs have verify that their budgets will be up to flat to up. And so the question is, how fast are those lettings and those projects go to work. As I said, we think it will be back half loaded. All said, in all markets, our outlook is improving kind of week-over-week as the pandemic improves, so getting better, but still some things we got to watch."

So we believe that Congress is going to pass a new highway bill with an increase in funding in 2021. And I would probably give you that in 3 buckets. One that the Biden administration their agenda has infrastructure next on the list after the COVID-19 build. So it is a priority. Second, if you go to the House and Senate, Senator Carper, who is Chair of the EPW Committee and then Congressman Defazio, who's Chair of the House T&I Committee, both have said they want draft bills out of committee before August -- before the August recess. And the reason they want to do that is they want to target passing a bill before the expiration as act at the end of September. So the administration is on it. The Congress and house is on it. And then third, remember that funding should increase as highway funding right now is starting from a position of strength. So in 2021, the funding is up $12 billion year-over-year to $59 billion. $2 billion of that is an increase from appropriations, $10 billion of that is from COVID relief. This starts the highway funding baseline from a higher point and no one on the hill wants to reduce funding for highways. So we believe that we'll see it before the end of the year, hopefully before the expiration of the FAST Act, and we'll think it will be at higher levels."

Based on the state DOT budgets, which you pointed out, improvements in those budgets, we should see growth, we should see improvement in highway work and should grow as we march through 2021 and particularly as we see those lettings in the fourth quarter talk to mature the shipments. The majority of our 20 states will see funding and lettings up for fiscal year 2021, particularly as you pointed out, important states like Texas and California, and really importantly, our southeastern states, which are either up year-over-year or they're flat from '19, which was -- excuse me, flat from '20 which saw a big jump from '19. So really good solid funding. We're past the interruption of the pandemic. And then you've got the $10 billion of COVID-19 relief funds for highways. More than half of that $10 billion will be spent in Vulcan served states and support growth. Some of that in 2021, although it presently appears that the majority of those funds will support shipments in '22, maybe going a little bit into '23. So all of this, I'd tell you, is good news, and we still have to let the shipments catch up with the recently improved lettings.

I mean, we may see a little bit of an increase, but we certainly are not going to return to the old normal there. We've learned a lot during this time as have a lot of other companies about different, more efficient ways of communicating and accomplishing what we need to do. So we are always looking for ways to leverage SAG. I suspect we will continue to find some more of those as we go through. The range that we set if you look at the midpoint of the range in terms of SAG as a percentage of revenue, that's 7.3%, just a tick under 7.4%. So we'll see where we get to in the year.

We -- if you look back, we saw our aggregate operating efficiencies last year, whether that's throughput, plant availability, later efficiencies improve. At the same time, we had -- if you look at yield and energy efficiencies, they were mostly flat to slightly down, really due to production volumes being volatile and some product split issues on yield all of which were, I would tell you, pandemic related. So as we look forward to 2021, we'd expect a headwind of the diesel prices that impact us in some -- I'd tell you some $10 million to $20 million. But in spite of this, we would expect our unit cash cost for aggregates to be flat to maybe up a little bit. And it's really supported by our operating strategic disciplines that we've been working on in those processes that we've been putting in for the last 2 years. I would tell you that I'm really proud of our operators, first of all, for keeping each other safe and healthy and a tough year and working through a tough year, but also their relentless quest for continuous improvement in those drivers of our operating efficiencies that drive your cost savings.

But given the uncertainty we faced as we took some of those decisions to delay CapEx, et cetera, I certainly think that having a bit of cash there for safety is certainly the right thing to do. You're right, the first use of the $1.2 billion will be to pay down the $500 million maturity in March. I mean, that's been long-planned and taken care of. I think as we think about the capital allocation priorities, we've had in place for a long time that have really, I think, served us well. And are well understood by the market. If you think about the waterfall of those priorities and the order of them, the sort of other than maintaining and improving our dividend, which is critically important for us. We want to make sure that that can absolutely be sustained through the cycle. We are beginning to open up and spend a bit more cash on growth. That's the second priority in that capital allocation policy. And so we're going to be spending more on those internal growth projects. And look, as I said on M&A, we'll be looking at opportunities as they come down the path. I would say that, again, going back to that waterfall, those growth projects and dividends are of a higher priority to us than share repurchase. So I think we just need to wait a bit and see what materializes on the growth front. And then as we go through the year and see how the how the cash plays out and what other opportunities arise, then we've got plenty of time to consider the share repurchase."

If you really kind of step -- that California import state for us. So if you step back and look at that -- and look at California, the fires are out and the semicore is over. So already, things are better in California. And the 2021 demand is improving. Northern Cal -- is really kind of -- you got to separate northern California, Southern California, Northern Cal, is recovering. But remember, it had the longest -- it has the longest recovery because it had the most severe shelter in place on top of that, you had the fires and cement shortages, which really hurt us that whole market in 2020. So we'll see improvement in 2021, but a little slower. Now if you look at the highway piece, which affects the whole market, SB 1 lettings are going to increase -- are increasing this year by 14%. So we'll see growth, both growth in both improvement in aggregates and asphalt. And then in Southern California, we're going to see single -- excuse me, high single-digit to double-digit growth in residential and nonres is recovering with the warehouses and distribution center and even the like. So -- and I think if you step back and look at -- remember, look at California from last year's perspective, in spite of all the demand challenges and the pandemic and the fires and cement shortages in 2020, we were still more profitable year-over-year than we were in 2019. So that unit profitability sets us up well in 2021 as we start to see -- now we're starting to see volumes improving along with unit margins. So California will be a better place without the challenges they had in 2020. Arizona, I believe that, again, the residential fee sector is good. I think it is -- the highway is solid, nonres improving so Arizona is a pocket of population growth, which supports that. If you look at Illinois, it has its challenges, highway work, we'll probably be -- if you pull in toll work, will be solid, but the other sectors and res is okay, but the other sectors still see challenges as does non highway infrastructure. So somewhat of a challenged market for us."

We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. We hope you and your families are and will continue to be safe and healthy. 2020 represented another year of strong earnings growth for Vulcan, despite the many challenges associated with the pandemic. Our results demonstrated the strength, flexibility and resilient nature of our aggregates business. But most of all, 2020 demonstrated the commitment of Vulcan employees as they face uncertainty and had to make adjustments both in their professional and their personal lives. 
Our team stayed focused on operating safely, servicing our customers and making progress on our 4 strategic disciplines. Congratulations on a job well done. In a few minutes, Suzanne will share some fourth quarter highlights with you, but first, I'd like to summarize our full year 2020 accomplishments and discuss broad themes and where we are headed. 
Our full year financial results were strong. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 4% to $1.324 billion, and EBITDA margin expanded by 150 basis points. Cash generation continued to be strong with operating cash flows increasing by 9% to $1.1 billion. And finally, one of our principal measures, return on invested capital, improved by 40 basis points to 14.3%. These results were particularly noteworthy considering our annual aggregates volume declined by 3% as compared to 2019. Higher average selling prices and effective cost control were key drivers of this performance. 
Aggregates pricing improved by just over 3% on both a reported and mixed adjusted basis. Importantly, these pricing gains were widespread across our footprint. Our total cost of sales per ton increased by 2%, while our unit cash cost of sales, which is more controllable, only grew by 1%. This led to a 5.5% gain in our aggregates cash gross profit per ton. At $7.11, we are making good progress toward our longer-term goal of $9 per ton. This improvement in unit profitability was supported by our 4 strategic disciplines: Commercial excellence; operations excellence; logistics innovation; and strategic sourcing. We also experienced improvements in each of our non-aggregates business segments. Collectively, gross profit improved 12% across these 3 segments. Europe profitability increased in both asphalt and concrete. Asphalt gross profit increased $12 million or 19% over the prior year, even though volumes declined 7%. This improvement in profitability resulted from stable sales prices and lower liquid asphalt cost. Our ready-mix concrete unit profitability increased 8%. Average selling prices increased by 2% and volume declined by 5%, primarily as a result of the cement shortages in California.
The higher profitability in each of our business segments and our improving overall EBITDA margin set us up well for 2021. We are well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities in our geographic footprint. The demand environment is also improving, particularly in residential construction and highway construction. Let's take each market segment in turn. 
Residential continues to show strength, especially in single family. The market fundamentals of low interest rates and reduced supply suggests that the growth will continue. This represents a clear opportunity for us as both permits and starts are growing faster in Vulcan-served markets. 
Highway lettings and awards returned to growth in the fourth quarter. State DOT budgets have stabilized, with most of our states showing budgets flat to up from 2020. The caution in this market segment is that it will require time to turn awards into shipments given the midyear 2020 loan awards due to the pandemic. While timing of shipments is a variable, we will see improvement in highway shipments throughout 2021. As we said in the third quarter, the near-term outlook for the nonresidential construction sector provides the least forward visibility.
Dodge construction starts are still down year-over-year, but certainly, indicators are beginning to improve, perhaps signaling that potential improvement is just around the corner. Weakness lingers in the office space and hospitality related sectors, but there is growth in the heavier nonresidential categories like distribution facilities and data centers. In fact, warehouses are now the largest nonresidential category as measured by square feet and represent approximately 1/3 of construction awards. These projects are typically more aggregate intensive, and 90% of the near-term growth in this sector will occur in Vulcan serviced states according to Dodge.
The administration and Congress are committed to an infrastructure-led economic recovery and have indicated that they will focus on an infrastructure built next after the COVID-19 relief package. Clearly, our leading market positions will mean broad participation in infrastructure-related spending. We believe demand for aggregates will continue to improve as we progress through 2021. That being said, the timing of shipments to highway projects and nonresidential construction projects remains a variable. We consider these factors as we thought about our 2021 prospects and guidance. That said, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.34 billion and $1.44 billion. We anticipate 2021 aggregate shipments could fall in a range of a 2% decline to a 2% increase as compared to 2020. Regardless of volume swings, we will improve our full year unit profitability in aggregates. We expect aggregates freight adjusted average selling prices to increase by 2% to 4% in 2021. And gross profit in our non-aggregate segments was forecast to improve by mid-single to mid-high single digits. To sum it up, 2021 will turn out to be a year of solid earnings growth.
Now I'll turn it over to Suzanne for further comments. Suzanne?"

Before I discuss fourth quarter 2020 highlights, I'll fill in some additional details on our 2021 guidance. We made significant reductions in our selling, general and administrative expenses in 2020. We expect to",573,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone. Before I discuss fourth quarter 2020 highlights, I'll fill in some additional details on our 2021 guidance. We made significant reductions in our selling, general and administrative expenses in 2020. We expect to further leverage our overhead cost in 2021 and anticipate our SG&A expenses to be between $365 million and $375 million. We anticipate interest expense to approximate $130 million for the full year. Barring any changes to federal tax law, our effective tax rate will be about 21%. The category of depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization expenses will be around $400 million. 
Now with respect to capital expenditures, we invested $361 million in 2020. We expect to spend between $450 million and $475 million in 2021. This includes fully restarting and advancing growth projects that were delayed last spring, such as the opening of a new quarry in California, capacity expansion at other quarries and improvements to our logistics and distribution network. It also reflects a catch-up of operating CapEx that was postponed at the start of the pandemic. As always, we'll carefully monitor the economic environment and adjust our capital spending as necessary. 
As you model, you'll note that the combination of our assumptions for 2021 leads to another healthy year of cash generation. I'll now give a little color on the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $311 million, up 4% from last year's fourth quarter. Aggregates volume declined by 1%, while reported pricing increased by 3% and mix adjusted pricing by 2%. Costs were slightly higher in the quarter due to additional stripping costs in advance of future shipping growth and the timing of repairs. There were 2 items that affected the comparability of our fully diluted earnings per share in both the fourth quarter and full year 2020 as compared to those same periods in 2019. First, we recorded a onetime noncash pension settlement charge of $23 million or $0.13 per diluted share in connection with a voluntary lump sum distribution of benefits to certain fully vested plan participants. This liability management action will benefit future pension expense and funding requirements. And second, the tax rate for fourth quarter and full year 2020 was higher than in the comparable periods in 2019. Last year, the tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and R&D credits were greater than the same benefits in 2020. The resulting EPS effect was $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and $0.18 per diluted share for the full year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position remains very strong, with a weighted average debt maturity of 13 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was 1.6x as of December 31, reflecting $1.2 billion of cash on hand. Approximately $500 million of this cash will be used to repay a debt maturity coming due next month.
As Tom mentioned, our cash flow was robust in 2020 and contributed to year-over-year leverage reduction. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and the resulting slowdown in economic activity, M&A was lighter than usual in 2020. We returned $206 million to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases.

I'll start with just kind of stepping back and looking at the year 2021. As you saw, our guidance was negative 2% to positive 2% on volume.

As you saw, our guidance was negative 2% to positive 2% on volume. I would tell you that the aggregate demand outlook is improving and it seems to get brighter kind of week in and week out. And we would expect shipments to continue to improve sequentially as we march through 2021. 
Residential construction is very good and continues to grow. At the same time, heavy nonresidential construction is good, and it's important because of its aggregate intensity. At the same time, light nonresidential construction has been a challenge, and I think will be a headwind for us in the first half of 2021 probably getting better later in the year. And then highway lettings are much better. They were much better in the fourth quarter, and we think they'll continue to be strong throughout 2021. So this all adds up to starts and demand picture improving and will continue to prove as we march through the year.
But as you know, the demand outlook environment due to the pandemic has been quite volatile. So as we set our guidance to you, for 2021, we try to be both transparent and thoughtful about 2 really important things with a given that we know residential is strong and growing. So the first one of those is nonresidential construction shipments. We know warehouses and distribution centers are good. They're growing. They're intensive. They're aggregate intensive. We believe that overall, non-res has stabilized from the fall we saw throughout 2020. Now how fast that returns, we don't know. The other thing that we're seeing now, which is a bright spot is we're seeing the LNG projects start to pop up on the Gulf Coast that were postponed from last year. So we'll just have to see what transpires with the rest of nonresidential construction. And then the second thing we try to be thoughtful about was the timing of highway work. Lettings were -- if you remember, were light in Q3 of last year's DOTs tried to assess their funds or what was going to happen to their budgets. As once that stabilized, Q4 saw great lettings as should Q1 and the rest of 2021 as most DOTs have verified that their budgets will be up to flat to up. And so the question is, how fast are those lettings and those projects go to work. As I said, we think it will be back half loaded.
All said, in all markets, our outlook is improving kind of week-over-week as the pandemic improves, so getting better, but still some things we got to watch."

So we believe that Congress is going to pass a new highway bill with an increase in funding in 2021. And I would probably give you that in 3 buckets. One that the Biden administration, their agenda has infrastructure next on the list after the COVID-19 build. So it is a priority. 
Second, if you go to the House and Senate, Senator Carper, who is Chair of the EPW Committee and then Congressman DeFazio, who's Chair of the House T&I Committee, both have said they want draft bills out of committee before August -- before the August recess. And the reason they want to do that is they want to target passing a bill before the expiration of the FAST Act at the end of September. So the administration is on it. The Congress and House is on it. 
And then third, remember that funding should increase as highway funding right now is starting from a position of strength. So in 2021, the funding is up $12 billion year-over-year to $59 billion. $2 billion of that is an increase from appropriations, $10 billion of that is from COVID relief. This starts the highway funding baseline from a higher point and no one on the hill wants to reduce funding for highways. So we believe that we'll see it before the end of the year, hopefully before the expiration of the FAST Act, and we'll think it will be at higher levels."

Based on the state DOT budgets, which you pointed out, improvements in those budgets, we should see growth, we should see improvement in highway work and should grow as we march through 2021, particularly as we see those lettings in the fourth quarter talk to mature the shipments. 
The majority of our 20 states will see funding and lettings up for fiscal year 2021, particularly as you pointed out, important states like Texas and California, and really importantly, our southeastern states, which are either up year-over-year or they're flat from '19, which was -- excuse me, flat from '20 which saw a big jump from '19. So really good solid funding. We're past the interruption of the pandemic. And then you've got the $10 billion of COVID-19 relief funds for highways. More than half of that $10 billion will be spent in Vulcan served states and support growth. Some of that in 2021, although it presently appears that the majority of those funds will support shipments in '22, maybe going a little bit into '23. So all of this, I'd tell you, is good news, and we still have to let the shipments catch up with the recently improved lettings.

And as we talked about in the third quarter, I mean that's really an area where this year, depending on what happens with vaccine distribution, et cetera. I mean, we may see a little bit of an increase, but we certainly are not going to return to the old normal there. 
We've learned a lot during this time as have a lot of other companies about different, more efficient ways of communicating and accomplishing what we need to do. So we are always looking for ways to leverage SAG. I suspect we will continue to find some more of those as we go through. The range that we set if you look at the midpoint of the range in terms of SAG as a percentage of revenue, that's 7.3%, just a tick under 7.4%. So we'll see where we get to in the year. But certainly, as we did last year, we continue to look for ways to reduce that, and that improvement really sort of accelerated through the year.

You're right, the first use of the $1.2 billion will be to pay down the $500 million maturity in March. I mean, that's been long-planned and taken care of. I think as we think about the capital allocation priorities we've had in place for a long time that have really, I think, served us well. And are well understood by the market. If you think about the waterfall of those priorities and the order of them, the sort of other than maintaining and improving our dividend, which is critically important for us. We want to make sure that, that can absolutely be sustained through the cycle. We are beginning to open up and spend a bit more cash on growth. That's the second priority in that capital allocation policy. And so we're going to be spending more on those internal growth projects. And look, as I said on M&A, we'll be looking at opportunities as they come down the path. I would say that, again, going back to that waterfall, those growth projects and dividends are of a higher priority to us than share repurchase.

If you really kind of step back, California is an import state for us. So if you step back and look at that -- and look at California, the fires are out and the cement shortage is over. So already, things are better in California. And the 2021 demand is improving. Northern Cal -- is really kind of -- you got to separate northern California, Southern California, Northern Cal is recovering. But remember, it had the longest -- it has the longest recovery because it had the most severe shelter in place on top of that, you had the fires and cement shortages, which really hurt us that whole market in 2020. So we'll see improvement in 2021, but a little slower.
Now if you look at the highway piece, which affects the whole market, SB1 lettings are going to increase -- or increasing this year by 14%. So we'll see growth, both growth in -- both improvement in aggregates and asphalt. And then in Southern California, we're going to see single -- excuse me, high single-digit to double-digit growth in residential and nonres is recovering with the warehouses and distribution center and even the like. So -- and I think if you step back and look at -- remember, look at California from last year's perspective, in spite of all the demand challenges and the pandemic and the fires and cement shortages. In 2020, we were still more profitable year-over-year than we were in 2019. So that unit profitability sets us up well in 2021 as we start to see -- now we're starting to see volumes improving along with unit margins. So California will be a better place without the challenges they had in 2020.
Arizona, I believe that, again, the residential fee sector is good. I think it is -- the highway is solid, nonres improving. So Arizona is a pocket of population growth, which supports that. If you look at Illinois, it has its challenges, highway work will probably be -- if you pull in toll work, will be solid, but the other sectors and res is okay, but the other sectors still see challenges as does non-highway infrastructure. So somewhat of a challenged market for us."

Because you've now got to put it in the roads and the utilities, but it's also a better mix because you've got the substructure of basin fines under all those roads and utilities and under those slabs.

We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials and hope that you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. I want to begin by saying that our performance in the first quarter was a very promising start to the year. 
Demand in our markets continues to improve, and our team executed well as evidenced by our financial results. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the gain on sale from our reclaimed quarry in California was $244 million, up 22% compared to last year. This strong growth was driven in part by a 3% increase in aggregate shipments. Despite weather impacts across Texas and parts of the Southeast in February, we experienced a pickup in shipments and March proved to be a strong month. 
Residential starts continue to accelerate. And highway starts also increased due to improved lettings in the third and fourth quarters of last year. We've experienced an increase in both the number of jobs and the shipping speed in the heavy nonresidential space, which is also the most aggregate intensive. And finally, some of the jobs that had been postponed last year have started. With year-over-year improvement across our footprint, pricing was the second driver of our EBITDA growth. Freight adjusted aggregates pricing increased by 2% in the quarter. Adjusted for mix, the increase was 1.3%. This was, as expected, since we were shipping work that have been bid in the middle of the pandemic when there was uncertainty and a lack of demand visibility. As our 2021 price increases gain traction, we will see pricing improvement throughout the year. The third driver of EBITDA growth and the one most within our control was our exceptional cost performance in the quarter. 
Aggregate total cost of sales per ton was 2% lower than last year's first quarter. And cash cost of sales per ton declined by 3%. Cost control like this is an accomplishment and requires considerable discipline from our operators. The team focused hard on operational execution. And as a result, all of our operating parameters and the quarries improved year-over-year. We were pleased with the meaningful impact from our 4 strategic disciplines, which will continue to mature. The most compelling metric continues to be our strong unit margin gains across the footprint. Aggregates cash gross profit per ton increased by 9%. This demonstrates the attractive operational earnings power of our aggregates business when demand is combined with strong execution on our 4 strategic disciplines. Overall, our operating results this quarter helped drive a 90 basis point improvement in our return on invested capital. Suzanne will provide further comments on this and other aspects of our financial performance. 
Let's now turn to our view of the end markets, and then we'll cover how that influence our outlook for the full year. Broadly speaking, the demand environment improved considerably over the last few months. Construction starts, as measured by Dodge, got better along with other leading indicators like the Dodge Momentum Index, and ABI. Construction employment levels continue to improve as well. Residential construction remains the strongest end market. There is pent-up demand for houses and new subdivisions are being built with more to come. The market fundamentals of low interest rates and reduced supply are still in place, which foreshadows continued growth. Housing starts are growing faster in Vulcan served markets. The outlook for our nonresidential end markets remains limited. However, our quote activity has increased and leading indicators are improving, which suggest that a turnaround is happening. The strongest nonresidential sector relates to e-commerce and technology and encompasses data centers, warehouses and distribution facilities. 
According to Dodge, 90% of the growth in this sector will occur in Vulcan served markets. Majority of nonres starts currently fits within this category, but we believe a strong residential market, combined with an increasingly open economy will drive additional demand in other nonresidential sectors. With respect to highways, state budgets and letting -- and lettings are progressing as anticipated. We are seeing the improvement in lettings from the second half of 2020. 
Now turning to shipments. The COVID-19 relief funds have provided a backstop for any loss transportation revenues for highways. Our country's leadership continues to work on an infrastructure package. Both parties have proposed substantial increases in highway funding, and this is a priority for both the Democrats and the Republicans. 
To summarize our view of end markets, demand is improving. We see evidence of this, both on the ground with our customers, and in the data from leading indicators. As a result, we've upgraded our aggregates volume guidance for 2021 to a range of 1% to 4% growth compared to 2020. The excluding the gain on the sale of the California property, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of between $1.38 billion and $1.46 billion. As we look forward to consider opportunities, we have 3 paths to growth with higher returns. Those paths are organic growth, M&A and greenfields. I'll take each in turn. 
First, organic growth is a critical part of any strategy because it offers the most attractive and compelling value proposition on a risk-adjusted basis. We have the best geographic footprint in the industry and the best operators in the industry, but we are not satisfied. Our 4 strategic disciplines are designed to accelerate this organic growth strategy. And the benefits are clear as we grow our unit profitability. Second, we regularly review an active list of M&A targets. Last year, the M&A market basically shut down. But it's reopened this year. We have a long history of making both large and small acquisitions when they are a good strategic fit. Since 2014, we've completed more than 2 dozen value-enhancing acquisitions in some of the fastest-growing markets in the country. And finally, we had a long and successful history of developing and opening new aggregate locations. This allows us to pinpoint the location of aggregates reserves and growth quarters where there is no acquisition opportunity. Additional benefits include more control over timing of capital investment and not paying a premium for the assets. We like having a balance between organic and inorganic growth. It provides a high degree of flexibility and is an important part of our capital allocation process and our ability to increase our return on invested capital. 
I'll now turn the call over to Suzanne for further comments."

I'd like to start by highlighting 4 key areas to consider this quarter. Our aggregates unit profitability expansion, return on invested capital, balance sheet strength and the California land sale. First, unit pr",675,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to start by highlighting 4 key areas to consider this quarter. Our aggregates unit profitability expansion, return on invested capital, balance sheet strength and the California land sale. First, unit profitability. Our aggregates gross profit per ton increased by 12% to $4.82. We believe this is important because improving the operational profitability of existing locations generally comes with limited capital investment as compared to other growth engines. When the improvements are both sustainable and widespread across the footprint, significant value is created. Our strategic disciplines are making an impact, and we have a good track record of execution. 
Over the past 3 years, our compound annual growth rate for gross profit per ton was 7%. The second key area is return on invested capital. As Tom mentioned, the 90 basis point improvement in the quarter pushed our return to 14.8% for the trailing 12 months ended March 31. While a higher returns profile is always good, the way in which the improvement is achieved is also important. As an example, the first quarter's ROIC gain was comprised of a 1% increase in invested capital and a 7% increase in adjusted EBITDA. This further highlights the importance of the unit profitability discussed earlier. Over the past 3 years, our trailing 12 months ROIC has improved by 280 basis points, driven by a 4% compound annual growth rate in invested capital and an 11% compound annual growth rate in adjusted EBITDA. 
The third area is the balance sheet. Our balance sheet strength has created significant optionality and flexibility as we consider our capital allocation priorities, our balanced approach to growth and shareholder returns. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.4x and we have nearly $900 million of cash on the balance sheet. Our debt has a weighted average maturity of 15 years with no significant maturities in the near term. And as always, we will continue to operate the business for the long term. We will not rush decisions to invest just because extra capital is available. 
The last of the 4 key areas I wanted to highlight was the sale of the reclaimed quarry in Southern California. The sale generated $182 million of net proceeds and a pretax gain of $115 million. One of the strengths of our aggregates focused business are the multiple opportunities to create value and the life cycle of this quarry demonstrates that well. Now so far on the call, we focused entirely on the aggregates business. So let's shift briefly to non aggregates. 
Gross profit in those segments collectively was $5.6 million in the quarter or $2 million less than last year. The severe weather mentioned earlier affected both asphalt volumes in Alabama, Tennessee and Texas, and concrete volumes in Virginia. Before I turn the call back over to Tom, I'll touch briefly on 2 more topics; diesel fuel costs and a change in our effective tax rate. 
With respect to the cost of diesel, it really wasn't much of a factor in the quarter because the unit price of diesel was relatively unchanged from last year's first quarter. For the full year, we now anticipate that the cost of diesel fuel will be a headwind of approximately $25 million, reflecting higher prices since the start of the year. The last time we spoke with you, we expected that our effective tax rate for 2021 would be 21%. We now expect the full year rate to be between 23% and 24% following a 27% rate in the first quarter. The higher rate in Q1 and the revised expectation for the full year resulted from Alabama's recent change in the law, which modified the methodology by which a company apportions income to the state. This change had the effect of reducing our ability to fully utilize certain net operating loss carry-forwards in Alabama. And as a result, we recorded a $14 million charge in the first quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for closing comments."

If you remember, we saw a slowdown in lettings in the third quarter when revenues fell in Q2 of last year, then lettings ramp back up in October and have stayed up. So the 2021 DOT budgets and lettings basically return to normal. You saw gas tax revenues return you got the $10 billion of a million from the first COVID-19 relief packages. So basically, 2021 back to normal. As we look forward to 2022, which in most states, starts -- fiscal year starts July 1, it appears -- they haven't finalized our budgets, but it appears the budgets, again, will be back to normal or as planned with overall growth. I would point out that 4 of our 5 top states will see funding growth, we think, in fiscal year 2022. So back to normal. 
On the highway bill, on the federal highway bill, I think for me, the good news is that our nation's infrastructure problem and potential solutions are on the front page of the paper every day. I think it's too early to say how much spending will be up. But regardless of whose plan you like, both plans show a considerable increase in funding for roads and bridges. And also remember that in any definition of infrastructure, if it's new construction, aggregates is going to be in the foundation. So it will help us whether it's roads and bridges or other forms of infrastructure. So the bottom line is that we are -- I think we're likely to see an infrastructure package get done by the end of the year was substantially increase in funding. And again, going back to your first question, don't forget that the state funding is up and will continue to get better. So it looks like a bright future from an infrastructure perspective."

But with respect to whether or not capital gains tax and the potential changes proposed by the Biden administration are driving sellers to the market, I mean that's that's something that you often hear come up as tax law potentially changes. And as there's a pickup in M&A activity. In our view, I mean, it's possible. I certainly wouldn't say that it would have no impact. But in our experience, we typically see the driver, I mean, particularly in some of the small bolt-on acquisitions as being sort of generational changes with ownership as certain of the business leaders that have been running some of these smaller to mid sized businesses decide that they want to have a look at succession planning, are their children going to be involved in the business, et cetera. We see that as the more typical driver of a potential seller into the M&A market."

Good news is it started faster than anticipated really in the nonresidential and highway sector, and those were the big unknowns for us. So as we get a little more clarity to that and how fast jobs are starting and what our backlog look like, it gave us confidence that we could up our our volume guidance. So that was -- it was just -- the work -- we knew the work was there, how fast was it going to come back and it just came back faster than we had expected. I think if you look at the cost guidance, and there -- right now, we would say low single-digit built in our projection. That includes -- I think what you're seeing there is the inflationary pressures. Obviously, we call it out fuel. I think we have been around $10 million or so. We're now at $25 million, and that's simply the price of diesel went up. So the goal with cost is always flat costs. And I know our operators have a passion to do that and we think we can beat inflation. But right now, I think we're -- that's our best estimate on cost to be low single digit."

As Tom said, some of those postponed jobs starting to come back online, input from our customers, what we were seeing across the the footprint in all the markets, but also from a macro perspective, we have a number of leading indicators we looked at, that are all turning in the positive direction. And just as examples, we look at construction, unemployment. We look at ABI, the index as kind of a trend indicator, even though it can be volatile month-to-month. We are a big believer in Dodge Starts on a total dollars basis that's growing again in our markets, and we also look at the Dodge Momentum index, which is sort of an indicator for non risk.

That's typically the smallest quarter. It's seasonally affected. And when you look out toward third quarter, you do have the severe weather events that could potentially have some impact. So we want to be a bit cautious about that. On the higher side of the volume, the plus 4%, again, if we see the starts and other work opportunities, job opportunities out there come to pass, I mean, we could definitely be at that at that level. So it's really around nonres and just exactly how quickly that comes back. So could we be a bit better? I guess, possibly. But I think that for now, based on what we know and what we see in all those internal and external indicators, we are comfortable with the 1 to 4 range, I think we thoughtfully considered everything we know, and I think it's exactly the right place for us to be. As we sit here on May 4. And as we look forward in second quarter, look, we'll have a look and see where we are then.

Always, if you look at inflationary pressures and diesel coupled with better visibility to rising demand, that's always good for price. And I mean that's like 2 of the fundamentals, things that are really good for price. So I'd call pricing in the quarter as expected. Q1, we're working off work that we bid in the middle of pandemic. When price increases were not as robust because of uncertainty, and there's a lot of uncertainty if you think back a year. And as we said in Q2, we would accelerate prices through the year. Our April fixed plant prices are now in effect and as expected. So prices will continue to grow through the year. And that's what we expected, and that's what we're seeing. I do think that pricing will, as you say, will climb due to both fuel and inflation and demand returning. Our bid work pricing is moving up faster now because of inflationary pressures, particularly diesel and logistics challenges. And then we're now having more conversations about a second price increase or a midyear price increase depending on the market with our customers, and they get that based on both fuel and inflationary pressures. And I would say their profitabilities are now -- their bid workers -- their price is going up because of both the same thing, both inflationary pressures and visibility to demand. At the same time, and we all know that pricing is critical for all of us, but at the same time, remember, it's only part of the unit margin, arithmetic, unit margins is still the most important metric and I believe our teams have done a really good job implementing those 4 strategic disciplines. Our cash growth [Indiscernible] went up by 9% in the quarter, and that's that's a good job because it was a combination of volume, price and cost."

So the time from when they're let or when their bid to the time they're working is much faster than what we traditionally see in nonres and that was a little bit of the change in our outlook for the year. We saw those nonres jobs just starting faster than we expected. Now we're also seeing jobs that were postponed in the pandemic start again, start-up. And you couple that with -- we're starting to see green shoots on traditional nonres that's following subdivision construction and so in general, nonres is on the min.

So while our market outlook is really exciting with the growth from a volume perspective, there's always, there's going to be challenges. And right now, it's inflationary pressures, labor and logistics. And we're addressing these now. And our 4 strategic disciplines will allow us to mitigate these challenges faster. And I'll take them in turn. Inflation, the aggregates business has the ability to beat inflation for a couple of reasons. It allows us an avenue for price and we own our largest cost, which is the rock in the ground. And we believe that our good operating efficiencies supported by our operating disciplines will help offset inflation. Labor, again, our operating excellence program improves efficiencies. But also, we've really accelerated employee training and development. And that retains employees, that attracts employees and gets new employees up to speed faster, which is very important and keeps them safe. And then on the logistics front, if you remember, future truck shortages were one of the catalysts behind our logistics innovation efforts. And that allows us to truck more efficiently, and we can beat those challenges actually with technology-driven efficiencies. So our -- those 4 strategic disciplines are designed to take advantage of tailwinds, but also to dampen the effects of headwinds so that we can live up to the potential for our shareholders. And I think that's what you'll see over the next year. We'll take advantage of the volume and potentially pricing tailwinds, but will offset the headwinds of inflation, labor and logistic challenges."

And as always, we're going to be both opportunistic and disciplined about our approach to acquisitions. It's got to fit us. So when it comes to growth, I'd actually take a broader view, as you talked about and look at Vulcan's ability to grow. And it's unique because it's balanced. And the -- we talked about the 3 avenues. One was acquisitions. And look, we're the largest, most probable producer, we're going to get the call when it's something for sale, but we have to be disciplined and we have to do the work to pay the right price for the right assets. Number 2 would be opening greenfield facilities and greenfielding and opened a new facility. Greenfielding is a -- it's difficult to do and requires a lot of hard, smart work. You have to go out and define the growth quarters. You have to overlay that with geology. You have to go procure the land, you have to get the permits. And then you have to build the right facility at the right time. And the reason for that greenfields are so important is that as you look at the growth quarter, there may not be an acquisition target available to best supply that growth quarter, hence, the greenfield. But just -- you have to have the know-how, and it's hard to do and you have to do the hard work. There's nothing easy about it, and you have to time it right. And then the last, in the third quarter we talked about was organic growth. And you've heard me talk endlessly about our 4 strategic disciplines, and we're excited about them because they're important. And this has to be done with its design and planning and discipline. And it's important because it's -- from a shareholder perspective because it's lower risk and higher returns. And for us, it's working. You look at our numbers, over the last couple of years, you see us accelerate our growth in unit margins. And so that balanced approach for us is so important.

And by that, I mean, we will continue to grow the dividend at the Board's discretion to a level that we are absolutely certain that we can maintain through the cycle because what we absolutely do not want to do is have shifts and changes in that dividend. So when you're talking about an ordinary dividend, the ability to maintain that level is absolutely critical. And that's what we're focused on. When you look at our cash generation capabilities, if you look at our operating cash flows over the trailing 12 months, cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion. That's up about 20% year-over-year.

We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials and hope that you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. I want to begin by saying that our performance in the first quarter was a very promising start to the year.
Demand in our markets continues to improve, and our team executed well as evidenced by our financial results. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the gain on sale from our reclaimed quarry in California was $244 million, up 22% compared to last year. This strong growth was driven in part by a 3% increase in aggregate shipments. Despite weather impacts across Texas and parts of the Southeast in February, we experienced a pickup in shipments and March proved to be a strong month.
Residential starts continue to accelerate. And highway starts also increased due to improved lettings in the third and fourth quarters of last year. We've experienced an increase in both the number of jobs and the shipping speed in the heavy nonresidential space, which is also the most aggregate intensive. And finally, some of the jobs that had been postponed last year have started. With year-over-year improvement across our footprint, pricing was the second driver of our EBITDA growth. Freight-adjusted aggregates pricing increased by 2% in the quarter. Adjusted for mix, the increase was 1.3%. This was, as expected, since we were shipping work that have been bid in the middle of the pandemic when there was uncertainty and a lack of demand visibility. As our 2021 price increases gain traction, we will see pricing improvement throughout the year.
The third driver of EBITDA growth and the one most within our control was our exceptional cost performance in the quarter. Aggregate total cost of sales per ton was 2% lower than last year's first quarter. And cash cost of sales per ton declined by 3%. Cost control like this is an accomplishment and requires considerable discipline from our operators. The team focused hard on operational execution. And as a result, all of our operating parameters in the quarries improved year-over-year.
We were pleased with the meaningful impact from our 4 strategic disciplines, which will continue to mature. The most compelling metric continues to be our strong unit margin gains across the footprint. Aggregates cash gross profit per ton increased by 9%. This demonstrates the attractive operational earnings power of our aggregates business when demand is combined with strong execution on our 4 strategic disciplines. Overall, our operating results this quarter helped drive a 90 basis point improvement in our return on invested capital. Suzanne will provide further comments on this and other aspects of our financial performance.
Let's now turn to our view of the end markets, and then we'll cover how that influence our outlook for the full year. Broadly speaking, the demand environment improved considerably over the last few months. Construction starts, as measured by Dodge, got better along with other leading indicators like the Dodge Momentum Index, and ABI. Construction employment levels continue to improve as well. Residential construction remains the strongest end market. There is pent-up demand for houses and new subdivisions are being built with more to come. The market fundamentals of low interest rates and reduced supply are still in place, which foreshadows continued growth. Housing starts are growing faster in Vulcan-served markets. The outlook for our nonresidential end markets remains limited. However, our quote activity has increased and leading indicators are improving, which suggest that a turnaround is happening. The strongest nonresidential sector relates to e-commerce and technology and encompasses data centers, warehouses and distribution facilities.
According to Dodge, 90% of the growth in this sector will occur in Vulcan-served markets. Majority of nonres starts currently fits within this category, but we believe a strong residential market, combined with an increasingly open economy will drive additional demand in other nonresidential sectors. With respect to highways, state budgets and lettings are progressing as anticipated. We are seeing the improvement in lettings from the second half of 2020 now turning to shipments. The COVID-19 relief funds have provided a backstop for any loss transportation revenues for highways. Our country's leadership continues to work on an infrastructure package. Both parties have proposed substantial increases in highway funding, and this is a priority for both the Democrats and the Republicans.
To summarize our view of end markets, demand is improving. We see evidence of this, both on the ground with our customers and in the data from leading indicators. As a result, we've upgraded our aggregates volume guidance for 2021 to a range of 1% to 4% growth compared to 2020. Excluding the gain on the sale of the California property, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of between $1.38 billion and $1.46 billion.
As we look forward to consider opportunities, we have 3 paths to growth with higher returns. Those paths are organic growth, M&A and greenfields. I'll take each in turn. First, organic growth is a critical part of any strategy because it offers the most attractive and compelling value proposition on a risk-adjusted basis. We have the best geographic footprint in the industry and the best operators in the industry, but we are not satisfied. Our 4 strategic disciplines are designed to accelerate this organic growth strategy. And the benefits are clear as we grow our unit profitability.
Second, we regularly review an active list of M&A targets. Last year, the M&A market basically shut down. But it's reopened this year. We have a long history of making both large and small acquisitions when they are a good strategic fit. Since 2014, we've completed more than 2 dozen value-enhancing acquisitions in some of the fastest-growing markets in the country.
And finally, we had a long and successful history of developing and opening new aggregate locations. This allows us to pinpoint the location of aggregates reserves in growth quarters where there is no acquisition opportunity. Additional benefits include more control over timing of capital investment and not paying a premium for the assets. We like having a balance between organic and inorganic growth. It provides a high degree of flexibility and is an important part of our capital allocation process and our ability to increase our return on invested capital.
I'll now turn the call over to Suzanne for further comments."

I'd like to start by highlighting 4 key areas to consider this quarter. Our aggregates unit profitability expansion, return on invested capital, balance sheet strength and the California land sale.First, unit p",673,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to start by highlighting 4 key areas to consider this quarter. Our aggregates unit profitability expansion, return on invested capital, balance sheet strength and the California land sale.
First, unit profitability. Our aggregates gross profit per ton increased by 12% to $4.82. We believe this is important because improving the operational profitability of existing locations generally comes with limited capital investment as compared to other growth engines. When the improvements are both sustainable and widespread across the footprint, significant value is created. Our strategic disciplines are making an impact, and we have a good track record of execution. Over the past 3 years, our compound annual growth rate for gross profit per ton was 7%.
The second key area is return on invested capital. As Tom mentioned, the 90 basis point improvement in the quarter pushed our return to 14.8% for the trailing 12 months ended March 31. While a higher returns profile is always good, the way in which the improvement is achieved is also important. As an example, the first quarter's ROIC gain was comprised of a 1% increase in invested capital and a 7% increase in adjusted EBITDA. This further highlights the importance of the unit profitability discussed earlier. Over the past 3 years, our trailing 12 months ROIC has improved by 280 basis points, driven by a 4% compound annual growth rate in invested capital and an 11% compound annual growth rate in adjusted EBITDA.
The third area is the balance sheet. Our balance sheet strength has created significant optionality and flexibility as we consider our capital allocation priorities, our balanced approach to growth and shareholder returns. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.4x, and we have nearly $900 million of cash on the balance sheet. Our debt has a weighted average maturity of 15 years with no significant maturities in the near term. And as always, we will continue to operate the business for the long term. We will not rush decisions to invest just because extra capital is available.
The last of the 4 key areas I wanted to highlight was the sale of the reclaimed quarry in Southern California. The sale generated $182 million of net proceeds and a pretax gain of $115 million. One of the strengths of our aggregates-focused business are the multiple opportunities to create value and the life cycle of this quarry demonstrates that well.
Now so far on the call, we focused entirely on the aggregates business. So let's shift briefly to non-aggregates. Gross profit in those segments collectively was $5.6 million in the quarter or $2 million less than last year. The severe weather mentioned earlier affected both asphalt volumes in Alabama, Tennessee and Texas, and concrete volumes in Virginia.
Before I turn the call back over to Tom, I'll touch briefly on 2 more topics; diesel fuel costs and a change in our effective tax rate. With respect to the cost of diesel, it really wasn't much of a factor in the quarter because the unit price of diesel was relatively unchanged from last year's first quarter. For the full year, we now anticipate that the cost of diesel fuel will be a headwind of approximately $25 million, reflecting higher prices since the start of the year.
The last time we spoke with you, we expected that our effective tax rate for 2021 would be 21%. We now expect the full year rate to be between 23% and 24% following a 27% rate in the first quarter. The higher rate in Q1 and the revised expectation for the full year resulted from Alabama's recent change in the law, which modified the methodology by which a company apportions income to the state. This change had the effect of reducing our ability to fully utilize certain net operating loss carry-forwards in Alabama. And as a result, we recorded a $14 million charge in the first quarter.

So I would describe the state DOT budgets and lettings as simply back to normal. If you remember, we saw a slowdown in lettings in the third quarter when revenues fell in Q2 of last year, then lettings ramped back up in October and have stayed up. So the 2021 DOT budgets and lettings basically return to normal. You saw gas tax revenues return, you got the $10 billion of aid from the first COVID-19 relief packages. So basically, 2021 back to normal.
As we look forward to 2022, which in most states, starts -- fiscal year starts July 1, it appears -- now they haven't finalized their budgets, but it appears the budgets, again, will be back to normal or as planned with overall growth. I would point out that 4 of our 5 top states will see funding growth, we think, in fiscal year 2022. So back to normal.
On the highway bill, on the federal highway bill, I think, for me, the good news is that our nation's infrastructure problem and potential solutions are on the front page of the paper every day. I think it's too early to say how much funding will be up. But regardless of whose plan you like, both plans show a considerable increase in funding for roads and bridges. And also remember that in any definition of infrastructure, if it's new construction, aggregates is going to be in the foundation. So it will help us whether it's roads and bridges or other forms of infrastructure.
So the bottom line is that we are -- I think we're likely to see an infrastructure package get done by the end of the year with substantially increase in funding. And again, going back to your first question, don't forget that the state funding is up and will continue to get better. So it looks like a bright future from an infrastructure perspective."

Good news is it started faster than anticipated, really in the nonresidential and highway sector, and those were the big unknowns for us.
So as we got a little more clarity to that and how fast jobs are starting and what our backlog look like, it gave us confidence that we could up our volume guidance. So that was -- it was just -- the work -- we knew the work was there, it was how fast was it going to come back and it just came back faster than we had expected.
I think if you look at the cost guidance, and there, right now, we would say low single-digit built in our projection. That includes I think what you're seeing there is the inflationary pressures. Obviously, we call it out fuel. I think we have been around $10 million or so. We're now at $25 million, and that's simply the price of diesel went up. So the goal with cost is always flat costs. And I know our operators have a passion to do that, and we think we can beat inflation. But right now, I think we're -- that's our best estimate on cost to be low single digit."

And so it really, for us, was a combination of seeing the growth in the first quarter. As Tom said, some of those postponed jobs starting to come back online, input from our customers, what we were seeing across the footprint in all the markets, but also from a macro perspective, we have a number of leading indicators we looked at that are all turning in the positive direction.
And just as examples, we look at construction, unemployment. We look at ABI, the index as kind of a trend indicator, even though it can be volatile month to month. We are a big believer in Dodge starts on a total dollars basis. That's growing again in our markets, and we also look at the Dodge Momentum Index, which is sort of an indicator for nonres.

It's seasonally affected. And when you look out toward third quarter, you do have the severe weather events that could potentially have some impact. So we want to be a bit cautious about that.
On the higher side of the volume, the plus 4%. Again, if we see the starts and other work opportunities, job opportunities out there come to pass, I mean, we could definitely be at that level. So it's really around nonres and just exactly how quickly that comes back. So could we be a bit better? I guess, possibly. But I think that for now, based on what we know and what we see in all those internal and external indicators, we are comfortable with the 1 to 4 range. I think we thoughtfully considered everything we know, and I think it's exactly the right place for us to be as we sit here on May 4.

Always, if you look at inflationary pressures and diesel coupled with better visibility to rising demand, that's always good for price. And I mean that's like 2 of the fundamentals things that are really good for price. So I'd call pricing in the quarter as expected. Q1, we're working off work that we bid in the middle of pandemic when price increases were not as robust because of uncertainty, and there's a lot of uncertainty if you think back a year. And as we said, in Q2, we would accelerate prices through the year. Our April fixed plant prices are now in effect and went as expected. So prices will continue to grow through the year. And that's what we expected, and that's what we're seeing.
I do think that pricing will -- as you say, will climb due to both fuel and inflation and demand returning. Our bid work pricing is moving up faster now because of inflationary pressures, particularly diesel and logistics challenges. And then we're now having more conversations about a second price increase or a midyear price increase depending on the market with our customers, and they get that based on both fuel and inflationary pressures. And I would like to say their profitabilities are now -- their bid work is -- their price is going up because of both the same thing, both inflationary pressures and visibility to demand.
At the same time, and we all know that pricing is critical for all of us, but at the same time, remember, it's only part of the unit margin arithmetic. Unit margins is still the most important metric, and I believe our teams have done a really good job implementing those 4 strategic disciplines. Our cash gross profit per ton went up by 9% in the quarter, and that's a good job because it was a combination of volume, price and cost."

So the time from when they're let or when their bid to the time they're working is much faster than what we traditionally see in nonres and that was a little bit of the change in our outlook for the year. We saw those nonres jobs just starting faster than we expected.
Now we're also seeing jobs that were postponed in the pandemic start again -- start up.

So while our market outlook is really exciting with the growth from a volume perspective, there's always, there's going to be challenges, and right now, it's inflationary pressures, labor and logistics. And we're addressing these now. And our 4 strategic disciplines will allow us to mitigate these challenges faster. And I'll take them in turn.
Inflation, the aggregates business has the ability to beat inflation for a couple of reasons. It allows us an avenue for price, and we own -- our largest cost, which is the rock in the ground. And we believe that our good operating efficiencies supported by our operating disciplines will help offset inflation.
Labor, again, our operating excellence program improves efficiencies. But also, we've really accelerated employee training and development. And that retains employees, that attracts employees and gets new employees up to speed faster, which is very important and keeps them safe.
And then on the logistics front, if you remember, future truck shortages were one of the catalysts behind our logistics innovation efforts. And that allows us to truck more efficiently, and we can beat those challenges actually with technology-driven efficiencies.
So our -- those 4 strategic disciplines are designed to take advantage of tailwinds, but also to dampen the effects of headwinds so that we can live up to the potential for our shareholders. And I think that's what you'll see over the next year. We'll take advantage of the volume and potentially pricing tailwinds, but will offset the headwinds of inflation, labor and logistic challenges."

So if you just step back and look at growth, if you remember, in 2020, the M&A growth really dried up. We've seen a marked pickup in 2021. And as always, we're going to be both opportunistic and disciplined about our approach to acquisitions. It's got to fit us. So when it comes to growth, I'd actually take a broader view, as you talked about and look at Vulcan's ability to grow. And it's unique because it's balanced. And then there's -- we talked about the 3 avenues. One was acquisitions. And look, we're the largest, most probable aggregates producer, we're going to get the call when it's something for sale, but we have to be disciplined, and we have to do the work to pay the right price for the right assets.
Number 2 would be opening greenfield facilities and -- greenfielding is opening a new facility. Greenfielding is a -- it's difficult to do and requires a lot of hard, smart work. You have to go out and define the growth quarters. You have to overlay that with geology. You have to go procure the land, you have to get the permits. And then you have to build the right facility at the right time. And the reason for that greenfields are so important is that as you look at the growth quarter, there may not be an acquisition target available to best supply that growth quarter, hence, the greenfield. But just -- you have to have the know-how, and it's hard to do and you have to do the hard work. There's nothing easy about it, and you have to time it right.
And then the last, in the third quarter we talked about was organic growth. And you've heard me talk endlessly about our 4 strategic disciplines, and we're excited about them because they're important. And this has to be done with its design and planning and discipline. And it's important because it's -- from a shareholder's perspective because it's lower risk and higher returns. And for us, it's working. You look at our numbers, over the last couple of years, you see us accelerate our growth in unit margins. And so that balanced approach for us is so important. And don't forget that we also have the balance sheet to execute on this."

So I'll talk about highways and let Suzanne talk about dividend. I think that what's important in infrastructure, and I said this when we talked about the highway bill in the Biden plan, anything that is new construction, you have to have aggregates in the foundation. And now obviously, we love roads and highways because they're most aggregate-intensive. But anything that is new construction, you got to have aggregates in it.

Look, the dividend is very important to us, and it's very important to our shareholders, and we want to make absolutely certain that we maintain the dividend. It's a very good way of increasing shareholder returns. And as you noted, I mean, the company has continued to increase that year-over-year. And as we've said, it is -- we think about it in almost a progressive kind of way. And by that, I mean, we will continue to grow the dividend at the Board's discretion to a level that we are absolutely certain that we can maintain through the cycle because what we absolutely do not want to do is have shifts and changes in that dividend.
So when you're talking about an ordinary dividend, the ability to maintain that level is absolutely critical. And that's what we're focused on. When you look at our cash-generation capabilities, if you look at our operating cash flows over the trailing 12 months, cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion. That's up about 20% year-over-year. So I think you can tell by the strong cash generation capabilities that we have that we should -- again, at the Board's discretion, but we should be in a position to continue the view I just described on dividend growth."

So -- but I would say this much. The pricing environment has improved dramatically.

We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials and hope that you and your families continue to be safe and healthy.

We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials and hope that you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. 
I want to begin today's call by taking a moment to congratulate our team for their solid execution during the first half of the year. Our performance through the first 2 quarters further demonstrates the strength of our aggregates-led business. We expect the momentum we generated in the first half of the year to carry through the second half, and we reiterate our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1.38 billion to $1.46 billion. 
For the first half of the year, our adjusted EBITDA increased by 7% and our aggregate cash gross profit per ton expanded by 5% through a combination of volume growth, higher pricing and improved operating efficiencies. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $406 million, essentially unchanged versus the same quarter last year. 
We achieved this result despite a $25 million headwind from much higher diesel and liquid asphalt costs. Diesel costs rose by $15 million in the quarter. Liquid asphalt costs were $10 million higher than the same period last year. And together with wet weather, negatively impacted the profitability of our non-aggregate segments. 
Even after considering the energy headwind, our aggregates cash gross profit per ton grew by 2% in the quarter due to our team's consistent execution of our 4 strategic disciplines. With a 4% increase in aggregates volume in the second quarter, and the market's current visibility to demand, the pricing environment continues to improve. Freight-adjusted aggregates pricing increased 3% in the quarter, and the rate of growth improved sequentially throughout the quarter. Adjusted for mix, freight-adjusted price improved 2.6%, twice the growth rate realized in the first quarter. 
Along with improved volume and pricing, operating efficiencies and cost control helped to offset inflationary pressures. Our total cash cost of sales increased by 4% in the quarter versus the prior year. Excluding the diesel headwinds, cash cost of sales grew by less than 1%. During the second half of the year, we will remain diligent and focused on controlling what we can control and on driving further improvements in our profitability. 
The solid aggregate performance helped to offset reduced profitability in the non-aggregates segment. Our second quarter non-aggregates gross profit declined year-over-year due primarily to the higher liquid asphalt cost, which I mentioned earlier, and lower volumes in both asphalt and concrete. Wet weather-impacted asphalt shipments, while a shift in timing of projects particularly in Virginia, resulted in lower-than-anticipated concrete shipments. 
Turning now to the demand picture. It has improved across our major end markets, as well as geographies. The residential end-use has shown continued strength with solid starts in single-family housing. We've also seen an uptick in multifamily housing starts. 
Now with respect to the nonresidential outlook, improvement continues in a number of leading indicators, and we have begun to see month-over-month improvement in starts. The strongest nonresidential sector continues to be the work related to e-commerce and technology infrastructure, but lighter traditional nonresidential demand is also recovering. 
The level of highway starts remained healthy in the first half of 2021 as states got back to normal funding and budget levels. On the broader subject of federal highway and infrastructure spending, we're encouraged by the progress made toward a Highway Bill with substantially higher funding over the FAST Act levels. We've also seen an acceleration of starts in public infrastructure such as water and sewer treatment systems, airports and storm and flood control. 
Before turning the call over to Suzanne, I want to briefly touch on our growth strategy and the recently announced agreement to acquire U.S. Concrete. We have 3 paths to growth, and it's important to strike the right balance between these 3 in order to drive higher returns. Those paths are organic growth, greenfields and M&A. 
We always start with organic growth because it offers the most attractive and compelling value proposition on a risk-adjusted basis. We have a unique and irreplaceable asset base spread across the most attractive geographies in the U.S. Our 4 strategic disciplines are designed to accelerate our organic growth, and the benefits are clear as we expand our unit profitability. 
We also have a long and successful history of developing and opening new aggregate locations, particularly in growth corridors where acquisition opportunities may be limited. We like the flexibility that greenfields provide in regards to timing and pace of capital spending. 
Our third growth engine is M&A. U.S. Concrete is a great strategic fit for Vulcan, as it naturally complements our existing aggregates business. It also brings new geographic exposure to the company, expanding and diversifying our already strong footprint into the Northeast. 
Along with my colleagues at both Vulcan and U.S. Concrete, I'm very excited about the potential for this combination. It will allow us to further drive sustainable long-term shareholder value. And I look forward to welcoming the U.S. Concrete team to the Vulcan family. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Suzanne for further comments."

I'd like to begin by highlighting a few key areas to consider this quarter: our aggregates price realization, unit profitability, return on invested capital and balance sheet strength. First, our ability to con",493,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to begin by highlighting a few key areas to consider this quarter: our aggregates price realization, unit profitability, return on invested capital and balance sheet strength. 
First, our ability to consistently deliver compounding price improvements is an important driver of our unit margins. The current pricing environment is positive due to improving demand visibility and inflationary pressures. We've seen attractive sequential improvement in pricing through the first half of the year, and we expect the momentum to carry over to the second half. 
Clearly, these compounding price improvements, along with good operational execution, are having a positive impact on our unit profitability. This quarter marked the 12th straight quarter of improvement in our trailing 12-month cash gross profit per ton. For the trailing 12 months, cash gross profit per ton was $7.26 and for the quarter, it was $7.83 per ton, moving ever closer to our current goal of $9 per ton. 
The next area of focus is our return on invested capital. We are pleased with our improving returns. And on a trailing 12-month basis, return on invested capital was 14.8%, an increase of 60 basis points compared to the prior year period. This improvement was comprised of an essentially unchanged invested capital base and a 4% increase in trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. 
And finally, we will continue to prioritize our balance sheet strength to create the flexibility and optionality necessary to support our capital allocation strategy. At June 30, our net debt-to-EBITDA was 1.3x, reflecting $968 million of cash on hand. Our debt has a weighted average maturity of 15 years with no significant maturities in the near term. It's important to note that even after the anticipated close of the U.S. Concrete acquisition, our balance sheet will be in good standing and we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating. 
Before turning the call back over to Tom, I do want to touch briefly on 2 housekeeping matters. First, you will have noted an increase in our interest expense this quarter. Concurrent with the announced pending acquisition of U.S. Concrete in June, we obtained a bridge facility commitment to support the deal. Subsequently, we executed a $1.6 billion delayed draw term loan, which will be used to fund the acquisition, along with cash on hand. Borrowings under that facility are due 3 years from the funding date. And so this facility will be used as an interim measure prior to accessing the bond market at the appropriate time. As a result, financing costs of $9 million for the bridge commitment was recognized as expense in the second quarter. 
The final matter to mention is our effective tax rate. And as a reminder, at the end of first quarter, we increased our expectation of the full year rate to between 23% and 24%. That guidance is still applicable. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for closing remarks."

As you heard us say, we're confident in the full year guidance of $1.38 billion to $1.46 billion, which -- remember, we raised that 90 days ago. As you said, probably with a little bit different puts and takes. We probably won't make up or won't be able to make up the shortfall in other aggregates, which is really asphalt. As we're playing catch-up on liquid cost. 
Now I would say to that asphalt prices are going up and we'll see increased prices and probably improved margins in the second half, but probably not enough to offset all the liquid headwinds. That being said, aggregate volumes appear to be improving with demand improving in all market end uses. So I'd call it asphalt being offset by shipping on the higher side of our volume midpoint. 
So aggregates, we're on the optimistic side of volume. Prices in aggregates, we reiterate the 2% to 4% range, although we're seeing prices improving sequentially. From a cost perspective, we would still say that over the 12 months, we'll be low single digits, so good operating disciplines. Unit margin, in the mid single-digit range. Non-aggregates, a little lower, but improving, which brings me to, I'd say, confidence in that $1.38 billion to $1.46 billion guidance."

Yes, when you have -- we have visibility to growing demand like we have right now, and you couple that with pressures from fuel and other inflationary pressures, we know that prices will accelerate. They're probably accelerating a little faster than maybe we anticipated 90 days ago, and it's probably a little brighter. At this point, I think we'd be premature to adjust our 2021 pricing outlook, but I think it bodes very well for pricing in 2022. 
As we said in the first quarter call, as we called out, the rate of price increases continues to escalate sequentially over time. We saw that in the quarter. We talked about -- I mean, if you mix-adjust price in the second quarter, it doubled over the first quarter. And then if you look within the second quarter, prices increased sequentially month-to-month. 
I think that we'll see -- continue to see that sequential rate growth pattern throughout 2021. And I would expect it to -- that sequential improvement to continue in 2022 although maybe a little higher amplitude, and here's why. We started talking about to our customers about second half price increases in May. On bid work, which is about 6% of our work, we have definitely increased price increases over the last 60 days on new jobs. 
Now remember, there's a lag between that bid work. It won't ship for roughly 6 to 9 months. When it comes to fixed plants, we've had discussions and are having discussions about second half price increases, and we've realized those in a few markets. But in our conversations with customers, they've been very positive. Again, all supported by that clear visibility to growing demand and inflationary pressure. 
So while we see some benefit to 2021, this is definitely going to be a 2022 impact because those jobs that we bid now or bid over the last couple of months are definitely going to benefit 2022, and we'll see a bigger impact on fixed plant prices in 2022. Again, I think I would expect to see that rate of price increases continue to climb sequentially this year, and that pattern to continue to -- into 2022. So this is just a really good environment for pricing."

And I think with good cost control, I think we're confident with that mid-single-digit unit margin improvement. From a pricing from a geographic perspective, it's really widespread. We raised bid prices across our footprint over the last 2 months. I think that the second half fixed plant price increases, a few places in the Southeast. But it's -- that will really be more of a 2022 play with hopefully higher amplitude on pricing and maybe earlier in the year. 
So you got temporary pressures from inflation, but really a good setup from for prices moving forward. And I think that we've got a pretty -- good proven record on cost control to offset inflationary pressures, and we'll catch up with diesel even on cost control."

But despite the diesel headwinds, we also had a very good cash cost performance as well. Cash cost of sales was up 4% in the quarter. But if you back diesel out of that, which rose significantly and rapidly, our expenses were less than 1% rise year-over-year. 
So we certainly experienced some inflation in other parts of the business and other input products besides diesel. But again, we had sufficient operating efficiencies and cost control to hold those cash costs to within less than 1%. And so if you have the combination of good pricing discipline and those rises we've talked about, and we have good control over cost, which is one thing that we should be able to fully control, then you get the good results in cash gross profit per ton that we talked about. 
In Tom's comments, he called out that cash gross profit per ton was up 2%. If you exclude diesel from that, it's up 5%. So again, a very good performance, and it just shows when you focus on the things that you can control, what can be accomplished. In fact, if you look at the progression of cash gross profit per ton and you look at it on a trailing 12-month basis ended with the second quarter in 2019, and you compare that to the trailing 12 months ended the second quarter in 2021, so that's kind of 24-month period there, it's up 5%. So that's something that we will -- we're always focused on. We always like to talk about that because that's clearly the driver of our profitability, and we'll continue to talk about that."

At this point, all signs point to those significant increases in core highway funding. We think the Senate should pass their bill in the next week, which is incredibly exciting. And then I think we're confident that Congress passes the bill this year. 
Now it always -- I would caveat that, it always takes 1 to 2 years to see funding pass into shipments. Usually, we normally say 2 years.

Non-res starts on a trailing 6-month or trailing 3-month basis have now turned positive. We continue to see strength, as you would imagine, the heavy non-res, the warehouse and distribution centers. But now we're seeing growth in things like government buildings, institutional buildings, health care, private schools and churches. And we're just starting to see green shoots on stores that follow new subdivisions. 
So I'd call non-res out across our footprint pretty much as improving. Residential, it's going great. Single-family starts on a trailing 12-month basis were up 31% in our markets. Inventory is extremely low. This is almost all new subdivision work, which is more and more aggregate-intensive. So demand growth in this sector will continue to grow and still not overbuilt. Now you're seeing multifamily improvement permits for both multifamily and single-family would support continued growth. So it's just strong on the res side. 
Highways good. We're confident, we've returned back to normal. I can talk about that more later. I think what's exciting, which is a little bit of a shift that we're seeing now, we're seeing growth in non-highway infrastructure. And this is -- we started to see this in kind of the end of '19, beginning of '20, and then it got shut down with a pandemic. But on a trailing 12-month or 6-month and 3-month, it's very good. And it's more in the sector of water sewage. And you got to remember that the housing growth is also driving the non highway infrastructure.

We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials and hope that you and your families continue to be safe and healthy.
I want to begin today's call by taking a moment to congratulate our team for their solid execution during the first half of the year. Our performance through the first 2 quarters further demonstrates the strength of our aggregates-led business. We expect the momentum we generated in the first half of the year to carry through the second half, and we reiterate our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1.38 billion to $1.46 billion.
For the first half of the year, our adjusted EBITDA increased by 7% and our aggregates cash gross profit per ton expanded by 5% through a combination of volume growth, higher pricing and improved operating efficiencies. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $406 million, essentially unchanged versus the same quarter last year.
We achieved this result despite a $25 million headwind from much higher diesel and liquid asphalt costs. Diesel costs rose by $15 million in the quarter. Liquid asphalt costs were $10 million higher than the same period last year. And together with wet weather, negatively impacted the profitability of our non-aggregate segments.
Even after considering the energy headwind, our aggregates cash gross profit per ton grew by 2% in the quarter due to our team's consistent execution of our 4 strategic disciplines. With a 4% increase in aggregates volume in the second quarter and the market's current visibility to demand, the pricing environment continues to improve.
Freight-adjusted aggregates pricing increased 3% in the quarter, and the rate of growth improved sequentially throughout the quarter. Adjusted for mix, freight-adjusted price improved 2.6%, twice the growth rate realized in the first quarter.
Along with improved volume and pricing, operating efficiencies and cost control helped to offset inflationary pressures. Our total cash cost of sales increased by 4% in the quarter versus the prior year. Excluding the diesel headwinds, cash cost of sales grew by less than 1%. During the second half of the year, we will remain diligent and focused on controlling what we can control and on driving further improvements in our profitability.
The solid aggregates performance helped to offset reduced profitability in the non-aggregates segment. Our second quarter non-aggregates gross profit declined year-over-year due primarily to the higher liquid asphalt cost, which I mentioned earlier, and lower volumes in both asphalt and concrete. Wet weather impacted asphalt shipments while a shift in timing of projects, particularly in Virginia, resulted in lower-than-anticipated concrete shipments.
Turning now to the demand picture. It has improved across our major end markets as well as geographies. The residential end-use has shown continued strength with solid starts in single-family housing. We've also seen an uptick in multifamily housing starts.
Now with respect to the nonresidential outlook, improvement continues in a number of leading indicators and we have begun to see month-over-month improvement in starts. The strongest nonresidential sector continues to be the work related to e-commerce and technology infrastructure, but lighter traditional nonresidential demand is also recovering.
The level of highway starts remained healthy in the first half of 2021 as states got back to normal funding and budget levels. On the broader subject of federal highway and infrastructure spending, we're encouraged by the progress made toward a Highway Bill with substantially higher funding over the FAST Act levels. We've also seen an acceleration of starts in public infrastructure such as water and sewer treatment systems, airports and storm and flood control.
Before turning the call over to Suzanne, I want to briefly touch on our growth strategy and the recently announced agreement to acquire U.S. Concrete. We have 3 paths to growth, and it's important to strike the right balance between these 3 in order to drive higher returns. Those paths are organic growth, greenfields and M&A.
We always start with organic growth because it offers the most attractive and compelling value proposition on a risk-adjusted basis. We have a unique and irreplaceable asset base spread across the most attractive geographies in the U.S. Our 4 strategic disciplines are designed to accelerate our organic growth, and the benefits are clear as we expand our unit profitability.
We also have a long and successful history of developing and opening new aggregate locations, particularly in growth corridors where acquisition opportunities may be limited. We like the flexibility that greenfields provide in regards to timing and pace of capital spending.
Our third growth engine is M&A. U.S. Concrete is a great strategic fit for Vulcan as it naturally complements our existing aggregates business. It also brings new geographic exposure to the company, expanding and diversifying our already strong footprint into the Northeast.
Along with my colleagues at both Vulcan and U.S. Concrete, I'm very excited about the potential for this combination. It will allow us to further drive sustainable long-term shareholder value. And I look forward to welcoming the U.S. Concrete team to the Vulcan family.
Now I'll turn the call over to Suzanne for further comments."

I'd like to begin by highlighting a few key areas to consider this quarter: our aggregates price realization, unit profitability, return on invested capital and balance sheet strength.First, our ability to cons",493,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to begin by highlighting a few key areas to consider this quarter: our aggregates price realization, unit profitability, return on invested capital and balance sheet strength.
First, our ability to consistently deliver compounding price improvements is an important driver of our unit margins. The current pricing environment is positive due to improving demand visibility and inflationary pressures. We've seen attractive sequential improvement in pricing through the first half of the year, and we expect the momentum to carry over to the second half.
Clearly, these compounding price improvements, along with good operational execution, are having a positive impact on our unit profitability. This quarter marked the 12th straight quarter of improvement in our trailing 12-month cash gross profit per ton. For the trailing 12 months, cash gross profit per ton was $7.26, and for the quarter, it was $7.83 per ton, moving ever closer to our current goal of $9 per ton.
The next area of focus is our return on invested capital. We are pleased with our improving returns. And on a trailing 12-month basis, return on invested capital was 14.8%, an increase of 60 basis points compared to the prior year period. This improvement was comprised of an essentially unchanged invested capital base and a 4% increase in trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.
And finally, we will continue to prioritize our balance sheet strength to create the flexibility and optionality necessary to support our capital allocation strategy. At June 30, our net debt-to-EBITDA was 1.3x, reflecting $968 million of cash on hand. Our debt has a weighted average maturity of 15 years with no significant maturities in the near term. It's important to note that even after the anticipated close of the U.S. Concrete acquisition, our balance sheet will be in good standing and we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating.
Before turning the call back over to Tom, I do want to touch briefly on 2 housekeeping matters. First, you will have noted an increase in our interest expense this quarter. Concurrent with the announced pending acquisition of U.S. Concrete in June, we obtained a bridge facility commitment to support the deal. Subsequently, we executed a $1.6 billion delayed draw term loan which will be used to fund the acquisition along with cash on hand.
Borrowings under that facility are due 3 years from the funding date. And so this facility will be used as an interim measure prior to accessing the bond market at the appropriate time. As a result, financing cost of $9 million for the bridge commitment was recognized as expense in the second quarter.
The final matter to mention is our effective tax rate. And as a reminder, at the end of first quarter, we increased our expectation of the full year rate to between 23% and 24%. That guidance is still applicable.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for closing remarks."

We probably won't make up -- or won't be able to make up the shortfall in other aggregates, which is really asphalt as we're playing catch-up on liquid cost.
Now I would say to that asphalt prices are going up and we'll see increased prices and probably improved margins in the second half, but probably not enough to offset all the liquid headwinds. That being said, aggregate volumes appear to be improving with demand improving in all market end uses. So I'd call it asphalt being offset by shipping on the higher side of our volume midpoint. So aggregates, we're on the optimistic side of volume. Prices in aggregates, we reiterate the 2% to 4% range, although we're seeing prices improving sequentially.
From a cost perspective, we would still say that over the 12 months, we'll be low single digits, so good operating disciplines. Unit margin, in the mid-single-digit range. Non-aggregates, a little lower, but improving, which brings me to, I'd say, confidence in that $1.38 billion to $1.46 billion guidance."

Yes, when you have -- we have visibility to growing demand like we have right now, and you couple that with pressures from fuel and other inflationary pressures, we know that prices will accelerate. They're probably accelerating a little faster than maybe we anticipated 90 days ago, and it's probably a little brighter. At this point, I think we'd be premature to adjust our 2021 pricing outlook, but I think it bodes very well for pricing in 2022.
As we said in the first quarter call, as we called out, the rate of price increases continues to escalate sequentially over time. We saw that in the quarter. We talked about -- I mean if you mix-adjust price in the second quarter, it doubled over the first quarter. And then if you look within the second quarter, prices increased sequentially month-to-month.
I think that we'll see -- continue to see that sequential rate growth pattern throughout 2021. And I would expect it to -- that sequential improvement to continue in 2022 although maybe a little higher amplitude, and here's why. We started talking about -- to our customers about second half price increases in May. On bid work, which is about 6% of our work, we have definitely increased price increases over the last 60 days on new jobs.
Now remember, there's a lag between that bid work. It won't ship for roughly 6 to 9 months. When it comes to fixed plants, we've had discussions and are having discussions about second half price increases, and we've realized those in a few markets. But in our conversations with customers, they've been very positive. Again, all supported by that clear visibility to growing demand and inflationary pressure.
So while we see some benefit to 2021, this is definitely going to be a 2022 impact because those jobs that we bid now or bid over the last couple of months are definitely going to benefit 2022, and we'll see a bigger impact on fixed plant prices in 2022. Again, I think I would expect to see that rate of price increases continue to climb sequentially this year, and that pattern to continue to -- into 2022. So this is just a really good environment for pricing."

I think that if you step back and look at all of this, the pricing environment is as good as we've seen it in a while. Now you've got temporary inflationary pressures with diesel, but that is good for pricing because it allows you to have the ability to raise prices, particularly with the [indiscernible] being what it is.
And I think with good cost control, I think we're confident with that mid-single-digit unit margin improvement. From a pricing from a geographic perspective, it's really widespread. We raised bid prices across our footprint over the last 2 months. I think that the second half fixed plant price increases, a few places in the Southeast. But it's -- that will really be more of a 2022 play with hopefully higher amplitude on pricing and maybe earlier in the year.
So you got temporary pressures from inflation, but really a good setup from -- for prices moving forward. And I think that we've got a pretty good proven record on cost control to offset inflationary pressures, and we'll catch up with diesel even on cost control."

But despite the diesel headwinds, we also had a very good cash cost performance as well. Cash cost of sales was up 4% in the quarter. But if you back diesel out of that, which rose significantly and rapidly, our expenses were less than 1% rise year-over-year.
So we certainly experienced some inflation in other parts of the business and other input products besides diesel. But again, we had sufficient operating efficiencies and cost control to hold those cash costs to within less than 1%. And so if you have the combination of good pricing discipline and those rises we've talked about, and we have good control over cost, which is one thing that we should be able to fully control, then you get the good results in cash gross profit per ton that we talked about.
In Tom's comments, he called out that cash gross profit per ton was up 2%. If you exclude diesel from that, it's up 5%. So again, a very good performance, and it just shows when you focus on the things that you can control, what can be accomplished. In fact, if you look at the progression of cash gross profit per ton and you look at it on a trailing 12-month basis ended with the second quarter in 2019, and you compare that to the trailing 12 months ended the second quarter in 2021, so that's kind of 24-month period there, it's up 5%.
So that's something that we will -- we're always focused on. We always like to talk about that because that's clearly the driver of our profitability, and we'll continue to talk about that."

At this point, all signs point to those significant increases in core highway funding. We think the Senate should pass their bill in the next week, which is incredibly exciting. And then I think we're confident that Congress passes the bill this year.
Now it always -- I would caveat that, it always takes 1 to 2 years to see funding pass into shipments. Usually, we normally say 2 years. But I think state DoTs have really matured into their increase -- their substantially increased funding and are much more -- have much greater ability to step up work faster than what we saw over the last 3 years when the states dramatically increased state funding."

Non-res starts on a trailing 6-month or trailing 3-month basis have now turned positive. We continue to see strength, as you would imagine, the heavy non-res, the warehouse and distribution centers. But now we're seeing growth in things like government buildings, institutional buildings, health care, private schools and churches. And we're just starting to see green shoots on stores that follow new subdivisions. So I'd call non-res out across our footprint pretty much as improving.
Residential, it's going great. Single-family starts on a trailing 12-month basis were up 31% in our markets. Inventory is extremely low. This is almost all new subdivision work, which is more and more aggregate-intensive. So demand growth in this sector will continue to grow and still not overbuilt. Now you're seeing multifamily improvement. Permits for both multifamily and single family would support continued growth. So it's just strong on the res side.
Highways, good. We're confident. We've returned back to normal. I can talk about that more later. I think what's exciting, which is a little bit of a shift that we're seeing now, we're seeing growth in non-highway infrastructure.

We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company and hope that you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. This is our first earnings call since closing the U.S.",1319,"Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company and hope that you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. This is our first earnings call since closing the U.S. Concrete acquisition in late August. Therefore, I'd like to begin by welcoming the former U.S. Concrete employees and customers to our Vulcan family. Also want to thank our team for its continued solid execution during a quarter that was challenging due to inflationary pressures and labor constraints. Despite these challenges, our team managed our controllable costs, move pricing higher in all segments and importantly, expanded our aggregates unit profitability for the 13th consecutive quarter. 
We generated $418 million of adjusted EBITDA this quarter, an increase of 4% as compared to last year. Profitability for the quarter was held back by factors I mentioned earlier, energy inflation was a significant $30 million headwind. Unit diesel prices were up over 50%, leading to $14 million of additional expense. 
The cost of liquid asphalt was over $100 per ton higher than last year. This sharp increase impacted our results by $16 million. And finally, labor constraints, especially for truck drivers have caused delays and inefficiencies in our operations as well as those of our customers. Even with these headwinds, we improved our aggregate cash gross profit per ton by 3% and to $7.74. This was achieved through consistent execution of our 4 strategic disciplines which helped to drive volume growth, higher pricing and improved operating efficiencies. 
This strong performance and the momentum it provides sets us up well for '22, especially with respect to pricing. 
Total aggregate volume, including U.S. Concrete, increased by 8% versus last year's quarter. On a same-store basis, volume was up 5%. This reflects continued improvement in demand across all end markets. The pricing environment in aggregates continues to be very positive across our footprint. Same-store prices were up 3.1% in the quarter and mix adjusted prices increased by 3.5%. We saw our early price increases gain traction and as a result, year-over-year average selling prices improved sequentially each quarter this year. 
Although inflationary pressures can create short- to medium-term headwinds, the combination of inflation and improving visibility to demand has and will continue to create a favorable environment for price increases. Operating efficiencies and disciplined cost control helped to offset some of the higher input costs we experienced. On a same-store basis, our aggregates unit cost of sales in the quarter increased by only 1.7% as compared to last year. 
Now excluding the diesel effect, unit cost of sales actually decreased by 1%. While costs will be lumpy, we have delivered comparable results for the trailing 12-month period. This solid performance in aggregates helped to more than offset reduced profitability in non-aggregates segment. Our asphalt business was notably affected by both higher energy costs and wet weather. 
Quarterly gross profit in the segment fell from $30 million to $7 million. Higher liquid asphalt costs accounted for $16 million of this difference. We also experienced a rise in natural gas prices, which in turn impacted our plant production costs. Asphalt volume declined by 8% as volume growth in California was more than offset by lower Arizona volumes due to extremely wet weather. 
Average selling prices improved by almost 2% year-over-year and better than 2% sequentially, evidence that pricing actions are beginning to ease some of the illiquid asphalt inflation. I would expect continued price improvement as we pass along higher costs. 
In the Concrete segment, gross profit increased by 18%, reflecting our ownership of U.S. Concrete for 1 month. Same-store volumes declined by 7% due to the completion of large projects in Virginia and the availability of drivers to make up for any lost shipping days. For the quarter, same-store prices increased by 2%. 
Turning now to the demand picture. The story is relatively unchanged from the second quarter. Demand has improved across all of our major end markets as well as geographies. The residential end-use has shown continued strength with solid starts in single-family housing. Multifamily starts have also performed well. 
With respect to the nonresidential end market, improvement continues at a number of leading indicators we track. From its low point early this year, starts have consistently improved, returning to growth in recent months. The level of highway starts are up as states have moved back to more normal funding levels with Vulcan markets outpacing other markets. 
We look forward to the enactment of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill and the significant impact on volumes for years to come. Now looking forward, I want to briefly touch on our growth strategy and give a very preliminary view of 2022. As we shared on past calls, we have 3 paths to growth. These 3 are organic growth, M&A and greenfields. 
Earnings growth in the underlying business is at the core of our growth strategy because it provides the most attractive and compelling value proposition on a risk-adjusted basis. The benefits of this focus are clear as we expand our industry-leading unit profitability despite the macro challenges we may face from time to time. 
Next is M&A. We look for strategic opportunities that naturally complement our principal aggregates business. Given our leading market position, we have visibility to all deals that come to the market. The key is for us to be disciplined as we consider which deals to pursue. All opportunities are not created equal, and we want to do the deals that create the most value over time. 
And as the final pillar to our growth strategy is the development of [indiscernible] sites. There are times when an acquisition target is not available in a particular growth quarter. If that is the case, we turn to new greenfield sites, and we have a long successful history of developing them. 
During this quarter, we completed the U.S. Concrete acquisition and we're excited about the strategic fit and how it naturally complements our principal aggregates business in California, Texas and Virginia and gives us access to new platforms in New York and New Jersey. Already, our teams are working together to identify strategic opportunities. As you would expect, we are taking a thoughtful approach to integration to ensure that we capture all available synergies. 
It's still early days on the integration. We intend to give you a more detailed briefing in February, but we're pleased with the wins we've seen so far. We are confident in our ability to generate at least $50 million of synergies on a 12-month run basis beginning midyear next year, when most of the integration is complete, but more to come. 
Suzanne will cover some additional highlights of the quarter and share our latest financial view on how we expect to finish 2021. But before I turn the call over to her, I want to reiterate our confidence in our prospects for 2022, particularly with respect to pricing and our ability to control what we can control. The 2021 demand and inflationary environment sets us up well as we head into 2022. 
A key to our pricing strategy, we're starting early in the spring with announced price increases. In certain markets, we launched further increases. These increases are evident in our sequential quarterly pricing growth. Already, we are discussing 2022 pricing expectations with customers. Clearly, we need to see where those conversations lead. But at this stage, I would be surprised if next year's price increases are not at least 5%. 
The demand picture also looks good leaning into 2022, although we are watching the labor situation closely. If labor constraints do continue, it's important to remember that the work is still there. It may just proceed at a slower pace. Effectively, extending the recovery and allowing us the opportunity to compound price, control costs and still grow earnings. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Suzanne for further comments."

We've covered the key financial and operational highlights already. So I'd like to speak to the following topics: First, our balance sheet strength and capital allocation priorities; second, our return on invested capital; and finally, our financial guidance for 2021. 
With respect to the balance sheet, we will continue to prioritize sensible leverage and financial flexibility in order to support our capital allocation strategy and maintain our investment-grade rating. The structure of our debt is sound with long maturities that make sense for our business. Due to our strong cash generation, we were able to reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio to 2.7x following the U.S. Concrete acquisition. 
This is just above our stated range of 2 to 2.5x and we will be focused on getting back within that range in the near term. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged and and the consistent application of those while maintaining a sensible leverage range has allowed us to improve our return on investment over the past 3 years. 
For legacy Vulcan, the return was 14.7%, up 240 basis points from 3 years ago, with the inclusion of 1 month of U.S. Concrete earnings, and a 1 quarter impact of the acquisition on average invested capital, our return was 14.2%. We will continue to focus on the sequential improvement of returns. 
The final topic I want to share this morning is our updated view on 2021 guidance. Our guidance incorporates U.S. Concrete's expected EBITDA contribution since acquisition as well as recent trends in demand, price and costs. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance range for the full year is now $1.43 billion to $1.46 billion. This includes $50 million to $60 million of EBITDA from the acquisition but excludes $115 million gain on a land sale completed in the first quarter. I'm sure there will be a number of questions on business trends and the outlook in the Q&A section. So I'll turn the call back over to Tom for closing remarks."

As we've said over the past couple of quarters, the combination of visibility to growing demand. You couple that with inflationary pressures. This all bodes really good -- bodes well for aggregate prices. And our teams recognized this early on and started trying to move price in Q2. And as we predicted, our third quarter price increases were 3.1%, mix-adjusted 3.5%, which was up sequentially from 2.6% in Q2 and 1.3% in Q1. And that sequential improvement is really important because it illustrates the improving pricing environment. 
So looking forward, I'd expect that trend to continue in Q4. And then looking past that 2022, I think we'll see bigger jumps in pricing in January and in April as the 2022 fixed prices go into effect. So as we said before, based on trends, backlogs and customer conversations, I'd be very surprised if our 2022 price increases don't eclipse 5%."

So on a same-store basis, the volume was up north of 5%, which was strong. The vast majority of our markets experienced volume growth which speaks to the market's underlying growing demand and how broad-based it is. We have a little bit of weather in Alabama, parts of Texas, Arizona really got washed out and a little bit of weather in Northern California. Now this -- but this was more than offset with really strong shipments in the Southeast and the Eastern Seaboard. As we look to 2022, 2022 may be the first year in well over a decade, where we'll see growth in all 4 end uses. So it's just broad-based. Residence construction should continue to grow. Nonres is very important because it continues to -- continue to come through the pandemic and moves into growth into 2022. Non-highway infrastructure, we think grows following the big residential growth we've seen this year and highway demand in 2022 will also see growth supported by improvements in state funding and some COVID relief funds. So all that's really good news for '22 demand. However, as we talked about, there are some headwinds. And you've got supply chain issues, labor shortages and they're beginning to have some impact on shipments. 
Now those headwinds don't make demand go away. They only push it out and extend -- so it really extends the cycle if that happens. So the fundamentals for volume growth in 2022 are in place with some headwinds. And while it's kind of early in our planning stages, under the conditions, I'd be surprised if we saw our growth above 4%. At the same time, that demand, if we did have those headwinds, the man gets drawn out and extends the cycle. And with our ability to compound margins over time, that could be very helpful. So fundamental is really strong, some dampening effect with supply chain and labor, but the underlying fundamentals are really good."

And it's just a little bit of a lull in our backlog as we move into 2022 I think the underlying piece of concrete improvement was the nonres piece. We see non-grid growing in 2022. That's very important for ready-mix. The other thing I was encouraged with in the quarter on the same-store basis and also with U.S. Concrete, you're starting to see unit margin expansion. And earlier in the year, both our Concrete business and U.S. Concrete business got dinged from diesel. And a combination of diesel and what I'd call traffic inefficiencies. Last year, you just didn't have any traffic on the road. So you were able to deliver concrete very effectively and efficiently. This year, not so much. And so it added some cost. While those were headwinds for '21, pricing at this point has jumped past that, is on past raw materials, and we're seeing margin growth. So as we move into '22 with the combined businesses, I would predict you will see volume growth really driven by nonresidential construction growth, but also unit margin growth because prices have caught up and bypassed cost changes from '20 to '21. So I'm very encouraged for our outlook in 2022 in this product line."

While they've done a really good job with that, I think that our -- and this is 1 of the important pieces of synergies. I think that our 4 strategic disciplines are very applicable to their business, to their aggregates business. We've already started on that. The teams have met and that's working. So I think that as we work into 2022, the same applies both from a pricing and a demand and a unit margin growth perspective looking to 2022. And we think that we can help them take steps and just like they can in concrete, moving to ready-mix, I think that their operating disciplines and efficiencies are better than ours. They have some really impressive technology in Where's my Concrete. The teams have always started applying that to our ready-mix operations. And so I think this is very helpful for both product lines. their technology and disciplines help us. Ours help theirs in aggregates. And so that was one of the strengths of the deal."

It was an excellent performance by our operators. First and foremost, they kept their people safe. Cash cost was up 2.6% in the quarter without diesel, it was down 1%. And so the increase was all of diesel, partially offset with some efficiency savings. And year-to-date -- this is a trend. So year-to-date, that cash cost was up only 1.2% and without diesel, again, down 1%. This is a really strong performance because while diesel is the most dramatic change, all of our inputs are up like the steel is up almost 65%. And what that tells me is that our Vulcan way of operating strategic discipline is working, and our operators are making those efficiencies and those disciplines pay off. And so while this is hard to do particularly in inflationary pressures, it's working. And as you've seen over the last 2 years with our performance, it's sticky. I mean it's just there. And that kind of cost performance allows us to capture price to maximize unit margin growth, which is -- our cash unit margin now is at $7.74 a ton. And if you look back this is a compounded annual growth rate of 7% in unit margin growth over 8 years including diesel. So I would tell you, I am very proud of my operators and they and I both know, they're not done."

So if you look at asphalt first, we took a big hit this year with liquid, and it's kind of -- you're a little bit comparing the perfect storm because last year, liquid prices plummeted and the margins went up. This year, they spiked and took a bite out of margins. As we said in the prepared remarks, 2022 should see strong demand from improved highway work. And asphalt prices are moving to catch liquid, and you saw that start to move in the quarter but there is a lag. So we should see gross profit improvements in asphalt in 2022, but I would not expect them to get back to 2020 levels. I mean the reason why is you had that big decrease in liquid in 2022. But I would expect profitability in the product line to improve based on volume improvements and unit margin improvements because prices are going up to catch liquid cost. Moving to ready-mix. I think 2022 is set up very nicely for the combined Vulcan U.S. concrete ready-mix businesses. And again, that nonresidential demand turning to growth in 2022 is very healthy for concrete demand. Northern California saw some headwinds in '21 and so it's really a hangover from the pandemic. It was the most severe shelter in place. And the government offices shut down so nobody could get building permits. And that air pocket is what's hit us in 2021. We're past that. The permits that are out there. Our backlogs are very good and growing. The same can be applied to New York. Exactly the same thing. And then Texas was good and will continue to grow. But the -- you couple all that with healthy price increases, which has now gotten into margin growth I really look forward to the 2022 Concrete business."

But I think what -- as I said earlier, what really gets me excited is those teams in California, Texas and Virginia were together within days of the closing. They knew each other well. They were a big customer of ours. So they had relationships and they had their strategies and their tactics to improve volume, price and leverage operating efficiencies and share information and assets and equipment before they had them together before we could go back and review them and we're executing. So it's happened really fast. More to come. We'll put a lot of detail on that. But I am very pleased with what those combined line managers have already put in place and what -- how quickly and smoothly that's gone. I think the culture is being so much like each other, and our previous relationship has helped this. And I think I underestimated the speed at which that would impact the line businesses. So progress with them and great work."

We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company, and hope that you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. This is our first earnings call since closing the U.S.",1319,"Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company, and hope that you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. This is our first earnings call since closing the U.S. Concrete acquisition in late August. Therefore, I'd like to begin by welcoming the former U.S. Concrete employees and customers to our Vulcan family.
Also want to thank our team for its continued solid execution during a quarter that was challenging due to inflationary pressures and labor constraints. Despite these challenges, our team managed our controllable costs, move pricing higher in all segments and importantly, expanded our aggregates unit profitability for the 13th consecutive quarter.
We generated $418 million of adjusted EBITDA this quarter, an increase of 4% as compared to last year. Profitability for the quarter was held back by factors I mentioned earlier, energy inflation was a significant $30 million headwind. Unit diesel prices were up over 50%, leading to $14 million of additional expense.
The cost of liquid asphalt was over $100 per ton higher than last year. This sharp increase impacted our results by $16 million. And finally, labor constraints, especially for truck drivers, have caused delays and inefficiencies in our operations as well as those of our customers.
Even with these headwinds, we improved our aggregate cash gross profit per ton by 3% and to $7.74. This was achieved through consistent execution of our 4 strategic disciplines which helped to drive volume growth, higher pricing and improved operating efficiencies. This strong performance and the momentum it provides sets us up well for '22, especially with respect to pricing.
Total aggregate volume, including U.S. Concrete, increased by 8% versus last year's quarter. On a same-store basis, volume was up 5%. This reflects continued improvement in demand across all end markets. The pricing environment in aggregates continues to be very positive across our footprint. Same-store prices were up 3.1% in the quarter and mix adjusted prices increased by 3.5%. We saw our early price increases gain traction and as a result, year-over-year average selling prices improved sequentially each quarter this year.
Although inflationary pressures can create short- to medium-term headwinds, the combination of inflation and improving visibility to demand has and will continue to create a favorable environment for price increases. Operating efficiencies and disciplined cost control helped to offset some of the higher input costs we experienced. On a same-store basis, our aggregates unit cost of sales in the quarter increased by only 1.7% as compared to last year.
Now excluding the diesel effect, unit cost of sales actually decreased by 1%. While costs will be lumpy, we have delivered comparable results for the trailing 12-month period. This solid performance in aggregates helped to more than offset reduced profitability in non-aggregates segment.
Our Asphalt business was notably affected by both higher energy costs and wet weather. Quarterly gross profit in the segment fell from $30 million to $7 million. Higher liquid asphalt costs accounted for $16 million of this difference. We also experienced a rise in natural gas prices, which in turn impacted our plant production costs. Asphalt volume declined by 8% as volume growth in California was more than offset by lower Arizona volumes due to extremely wet weather.
Average selling prices improved by almost 2% year-over-year and better than 2% sequentially, evidence that pricing actions are beginning to ease some of the illiquid asphalt inflation. I would expect continued price improvement as we pass along higher costs.
In the Concrete segment, gross profit increased by 18%, reflecting our ownership of U.S. Concrete for 1 month. Same-store volumes declined by 7% due to the completion of large projects in Virginia and the availability of drivers to make up for any lost shipping days. For the quarter, same-store prices increased by 2%.
Turning now to the demand picture. The story is relatively unchanged from the second quarter. Demand has improved across all of our major end markets as well as geographies. The residential end-use has shown continued strength with solid starts in single-family housing. Multifamily starts have also performed well.
With respect to the nonresidential end market, improvement continues at a number of leading indicators we track. From its low point early this year, starts have consistently improved, returning to growth in recent months. The level of highway starts are up as states have moved back to more normal funding levels with Vulcan markets outpacing other markets. We look forward to the enactment of the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the significant impact on volumes for years to come.
Now looking forward, I want to briefly touch on our growth strategy and give a very preliminary view of 2022. As we shared on past calls, we have 3 paths to growth. These 3 are organic growth, M&A and greenfields. Earnings growth in the underlying business is at the core of our growth strategy because it provides the most attractive and compelling value proposition on a risk-adjusted basis. The benefits of this focus are clear as we expand our industry-leading unit profitability despite the macro challenges we may face from time to time.
Next is M&A. We look for strategic opportunities that naturally complement our principal aggregates business. Given our leading market position, we have visibility to all deals that come to the market. The key is for us to be disciplined as we consider which deals to pursue. All opportunities are not created equal, and we want to do the deals that create the most value over time.
And as the final pillar to our growth strategy is the development of greenfield sites. There are times when an acquisition target is not available in a particular growth quarter. If that is the case, we turn to new greenfield sites, and we have a long successful history of developing them.
During this quarter, we completed the U.S. Concrete acquisition and we're excited about the strategic fit and how it naturally complements our principal aggregates business in California, Texas and Virginia and gives us access to new platforms in New York and New Jersey. Already, our teams are working together to identify strategic opportunities. As you would expect, we are taking a thoughtful approach to integration to ensure that we capture all available synergies.
It's still early days on the integration. We intend to give you a more detailed briefing in February, but we're pleased with the wins we've seen so far. We are confident in our ability to generate at least $50 million of synergies on a 12-month run basis beginning midyear next year, when most of the integration is complete, but more to come.
Suzanne will cover some additional highlights of the quarter and share our latest financial view on how we expect to finish 2021. But before I turn the call over to her, I want to reiterate our confidence in our prospects for 2022, particularly with respect to pricing and our ability to control what we can control. The 2021 demand and inflationary environment sets us up well as we head into 2022.
A key to our pricing strategy, we're starting early in the spring with announced price increases. In certain markets, we launched further increases. These increases are evident in our sequential quarterly pricing growth. Already, we are discussing 2022 pricing expectations with customers. Clearly, we need to see where those conversations lead. But at this stage, I would be surprised if next year's price increases are not at least 5%.
The demand picture also looks good leaning into 2022, although we are watching the labor situation closely. If labor constraints do continue, it's important to remember that the work is still there. It may just proceed at a slower pace. Effectively, extending the recovery and allowing us the opportunity to compound price, control costs and still grow earnings.
Now I'll turn the call over to Suzanne for further comments."

We've covered the key financial and operational highlights already. So I'd like to speak to the following topics: First, our balance sheet strength and capital allocation priorities; second, our return on invested capital; and finally, our financial guidance for 2021.
With respect to the balance sheet, we will continue to prioritize sensible leverage and financial flexibility in order to support our capital allocation strategy and maintain our investment-grade rating. The structure of our debt is sound with long maturities that make sense for our business. Due to our strong cash generation, we were able to reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio to 2.7x following the U.S. Concrete acquisition.
This is just above our stated range of 2 to 2.5x and we will be focused on getting back within that range in the near term. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged and the consistent application of those while maintaining a sensible leverage range has allowed us to improve our return on investment over the past 3 years.
For Legacy Vulcan, the return was 14.7%, up 240 basis points from 3 years ago, with the inclusion of one month of U.S. Concrete earnings, and a 1-quarter impact of the acquisition on average invested capital, our return was 14.2%. We'll continue to focus on the sequential improvement of returns.
The final topic I want to share this morning is our updated view on 2021 guidance. Our guidance incorporates U.S. Concrete's expected EBITDA contribution since acquisition as well as recent trends in demand, price and costs. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance range for the full year is now $1.43 billion to $1.46 billion.
This includes $50 million to $60 million of EBITDA from the acquisition, but excludes $115 million gain on a land sale completed in the first quarter. I'm sure there will be a number of questions on business trends and the outlook in the Q&A section. So I'll turn the call back over to Tom for closing remarks."

Local execution is key to driving improvements in our business, particularly around our strategic disciplines. As we move forward, we will seek to maximize synergies with U.S. Concrete.

As we've said over the past couple of quarters, the combination of visibility to growing demand. You couple that with inflationary pressures. This all bodes really good -- bodes well for aggregate prices. And our teams recognized this early on and started trying to move price in Q2.
And as we predicted, our third quarter price increases were 3.1%, mix-adjusted 3.5%, which was up sequentially from 2.6% in Q2 and 1.3% in Q1. And that sequential improvement is really important because it illustrates the improving pricing environment.
So looking forward, I'd expect that trend to continue in Q4. And then looking past that to 2022, I think we'll see bigger jumps in pricing in January and in April as the 2022 fixed prices go into effect. So as we said before, based on trends, backlogs and customer conversations, I'd be very surprised if our 2022 price increases don't eclipse 5%."

So on a same-store basis, the volume was up north of 5%, which was strong. The vast majority of our markets experienced volume growth which speaks to the market's underlying growing demand and how broad-based it is. We had a little bit of weather in Alabama, parts of Texas, Arizona really got washed out and a little bit of weather in Northern California.
Now this -- but this was more than offset with really strong shipments in the Southeast and the Eastern Seaboard. As we look to 2022, 2022 may be the first year in well over a decade, where we'll see growth in all 4 end uses. So it's just broad-based. Residence construction should continue to grow. Nonres is very important because it continued to come through the pandemic and moves into growth into 2022.
Non-highway infrastructure, we think grows following the big residential growth we've seen this year and highway demand in 2022 will also see growth supported by improvements in state funding and some COVID relief funds. So all that's really good news for '22 demand. However, as we talked about, there are some headwinds. And you've got supply chain issues, labor shortages and they're beginning to have some impact on shipments.
Now those headwinds don't make demand go away. They only push it out and extend -- so it really extends the cycle if that happens. So the fundamentals for volume growth in 2022 are in place with some headwinds. And while it's kind of early in our planning stages, under the conditions, I'd be surprised if we saw our growth above 4%.
At the same time, that demand, if we did have those headwinds, the demand gets drawn out and extends the cycle. And with our ability to compound margins over time, that could be very helpful. So fundamentals, really strong, some dampening effect with supply chain and labor, but the underlying fundamentals are really good."

The large projects we had finished up were in Northern Virginia, really in the D.C. area. And it's just a little bit of a lull in our backlog as we move into 2022 I think the underlying piece of concrete improvement was the nonres piece. We see non-grid growing in 2022. That's very important for ready-mix.
The other thing I was encouraged with in the quarter on the same-store basis and also with U.S. Concrete, you're starting to see unit margin expansion. And earlier in the year, both our concrete business and U.S. Concrete business got dinged from diesel, and a combination of diesel and what I'd call traffic inefficiencies. Last year, you just didn't have any traffic on the road. So you were able to deliver concrete very effectively and efficiently. This year, not so much. And so it added some cost.
While those were headwinds for '21, pricing at this point has jumped past that, has jumped past raw materials, and we're seeing margin growth. So as we move into '22 with the combined businesses, I would predict you will see volume growth really driven by nonresidential construction growth, but also unit margin growth because prices have caught up and bypassed cost changes from '20 to '21. So I'm very encouraged for our outlook in 2022 in this product line."

While they've done a really good job with that, I think that our -- and this is 1 of the important pieces of synergies, I think that our 4 strategic disciplines are very applicable to their business, to their aggregates business. We've already started on that. The teams have met and that's working.
So I think that as we work into 2022, the same applies both from a pricing and a demand and a unit margin growth perspective looking to 2022. And we think that we can help them take steps and just like they can in concrete, moving to ready-mix, I think that their operating disciplines and efficiencies are better than ours.
They have some really impressive technology in WheresMyConcrete. The teams have always started applying that to our ready-mix operations. And so I think this is very helpful for both product lines. Their technology and disciplines help us, ours helps theirs in aggregates. And so that was one of the strengths of the deal."

It was an excellent performance by our operators. First and foremost, they kept their people safe. Cash cost was up 2.6% in the quarter. Without diesel, it was down 1%. And so the increase was all of diesel, partially offset with some efficiency savings. And year-to-date -- so this is a trend. So year-to-date, that cash cost was up only 1.2% and without diesel, again, down 1%.
This is a really strong performance because while diesel is the most dramatic change, all of our inputs are up, like the steel is up almost 65%. And what that tells me is that our Vulcan way of operating strategic discipline is working, and operators are making those efficiencies and those disciplines pay off. And so while this is hard to do particularly in inflationary pressures, it's working. And as you've seen over the last 2 years with our performance, it's sticky. I mean it's just there.
And that kind of cost performance allows us to capture price to maximize unit margin growth, which is -- our cash unit margin now is at $7.74 a ton. And if you look back this is a compounded annual growth rate of 7% in unit margin growth over 8 years including diesel. So I would tell you, I am very proud of my operators and they and I both know, they're not done."

So if you look at asphalt first, we took a big hit this year with liquid, and it's kind of -- you're a little bit comparing the perfect storm because last year, liquid prices plummeted and the margins went up. This year, they spiked and took a bite out of margins. As we said in the prepared remarks, 2022 should see strong demand from improved highway work. And asphalt prices are moving to catch liquid, and you saw that start to move in the quarter but there is a lag.
So we should see gross profit improvements in asphalt in 2022, but I would not expect them to get back to 2020 levels. I mean the reason why is you had that big decrease in liquid in 2022. But I would expect profitability in the product line to improve based on volume improvements and unit margin improvements because prices are going up to catch liquid cost.
Moving to ready-mix. I think 2022 is set up very nicely for the combined Vulcan U.S. concrete ready-mix businesses. And again, that nonresidential demand turning to growth in 2022 is very healthy for concrete demand. Northern California saw some headwinds in '21, so it's really a hangover from the pandemic.
It was the most severe shelter in place. And the government offices shut down so nobody could get building permits. And that air pocket is what's hit us in 2021. We're past that. The permits that are out there. Our backlogs are very good and growing.
The same can be applied to New York. Exactly the same thing. And then Texas was good and will continue to grow. But the -- you couple all that with healthy price increases, which has now gotten into margin growth, I really look forward to the 2022 Concrete business."

I think we've got the capacity and the firepower to produce a lot more than 4%. And I think it's really ability for, number one, to get product to market through truck drivers and truckers. 
Second is our customers' ability to get more employees, and it's more to catch up as opposed to get work done. I think they get work done, but the ability, if you have a week of rain and to catch that back up. Now you don't have the crews to take out their -- the next 2 weekends to do it because you're just working people too many hours, you just don't have enough people in the crews.
And then the last thing is with particularly in res, you're seeing supply chain issues, windows or door knobs or all kinds of different things that -- and there's a whole -- you read about this whole list, but if you talk to the big residential customers, they're having supply chain issues. And you have to put that mix in there, that is nonres also.
So I think that while the underlying demand structure is very good. As I said earlier, what's really important is it's widespread geographically, but it's also across all 4 end uses. And up until this year -- actually up until 2022, we've always had 1 of those as a drag, and I don't think we do in 2022.
So the fundamentals are there. I think you just have a little bit of a damping effect with labor and supply chain.

I think they experienced headwinds we talked about with the recovery from the pandemic in Northern California and New York. Obviously, they had the inefficiency cost headwinds with traffic get back on the road and the energy cost, as Suzanne mentioned.
As I said earlier, I think the market and demand headwinds are behind us. The permitting is strong. The backlogs are strong. Work is happening in the 2 coastal markets that we had concerns about in '21. And really importantly, at this point, price has moved past cost and showing growth in unit margin.
And obviously, like the rest of the construction material sector, they will have price increases in all these markets, we'll have price increases in ready-mix between January and April. So I think '22 sets up really well for the concrete business on the aggregate piece of it, much like ours. The same comments we said about 2022 with price and volume and cost would apply to the previous U.S. Concrete aggregates businesses."

It's a little too early to call the detail and we'd like to do that in February, and we'll do that in February. But I think what -- as I said earlier, what really gets me excited is those teams in California, Texas and Virginia were together within days of the closing. They knew each other well. They were a big customer of ours.
So they had relationships and they had their strategies and their tactics to improve volume, price and leverage operating efficiencies and share information and assets and equipment before -- they had them together before we could go back and review them and we're executing. So it's happened really fast. More to come. We'll put a lot of detail on that.
But I am very pleased with what those combined line managers have already put in place and what -- how quickly and smoothly that's gone. I think the culture is being so much like each other, and our previous relationship has helped this. And I think I underestimated the speed at which that would impact the line businesses. So congrats to them and great work."

And talking about your maintenance and your growth side, how does it look just preliminarily? And looking at the USCs assets, the capitalization of those assets, do they need to be caught up?
Is there any special opportunities that you're seeing early on there? And I'm assuming you're probably going to budget a little bit more for inflationary contractor issues that probably we haven't seen in the last several years."

I mean, clearly, the prices of everything is going up across the board, and we also there as well have some supply chain issues to manage. But I'll just touch on this year first and then comment on next year. You'll note we kept our CapEx guidance for 2021 the same. And that's really as a result of reviewing U.S. concrete needs for the period of ownership, we were able to fold that within the guidance range that we had. So really no big issues there.
As we look forward to next year, typically, we will spend somewhere between $450 million, $475 million, give or take. I wouldn't expect that to be vastly different. We're obviously still in the early days in terms of putting together the 2 capital plans and the 2 budgets and having a really good look at that. But haven't seen anything so far that makes me or us believe that we need to significantly pick up that CapEx guide."
