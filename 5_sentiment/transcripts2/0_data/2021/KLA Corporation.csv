As we reflect on the accomplishments of 2020, it's important for me to first appreciate and acknowledge the global KLA team. Your perseverance, drive to be better, and determination enabled KLA to rise to the challenge and deliver for our customers. 2020 was like no other year we have seen. And while our teams have not been physically together for the most part, our company continues to demonstrate the great KLA culture of collaboration and innovation and is emerging stronger than ever. 
In the process, we delivered exceptionally strong financial results in the December quarter, closing a strong year for the company. In our shareholder letter published today, we articulate how KLA's record results are driven by success on multiple fronts including the resourcefulness of our global workforce, the resiliency of our business model and our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. 
As most of you have already seen from our results, 2020 was an impressive year for KLA on multiple fronts. We delivered strong growth, profitability and free cash flow while continuously adjusting to the changing work environments driven by COVID. Through it all, we remain focused on meeting customer demand and delivering strong return to shareholders in the rapidly growing semiconductor market. Bren will have much more to highlight on the financials for both the quarter and the year, but I'd like to hit on a few of the annual milestones. 
For the year, KLA revenue grew 15% to $6.1 billion, marking the fifth consecutive year of growth. We also delivered notable profitability growth with non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP earnings per share, increasing 28% and 32%, respectively, year-over-year. Our free cash flow grew 44% to $1.8 billion and we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
In the December quarter, we saw diversified strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor Process Control revenue was once again above plan. The Electronics, Packaging and Components group met its target, and our Services business continued and delivered another quarter of growth and strong operating leverage. We ended the year with strong backlog, setting the stage for double-digit growth in 2021 as we continue to execute at a high level. We're operating from a position of strength in our marketplace. And given the accelerated growth of our served markets, we remain solidly on track to meet, and likely exceed, our 2023 financial targets. 
All this reflects the dedication global teams and the enabling role KLA plays in our customers' technology road maps and enhancing their return on capital investment. Moving to today's demand environment, which continues to demonstrate accelerated adoption of several semiconductor and electronics industry growth drivers that we've been highlighting for the past few years, technology continues to transform how we live and work. And the data-driven economy is fundamentally changing how businesses operate and deliver value. 
This digital transformation is enabling secular demand drivers such as high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and rapid growth in new automotive electronics and 5G communications markets. Each of these secular trends are driving investment and innovation and advanced memory and logic semiconductor devices as well as new and increasingly more complex advanced packaging and PCB technologies. 
With our market leadership in Process Control, and growth and expansion to new markets like specialty semiconductor process equipment, PCB and finished die inspection in our EPC group, KLA is essential to enabling our increasingly digital world. As much as things have changed over the past year, one thing that's remained constant is our KLA operating model. 
KLA operating model is the enduring framework that we rely on to guide the execution of our long-term strategic objectives. We deploy the KLA operating model to align the company on a consistent strategy, tie accountability to results, drive product development execution, respond to changing market conditions and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring the company operates with strong fiscal discipline as we pursue our long-term performance and profitability objectives. 
Let's turn now to 5 top highlights for our -- and our results for the quarter and for 2020. First, we saw continued strength and breadth in foundry/logic demand in the quarter. As expected, memory demand also grew as memory customers plan for growth and equipment investment in 2021 to meet improving end demand. We expect higher business levels across a broader set of customers in the March quarter, with demand momentum continuing throughout 2021 across our major end markets. 
The strength in demand we're seeing reflects KLA's essential role in supporting our customers' drive to innovate and continue to invest in future technology nodes. Second, we're seeing strong momentum in the marketplace for new products, driving market growth and share opportunities in both the semiconductor Process Control and EPC groups. Fueled by expanded customer investment in EUV lithography, the Semiconductor Process Control business is driving adoption with new applications in optical inspection portfolio, such as EUV print check for Gen 5. 
And expanding our share in new markets for KLA, including the eSL10, e-beam inspection platform and the nascent use of x-ray technologies for metrology applications. Third, our services revenue grew to $1.56 billion or 25% of total sales in 2020. This is driven by growth in our installed base, higher utilization rate and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and in the EPC group. 
The strong results delivered in 2020 show how the Services team continues to do a fantastic job leveraging the KLA operating model to deliver at a high level. Working in close collaboration with customers and partners, the Services business innovated and drove new initiatives against the unprecedented challenges of COVID. Not only did our Services business receive praise from our customers but also grew share of wallet. 
And we've seen our contact penetration steadily increase in 2020 from 70% to 75% plus, which fuels recurring revenue streams and generate strong operating leverage and cash flows. Fourth, this was a very encouraging year for the newly established EPC group, demonstrating success in KLA's growth strategies and highlighting how execution of the KLA operating model drives market leadership and improved operating leverage in acquired businesses. Revenue growth was strong, and we believe that on a net basis will exceed our $50 million annual acquisition cost synergy target by at least another additional $30 million. 
With EPC, KLA is now providing a more comprehensive and broader product portfolio and addressing fast-growing new markets in the electronics value chain, such as RF, automotive, 5G wireless connectivity and display. Relative to the adoption of 5G, KLA has exposure to many key components in the electronics value chain as well. The EPC group ended the year with record backlog, setting the stage for double-digit growth in 2021 and for incremental operating margins on that growth in line with the total company model. 
Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders. In the December quarter, we repurchased $177 million of common stock and paid $140 million in dividends. Back in July, KLA's Board of Directors authorized the 11th consecutive annual dividend increase to a yearly run rate of $3.60 per share. Since inception in 2006, KLA's dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15%. In 2020, KLA returned $1.23 billion to shareholders or 70% of free cash flow. 
Before Bren gets into the greater detail of our financial highlights, let me briefly summarize despite the disruption and unforeseen challenges that persisted throughout the year associated with COVID, KLA has benefited from the resourcefulness of global workforce. We've adapted well and we end 2020 in a position of strength while delivering record results and set the stage for the sixth consecutive year of growth. KLA is exceptionally well positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet the demanding customer requirements, which balance sensitivity and throughput. 
The semiconductor and electronics landscape is constantly changing, and we're seeing broadening customer interest which is being applied to more technology innovation than ever before at leading edge. We believe the secular factors driving industry demand that we identified at our last Investor Day, are even more relevant now than they were then. And this will help us to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. 
At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long-term operating leverage should provide consistent capital returns to our shareholders. And with that, I'll pass the call over to Bren."

KLA's December quarter and 2020 results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow, and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. 
2020 was a year of strong growth and profitability across multiple areas of our business. All of this was accomplished while simultaneously continuing to return high levels of capital to shareholders. Total revenue in the December quarter was $1.65 billion, the very top of the guided range for the quarter of $1.51 to $1.66 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.8%, slightly below the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter of 61% to 63%. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $3.24, solidly above the midpoint of the guided range of $2.82 to $3.46. GAAP EPS was $2.94. At the guided tax rate of 13%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $3.27. Total operating expenses were above the guided range of $393 million including $228 million of R&D expense and $165 million of SG&A. Non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue was strong at 38% and in line with expectations. 
The higher operating expenses in the quarter were due in part to adjustments in variable compensation programs as well as the timing of prototype material purchases for product development programs. Based on revenue expectations for 2021, and product development requirements, particularly in programs supporting next-generation reticle inspection capabilities, and the regionalization of additional customer engagement resources, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $400 million in the March quarter. 
And we are budgeting quarterly operating expenses roughly within the range of $400 million to $405 million over the near-term horizon. Given top line expectations for 2021, and we expect that the business will continue to outperform its target operating model in terms of overall profitability and operating margin leverage. Other interest and expense in the December quarter was $43 million, and the effective tax rate was 13.8%. 
Though we always have some variability in our tax rate, given the timing and impact of discrete items and the geographic distribution of revenue and profit, we believe it is prudent to adjust our long-term tax planning rate up slightly to 13.5% going forward. Of course, we are monitoring the corporate tax discussions in the United States. And we'll provide updates on how those will affect or would affect KLA as appropriate in the future. 
Non-GAAP net income was $504 million. GAAP net income was $457 million. Cash flow from operations was $561 million, and free cash flow was a record at $502 million. This resulted in a free cash flow conversion of nearly 100% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of just over 30%. Our segment revenue was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in our semiconductor process control business. The EPC group delivered results in line with our model heading into the quarter. 
Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated Service business, was $1.38 billion, a sequential quarterly increase of 9% and up 15% for 2020. Approximate customer segment mix is as follows: Foundry was strong as expected at 49%, logic was 10%, and memory grew to 41% from 32% in the December quarter. Within memory, the business was roughly 60% NAND and 40% DRAM. 
Going forward, we will be combining the foundry and logic segments into one category to remove some of the noise as to whether a customer is in one category or another, given the various markets they serve, and to better align with industry reporting practices. Revenue for the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment in December was $91 million, up 2% sequentially and up 24% in 2020. Demand in this segment was driven by growth in RF, MEMS, and advanced packaging. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $179 million, down 1% sequentially, but up 12% for 2020 as strength in PCB and component inspection offset a weaker business environment in the display business. 
In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.46 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, during the December quarter, we repurchased $177 million of common stock and paid $140 million in dividends. In 2020, KLA returned $1.2 billion to shareholders or 70% of free cash flow, including $547 million in dividends paid and $681 million in share repurchases. 
We believe our track record for delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. As it relates to guidance, as we begin the new year, our view is that the wafer fab equipment or WFE market will grow in the mid-teens, plus or minus a couple of percentage points, in 2021 off a baseline of $59 billion to $60 billion. 2021 is expected to be a year of strong demand and growth across our major end markets, with the strongest percentage growth coming in memory, led by DRAM investment and with foundry logic, delivering another year of solid growth. 
Looking ahead, based on our current backlog, sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters and product lead times, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. As a result, we would expect the company revenue to be roughly consistent quarter-to-quarter across the year. Our March quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be in a range of $1.74 billion, plus or minus $75 million. 
Foundry/logic is forecasted to be about 68% of Semi Process Control Systems revenue. Memory is expected to be approximately 32%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.25% to 63.25% as we expect a richer product mix continued service leverage and higher volume lead to improved gross margins compared to the December quarter. 
Based on revenue and product mix expectations for 2021, we are modeling gross margins between 61.5% and 62% in 2021. Given the structural trends in our business in both cost and product positioning, my bias today is to the high end of this range. Other model assumptions include operating expense of approximately $400 million, interest and other expense of approximately $43 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. 
Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.98 to $3.66 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $3.23 to $3.91. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. In closing, the end market dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling with solid demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes. 
2021 is setting up to be a second consecutive year of double-digit growth for both WFE and KLA. KLA is executing well with continued confidence that we are on track to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and also guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly more diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive moat and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin?"

And we do think that there's going to be some EUV that comes in. But there's no question that there's scaling happening. And of course, that drives more process control intensity. The other thing that's pretty clear in DRAM is the overlay requirements continue to get more and more challenging. So we're seeing increased -- trying to understand of how to squeeze more capability out of the lithography sets that they've got. 
And then we do see some, as I say, EUV adoption. So we think there'll be incrementally more focus our more advanced optical inspection tools to be able to support that. So that's what we're seeing as a trend. It's not necessarily, obviously, it's EUV heavy as what we'd see in foundry/Logic, but there is some element of EUV in there. Does that answer your question, Patrick?"

And certainly, adding Orbotech in, and I think we've done a pretty good job of improving the overall asset velocity that business so far. I think there's room for us to improve it going forward. But on the KLA side, one of the areas where you could argue that we -- I think we do something in our business to support, and I think we get paid for in terms of our profitability, but to support our model, both in terms of the component differentiation we have that drives our differentiation of our products, but also that enables our business. So we've always tended to carry a lot of inventory because we're supporting these tools that last a long time in the field. 
And we also have very exclusive relationships in a lot of our key supplier relationships that help us, as I said, protect differentiation. So as a result of all that, it does drive higher inventory commitments, and we carry that risk, if you will, although we never get stuck with extra systems and given the strength service business, we tend to move the part. So we think it's a good sacrifice to make. We think we get paid for it in terms of the profitability and structure of our business. 
And the volume we've seen has allowed us to improve it a little bit. This is not a turns business for the most part, so I think there's probably an upper limit to it. But we have -- we do focus on, and I think we have improved it a little bit over time."

We wanted to provide our view of WFE growth for '21 and expectations for KLA in the year. And the third thing was to provide just some context on the demand profile as we move through the year. And as I said in the prepared remarks, it looks relatively consistent. Now I'm not guiding the June quarter. I'm not guiding September, I'm not guiding December. But what I wanted to do is provide a little bit more context. 
Now we do have tools that cost from $10 million to $20 million, sometimes even more than that. So there is the usual variability that you have related to the timing of a shipment to customer acceptance, a consignment buyout and so on. But when we look across our business, it looks relatively consistent from a demand profile point of view. And I think starting with the backlog we have, the visibility we have in the funnel and then just the general lead time dynamics of our products it gives me some comfort with that statement."

I think we ought to spend less. But anyway, to answer your question, look, we have a rigorous process where we look at the portfolio of the business and look at how we get returns on that portfolio. So we've ramped up our investments in R&D and product development over the last few years. We think that there are opportunities. One of the biggest drivers that's driving the uptick that I articulated here as we look at '21 is investment in multiple programs supporting reticle inspection, qualification and so on. So I think that, that's been an area of focus for us, but we feel pretty comfortable with our process around R&D and the timing of our road map related to our customer requirements it's worked pretty well for KLA. I think what's driving more of our model upside is more of a gross margin dynamic than a cost dynamic.

The first one, no, we don't see any slowdown in the EUV impact if the delays that were outlined by SML in terms of the demand for Gen 5. If anything, it's kind of gone the other way. What's happened in the last few months is I think the realization that some of the yield challenges associated with EUV or best addressed by having more Gen 5 capacity. And so we're actually maxed out and trying to ramp that to support it. So we have very strong Gen 5. We don't see any delay in that. And we have a lot of conversations with customers about our ability to fix -- to support that. In terms of Orbotech, in terms of that, it's a complicated business overall to aggregate. And so we don't really see anything any signs of concern. 
We do see continued growth in that business. We feel good about where we set out our plans for 2023 in terms of the original model that we outlayed at the Investor Day. And we're on track to meet or exceed those. So we feel good about it. We'll have to see. This is a little bit newer for us to understand the dynamics of Orbotech business, but we feel good about the signs that we're seeing. 
And as we said, we ended with a strong backlog coming out of 2020. So we feel really good about this year. So C.J., the only thing I'll add to that is we were guiding it right, it still has the same variability you see quarter-to-quarter is at a different -- obviously, order agitate in our semiconductor control equipment business. But if you look at what's driving the business overall between 5G infrastructure, mobile and 5G handsets, some of the dynamics within Specialty, and then just all the overall PCB dynamics and how it's changing relative to integration and packaging and high-performance computing. So all of that is driving some nice growth in those businesses. 
So while the display business is, I expect a down year in '21 versus '20, the other businesses are more making up for it. So I think that overall, it looks pretty consistent more or less as we move through the year."

We talked about the x-ray technology is really more applicable to that, some of the challenges associated with metrology, and even how it impacts fair wafer business, our search scan business because the flatness requirements and the cleanliness for wafers for NAND really get exacerbated when you think about the kind of verticality those dimensions are going through and the stress that puts on the semiconductor producer for them to be able to manage the yield.

If you look at our service model, it's a 9% to 11% growth rate, which is what we articulated at Investor Day. And I'd argue that, certainly, the increase in demand we've seen on the system side gives us a tailwind to that growth rate moving forward. There is clearly, customers are valuing the service offerings, particularly as you're seeing more and more demand at the trailing edge and the need for those customers to keep those tools up. 
A lot of those customers, particularly around automotive are facing reliability requirements, and that's driving more investment and process control and the information that comes off the tools. So those have all been good drivers for us. So I keep thinking, look, a 80%, 85%, I think that's probably reasonable to think that we could aspire to get there. There's always dynamics for certain customers that prefer a billable model. And so we'll have to deal with that resistance to try to move to a contract structure. 
At the end of the day, contract structures allow us to optimize the cost structure underneath, and we can serve to an entitlement level that drives higher through-cycle profitability so that's what we aspire to. So I think there's opportunities, but I think there's always going to be some limit to it where customers are going to -- some customers prefer a little structure part of their installed base. Just to add to it, I mean, the one other factor is the tools that are being shipped today, the complexity is such that if you think about a car analogy, it's pretty hard to [indiscernible] a car today, 15 years ago, it might have been different. And so you think about, over time, the complexity and the associated, more and more of our systems end up having more and more custom design parts throughout the system, and it just becomes more economical to rely on us. And then there's no question that a service model, a customer benefits from having a contract over the long term, they take the risk out of episodic events and they have more reliability of uptime. 
So I agree with Brent. I think it goes up over time, but nothing moves particularly fast in the services world, given the size of the installed beta. So it takes a little time for that number to keep creeping up. But we're firmly convinced and committed to driving it."

And so when you look at what we're doing going forward, we expect that at a minimum, we'd be able to return 70% and investors can model that as they think about the returns profile over time. We're right around that this year, but this was a little bit of a unique year with some of the COVID dynamics at the beginning of the year. We did build our cash balance a little bit. But you're right, given the growth of the business, I would expect that we can deploy more. We do an exhaustive exercise here to understand the liquidity of the company and how much cash we need and we're operating at that level today. 
And so we have to juxtapose those alternatives against opportunities for growth in the company. And I think we've done a pretty good job of that. But generally, I think the 70% tends to be a floor. And given the uptick in the business that we're describing, I would expect our quarter-to-quarter share repurchasing to increase as we go forward here. Now on the dividend side, a, we've raised it 11 years in a row, 35% or so payout ratio target through-cycle to enable us to continue to raise it year in and year out and have a payout ratio that gives us the ability to do that, and even raise it in difficult years. 
We're going to grow it in line with the growth rate and free cash flow. And so over time, you can expect that the dividend payout ratio will grow roughly in line with the growth in free cash flow. So that's our model, and we do our exercise here in each year, and we'll continue to do it that way. I don't think anything's changed."

There was a pretty big budget flush from one of the big customers in the fourth quarter. So that was higher. But I guess my question is, is your view on that, is it because things have been cut? So because the procurement has been cut later on in the year as to why it's flat? Or is it because the number is the same, it just is off of a bigger base in 2020?"

What were the end drivers for it? And what were the products. And I say that because EUV really drove a lot of our BBP performance, but it isn't necessarily the only thing BBP is used for. So we feel good about how we finished up the year. As you said, we gained share and we feel like we held it. We'll see what the final numbers come out. But remember at Investor Day, we were modeling a slower growth in share than what we're actually seeing. 
So we feel really good about where we are in terms of the BBP adoption and had a very strong year in optical inspection in calendar '20. As you shift to '21, we feel like we're well positioned to build on the share gains or Process Control adoption gains that we had, again, based as much on end demand as some products that are coming to market that will continue to build that, plus continued adoption the optical inspection strength is really remarkable, and we feel good about how we're positioned there. So I think that you're right, we gained more in '19 than in 2020, we held our gains maybe built on it a little. And I think we're positioned to continue that trajectory as we go towards our 23 plan, but certainly for '21. That's the way the year is lining up. That's the way our build plans look right now. 
Yes. The product families overall, all of them are showing growth. I would think that Rick talked a lot about the broadband plasma and the strength there. Because of the memory uptake we're seeing and after a couple of years now of digestion, we're seeing more pattern inspection or unpatterned inspection investment. And so that's indicator, both to support the wafer output, but also, which in memory tends to drive wafers, so that drives that business. And then the tool monitoring that is done with pattern pruning monitor waivers in memory. And then in reticle inspection, I'd expect to see growth year-over-year above market kind of growth levels in that business as well."

And as you know, Oreste is running that. I think he's confident that we can build on our success as we go forward based on the interactions that we're having customers. We feel good about specialty. PCB has been great, and we've been really happy with the work that's going on in the packaging inspection, the IQOS businesses. 
So those 3 are really hitting it and feel really good about it. I also mentioned we're seeing the same operating margin leverage. Obviously, those are lower profitability businesses, but they have the same leverage in the operating model as the rest of KLA. So we feel good about that as well."

As we reflect on the accomplishments of 2020, it's important for me to first appreciate and acknowledge the global KLA team. Your perseverance, drive to be better and determination enabled KLA to rise to the challenge and deliver for our customers. 2020 was like no other year we have seen. And while our teams have not been physically together for the most part, our company continues to demonstrate the great KLA culture of collaboration and innovation and is emerging stronger than ever.
In the process, we delivered exceptionally strong financial results in the December quarter, closing a strong year for the company. In our shareholder letter published today, we articulate how KLA's record results are driven by success on multiple fronts, including the resourcefulness of our global workforce, the resiliency of our business model and our commitment to returning value to our shareholders.
As most of you have already seen from our results, 2020 was an impressive year for KLA on multiple fronts. We delivered strong growth, profitability and free cash flow while continuously adjusting to the changing work environments driven by COVID. Through it all, we remain focused on meeting customer demand and delivering strong return to shareholders in the rapidly growing semiconductor market.
Bren will have much more to highlight on the financials for both the quarter and the year, but I'd like to hit on a few of the annual milestones. For the year, KLA revenue grew 15% to $6.1 billion, marking the fifth consecutive year of growth. We also delivered notable profitability growth with non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing 28% and 32%, respectively year-over-year. Our free cash flow grew 44% to $1.8 billion, and we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
In the December quarter, we saw diversified strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor Process Control revenue was once again above plan. The Electronics, Packaging and Components group met its target. And our Services business continued and delivered another quarter of growth and strong operating leverage.
We ended the year with strong backlog, setting the stage for double-digit growth in 2021 as we continue to execute at a high level. We're operating from a position of strength in our marketplace. And given the accelerated growth of our served markets, we remain solidly on track to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. All this reflects the dedication of our global teams and the enabling role KLA plays in our customers' technology road maps and enhancing their return on capital investment.
Moving to today's demand environment, which continues to demonstrate accelerated adoption of several semiconductor and electronics industry growth drivers that we've been highlighting for the past few years, technology continues to transform how we live and work. And the data-driven economy is fundamentally changing how businesses operate and deliver value.
This digital transformation is enabling secular demand drivers such as high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and rapid growth in new automotive electronics and 5G communications markets. Each of these secular trends are driving investment and innovation and advanced memory and logic semiconductor devices as well as new and increasingly more complex advanced packaging and PCB technologies. With our market leadership in Process Control and growth and expansion to new markets like specialty semiconductor process equipment, PCB and finished die inspection in our EPC group, KLA is essential to enabling our increasingly digital world.
As much as things have changed over the past year, one thing that's remained constant is our KLA operating model. KLA operating model is the enduring framework that we rely on to guide the execution of our long-term strategic objectives. We deploy the KLA operating model to align the company on a consistent strategy, tie accountability to results, drive product development execution, respond to changing market conditions and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring the company operates with strong fiscal discipline as we pursue our long-term performance and profitability objectives.
Let's turn now to 5 top highlights for our -- and our results for the quarter and for 2020. First, we saw continued strength and breadth in foundry/logic demand in the quarter. As expected, memory demand also grew as memory customers plan for growth and equipment investment in 2021 to meet improving end demand. We expect higher business levels across a broader set of customers in the March quarter, with demand momentum continuing throughout 2021 across our major end markets. The strength in demand we're seeing reflects KLA's essential role in supporting our customers' drive to innovate and continue to invest in future technology nodes.
Second, we're seeing strong momentum in the marketplace for new products, driving market growth and share opportunities in both the Semiconductor Process Control and EPC groups. Fueled by expanded customer investment in EUV lithography, the Semiconductor Process Control business is driving adoption with new applications in optical inspection portfolio, such as EUV print check for GEN5, and expanding our share in new markets for KLA, including the eSL10 e-beam inspection
Platform and the nascent use of x-ray technologies for metrology applications.
Third, our Services revenue grew to $1.56 billion or 25% of total sales in 2020. This is driven by growth in our installed base, higher utilization rate and increasing expansion of Service opportunities in the trailing edge and in the EPC group. The strong results delivered in 2020 show how the Services team continues to do a fantastic job leveraging the KLA operating model to deliver at a high level. Working in close collaboration with customers and partners, the Services business innovated and drove new initiatives against the unprecedented challenges of COVID. Not only did our Services business received praise from our customers, but also grew share of wallet. And we've seen our contact penetration steadily increase in 2020 from 70% to 75% plus, which fuels recurring revenue streams and generate strong operating leverage and cash flows.
Fourth, this was a very encouraging year for the newly established EPC group, demonstrating success in KLA's growth strategies and highlighting how execution of the KLA operating model drives market leadership and improved operating leverage in acquired businesses. Revenue growth was strong, and we believe that on a net basis will exceed our $50 million annual acquisition cost synergy target by at least another additional $30 million. With EPC, KLA is now providing a more comprehensive and broader product portfolio and addressing fast-growing new markets in the electronics value chain, such as RF, automotive, 5G wireless connectivity and display. Relative to the adoption of 5G, KLA has exposure to many key components in the electronics value chain as well. The EPC group ended the year with record backlog, setting the stage for double-digit growth in 2021 and for incremental operating margins on that growth in line with the total company model.
Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, in the December quarter, we repurchased $177 million of common stock and paid $140 million in dividends. Back in July, KLA's Board of Directors authorized the 11th consecutive annual dividend increase to a yearly run rate of $3.60 per share. Since inception in 2006, KLA's dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15%. In 2020, KLA returned $1.23 billion to shareholders or 70% of free cash flow.
Before Bren gets into the greater detail of our financial highlights, let me briefly summarize, despite the disruption and unforeseen challenges that persisted throughout the year associated with COVID, KLA has benefited from the resourcefulness of its global workforce, we've adapted well and we end 2020 in a position of strength while delivering record results and set the stage for the sixth consecutive year of growth.
KLA is exceptionally well positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet the demanding customer requirements, which balance sensitivity and throughput. The semiconductor and electronics landscape is constantly changing, and we're seeing broadening customer interest which is being applied to more technology innovation than ever before at leading edge.
We believe the secular factors driving industry demand that we identified at our last Investor Day are even more relevant now than they were then, and this will help us to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long-term operating leverage should provide consistent capital returns to our shareholders.
And with that, I'll pass the call over to Bren."

KLA's December quarter and 2020 results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. 2020 was a year of strong growth and profitability across multiple areas of our business. All of this was accomplished while simultaneously continuing to return high levels of capital to shareholders.
Total revenue in the December quarter was $1.65 billion, at the very top of the guided range for the quarter of $1.51 to $1.66 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.8%, slightly below the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter of 61% to 63%. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.24, solidly above the midpoint of the guided range of $2.82 to $3.46. GAAP EPS was $2.94. At the guided tax rate of 13%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $3.27.
Total operating expenses were above the guided range of $393 million, including $228 million of R&D expense and $165 million of SG&A. Non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue was strong at 38% and in line with expectations. The higher operating expenses in the quarter were due in part to adjustments in variable compensation programs as well as the timing of prototype material purchases for product development programs.
Based on revenue expectations for 2021, product development requirements, particularly in programs supporting next-generation reticle inspection capabilities and the regionalization of additional customer engagement resources, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $400 million in the March quarter and we are budgeting quarterly operating expenses roughly within the range of $400 million to $405 million over the near-term horizon. Given top line expectations for 2021, we expect that the business will continue to outperform its target operating model in terms of overall profitability and operating margin leverage.
Other interest and expense in the December quarter was $43 million, and the effective tax rate was 13.8%. Though we always have some variability in our tax rate, given the timing and impact of discrete items and the geographic distribution of revenue and profit, we believe it is prudent to adjust our long-term tax planning rate up slightly to 13.5% going forward. Of course, we are monitoring the corporate tax discussions in the United States, and we'll provide updates on how those will affect or would affect KLA, as appropriate, in the future.
Non-GAAP net income was $504 million, GAAP net income was $457 million, cash flow from operations was $561 million and free cash flow was a record at $502 million. This resulted in the free cash flow conversion of nearly 100% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of just over 30%.
Our segment revenue was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in our Semiconductor Process Control business. The EPC group delivered results in line with our model heading into the quarter. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated Service business, was $1.38 billion, a sequential quarterly increase of 9% and up 15% for 2020. Approximate customer segment mix is as follows: foundry was strong as expected at 49%, logic was 10% and memory grew to 41% from 32% in the December quarter. Within memory, the business was roughly 60% NAND and 40% DRAM.
Going forward, we will be combining the foundry and logic segments into one category to remove some of the noise as to whether a customer is in one category or another, given the various markets they serve and to better align with industry reporting practices.
Revenue for the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment in December was $91 million, up 2% sequentially and up 24% in 2020. Demand in this segment was driven by growth in RF, MEMS and advanced packaging. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $179 million, down 1% sequentially, but up 12% for 2020 as strength in PCB and component inspection offset a weaker business environment in the display business.
In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.46 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, during the December quarter, we repurchased $177 million of common stock and paid $140 million in dividends. In 2020, KLA returned $1.2 billion to shareholders or 70% of free cash flow, including $547 million in dividends paid and $681 million in share repurchases. We believe our track record for delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders.
As it relates to guidance, as we begin the new year, our view is that the wafer fab equipment or WFE market will grow in the mid-teens, plus or minus a couple of percentage points, in 2021 off a baseline of $59 billion to $60 billion. 2021 is expected to be a year of strong demand and growth across our major end markets, with the strongest percentage growth coming in memory, led by DRAM investment and with foundry/logic delivering another year of solid growth.
Looking ahead, based on our current backlog, sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters and product lead times, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. As a result, we would expect the company revenue to be roughly consistent quarter-to-quarter across the year.
Our March quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be in a range of $1.74 billion, plus or minus $75 million. Foundry/logic is forecasted to be about 68% of Semi Process Control Systems revenue. Memory is expected to be approximately 32%.
We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.25% to 63.25% as we expect a richer product mix, continued service leverage and higher volume lead to improved gross margins compared to the December quarter.
Based on revenue and product mix expectations for 2021, we are modeling gross margins between 61.5% and 62% in 2021. Given the structural trends in our business in both cost and product positioning, my bias today is to the high end of this range. Other model assumptions include operating expense of approximately $400 million, interest and other expense of approximately $43 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%.
Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.98 to $3.66 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $3.23 to $3.91. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares.
In closing, the end market dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling with solid demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes.
2021 is setting up to be a second consecutive year of double-digit growth for both WFE and KLA. KLA is executing well with continued confidence that we are on track to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and also guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly more diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive moat and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders.

The other thing that's pretty clear in DRAM is the overlay requirements continue to get more and more challenging. So we're seeing increased -- trying to understand of how to squeeze more capability out of the lithography sets that they've got.
And then we do see some, as I say, EUV adoption. So we think there'll be incrementally more focus on our more advanced optical inspection tools to be able to support that. So that's what we're seeing as a trend. It's not necessarily, obviously, as EUV-heavy as what we'd see in foundry/logic, but there is some element of EUV in there.

But on the KLA side, one of the areas where you could argue that we -- I think we do something in our business to support, and I think we get paid for it in terms of our profitability, but to support our model, both in terms of the component differentiation we have that drives our differentiation of our products, but also that enables our business. So we've always tended to carry a lot of inventory because we're supporting these tools that last a long time in the field. And we also have very exclusive relationships in a lot of our key supplier relationships that help us, as I said, protect differentiation.
So as a result of all that, it does drive higher inventory commitments, and we carry that risk, if you will, although we never get stuck with extra systems. And given the strength of the service business, we tend to move the part. So we think it's a good sacrifice to make. We think we get paid for it in terms of the profitability and structure of our business.
And the volume we've seen has allowed us to improve it a little bit. It's -- this is not a turns business for the most part, so I think there's probably an upper limit to it. But we have -- we do focus on, and I think we have improved it a little bit over time."

I was really trying to do a few things. First, obviously, we're guiding March, and we've got a nice sequential increase to the March quarter. We wanted to provide our view of WFE growth for '21 and expectations for KLA in the year. And the third thing was to provide just some context on the demand profile as we move through the year. And as I said in the prepared remarks, it looks relatively consistent.
Now I'm not guiding the June quarter. I'm not guiding September. I'm not guiding December. But what I wanted to do is provide a little bit more context. Now we do have tools that cost from $10 million to $20 million, sometimes even more than that. So there is the usual variability that you have related to the timing of a shipment to customer acceptance, to consignment buyout and so on.
But when we look across our business, it looks relatively consistent from a demand profile point of view. And I think starting with the backlog we have, the visibility we have in the funnel and then just the general lead time dynamics of our products, it gives me some comfort with that statement."

I think sometimes Rick and I are the only 2 people in the company that think we ought to spend less. But anyway, to answer your question, look, we have a rigorous process where we look at the portfolio of the business and look at how we get returns on that portfolio.
So we've ramped up our investments in R&D and product development over the last few years. We think that there are opportunities. One of the biggest drivers that's driving the uptick that I articulated here, as we look at '21, is investment in multiple programs supporting reticle inspection, qualification and so on.
So I think that that's been an area of focus for us, but we feel pretty comfortable with our process around R&D and the timing of our road map relative to our customer requirements, and It's worked pretty well for KLA. I think what's driving more of our model upside is more of a gross margin dynamic than a cost dynamic.
And so I think the gross margin is reflective of the differentiation that we have with our products in the field and I think the value we're adding to our customers. So hopefully, that answers your question."

What's happened in the last few months is I think the realization that some of the yield challenges associated with EUV are best addressed by having more GEN5 capacity. And so we're actually maxed out and trying to ramp that in order to support it. So we have very strong GEN5. We don't see any delay in that. And we have a lot of conversations with customers about our ability to support that.
In terms of Orbotech, in terms of that, it's a complicated business overall to aggregate, and so we don't really see anything -- any signs of concern. We do see continued growth in that business.

There's -- clearly, customers are valuing the service offerings, particularly as you're seeing more and more demand at the trailing edge and the need for those customers to keep those tools up. A lot of those customers, particularly around automotive, are facing increasing reliability requirements, and that's driving more investment in process control and the information that comes off the tools.
So those have all been good drivers for us. So I keep thinking, look, 80%, 85%, I think that's probably reasonable to think that we could aspire to get there. There's always dynamics for certain customers that prefer a billable model. And so we'll have to deal with that resistance to try to move to a contract structure.

So I agree with Bren. I think it goes up over time, but nothing moves particularly fast in the services world, given the size of the installed base. So it takes a little time for that number to keep creeping up. But we're firmly convinced and committed to driving it."

So when I look at it and -- I think that we will at least perform in line with the market. I would expect that we'll probably do a little bit better. There are some headwinds and some tailwinds as we look at '21. But overall, I think that that's where process control intensity kind of plays out.
And then from a share, if we execute, I think there's probably some opportunities for some modest share improvement as well. So I would think KLA's share of WFE is probably flat to slightly up as we look at '21 from where we sit today."

And so when you look at what we're doing going forward, we expect that at a minimum, we'd be able to return 70% and investors can model that as they think about the returns profile over time. We're right around that this year, but this was a little bit of a unique year with some of the COVID dynamics at the beginning of the year. We did build our cash balance a little bit. But you're right, given the growth of the business, I would expect that we can deploy more. We do an exhaustive exercise here to understand the liquidity of the company and how much cash we need to run it, and we're operating at that level today.
And so we have to juxtapose those alternatives against opportunities for growth in the company, and I think we've done a pretty good job of that. But generally, I think the 70% tends to be a floor. And given the uptick in the business that we're describing, I would expect our quarter-to-quarter share repurchasing to increase as we go forward here.
Now on the dividend side, a, we've raised it 11 years in a row, 35% or so payout ratio target through-cycle to enable us to continue to raise it year in and year out and have a payout ratio that gives us the ability to do that and even raise it in difficult years.
We're going to grow it in line with the growth rate in free cash flow. And so over time, you can expect that the dividend payout ratio will grow roughly in line with the growth in free cash flow. So that's our model, and we do our exercise here each year, and we'll continue to do it that way. I don't think anything's changed."

So you always have the drivers that influence margin -- gross margin, whether it's a product mix. Obviously, service has a dilutive element at the gross margin line. But we factor that into how we think about the model when we put out there.
So yes, we're outperforming the public model. I think the strength and the speed of the growth that we've seen over the last couple of years has helped drive a fair amount of leverage in the business.

So we feel good about how we finished up the year. As you said, we gained share and we feel like we held it. We'll see what the final numbers come out. But remember, at Investor Day, we were modeling a slower growth in share than what we're actually seeing. So we feel really good about where we are in terms of the BBP adoption and had a very strong year in optical inspection in calendar '20.
As you shift to '21, we feel like we're well positioned to continue to build on the share gains or process control adoption gains that we had, again, based as much on end demand as some products that are coming to market that will continue to build that, plus continued adoption. The optical inspection strength is really remarkable, and we feel good about how we're positioned there.
So I think that you're right. We gained more in '19 than in 2020. We held our gains, maybe built on it a little. And I think we're positioned to continue that trajectory as we go towards our '23 plan, but certainly for '21. That's the way the year is lining up. That's the way our build plans look right now."

KLA's March quarter results demonstrate continued momentum in our business. We delivered strong 27% year-over-year revenue growth. Non-GAAP gross and operating profit rose 30% and 48% y",1430,"Thanks, Kevin, and thank you for joining KLA's earnings call today. KLA's March quarter results demonstrate continued momentum in our business. We delivered strong 27% year-over-year revenue growth. 
Non-GAAP gross and operating profit rose 30% and 48% year-over-year, respectively, and free cash flow grew 47% to a record level. We accomplished these by executing our strategic vision amidst a dynamic business environment. Year-to-date, we've seen a sharp increase in business levels across each of our major markets. 
This is primarily due to secular demand trends driving semiconductor industry growth across a broad range of markets and applications such as 5G and cloud computing. Our customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investment to address these growth markets while continuing investment in leading-edge R&D efforts. 
Against this backdrop of strong demand, we continue to navigate evolving customer requirements and dynamic supply chain challenges. Still, KLA has not missed a beat and continues operating at an exceptionally high level, delivering on our commitments, staying focused on creating value for our partners, customers and shareholders. 
We would be remiss if we did not mention that achieving these results would be impossible without the extraordinary contributions of our talented global teams who always rise to the challenges of meeting our customers' needs in an increasingly complex global business environment. 
Three key things enabled KLA's record results and momentum; one, successful innovation and market leadership; two, the resourcefulness and talent of our global workforce and three, the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model. 
Before we discuss those further, let me begin by touching on how we see the industry demand environment now. Strong secular demand trends continue to shape multiple markets and are fueled by the increasing digitization of end markets and industries. 
In addition, there's a heightened focus on the strategic nature of our customers' investments around both leading edge development, optimizing facility utilization and regionalization. As a result, our WFE forecast has improved even further from January, reflecting the strength of demand we're experiencing over the past couple of months, with momentum continuing into calendar 2022. 
And in this environment, KLA is experiencing a sharp increase in customer demand for systems and support for 2021 deliveries, and our expectations for KLA revenue growth have increased from our initial assessment in January. This momentum in customer investment is happening against a backdrop where process control intensity maintains its momentum, and KLA continues to drive market leadership at levels approximately 4x the nearest competitor. 
Propelled by the upside we're experiencing in the underlying WFE markets, KLA market leadership, increasing long-term Process Control intensity, our broader reach into electronics ecosystem and the contributions of our large and growing service business, KLA is on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of our original expectations. 
KLA's market leadership results from the ongoing successful execution of the company's customer-focused strategy, which is based on investing a high level of R&D to drive differentiation with a unique portfolio of products, technologies and strategies that address the most critical Process Control market challenges. 
We're pleased to continue to see the success of our efforts being validated by our customers' purchasing decisions. Here are some recent success stories to illustrate the point. The most recently published Gartner data shows that in 2020, the total optical inspection market grew at a rate double that of the growth rate of the overall WFE market to approximately $1.9 billion, with KLA maintaining our strong market leadership and 83% share of this critical market for Process Control. 
Many already know that KLA is participating in the automotive electronics through our semiconductor packaging and PCB product lines. We're excited by near-term plans to launch new versions of our Process Control products tailored for the automotive industry. 
This quarter, expect to hear more about how KLA has positioned our wafer inspection portfolio to help customers drive higher reliability, quality and yield in automotive applications in both 200-milliliter and 300-millimeter production which will help address some of the reported automotive semiconductor shortages going forward. 
Calendar year 2021 is positioned to be the 6th consecutive year of revenue growth for KLA, demonstrating strong through-cycle growth, the success of our diversification strategies and our market leadership in Process Control and a large and growing contribution from our Services business. 
Let's briefly cover the top 5 highlights from the March quarter results. First, we saw continued strength in breadth and foundry logic demand in the quarter. As expected, memory demand also grew as memory customers plan for growth in equipment investment in 2021 to meet improving end demand. 
We expect higher business levels across a broader set of customers in the March quarter, with demand momentum continuing throughout 2021 across major end markets. The strength and demand we're seeing reflects KLA's essential role in supporting our customers' drive to innovate and continue to invest in future technology nodes. 
Second, Gartner's recent market share report for 2020 size KLA's share of Process Control over 53% for the year. KLA's market share in Process Control has maintained a steady growth trajectory over the past 10 years. Highlights that the 2020 report show KLA continuing to strengthen our core franchise and optical inspection and strong momentum in gains e-beam inspection and optical metrology, increasing investment in leading-edge foundry logic the accelerated adoption of EUV continues to be major factors driving equipment spending. 
KLA's market leadership once again demonstrates the success of our portfolio approach to solving complex customer requirements at the leading edge. Third, our Services revenue was $428 million in the March quarter or 24% of total sales, with over 75% of Services revenue in our Semiconductor Process Control segment resulting from recurring contract agreements. 
Services is on track for another strong double-digit growth year, driven by our growing installed base, higher utilization rate and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and the EPC group. Our Semi Process Control business revenue continues to grow faster than the rate of the installed base, growing approximately 2.8x faster over the last 5 years. 
Fourth, this was another growth quarter for our Electronics, Packaging and Components, or EPC group. Highlighted by record quarterly bookings for the semiconductor -- the specialty semiconductor business. Growth was driven by automotive, 5G wireless connectivity and advanced packaging applications across various end markets. 
With EPC, KLA is now providing a more comprehensive and broader product portfolio across fast-growing new markets in the electronics value chain, such as RF, automotive semiconductors and advanced packaging. As it relates to EPC's opportunities in advanced packaging markets, KLA is strengthening our engagement with the top 5 semiconductor market leaders in packaging, and we're expanding our reach with OSATS. 
KLA is ramping our investment in advanced packaging market to drive adoption of new technologies in this exciting growth market, in addition to new inspection products for high level production and assembly. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, in the March quarter, we repurchased $273 million of our common stock and paid $139 million in dividends. For a total capital return of $412 million or 71% of free cash flow of $585 million, which was also a record. 
Last July, KLA's Board of Directors authorized the 11th consecutive annual dividend increase to a yearly run rate of $3.60 per share. Since its inception in 2006, KLA's dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15%. We believe KLA's track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. 
Before Bren gets into greater details of our financial highlights that some recap, KLA's March 2021 results demonstrate the critical nature of KLA's products and services and enabling the digital transformation of our lives, the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation. 
KLA is exceptionally well positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding customer requirements, balancing sensitivity and throughput. Semiconductor and electronics landscape is constantly changing. We're seeing broadening customer interest driven by more technology innovation than ever before at the leading edge. 
We believe there are multiple secular factors driving industry demand and KLA will continue to benefit from and position us to exceed our 2023 financial targets, reach them earlier than anticipated. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth, strong long-term operating leverage should provide robust cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll pass the call over to Bren."

Results this quarter highlighted the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. 
Total revenue in the March quarter was $1.8 billion at the top of the guided range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.9%, above the midpoint of the guided range as stronger revenue and favorable product mix drove upside in the quarter. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $3.85 at the upper end of the guided range. GAAP EPS was $3.66. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $407 million, including $239 million of R&D expense and $168 million of SG&A. At KLA, technical application support for our customers is included in SG&A and was $42 million in the quarter. 
The combination of R&D expense and technical applications represents about 70% of total operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was very strong at 40.4%. Given higher revenue expectations for the remaining 3 quarters of 2021, product development requirements, particularly in programs supporting next-generation reticle inspection capabilities, regionalization of additional customer engagement resources and increased investment in our infrastructure globally, particularly in expanding our manufacturing footprint and completing our new HQ2 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $412 million in the June quarter. 
We are budgeting quarterly operating expenses to increase sequentially $3 million to $5 million a quarter over the near-term horizon. Given top line expectations for 2021 and fueled by double-digit growth over the past 2 years, we expect that the business will continue to outperform our target operating model, both in terms of overall profitability and operating margin leverage. 
Non-GAAP net income was $598 million. GAAP net income was $567 million. Cash flow from operations was $646 million, and free cash flow was $585 million. This resulted in a free cash flow conversion of nearly 100% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of over 32%. 
Our segment revenue was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in our Semiconductor Process Control business. The EPC group delivered results mostly in line with our model heading into the quarter. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business was $1.51 billion, the sequential quarterly increase of 9% and up 28% compared with March of last year. 
The approximate semiconductor customer mix was as follows: foundry Logic was strong as expected at 69%. And memory was 31%. In memory, the business was split roughly 55% NAND and 45% DRAM. Revenue for the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment in March was $92 million, up 1% sequentially and up 8% over the prior year. 
Demand in this segment was driven by growth in RF, power and advanced packaging. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $205 million, up 14% sequentially and up 28% year-over-year, with mobility markets driving strength in advanced PCB and finished component inspection. 
Revenue by major product category in region are both broken out in the shareholder letter in slides. From a balance sheet perspective, KLA ended the quarter with $2.4 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. 
In terms of cash flow and capital returns, Rick already covered the highlights. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. 
While circumstances can change, our current expectation is that our capital returns profile for calendar '21 will exceed 85% of the expected free cash flow. As it relates to guidance, our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook has expanded further from our view in January, where we characterized the WFE market to grow in the low teens, plus or minus a few points. 
We are revising up our view for the WFE market to grow on a percentage basis in the low to mid 20s with a bias to the upside in calendar '21 from approximately $61 billion in 2020, reflecting the strengthening of demand we have experienced over the past couple of months across all segments. 
Also, and earnings in January, we provided a high level outlook of business levels being roughly flat quarter-to-quarter for calendar year '21. As we look ahead, based on the strength of our current backlog, sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters, along with expected product lead times, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. As a result, we would expect the company revenue to continue to improve sequentially quarter-to-quarter throughout the remainder of the calendar year, with the second half growing versus the first half as more KLA manufacturing capacity comes online to support this robust customer demand environment. 
This growth is fueled principally by our Semiconductor Process Control business. This business is positioned well in terms of expected performance in 2021 relative to the overall WFE market. 
Our June quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be in a range of $1.855 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be about 68% and memory is expected to be approximately 32% of Semi Process Control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. 
Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 60% of the segment mix. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61% to 63% as product mix expectations normalize in the June quarter. Based on increased revenue volume and product mix expectations for 2021, we are now modeling gross margin to be between 62% and 62.5% for the calendar year. 
While in any given quarter, the mix of our business will affect our gross margin results, the structural trends, both in terms of product cost and product positioning remain compelling in our sustainable tailwinds going forward. Other model assumptions include, non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $412 million, interest and other expense of approximately $40 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. 
Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $3.20 to $4.08, and and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $3.47 to $4.35. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 154.5 million shares. 
In closing, the industry dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling, with solid demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes. We are encouraged by the strength of the leading indicators of our business. And our customers' multiyear plans for continued investment. 
KLA is executing well, and we have continued confidence that we are on track to both exceed our 2023 financial targets and achieve sooner than anticipated on the strength of higher industry demand. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. 
They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive moat, strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders.

So we feel pretty good not only about the growth of the overall industry, but the positioning of the Semi Process Control segment against that industry growth and expectations.

From a competitive standpoint, we also expect to be able to continue the plan we laid out in 2020 -- 2019, which is to increase our overall position of process control as we have in the last couple of years, and we think that continues. Based on the strength of our product portfolio and the engagement we have with our existing customers. 
There's no question that there's always going to be competition out there. But if you look at the history of the Gartner data, as we highlighted, over time, as  consistently been successful in leveraging our strategies to build on our market position and gain share. And we don't see anything about the current competitive environment that will change that. 
We do have some major products to deliver in terms of in areas like reticle inspection, but -- and that's happening this year. But we're very pleased with the performance of our optical inspection, and we're also very encouraged by the recent success of our e-beam offerings that we really got back in those segments in the last year or so. So we feel good about our competitive position. And as you might imagine, it kind of shows up in our gross margin in terms of the strength of our business and our competitive position. 
That we're able to continue to have the kind of margin profile that we have, despite the fact that we've added EPC, which overall, at a corporate level, you know, was dilutive to the margins that KLA had prior to that. So I think that should be evidence of our strength."

So when you look back at the March quarter, most of the growth sequentially in the quarter came from the Semi Process Control business. And as Rick just mentioned, that's a richer business for us overall. 
So that, combined with the upside in the quarter in terms of incremental revenue. Is what drove the margins up to where they were. It's a little bit lower as we look at at the June quarter, it's still in line with the kind of guidance that we've been providing at 62%, plus or minus. So mostly in line with that. As we look at quarter-to-quarter, we do have some sequential growth in EPC. And so that's dilutive from that standpoint. 
But in general, I think that the margin drivers structurally are all pretty solid. We're seeing nice leverage overall in the business from the activities, the strength of the business and the activities in our factory. So we're seeing good efficiencies there. 
And then over the course of the year, I think just given the directionally where it's moving, as I mentioned last quarter, I thought it was 61.5% to 62% for the year. Certainly, the stronger outlook in terms of top line, but also just the drivers underneath in terms of what we're expecting from certain products. I think we're in line with that sort of 62% to 62.5% that I talked about in our prepared remarks. 
And given the strength in the business overall, probably more bias to the upper end of that range. So I think that there's sustainable traction in these areas, particularly around certain products, we talked about the inflection in growth in optical inspection.

But can you help me better understand the 4x market share advantage that you have in the optical world, how does that position you as we start moving to these new technologies?"

I think the I'm not certain of this, but I think the fastest-growing product in metrology and inspection of pretty certain was our GEN5 over the last couple of years. And the strength of that is driven by its ability to satisfy the need",419,"Yes. Thanks, John. I think the I'm not certain of this, but I think the fastest-growing product in metrology and inspection of pretty certain was our GEN5 over the last couple of years. And the strength of that is driven by its ability to satisfy the needs that we have for inspection measurement with EUV, specifically around print down and also the advanced nodes. 
There's nothing that we're seeing that indicates the percent of inspection and metrology budget is dramatically increasing toward e-beam. In fact, if anything, it's always been the challenge to drive the optical at a higher rate because the price performance is so much higher. 
I'd also say that the people that are closest to having a multi e-beam solution, or KLA, we're the ones that have it that we're developing and introducing in the reticle space, which is, I think where it's needed the most. So we don't really see any inflection. We don't see a change in the market share dynamic. And if anything, the challenge that brand and the operations team have is satisfying the increased demand around the optical portfolio that we have specifically GEN5, but also GEN4, which hasn't slowed down. So I don't buy the thesis that this is the transition it hasn't been for years. 
And the reason is because optical keeps getting better. And it's really difficult to make an e-beam tool that's fast enough to satisfy most of the inspection requirements. In terms of pointing e-beam, pointing optical with e-beam, that's not a new idea. That's been around quite a while. And at KLA, we introduced that concept when we introduced our e-beam Inspection tool and talked about it at our Analyst Day, that just allows those tools to be functional and to continue to provide value. 
So I don't think that transition is happening.
I think just in terms of overall growth rates, right? So we talked about the accelerated growth relative to market in 2020. And I would expect this business to grow faster than market again in 2021. 
So I think that the good thing about the complementary nature of our e-beam solutions with our optical is driving higher relevancy and use case application across the optical inspection, which is the large market, right? That's the market that's $2 billion-plus in terms of opportunities. 
So it gives you some perspective on the strategy overall, but there's an inflection here that's validating, I think, the relevancy of optical inspection in a lot of different ways."

John, again, I don't think the world is going to move large-scale to e-beam. I mean we're well positioned if it does. But I just don't -- I think there's going to be a mix and match and the percent of layers that could be inspected by e-beam is never going to be as high as what could be expected by optical, especially since GEN5 is still in the early iterations. 
We have more capability to to add to GEN5. It's -- we've been adding -- have for a while added AI capability is at. So I think in general, yes, we have a good e-beam solution, but our modeling doesn't show that, that's going to be the increased percentage of the use case because optical can satisfy especially GEN5 and satisfy the needs that are going to be through the 2020 even past when we get the high-NA EUV. And remember, that's only a percentage of the layers that are going to be subject to that. 
So I don't think we're going to see this transition to e-beam. I think incumbency for KLA has really been based on our ability to keep delivering new capability to the market, not so much because we've been there, but our newest products, which is why we invest so heavily in R&D and the application support for our customers. 
So I don't think it's going to transition. We'd be fine if it did, but I think it's a better price performance for our customers to have as many layers be done optically as possible because the throughput capability is just so much better in optical than it is in any form of e-beam."

And to me, logically, when we're adding meaningful capacity, I would think process tools would outperform and Process Control would  underperform. Not any hit to you, but just where you fit in terms of the order of spending. 
And here, you've outlined mid-20s kind of growth for the industry, whereas we've heard 37% growth from ASML, we've got 30-plus percent growth from Lam. How in that world, those process control outperform. Is it Intel coming back? Is it at mask inspection spend from China? What are the moving parts that can allow that to happen?"

Just based on the orders and the conversations we're having with customers daily, will significantly outgrow that. 
I don't know it will be 38%, but it will probably start with the 3 in terms of what it is. Now we don't know what WFE is going to actually be this year, but if that's what Process Control, that's just based on the conversations we're having right now. A who runs that business is in calls almost 3 times a week talking about slots and support for customers across this portfolio. I get pulled into them occasionally. 
But that's the conversation is how can we support that. And when we model it, we look at that business, and we think it's going to be a very strong grower this year. Could the WFE numbers change? Yes, of course. What's it driven on your other question, C.J., it's -- of course, it's driven by the increased investment people have in the advanced design rules it's not a secret that TSM has talked about dramatically increasing their CapEx this year, and we know what Intel has said publicly. 
But it's not just that. We're seeing increased commitment and conversation from the memory manufacturers who want that capability, too. So I think the difference between the Process Control intensity and foundry logic is still there, but it is narrowing a bit as people push harder on the advanced nodes for specifically for the advanced DRAM work that's going, but also some NAND work too. 
Bren, maybe you can fill in."

I don't know what the baselines were for the different companies and sometimes they don't even share them, so you don't really know when you're thinking about percentages. 
So I try to show our work yearly, how we're thinking about it. If you look at 2020, KLA's performance was pretty much in line with the market. If you went from $52 billion, $53 billion in 2019 to 2020 at $61 billion that's about 16% overall. And if you look at semi PC equipment, it was in that ballpark. So as we look at this year, as I said earlier, if you're looking at $75 billion plus, I think that's where the the industry is against the $61 billion baseline, then you're like in the mid-20s to our prepared remarks. 
And against that backdrop, I would expect Process Control to do very well. And so we'll see how it goes. I'm not going to guide the second half, certainly, we would expect the second half to be stronger in that business overall. And I think the drivers are pretty compelling and pretty broad-based. So we'll see how it goes as we move forward here. But that's -- I think that's how I see it at this point."

Now our products do vary. Some have very long lead times where you're looking at some of our high-end systems, the timing to procure and optical components and then polish and grind optics, can take some time. 
So for some of those products, the lead times are significantly longer. I'd say today, if you aggregate it across the company, we're a little bit longer than we'd like to be. So we'd like to target somewhere in that 5% to 6%, and we're probably somewhere in that 7% to 8% range as we look at it today. 
And capacity is coming online really across the board. We're adding people into all of our factories. Why we've been doing that since we started to see the business inflect in November, in a meaningful way. We're adding capacity in terms of space in all of our major factories around the world. And we're working very closely with our suppliers. Suppliers have been great and supporting our ramp so far. They're adding and investing, and we're investing in them in a lot of cases. 
So I would expect that given the guidance, the growth we're expecting in the second half will happen as a result of incremental capacity, and we can continue to work that. So I think given the expectations around 6 months of -- in terms of our lead time, we can continue to add to what we have to support whatever environment we're facing. 
At the end of the day, KLA doesn't lose business because we can't deliver. So we also will move things around as needed to be able to support our customers. And we do a lot from a tactical point of view to try to shorten cycle times, adding shifts, all the little things you can do to pull in and cut days out of the lead time. 
So all those activities are ongoing. And I think that as we execute against that into the second half, I think it creates opportunities for us to deliver to the expectations we have right now, but also to support upside if it presents itself. And I don't see any reason why it seems to be sustaining even as we move beyond, right, in terms of -- I don't see anything falling off anytime soon."

But obviously, ensuring the quality of the reticles. And when they're printed that the high-quality is there, now it's across more layers. So that drives adoption of GEN5, also just more sensitivity to smaller defects. So in general, that shifts the dynamic, if you thought about a blend between GEN4 and GEN5, which GEN4 is still very active. As a product line, this will shift it more in those advanced nodes to a higher percentage of those tools being GEN5 tools and the next-generation or iterations on GEN5 as we move forward. 
I think we mentioned in the past, GEN5 is very early in its product life cycle. And there are a number of additional capabilities that will be added to it to support advance. So those are just 2 areas there'll be others in terms of the metrology challenges. But in general, the process control challenges as we move forward, especially on advanced design rules will increase. And we're seeing that play out right now in development."

One of the things that we learned early on, though, is to look at the -- follow the money and figure out how profitable your customers are and what is sustainable. And I go back to periods where I remember companies that were spending 2x their CapEx was twice the size of their revenue. And you just knew that couldn't last, right? 
So when we look at the supply chain now, 1 of the leading indicators we always look at is profitability of our customers. And it's universally good. I mean there are some examples where customers are investing, and we see this in China, where they don't have a revenue base to support the investment, but those are viewed as strategic investments. 
But the percent of that that's in the industry right now is really low. And so it's the growth of the semiconductor industry broadly with all the different drivers. The number of players that have maintained their profitability through these cycles. And the fact that, that gives us confidence in the sustainability. 
I don't think we're going to see growth rate that's 25%, 30%. We're talking about what it might be this year. That's not going to be the long-term growth rate. I think there's a step-up to get to support these new drivers. And I would imagine it resumes its growth at a more reasonable upper single-digit kind of level. For the equipment industry as we kind of model. But the step-up is consistent with the multiple drivers. 
As Bren mentioned, we have a lot of leverage in terms of being able to utilize our facilities. But even that, given that we're investing right now to make sure we've got additional people parts and space, as Bren said, so that we could support the ramps that we're seeing. 
I do think this is a step-up. I think we've seen it in the past. And I think the business is sustainable. I don't think 30% growth will happen for several years in a row. But if it did, we'd be there to support it. So we feel really good about where we are. And more importantly, the investments we're making in our capability are enabling our customers to achieve their objectives, and that's really the the key to our continued success is make sure we're staying relevant with our customers. Does that answer your question, Patrick?"

And to make you feel younger, Rick, I'll ask you to follow-up as well. As we look forward, and I know Process Control does get a, I guess, a good look at a lot of next-generation process technologies and manufacturing. You mentioned about EUV increasing layers and the adoption of GEN5. 
As you look forward to foundry logic, you have the EUV increasing layers, but you also have in a few nodes the transition to gate all around to nanowires, nanoribbons. Qualitatively, from a Process Control standpoint, I know it's very early, which do you see out of the EUV increasing layers and the transition to to the new transition structures, which do you see as a larger incremental opportunity for KLA?"

Just so you know, we do have a group inside of KLA that models out the advanced technology designs. We have some really talented people that we think about that years in advance to think about what are the solutions that will be necessary. Data all around is an interesting 1 because there, it's actually an adaptation of GEN4 that's going to be most relevant to solving some of those problems based on the contrast of those devices. 
So we think that will be incremental. As I mentioned in the earlier question, you think about more EUV layers, that just drives the overall expectation of higher sensitivity across the portfolio, the increase for more inspection overall and a higher level of sensitivity. 
I tip it toward the advanced nodes driving more intensity than the new structures, but the new structures can't be discounted because if you can't make them successful, then you're not going to be able to ramp those nodes. So -- but I'd say, probably 60-40, maybe even 65-35, that it will be the advanced design rules that drive it more. And it's not just going to be in foundry logic because we're also seeing even though it seems like they're almost out of gas, DRAM keeps pushing as well to drive the next capability improvement so that they can have competitive advantage, and I don't think that abates anytime soon."

You guys talked about that a lot back in the back half of 2019 with 10. So I guess conceptually, it's not new, but they have a pretty strong e-beam review presence. So I guess, in theory, that could provide kind of a better input for the AI algorithm. But can you sort of talk about just this general idea and maybe sort of whether it can change the impact the e-beam could have on the market in your position?"

I could go back even further when we introduced the back years and years ago and the idea it was a pointer for optical back then. And that was in the '90s. So this idea of e-beam directing optical is an old idea. The idea that -- the problem that it has in general, and this is an interesting question is do you have systemic defects? 
Do you really -- can you actually point that, AI has helped solve some of those problems, but there's still this basic question about coverage. And can you cover enough of the wafers to see enough of the Airs if you look at a modern wafer in a leading fab, they don't have many defects. 
I mean there are very few. So you need to cover a lot of area, and that's what optical is really good at. The e-beam ends up being the most valuable and debugging of a new process at the very front end, which is why it's mostly been in R&D. And that's what we're continuing to see. AI has been added to the products. We've been doing that for a number of years, whatever your definition is that increasing the intelligence, the algorithm that's been KLA's sweet spot for years, and we continue to do that. 
So I think -- I don't think that the announcement of 2.5-year old technology earlier this year was really anything revolutionary other than to announce it's not new. And I don't think that the relevancy of what we're doing changes as a result. I do think that increasing the capability of the ML and the AI across all the products in this industry will continue to make them more relevant as we go forward for KLA and others as well. 
So I think that's an area we're all taking advantage of. And that will help increase the capability and the learning that the industry has, in general, would be able to move forward. But I don't think this is -- this was not a dislocation. It was not -- it was not anything new for customers. It might have been new for other communities, but the disclosures and the conversations are not new to customers."

So service, obviously, it's a lower portion of your total rather than your peers. I know that you're never going to be like the films guys given the nature of their technology, some of their tools eat themselves. So obviously, it's sort of like apples and oranges there. 
But some of them also are sort of guaranteeing performance and metrics like that, and they're sort of selling that. And I'm wondering what sort of new things you're bringing to bear in service to maybe help your service business start to grow a little faster?"

I mean we -- I think 1 of the things in service for us is that we have the ability to really customize our offerings for customers, both in terms of response times, in terms of stocking levels, in terms of uptime commitments, and things like that. 
And then given that and given the nature of the contract that we structure, and it's pretty important for you when customers buy Process Control, they buy what they need and then they they have contracts to ensure that the tools are running full out all the time, and they are willing to invest in a contract structure to ensure that we can keep them up and make sure that they match and all those sorts of things. 
So it's a little bit different business. Customers because they don't have as many, they have 10s instead of hundreds as they would in a process tool. They don't necessarily have the ability to build the capability internally to be able to do self-service. And so that's a unique aspect of our service business, there's also the complexity of what we offer relative to process tools, which is far different. 
So for all those reasons, it does drive a different service experience with customers. And as I said, we customized to meet their their operating expense requirements and what they're looking to get out of their fab, and it does drive this 75% plus contract revenue stream. I think there's always what happens with the new tools in terms of our ability to sell and support service on new tools. 
I think where we've seen a lot more engagement with customers is is the -- in the trailing edge, where you're seeing higher reliability and quality requirements, particularly, let's say, for example, in areas like automotive, where customers weren't as focused on the Process Control outcomes as much as they are today with the growth that we're seeing and the increase in reliability that's required. 
And given the margin structure in that industry, for example, it's pretty important that you don't under kill, right, because of the cost of recall and so on, but then there's also overkill too. So there's a lot more process control engagement that's happening through our service business for those customers to support the installed base at a greater level. So you don't see tools falling off. 
You've seen them staying in service, and that's what is probably the unique growth driver that we're seeing today as as products are living longer and some of these other markets are inflecting."

And we believe that this year will be another strong year. So I mean these things move. Annually, it's kind of hard because there are puts and takes. But competitively, we're actually ahead of plan. And largely, that's driven by the success mainly of Gen 5. And what we're seeing in the optical inspection portfolio, that's been the bigger gains.

From a top line point of view, you're right, it's been what's driven it mostly has been, yes, we had some incremental share improvement relative to the plan we were on, but just stronger industry growth. We talked a lot -- and part of our theme was, if you will, back for our Investor Day, was to talk a lot about opportunities related to EUV and increasing memory opportunities to drive incremental adoption of process control and KLA solutions. 
We talked about reticle inspection requirements for EUV that would affect the reticle inspection tools, but also the wafer inspection tools. We also talked about new markets like e-beam that we were reentering and then finally, opportunities in memory metrology. So those, in some ways, we're going to create incremental revenue, almost irrespective of the WFE level. 
If we look at where we are today, most of it's been industry growth in the, I'll call, the normal products or the regular products and share opportunities has driven our performance relative to the overall plan. The contributions from those products are still to come. We talked a lot about '20 and '21 being opportunities to engage with customers to seed the markets. And that we would start to see more steady state contributions in 2023 from those products. 
So we're still in that same phase regarding those. And in some cases, COVID has made it a little bit harder to engage with customers out in the field to support new products in these -- and to drive new markets. But I think that's still to come. So we've got a higher industry environment that's driven us to where we are today, but those contributions are still to come over the next couple of years. And so we're excited about that. 
And then on the leverage part, anytime you have revenue that's grown what we saw in calendar '20, where we were up 15% as a company. And the growth expectations we now have for 2021, given the industry commentary earlier, any time you drive revenue like that, you're going to drive more leverage through the model. 
So yes, we're outperforming our public model by about 4 points in operating margin today. Do I think that, that's sustainable at 4 points? Probably not. But do I think there's a couple of points for sure sustainability there. I do, just given the strength of the products and the expected mix going forward. 
So yes, we're -- I think, in a pretty good place relative to the overall model. We have to execute, of course, over the next year or so. And we'll have more to say about the future in the coming months and quarters."

KLA's March quarter results demonstrate continued momentum in our business. We delivered strong 27% year-over-year revenue growth.
Non-GAAP gross and operating profit rose 30% and 48% year-over-year, respectively. And free cash flow grew 47% to a record level. We accomplished these by executing our strategic vision amidst a dynamic business environment. Year-to-date, we've seen a sharp increase in business levels across each of our major markets. This is primarily due to secular demand trends driving semiconductor industry growth across a broad range of markets and applications such as 5G and cloud computing.
Our customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investment to address these growth markets while continuing investment in leading-edge R&D efforts.  Against this backdrop of strong demand, we continue to navigate evolving customer requirements and dynamic supply chain challenges. Still, KLA has not missed a beat and continues operating at an exceptionally high level, delivering on our commitments, staying focused on creating value for our partners, customers and shareholders.
We would be remiss if we did not mention that achieving these results would be impossible without the extraordinary contributions of our talented global teams who always rise to the challenges of meeting our customers' needs in an increasingly complex global business environment. Three key things enabled KLA's record results and momentum: one, successful innovation and market leadership; two, the resourcefulness and talent of our global workforce; and three, the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model.
Before we discuss those further, let me begin by touching on how we see the industry demand environment now. Strong secular demand trends continue to shape multiple markets and are fueled by the increasing digitization of end markets and industries. In addition, there's a heightened focus on the strategic nature of our customers' investments around both leading edge development, optimizing facility utilization and regionalization. As a result, our WFE forecast has improved, even further from January, reflecting the strength of demand we're experiencing over the past couple of months, with momentum continuing into calendar 2022.
And in this environment, KLA is experiencing a sharp increase in customer demand for systems and support for 2021 deliveries. And our expectations for KLA revenue growth have increased from our initial assessment in January. This momentum in customer investment is happening against a backdrop where process control intensity maintains its momentum and KLA continues to drive market leadership at levels approximately 4x the nearest competitor. Propelled by the upside we're experiencing in the underlying WFE markets, KLA market leadership, increasing long-term process control intensity, our broader reach into electronics ecosystem and the contributions of our large and growing service business, KLA is on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of our original expectations.
KLA's market leadership results from the ongoing successful execution of the company's customer-focused strategy, which is based on investing a high level of R&D to drive differentiation with the unique portfolio of products, technologies and strategies that address the most critical process control market challenges. We're pleased to continue to see the success of our efforts being validated by our customers' purchasing decisions. Here are some recent success stories to illustrate the point.
The most recently published Gartner data shows that in 2020, the total optical inspection market grew at a rate double that of the growth rate of the overall WFE market to approximately $1.9 billion, with KLA maintaining our strong market leadership and 83% share of this critical market for process control.
Many already know that KLA is participating in the automotive electronics through our semiconductor packaging and PCB product lines. We're excited by near-term plans to launch new versions of our process control products tailored for the automotive industry. This quarter, expect to hear more about how KLA has positioned our wafer inspection portfolio to help customers drive higher reliability, quality and yield in automotive applications in both 200-millimeter and 300-millimeter production, which will help address some of the reported automotive semiconductor shortages going forward.
Calendar year 2021 is positioned to be the 6th consecutive year of revenue growth for KLA, demonstrating strong through-cycle growth, the success of our diversification strategies and our market leadership in process control and a large and growing contribution from our Services business.
Let's briefly cover the top 5 highlights from the March quarter results. First, we saw continued strength and breadth in foundry/logic demand in the quarter. As expected, memory demand also grew, as memory customers planned for growth in equipment investment in 2021 to meet improving end demand. We expect higher business levels across a broader set of customers in the March quarter, with demand momentum continuing throughout 2021 across major end markets. The strength in demand we're seeing reflects KLA's essential role in supporting our customers' drive to innovate and continue to invest in future technology nodes.
Second, Gartner's recent market share report for 2020 sized KLA's share of process control over 53% for the year. KLA's market share in process control has maintained a steady growth trajectory over the past 10 years. Highlights of the 2020 report show KLA continuing to strengthen our core franchise in optical inspection and strong momentum against e-beam inspection and optical metrology. Increasing investment in leading-edge foundry/logic accelerated adoption of the EUV continues to be major factors driving equipment spending.
KLA's market leadership once again demonstrates the success of our portfolio approach to solving complex customer requirements at the leading edge. Third, our Services revenue was $428 million in the March quarter or 24% of total sales, with over 75% of Services revenue in our Semiconductor Process Control segment resulting from recurring contract agreements. Services is on track for another strong double-digit growth year, driven by our growing installed base, higher utilization rate and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and the EPC group. Our Semi Process Control service business revenue continues to grow faster than the rate of the installed base, growing approximately 2.8x faster over the last 5 years.
Fourth, this was another growth quarter for our Electronics, Packaging and Components, or EPC group, highlighted by record quarterly bookings for the semiconductor -- the specialty semiconductor business. Growth was driven by automotive, 5G, wireless connectivity and advanced packaging applications across various end markets. With EPC, KLA is now providing a more comprehensive and broader product portfolio across fast growing new markets in the electronics value chain such as RF, automotive semiconductors and advanced packaging. As it relates to EPC's opportunities in advanced packaging markets, KLA is strengthening our engagement with the top 5 semiconductor market leaders in packaging, and we're expanding our reach with OSATs. KLA is ramping our investment in advanced packaging market to drive adoption of new technologies in this exciting growth market in addition to new inspection products for high level production and assembly. 
Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, in the March quarter, we repurchased $273 million of our common stock and paid $139 million in dividends for a total capital return of $412 million or 71% of free cash flow of $585 million, which was also a record. Last July, KLA's Board of Directors authorized the 11th consecutive annual dividend increase to a yearly run rate of $3.60 per share. Since its inception in 2006, KLA's dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15%. We believe KLA's track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders.
Before Bren gets into greater details of our financial highlights, let me recap. KLA's March 2021 results demonstrate the critical nature of KLA's products and services and enabling the digital transformation of our lives, the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation. KLA is exceptionally well positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding customer requirements, balancing sensitivity and throughput. Semiconductor and electronics landscape is constantly changing. We're seeing broadening customer interest, driven by more technology innovation than ever before at the leading edge.
We believe there are multiple secular factors driving industry demand, and KLA will continue to benefit from and position us to exceed our 2023 financial targets, reach them earlier than anticipated. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long-term operating leverage should provide robust cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to our shareholders.
And with that, I'll pass the call over to Bren."

Results this quarter highlighted the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation.
Total revenue in the March quarter was $1.8 billion, at the top of the guided range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.9%, above the midpoint of the guided range, as stronger revenue and favorable product mix drove upside in the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.85, at the upper end of the guided range. GAAP EPS was $3.66.
Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $407 million, including $239 million of R&D expense and $168 million of SG&A. At KLA, technical application support for our customers is included in SG&A and was $42 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D expense and technical applications represents about 70% of total operating expenses.
Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was very strong at 40.4%. Given higher revenue expectations for the remaining 3 quarters of 2021, product development requirements, particularly in programs supporting next-generation reticle inspection capabilities, regionalization of additional customer engagement resources and increased investment in our infrastructure globally, particularly in expanding our manufacturing footprint and completing our new HQ2 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $412 million in the June quarter.
We are budgeting quarterly operating expenses to increase sequentially $3 million to $5 million a quarter over the near-term horizon. Given top line expectations for 2021 and fueled by double-digit growth over the past 2 years, we expect that the business will continue to outperform our target operating model, both in terms of overall profitability and operating margin leverage.
Non-GAAP net income was $598 million. GAAP net income was $567 million. Cash flow from operations was $646 million. And free cash flow was $585 million. This resulted in a free cash flow conversion of nearly 100% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of over 32%.
Our segment revenue was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in our Semiconductor Process Control business. The EPC group delivered results mostly in line with our model heading into the quarter. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business was $1.51 billion, a sequential quarterly increase of 9% and up 28% compared with March of last year. The approximate semiconductor customer mix was as follows: foundry/logic was strong as expected at 69%. And memory was 31%. In memory, the business was split roughly 55% NAND and 45% DRAM.
Revenue for the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment in March was $92 million, up 1% sequentially and up 8% over the prior year. Demand in this segment was driven by growth in RF, power and advanced packaging. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $205 million, up 14% sequentially and up 28% year-over-year, with mobility markets driving strength in advanced PCB and finished component inspection.
Revenue by major product category and region are both broken out in the shareholder letter in slides. From a balance sheet perspective, KLA ended the quarter with $2.4 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies.
In terms of cash flow and capital returns, Rick already covered the highlights. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. While circumstances can change, our current expectation is that our capital returns profile for calendar '21 will exceed 85% of the expected free cash flow.
As it relates to guidance, our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook has expanded further from our view in January, where we characterized the WFE market to grow in the low teens, plus or minus a few points. We are revising up our view for the WFE market to grow on a percentage basis in the low to mid 20s, with a bias to the upside in calendar '21 from approximately $61 billion in 2020, reflecting the strengthening of demand we have experienced over the past couple of months across all segments.
Also, at earnings in January, we provided a high-level outlook of business levels being roughly flat quarter-to-quarter for calendar year '21. As we look ahead, based on the strength of our current backlog, sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters, along with expected product lead times, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. As a result, we would expect the company revenue to continue to improve sequentially quarter-to-quarter throughout the remainder of the calendar year, with the second half growing versus the first half, as more KLA manufacturing capacity comes online to support this robust customer demand environment.
This growth is fueled principally by our Semiconductor Process Control business. This business is positioned well in terms of expected performance in 2021 relative to the overall WFE market.
Our June quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be in a range of $1.855 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Foundry/logic is forecasted to be about 68%. And memory is expected to be approximately 32% of Semi Process Control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 60% of the segment mix. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61% to 63%, as product mix expectations normalize in the June quarter. Based on increased revenue volume and product mix expectations for 2021, we are now modeling gross margin to be between 62% and 62.5% for the calendar year.
While in any given quarter the mix of our business will affect our gross margin results, the structural trends, both in terms of product cost and product positioning, remain compelling in our sustainable tailwinds going forward. Other model assumptions include, non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $412 million, interest and other expense of approximately $40 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%.
Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $3.20 to $4.08 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $3.47 to $4.35. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 154.5 million shares.
In closing, the industry dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling, with solid demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes. We are encouraged by the strength of the leading indicators of our business. And our customers' multiyear plans for continued investment.
KLA is executing well, and we have continued confidence that we are on track to both exceed our 2023 financial targets and achieve it sooner than anticipated on the strength of higher industry demand. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive moat, strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin?"

So we feel pretty good not only about the growth of the overall industry, but the positioning of the Semi Process Control segment against that industry growth and expectations.

From a competitive standpoint, we also expect to be able to continue the plan we laid out in 2020 -- 2019, which is to increase our overall position of process control as we have in the last couple of years. And we think that continues based on the strength of our product portfolio and the engagement we have with our existing customers.
There's no question that there's always going to be competition out there. But if you look at the history of the Gartner data, as we highlighted, over time, KA has consistently been successful in leveraging our strategies to build on our market position and gain share. And we don't see anything about the current competitive environment that will change that. We do have some major products to deliver in terms of -- in areas like reticle inspection, but -- and that's happening this year. But we're very pleased with the performance of our optical inspection. And we're also very encouraged by the recent success of our e-beam offerings that we really got back in those segments in the last year or so.
So we feel good about our competitive position. And as you might imagine, it kind of shows up in our gross margin in terms of the strength of our business and our competitive position. That we're able to continue to have the kind of margin profile that we have, despite the fact that we've added EPC, which overall, at a corporate level, you know, was dilutive to the margins that KLA had prior to that.

So when you look back at the March quarter, most of the growth sequentially in the quarter came from the Semi Process Control business. And as Rick just mentioned, that's a richer business for us overall. So that, combined with the upside in the quarter in terms of incremental revenue, is what drove the margins up to where they were. It's a little bit lower as we look at the June quarter. It's still in line with the kind of guidance that we've been providing at 62%, plus or minus. So we're mostly in line with that.
As we look at quarter-to-quarter, we do have some sequential growth in EPC. And so that's dilutive from that standpoint. But in general, I think that the margin drivers structurally are all pretty solid. We're seeing nice leverage overall in the business from the activities, the strength of the business and the activities in our factory. So we're seeing good efficiencies there.
And then over the course of the year, I think just given directionally where it's moving, as I mentioned last quarter, I thought it was 61.5% to 62% for the year. Certainly, the stronger outlook in terms of top line, but also just the drivers underneath in terms of what we're expecting from certain products. I think we're in line with that sort of 62% to 62.5% that I talked about in our prepared remarks.
And given the strength in the business overall, probably more bias to the upper end of that range. So I think that there's sustainable traction in these areas, particularly around certain products.

I think the -- I'm not certain of this, but I think the fastest growing product in metrology and inspection, I'm pretty certain, was our GEN5 over the last couple of years. And the strength of that is driven by its ability to satisfy the needs that we have for inspection measurement with EUV, specifically around print down and also the advanced nodes. 
There's nothing that we're seeing that indicates the percent of inspection and metrology budget is dramatically increasing toward e-beam. In fact, if anything, it's always been the challenge to drive the optical at a higher rate, because the price performance is so much higher.
I'd also say that the people that are closest to having a multi-beam -- e-beam solution are KLA. We're the ones that have it that we're developing and introducing in the reticle space, which is, I think, where it's needed the most. So we don't really see any inflection. We don't see a change in the market share dynamic. And if anything, the challenge the brand and the operations team have is satisfying the increased demand around the optical portfolio that we have, specifically GEN5, but also GEN4, which hasn't slowed down. So I don't buy the thesis that this is the transition.
It hasn't been for years, and the reason is because optical keeps getting better. And it's really difficult to make an e-beam tool that's fast enough to satisfy most of the inspection requirements. In terms of pointing e-beam, pointing optical with e-beam, that's not a new idea. That's been around quite a while. And at KLA, we introduced that concept when we introduced our e-beam inspection tool and talked about it at our Analyst Day. That just allows those tools to be functional and to continue to provide value. So I don't think that transition is happening.
I think just in terms of overall growth rates, right? So we talked about the accelerated growth relative to market in 2020. And I would expect this business to grow faster than market again in 2021. So I think that the good thing about the complementary nature of our e-beam solutions with our optical is driving higher relevancy and use case application across the optical inspection, which is the large market, right? That's the market that's $2 billion-plus in terms of opportunities. So it gives you some perspective on the strategy overall, but there's an inflection here that's validating, I think, the relevancy of optical inspection in a lot of different ways."

But I just don't think -- I think there's going to be a mix and match. And the percent of layers that could be inspected by e-beam is never going to be as high as what could be expected by optical, especially since GEN5 is still in the early iterations. We have more capability  to add to GEN5. We've been adding -- have for a while added AI capability to that.
So I think in general, yes, we have a good e-beam solution, but our modeling doesn't show that, that's going to be the increased percentage of the use case, because optical can satisfy -- especially GEN5 can satisfy the needs that are going to be through the 2020s even past when we get the high-NA EUV. And remember, that's only a percentage of the layers that are going to be subject to that. So I don't think we're going to see this transition to e-beam.
I think incumbency for KLA has really been based on our ability to keep delivering new capability to the market, not so much because we've been there, but our newest products, which is why we invest so heavily in R&D and the application support for our customers. So I don't think it's going to transition. We'd be fine if it did, but I think it's a better price performance for our customers to have as many layers be done optically as possible, because the throughput capability is just so much better in optical than it is in any form of e-beam."

Now we don't know what WFE is going to actually be this year, but if that's what process control -- that's just based on the conversations we're having right now. Ahmad Khan who runs that business is in calls almost 3 times a week talking about slots and support for customers across this portfolio. I get pulled into them occasionally. But that's the conversation is how can we support that.
And when we model it, we look at that business, and we think it's going to be a very strong grower this year. Could the WFE numbers change? Yes, of course. What's it driven on your other question, C.J., it's -- of course, it's driven by the increased investment people have in the advanced design rules. It's not a secret that TSM has talked about dramatically increasing their CapEx this year, and we know what Intel has said publicly.
But it's not just that. We're seeing increased commitment in conversation from the memory manufacturers who want that capability too.

So I try to show our work here, how we're thinking about it. If you look at 2020, KLA's performance was pretty much in line with the market. If you went from $52 billion, $53 billion in 2019 to 2020 at $61 billion, that's about 16% overall. And if you look at Semi PC equipment, it was in that ballpark.
So as we look at this year, as I said earlier, if you're looking at $75 billion plus, I think that's where the industry is against the $61 billion baseline, then you're like in the mid-20s to our prepared remarks. And against that backdrop, I would expect Process Control to do very well.
And so we'll see how it goes. I'm not going to guide the second half. Certainly, we would expect the second half to be stronger in that business overall.

Would love to hear -- you guys typically run your business to roughly 7-month backlog. Has that extended? And I guess, what -- how should we be thinking about the timing of bringing on capacity implications to the model, either gross margins or OpEx, if at all? And if your lead times are extending beyond that kind of 7-month time frame, do you have visibility now into the first half of '22?"

Now our products do vary. Some have very long lead times, where you're looking at some of our high-end systems, the timing to procure and optical components and then polish and grind optics can take some time. So for some of those products, the lead times are significantly longer. I'd say today, if you aggregate it across the company, we're a little bit longer than we'd like to be. So we'd like to target somewhere in that 5 to 6, and we're probably somewhere in that 7 to 8 range as we look at it today.
And capacity is coming online really across the board. We're adding people into all of our factories. We've been doing that since we started to see the business inflect in November in a meaningful way. We're adding capacity in terms of space in all of our major factories around the world. And we're working very closely with our suppliers. Suppliers have been great in supporting our ramp so far. They're adding and investing, and we're investing in them in a lot of cases.
So I would expect that given the guidance, the growth we're expecting in the second half will happen as a result of incremental capacity, and we can continue to work that. So I think given the expectations around 6 months of -- in terms of our lead time, we can continue to add to what we have to support whatever environment we're facing. 
At the end of the day, KLA doesn't lose business because we can't deliver. So we also will move things around as needed to be able to support our customers. And we do a lot from a tactical point of view to try to shorten cycle times, adding shifts, all the little things you can do to pull in and cut days out of the lead time.
So all those activities are ongoing. And I think that as we execute against that into the second half, I think it creates opportunities for us to deliver to the expectations we have right now, but also to support upside if it presents itself. And I don't see any reason why -- it seems to be sustaining even as we move beyond, right, in terms of -- I don't see anything falling off anytime soon."

So now it's really firing on all cylinders. And so we're seeing really, really strong growth across EPC in terms of supporting both the continuing momentum in 5G, but also now automotive.

There's a lot of Process Control work that goes on early on when we're doing R&D and development with our customers. And there's definitely an increased sensitivity to the number of layers that they have to qualify. And that drives multiple markets. But obviously, ensuring the quality of the reticles and when they're printed that the high-quality is there, now it's across more layers. So that drives adoption of GEN5. Also just more sensitivity to smaller defects.
So in general, that shifts the dynamic, if you thought about a blend between GEN4 and GEN5, which GEN4 is still very active as a product line. This will shift it more in those advanced nodes to a higher percentage of those tools being GEN5 tools and the next-generation or iterations on GEN5 as we move forward.
I think we mentioned in the past, GEN5 is very early in its product life cycle. And there are a number of additional capabilities that will be added to it to support advance. So those are just 2 areas. There'll be others in terms of the metrology challenges. But in general, the process control challenges as we move forward, especially on advanced design rules, will increase. And we're seeing that play out right now in development."

Patrick, thanks for not making me feel old. I think every cycle, as I'm sure you've heard, is different. One of the things that we learned early on, though, is to look at the -- follow the money and figure out how profitable your customers are and what is sustainable. And I go back to periods where I remember companies that were spending 2x their CapEx was twice the size of their revenue. And you just knew that couldn't last, right?
So when we look at the supply chain -- now one of the leading indicators we always look at is profitability of our customers. And it's universally good. I mean there are some examples where customers are investing, and we see this in China, where they don't have a revenue base to support the investment, but those are viewed as strategic investments. But the percent of that, that's in the industry right now is really low. And so it's the growth of the semiconductor industry broadly with all the different drivers, the number of players that have maintained their profitability through these cycles and the fact that, that gives us confidence in the sustainability.
I don't think we're going to see growth rate that's 25%, 30%. We're talking about what it might be this year. That's not going to be the long-term growth rate. I think there's a step-up to get to support these new drivers. And I would imagine it resumes its growth at a more reasonable upper single-digit kind of level for the equipment industry as we kind of model. But the step-up is consistent with the multiple drivers.
As Bren mentioned, we have a lot of leverage in terms of being able to utilize our facilities. But even that, given that we're investing right now to make sure we've got additional people, parts and space, as Bren said, so that we could support the ramps that we're seeing. I do think this is a step-up. I think we've seen it in the past. And I think the business is sustainable.
I don't think 30% growth will happen for several years in a row. But if it did, we'd be there to support it. So we feel really good about where we are. And more importantly, the investments we're making in our capability are enabling our customers to achieve their objectives, and that's really the key to our continued success is make sure we're staying relevant with our customers.

As we look forward, and I know process control does get a, I guess, a good look at a lot of next-generation process technologies and manufacturing. You mentioned about EUV increasing layers and the adoption of GEN5.
As you look forward to foundry/logic, you have the EUV increasing layers, but you also have in a few nodes the transition to gate all around to nanowires, nanoribbons. Qualitatively, from a process control standpoint, I know it's very early, which do you see out of the EUV increasing layers and the transition to the new transition structures, which do you see as a larger incremental opportunity for KLA?"

Just so you know, we do have a group inside of KLA that models out the advanced technology designs. We have some really talented people that we think about that years in advance to think about what are the solutions that will be necessary. Data all around is an interesting 1 because there, it's actually an adaptation of GEN4 that's going to be most relevant to solving some of those problems based on the contrast of those devices.
So we think that will be incremental. As I mentioned in the earlier question, you think about more EUV layers, that just drives the overall expectation of higher sensitivity across the portfolio, the increase for more inspection overall and a higher level of sensitivity. I tip it toward the advanced nodes driving more intensity than the new structures, but the new structures can't be discounted because if you can't make them successful, then you're not going to be able to ramp those nodes. So -- but I'd say, probably 60-40, maybe even 65-35 that it will be the advanced design rules that drive it more.
And it's not just going to be in foundry/logic because we're also seeing -- even though it seems like they're almost out of gas, DRAM keeps pushing as well to drive the next capability improvement so that they can have competitive advantage. And I don't think that abates anytime soon."

If you look at a modern wafer in a leading fab, they don't have many defects. I mean there are very few. So you need to cover a lot of area, and that's what optical is really good at.
The e-beam ends up being the most valuable in debugging of a new process at the very front end, which is why it's mostly been in R&D. And that's what we're continuing to see. AI has been added to the products. We've been doing that for a number of years. Whatever your definition is, increasing the intelligence, the algorithm that's been KLA's sweet spot for years, and we continue to do that.
So I think -- I don't think that the announcement of 2.5-year-old technology earlier this year was really anything revolutionary other than the announcement. It's not new. And I don't think that the relevancy of what we're doing changes as a result. I do think that increasing the capability of the ML and the AI across all the products in this industry will continue to make them more relevant as we go forward for KLA and others as well.
So I think that's an area we're all taking advantage of. And that will help increase the capability and the learning that the industry has, in general, to be able to move forward. But I don't think this is -- this was not a dislocation. It was not anything new for customers. It might have been new for other communities, but the disclosures and the conversations are not new to customers."

So service, obviously, it's a lower portion of your total rather than your peers. I know that you're never going to be like the films guys, given the nature of their technology, some of their tools eat themselves. So obviously, it's sort of like apples and oranges there. But some of them also are sort of guaranteeing performance and metrics like that, and they're sort of selling that. And I'm wondering what sort of new things you're bringing to bear in service to maybe help your service business start to grow a little faster?"
282225,710591869,2263845,"KLA Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","KLA Corporation","Executives","Yes, Tim, I mean, we -- I think one of the things in service for us is that we have the ability to really customize our offerings for customers, both in terms of response times, in terms of the stocking levels, in terms of uptime commitments and things li",428,"Yes, Tim, I mean, we -- I think one of the things in service for us is that we have the ability to really customize our offerings for customers, both in terms of response times, in terms of the stocking levels, in terms of uptime commitments and things like that. And then given that and given the nature of the contract that we structure -- and it's pretty important for -- when customers buy process control, they buy what they need, and then they have contracts to ensure that the tools are running full out all the time. And they are willing to invest in a contract structure to ensure that we can keep them up and make sure that they match and all those sorts of things.
So it's a little bit different business. Customers, because they don't have as many, they have tens instead of hundreds as they would in a process tool. They don't necessarily have the ability to build the capability internally to be able to do self-service. And so that's a unique aspect of our service business. There's also the complexity of what we offer relative to process tools, which is far different.
So for all those reasons, it does drive a different service experience with customers. And as I said, we customize to meet their operating expense requirements and what they're looking to get out of their fab. And it does drive this 75%-plus contract revenue stream. I think there's always what happens with the new tools in terms of our ability to sell and support service on new tools.
I think where we've seen a lot more engagement with customers is the -- in the trailing edge, where you're seeing higher reliability and quality requirements, particularly, let's say, for example, in areas like automotive, where customers weren't as focused on the process control outcomes as much as they are today with the growth that we're seeing and the increase in reliability that's required.
And given the margin structure in that industry, for example, it's pretty important that you don't under-kill, right, because of the cost of recall and so on. But then there's also overkill too. So there's a lot more process control engagement that's happening through our service business for those customers to support the installed base at a greater level.
So you don't see tools falling off. You see them staying in service. And that's what is probably the unique growth driver that we're seeing today as products are living longer and some of these other markets are inflecting."

So I mean these things move. Annually, it's kind of hard, because there are puts and takes. But competitively, we're actually ahead of plan. And largely, that's driven by the success mainly of GEN5 and what we're seeing in the optical inspection portfolio. That's been the bigger gains. We have new products coming out that will add to that. But our expectation of share growth is actually higher than it was at the time when we did the analyst meeting based on the success that we've had to date.

From a top line point of view, you're right, it's been -- what's driven it mostly has been, yes, we had some incremental share improvement relative to the plan we were on, but just stronger industry growth. We talked a lot -- and part of our theme was, if you will, back for our Investor Day, was to talk a lot about opportunities related to EUV and increasing memory opportunities to drive incremental adoption of process control and KLA solutions.
We talked about reticle inspection requirements for EUV that would affect the reticle inspection tools, but also the wafer inspection tools. We also talked about new markets like e-beam that we were reentering, and then finally, opportunities in memory metrology. So those, in some ways, were going to create incremental revenue almost irrespective of the WFE level.
If we look at where we are today, most of it's been industry growth in the, I'll call, the normal products or the regular products, and share opportunity has driven our performance relative to the overall plan. The contributions from those products are still to come. We talked a lot about '20 and '21 being opportunities to engage with customers to seed the markets and that we would start to see more steady state contributions in 2023 from those products.
So we're still in that same phase regarding those. And in some cases, COVID has made it a little bit harder to engage with customers out in the field to support new products in these -- and to drive new markets. But I think that's still to come. So we've got a higher industry environment that's driven us to where we are today, but those contributions are still to come over the next couple of years. And so we're excited about that.
And then on the leverage part, anytime you have revenue that's grown what we saw in calendar '20, where we were up 15% as a company and the growth expectations we now have for 2021, given the industry commentary earlier, any time you drive revenue like that, you're going to drive more leverage through the model.
So yes, we're outperforming our public model by about 4 points in operating margin today. Do I think that, that's sustainable at 4 points? Probably not. But do I think there's a couple of points for sure sustainability there? I do, just given the strength of the products and the expected mix going forward.
So yes, we're -- I think, in a pretty good place relative to the overall model. We have to execute, of course, over the next year or so. And we'll have more to say about the future in the coming months and quarters."

KLA's March quarter results demonstrate continued momentum in our business. We delivered strong 27% year-over-year revenue growth.
Non-GAAP gross and operating profit rose 30% and 48% year-over-year, respectively. And free cash flow grew 47% to a record level. We accomplished these by executing our strategic vision amidst a dynamic business environment. Year-to-date, we've seen a sharp increase in business levels across each of our major markets. This is primarily due to secular demand trends driving semiconductor industry growth across a broad range of markets and applications such as 5G and cloud computing.
Our customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investment to address these growth markets while continuing investment in leading-edge R&D efforts.  Against this backdrop of strong demand, we continue to navigate evolving customer requirements and dynamic supply chain challenges. Still, KLA has not missed a beat and continues operating at an exceptionally high level, delivering on our commitments, staying focused on creating value for our partners, customers and shareholders.
We would be remiss if we did not mention that achieving these results would be impossible without the extraordinary contributions of our talented global teams who always rise to the challenges of meeting our customers' needs in an increasingly complex global business environment. Three key things enabled KLA's record results and momentum: one, successful innovation and market leadership; two, the resourcefulness and talent of our global workforce; and three, the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model.
Before we discuss those further, let me begin by touching on how we see the industry demand environment now. Strong secular demand trends continue to shape multiple markets and are fueled by the increasing digitization of end markets and industries. In addition, there's a heightened focus on the strategic nature of our customers' investments around both leading edge development, optimizing facility utilization and regionalization. As a result, our WFE forecast has improved, even further from January, reflecting the strength of demand we're experiencing over the past couple of months, with momentum continuing into calendar 2022.
And in this environment, KLA is experiencing a sharp increase in customer demand for systems and support for 2021 deliveries. And our expectations for KLA revenue growth have increased from our initial assessment in January. This momentum in customer investment is happening against a backdrop where process control intensity maintains its momentum and KLA continues to drive market leadership at levels approximately 4x the nearest competitor. Propelled by the upside we're experiencing in the underlying WFE markets, KLA market leadership, increasing long-term process control intensity, our broader reach into electronics ecosystem and the contributions of our large and growing service business, KLA is on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of our original expectations.
KLA's market leadership results from the ongoing successful execution of the company's customer-focused strategy, which is based on investing a high level of R&D to drive differentiation with the unique portfolio of products, technologies and strategies that address the most critical process control market challenges. We're pleased to continue to see the success of our efforts being validated by our customers' purchasing decisions. Here are some recent success stories to illustrate the point.
The most recently published Gartner data shows that in 2020, the total optical inspection market grew at a rate double that of the growth rate of the overall WFE market to approximately $1.9 billion, with KLA maintaining our strong market leadership and 83% share of this critical market for process control.
Many already know that KLA is participating in the automotive electronics through our semiconductor packaging and PCB product lines. We're excited by near-term plans to launch new versions of our process control products tailored for the automotive industry. This quarter, expect to hear more about how KLA has positioned our wafer inspection portfolio to help customers drive higher reliability, quality and yield in automotive applications in both 200-millimeter and 300-millimeter production, which will help address some of the reported automotive semiconductor shortages going forward.
Calendar year 2021 is positioned to be the 6th consecutive year of revenue growth for KLA, demonstrating strong through-cycle growth, the success of our diversification strategies and our market leadership in process control and a large and growing contribution from our Services business.
Let's briefly cover the top 5 highlights from the March quarter results. First, we saw continued strength and breadth in foundry/logic demand in the quarter. As expected, memory demand also grew, as memory customers planned for growth in equipment investment in 2021 to meet improving end demand. We expect higher business levels across a broader set of customers in the March quarter, with demand momentum continuing throughout 2021 across major end markets. The strength in demand we're seeing reflects KLA's essential role in supporting our customers' drive to innovate and continue to invest in future technology nodes.
Second, Gartner's recent market share report for 2020 sized KLA's share of process control over 53% for the year. KLA's market share in process control has maintained a steady growth trajectory over the past 10 years. Highlights of the 2020 report show KLA continuing to strengthen our core franchise in optical inspection and strong momentum against e-beam inspection and optical metrology. Increasing investment in leading-edge foundry/logic accelerated adoption of the EUV continues to be major factors driving equipment spending.
KLA's market leadership once again demonstrates the success of our portfolio approach to solving complex customer requirements at the leading edge. Third, our Services revenue was $428 million in the March quarter or 24% of total sales, with over 75% of Services revenue in our Semiconductor Process Control segment resulting from recurring contract agreements. Services is on track for another strong double-digit growth year, driven by our growing installed base, higher utilization rate and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and the EPC group. Our Semi Process Control service business revenue continues to grow faster than the rate of the installed base, growing approximately 2.8x faster over the last 5 years.
Fourth, this was another growth quarter for our Electronics, Packaging and Components, or EPC group, highlighted by record quarterly bookings for the semiconductor -- the specialty semiconductor business. Growth was driven by automotive, 5G, wireless connectivity and advanced packaging applications across various end markets. With EPC, KLA is now providing a more comprehensive and broader product portfolio across fast growing new markets in the electronics value chain such as RF, automotive semiconductors and advanced packaging. As it relates to EPC's opportunities in advanced packaging markets, KLA is strengthening our engagement with the top 5 semiconductor market leaders in packaging, and we're expanding our reach with OSATs. KLA is ramping our investment in advanced packaging market to drive adoption of new technologies in this exciting growth market in addition to new inspection products for high level production and assembly. 
Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, in the March quarter, we repurchased $273 million of our common stock and paid $139 million in dividends for a total capital return of $412 million or 71% of free cash flow of $585 million, which was also a record. Last July, KLA's Board of Directors authorized the 11th consecutive annual dividend increase to a yearly run rate of $3.60 per share. Since its inception in 2006, KLA's dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15%. We believe KLA's track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders.
Before Bren gets into greater details of our financial highlights, let me recap. KLA's March 2021 results demonstrate the critical nature of KLA's products and services and enabling the digital transformation of our lives, the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation. KLA is exceptionally well positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding customer requirements, balancing sensitivity and throughput. Semiconductor and electronics landscape is constantly changing. We're seeing broadening customer interest, driven by more technology innovation than ever before at the leading edge.
We believe there are multiple secular factors driving industry demand, and KLA will continue to benefit from and position us to exceed our 2023 financial targets, reach them earlier than anticipated. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long-term operating leverage should provide robust cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to our shareholders.
And with that, I'll pass the call over to Bren."

Results this quarter highlighted the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation.
Total revenue in the March quarter was $1.8 billion, at the top of the guided range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.9%, above the midpoint of the guided range, as stronger revenue and favorable product mix drove upside in the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.85, at the upper end of the guided range. GAAP EPS was $3.66.
Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $407 million, including $239 million of R&D expense and $168 million of SG&A. At KLA, technical application support for our customers is included in SG&A and was $42 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D expense and technical applications represents about 70% of total operating expenses.
Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was very strong at 40.4%. Given higher revenue expectations for the remaining 3 quarters of 2021, product development requirements, particularly in programs supporting next-generation reticle inspection capabilities, regionalization of additional customer engagement resources and increased investment in our infrastructure globally, particularly in expanding our manufacturing footprint and completing our new HQ2 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $412 million in the June quarter.
We are budgeting quarterly operating expenses to increase sequentially $3 million to $5 million a quarter over the near-term horizon. Given top line expectations for 2021 and fueled by double-digit growth over the past 2 years, we expect that the business will continue to outperform our target operating model, both in terms of overall profitability and operating margin leverage.
Non-GAAP net income was $598 million. GAAP net income was $567 million. Cash flow from operations was $646 million. And free cash flow was $585 million. This resulted in a free cash flow conversion of nearly 100% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of over 32%.
Our segment revenue was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in our Semiconductor Process Control business. The EPC group delivered results mostly in line with our model heading into the quarter. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business was $1.51 billion, a sequential quarterly increase of 9% and up 28% compared with March of last year. The approximate semiconductor customer mix was as follows: foundry/logic was strong as expected at 69%. And memory was 31%. In memory, the business was split roughly 55% NAND and 45% DRAM.
Revenue for the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment in March was $92 million, up 1% sequentially and up 8% over the prior year. Demand in this segment was driven by growth in RF, power and advanced packaging. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $205 million, up 14% sequentially and up 28% year-over-year, with mobility markets driving strength in advanced PCB and finished component inspection.
Revenue by major product category and region are both broken out in the shareholder letter in slides. From a balance sheet perspective, KLA ended the quarter with $2.4 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies.
In terms of cash flow and capital returns, Rick already covered the highlights. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. While circumstances can change, our current expectation is that our capital returns profile for calendar '21 will exceed 85% of the expected free cash flow.
As it relates to guidance, our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook has expanded further from our view in January, where we characterized the WFE market to grow in the low teens, plus or minus a few points. We are revising up our view for the WFE market to grow on a percentage basis in the low to mid 20s, with a bias to the upside in calendar '21 from approximately $61 billion in 2020, reflecting the strengthening of demand we have experienced over the past couple of months across all segments.
Also, at earnings in January, we provided a high-level outlook of business levels being roughly flat quarter-to-quarter for calendar year '21. As we look ahead, based on the strength of our current backlog, sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters, along with expected product lead times, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. As a result, we would expect the company revenue to continue to improve sequentially quarter-to-quarter throughout the remainder of the calendar year, with the second half growing versus the first half, as more KLA manufacturing capacity comes online to support this robust customer demand environment.
This growth is fueled principally by our Semiconductor Process Control business. This business is positioned well in terms of expected performance in 2021 relative to the overall WFE market.
Our June quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be in a range of $1.855 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Foundry/logic is forecasted to be about 68%. And memory is expected to be approximately 32% of Semi Process Control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 60% of the segment mix. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61% to 63%, as product mix expectations normalize in the June quarter. Based on increased revenue volume and product mix expectations for 2021, we are now modeling gross margin to be between 62% and 62.5% for the calendar year.
While in any given quarter the mix of our business will affect our gross margin results, the structural trends, both in terms of product cost and product positioning, remain compelling in our sustainable tailwinds going forward. Other model assumptions include, non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $412 million, interest and other expense of approximately $40 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%.
Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $3.20 to $4.08 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $3.47 to $4.35. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 154.5 million shares.
In closing, the industry dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling, with solid demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes. We are encouraged by the strength of the leading indicators of our business. And our customers' multiyear plans for continued investment.
KLA is executing well, and we have continued confidence that we are on track to both exceed our 2023 financial targets and achieve it sooner than anticipated on the strength of higher industry demand. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive moat, strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders.

And we think that continues based on the strength of our product portfolio and the engagement we have with our existing customers.
There's no question that there's always going to be competition out there. But if you look at the history of the Gartner data, as we highlighted, over time, KA has consistently been successful in leveraging our strategies to build on our market position and gain share. And we don't see anything about the current competitive environment that will change that. We do have some major products to deliver in terms of -- in areas like reticle inspection, but -- and that's happening this year.

And we're also very encouraged by the recent success of our e-beam offerings that we really got back in those segments in the last year or so.
So we feel good about our competitive position. And as you might imagine, it kind of shows up in our gross margin in terms of the strength of our business and our competitive position. That we're able to continue to have the kind of margin profile that we have, despite the fact that we've added EPC, which overall, at a corporate level, you know, was dilutive to the margins that KLA had prior to that.

So when you look back at the March quarter, most of the growth sequentially in the quarter came from the Semi Process Control business. And as Rick just mentioned, that's a richer business for us overall. So that, combined with the upside in the quarter in terms of incremental revenue, is what drove the margins up to where they were. It's a little bit lower as we look at the June quarter. It's still in line with the kind of guidance that we've been providing at 62%, plus or minus. So we're mostly in line with that.
As we look at quarter-to-quarter, we do have some sequential growth in EPC. And so that's dilutive from that standpoint. But in general, I think that the margin drivers structurally are all pretty solid. We're seeing nice leverage overall in the business from the activities, the strength of the business and the activities in our factory. So we're seeing good efficiencies there.
And then over the course of the year, I think just given directionally where it's moving, as I mentioned last quarter, I thought it was 61.5% to 62% for the year. Certainly, the stronger outlook in terms of top line, but also just the drivers underneath in terms of what we're expecting from certain products. I think we're in line with that sort of 62% to 62.5% that I talked about in our prepared remarks.
And given the strength in the business overall, probably more bias to the upper end of that range. So I think that there's sustainable traction in these areas, particularly around certain products. We talked about the inflection and growth in optical inspection. So anytime you see products like that inflecting, that's going to drive to a richer mix overall for the overall business."

But can you help me better understand the 4x market share advantage that you have in the optical world, how does that position you as we start moving to these new technologies?"

I think the -- I'm not certain of this, but I think the fastest growing product in metrology and inspection, I'm pretty certain, was our GEN5 over the last couple of years. And the strength of that is driven by its ability to satisfy the needs that we have for inspection measurement with EUV, specifically around print down and also the advanced nodes. 
There's nothing that we're seeing that indicates the percent of inspection and metrology budget is dramatically increasing toward e-beam. In fact, if anything, it's always been the challenge to drive the optical at a higher rate, because the price performance is so much higher.
I'd also say that the people that are closest to having a multi-beam -- e-beam solution are KLA. We're the ones that have it that we're developing and introducing in the reticle space, which is, I think, where it's needed the most. So we don't really see any inflection. We don't see a change in the market share dynamic. And if anything, the challenge the brand and the operations team have is satisfying the increased demand around the optical portfolio that we have, specifically GEN5, but also GEN4, which hasn't slowed down. So I don't buy the thesis that this is the transition.
It hasn't been for years, and the reason is because optical keeps getting better. And it's really difficult to make an e-beam tool that's fast enough to satisfy most of the inspection requirements. In terms of pointing e-beam, pointing optical with e-beam, that's not a new idea. That's been around quite a while. And at KLA, we introduced that concept when we introduced our e-beam inspection tool and talked about it at our Analyst Day. That just allows those tools to be functional and to continue to provide value. So I don't think that transition is happening.
I think just in terms of overall growth rates, right? So we talked about the accelerated growth relative to market in 2020. And I would expect this business to grow faster than market again in 2021. So I think that the good thing about the complementary nature of our e-beam solutions with our optical is driving higher relevancy and use case application across the optical inspection, which is the large market, right? That's the market that's $2 billion-plus in terms of opportunities. So it gives you some perspective on the strategy overall, but there's an inflection here that's validating, I think, the relevancy of optical inspection in a lot of different ways."

But I just don't think -- I think there's going to be a mix and match. And the percent of layers that could be inspected by e-beam is never going to be as high as what could be expected by optical, especially since GEN5 is still in the early iterations. We have more capability  to add to GEN5. We've been adding -- have for a while added AI capability to that.
So I think in general, yes, we have a good e-beam solution, but our modeling doesn't show that, that's going to be the increased percentage of the use case, because optical can satisfy -- especially GEN5 can satisfy the needs that are going to be through the 2020s even past when we get the high-NA EUV. And remember, that's only a percentage of the layers that are going to be subject to that. So I don't think we're going to see this transition to e-beam.
I think incumbency for KLA has really been based on our ability to keep delivering new capability to the market, not so much because we've been there, but our newest products, which is why we invest so heavily in R&D and the application support for our customers. So I don't think it's going to transition. We'd be fine if it did, but I think it's a better price performance for our customers to have as many layers be done optically as possible, because the throughput capability is just so much better in optical than it is in any form of e-beam."

What we're loaded right now and what we're modeling that we need to do just based on the orders and the conversations we're having with customers daily is we'll significantly outgrow that. 
I don't know if it will be 38%, but it will probably start with a 3 in terms of what it is. Now we don't know what WFE is going to actually be this year, but if that's what process control -- that's just based on the conversations we're having right now. Ahmad Khan who runs that business is in calls almost 3 times a week talking about slots and support for customers across this portfolio. I get pulled into them occasionally. But that's the conversation is how can we support that.
And when we model it, we look at that business, and we think it's going to be a very strong grower this year. Could the WFE numbers change? Yes, of course. What's it driven on your other question, C.J., it's -- of course, it's driven by the increased investment people have in the advanced design rules. It's not a secret that TSM has talked about dramatically increasing their CapEx this year, and we know what Intel has said publicly.
But it's not just that. We're seeing increased commitment in conversation from the memory manufacturers who want that capability too. So I think the difference between the process control intensity and foundry/logic is still there, but it is narrowing a bit as people push harder on the advanced nodes for -- specifically for the advanced DRAM work that's going, but also some NAND work too.

I don't know what the baselines were for the different companies. And sometimes they don't even share them, so you don't really know when you're thinking about percentages. So I try to show our work here, how we're thinking about it. If you look at 2020, KLA's performance was pretty much in line with the market. If you went from $52 billion, $53 billion in 2019 to 2020 at $61 billion, that's about 16% overall. And if you look at Semi PC equipment, it was in that ballpark.
So as we look at this year, as I said earlier, if you're looking at $75 billion plus, I think that's where the industry is against the $61 billion baseline, then you're like in the mid-20s to our prepared remarks. And against that backdrop, I would expect Process Control to do very well.
And so we'll see how it goes. I'm not going to guide the second half. Certainly, we would expect the second half to be stronger in that business overall.

Now our products do vary. Some have very long lead times, where you're looking at some of our high-end systems, the timing to procure and optical components and then polish and grind optics can take some time. So for some of those products, the lead times are significantly longer. I'd say today, if you aggregate it across the company, we're a little bit longer than we'd like to be. So we'd like to target somewhere in that 5 to 6, and we're probably somewhere in that 7 to 8 range as we look at it today.
And capacity is coming online really across the board. We're adding people into all of our factories. We've been doing that since we started to see the business inflect in November in a meaningful way. We're adding capacity in terms of space in all of our major factories around the world. And we're working very closely with our suppliers. Suppliers have been great in supporting our ramp so far. They're adding and investing, and we're investing in them in a lot of cases.
So I would expect that given the guidance, the growth we're expecting in the second half will happen as a result of incremental capacity, and we can continue to work that. So I think given the expectations around 6 months of -- in terms of our lead time, we can continue to add to what we have to support whatever environment we're facing. 
At the end of the day, KLA doesn't lose business because we can't deliver. So we also will move things around as needed to be able to support our customers. And we do a lot from a tactical point of view to try to shorten cycle times, adding shifts, all the little things you can do to pull in and cut days out of the lead time.
So all those activities are ongoing. And I think that as we execute against that into the second half, I think it creates opportunities for us to deliver to the expectations we have right now, but also to support upside if it presents itself. And I don't see any reason why -- it seems to be sustaining even as we move beyond, right, in terms of -- I don't see anything falling off anytime soon."

And then as a follow-on, I mean, on the EPC business with -- again, with the chip tightness on mature technologies, especially automotive and industrial-focused and tightness in advanced packaging and substrates, I would assume that this would be driving strong demand for EPC's portfolio of products, because they are focused on specialty processes, advanced packaging and PCB.
And I think last call, I think your view was that ex display that EPC would grow 15% this year. But just given the strong demand for analog, RF, power transistors, advanced substrates, PCB capacity, do you guys have a new view of EPC growth for this year?"

And as you know and everybody knows, they hit the brakes part last year when the view of the overall economy was tough. Largely, I'd say that and some other factors, which have contributed to this chip shortage. And so now they're back on. And you're right, that's definitely driving EPC, as [ PGS ] is being driven by that dynamic as well. 
So now it's really firing on all cylinders. And so we're seeing really, really strong growth across EPC in terms of supporting both the continuing momentum in 5G, but also now automotive. And I mentioned in my comments that we're going to talk more about some of the new offerings we're having to support our automotive customers, which we hope will not just help in terms of solving some of their problems, but alleviate some of these shortages as we help them with yield, which is really the near-term the best leverage they have in terms of providing more output is higher yield."

But obviously, ensuring the quality of the reticles and when they're printed that the high-quality is there, now it's across more layers. So that drives adoption of GEN5. Also just more sensitivity to smaller defects.
So in general, that shifts the dynamic, if you thought about a blend between GEN4 and GEN5, which GEN4 is still very active as a product line. This will shift it more in those advanced nodes to a higher percentage of those tools being GEN5 tools and the next-generation or iterations on GEN5 as we move forward.
I think we mentioned in the past, GEN5 is very early in its product life cycle. And there are a number of additional capabilities that will be added to it to support advance. So those are just 2 areas. There'll be others in terms of the metrology challenges. But in general, the process control challenges as we move forward, especially on advanced design rules, will increase. And we're seeing that play out right now in development."

Patrick, thanks for not making me feel old. I think every cycle, as I'm sure you've heard, is different. One of the things that we learned early on, though, is to look at the -- follow the money and figure out how profitable your customers are and what is sustainable. And I go back to periods where I remember companies that were spending 2x their CapEx was twice the size of their revenue. And you just knew that couldn't last, right?
So when we look at the supply chain -- now one of the leading indicators we always look at is profitability of our customers. And it's universally good. I mean there are some examples where customers are investing, and we see this in China, where they don't have a revenue base to support the investment, but those are viewed as strategic investments. But the percent of that, that's in the industry right now is really low. And so it's the growth of the semiconductor industry broadly with all the different drivers, the number of players that have maintained their profitability through these cycles and the fact that, that gives us confidence in the sustainability.
I don't think we're going to see growth rate that's 25%, 30%. We're talking about what it might be this year. That's not going to be the long-term growth rate. I think there's a step-up to get to support these new drivers. And I would imagine it resumes its growth at a more reasonable upper single-digit kind of level for the equipment industry as we kind of model. But the step-up is consistent with the multiple drivers.
As Bren mentioned, we have a lot of leverage in terms of being able to utilize our facilities. But even that, given that we're investing right now to make sure we've got additional people, parts and space, as Bren said, so that we could support the ramps that we're seeing. I do think this is a step-up. I think we've seen it in the past. And I think the business is sustainable.
I don't think 30% growth will happen for several years in a row. But if it did, we'd be there to support it. So we feel really good about where we are. And more importantly, the investments we're making in our capability are enabling our customers to achieve their objectives, and that's really the key to our continued success is make sure we're staying relevant with our customers.

You mentioned about EUV increasing layers and the adoption of GEN5.
As you look forward to foundry/logic, you have the EUV increasing layers, but you also have in a few nodes the transition to gate all around to nanowires, nanoribbons. Qualitatively, from a process control standpoint, I know it's very early, which do you see out of the EUV increasing layers and the transition to the new transition structures, which do you see as a larger incremental opportunity for KLA?"

Just so you know, we do have a group inside of KLA that models out the advanced technology designs. We have some really talented people that we think about that years in advance to think about what are the solutions that will be necessary. Data all around is an interesting 1 because there, it's actually an adaptation of GEN4 that's going to be most relevant to solving some of those problems based on the contrast of those devices.
So we think that will be incremental. As I mentioned in the earlier question, you think about more EUV layers, that just drives the overall expectation of higher sensitivity across the portfolio, the increase for more inspection overall and a higher level of sensitivity. I tip it toward the advanced nodes driving more intensity than the new structures, but the new structures can't be discounted because if you can't make them successful, then you're not going to be able to ramp those nodes. So -- but I'd say, probably 60-40, maybe even 65-35 that it will be the advanced design rules that drive it more.
And it's not just going to be in foundry/logic because we're also seeing -- even though it seems like they're almost out of gas, DRAM keeps pushing as well to drive the next capability improvement so that they can have competitive advantage. And I don't think that abates anytime soon."

And the idea -- it was a pointer for optical back then, and that was in the '90s. So this idea of e-beam directing optical is an old idea. The idea that -- the problem that it has in general, and this is an interesting question, is do you have systemic defects? Can you -- do you really -- can you actually point that.
AI has helped solve some of those problems, but there's still this basic question about coverage. And can you cover enough of the wafers to see enough of the errors. If you look at a modern wafer in a leading fab, they don't have many defects. I mean there are very few. So you need to cover a lot of area, and that's what optical is really good at.
The e-beam ends up being the most valuable in debugging of a new process at the very front end, which is why it's mostly been in R&D. And that's what we're continuing to see. AI has been added to the products. We've been doing that for a number of years. Whatever your definition is, increasing the intelligence, the algorithm that's been KLA's sweet spot for years, and we continue to do that.
So I think -- I don't think that the announcement of 2.5-year-old technology earlier this year was really anything revolutionary other than the announcement. It's not new. And I don't think that the relevancy of what we're doing changes as a result. I do think that increasing the capability of the ML and the AI across all the products in this industry will continue to make them more relevant as we go forward for KLA and others as well.
So I think that's an area we're all taking advantage of. And that will help increase the capability and the learning that the industry has, in general, to be able to move forward. But I don't think this is -- this was not a dislocation. It was not anything new for customers. It might have been new for other communities, but the disclosures and the conversations are not new to customers."

And then given that and given the nature of the contract that we structure -- and it's pretty important for -- when customers buy process control, they buy what they need, and then they have contracts to ensure that the tools are running full out all the time. And they are willing to invest in a contract structure to ensure that we can keep them up and make sure that they match and all those sorts of things.
So it's a little bit different business. Customers, because they don't have as many, they have tens instead of hundreds as they would in a process tool. They don't necessarily have the ability to build the capability internally to be able to do self-service. And so that's a unique aspect of our service business. There's also the complexity of what we offer relative to process tools, which is far different.
So for all those reasons, it does drive a different service experience with customers. And as I said, we customize to meet their operating expense requirements and what they're looking to get out of their fab. And it does drive this 75%-plus contract revenue stream. I think there's always what happens with the new tools in terms of our ability to sell and support service on new tools.
I think where we've seen a lot more engagement with customers is the -- in the trailing edge, where you're seeing higher reliability and quality requirements, particularly, let's say, for example, in areas like automotive, where customers weren't as focused on the process control outcomes as much as they are today with the growth that we're seeing and the increase in reliability that's required.
And given the margin structure in that industry, for example, it's pretty important that you don't under-kill, right, because of the cost of recall and so on. But then there's also overkill too. So there's a lot more process control engagement that's happening through our service business for those customers to support the installed base at a greater level.
So you don't see tools falling off. You see them staying in service. And that's what is probably the unique growth driver that we're seeing today as products are living longer and some of these other markets are inflecting."

But we had modeled 2.5% over the 4 years, and we've gained 2.3% over 2 years. And we believe that this year will be another strong year.
So I mean these things move. Annually, it's kind of hard, because there are puts and takes. But competitively, we're actually ahead of plan. And largely, that's driven by the success mainly of GEN5 and what we're seeing in the optical inspection portfolio. That's been the bigger gains. We have new products coming out that will add to that. But our expectation of share growth is actually higher than it was at the time when we did the analyst meeting based on the success that we've had to date. And then Bren can talk more about the model."

From a top line point of view, you're right, it's been -- what's driven it mostly has been, yes, we had some incremental share improvement relative to the plan we were on, but just stronger industry growth. We talked a lot -- and part of our theme was, if you will, back for our Investor Day, was to talk a lot about opportunities related to EUV and increasing memory opportunities to drive incremental adoption of process control and KLA solutions.
We talked about reticle inspection requirements for EUV that would affect the reticle inspection tools, but also the wafer inspection tools. We also talked about new markets like e-beam that we were reentering, and then finally, opportunities in memory metrology. So those, in some ways, were going to create incremental revenue almost irrespective of the WFE level.
If we look at where we are today, most of it's been industry growth in the, I'll call, the normal products or the regular products, and share opportunity has driven our performance relative to the overall plan. The contributions from those products are still to come. We talked a lot about '20 and '21 being opportunities to engage with customers to seed the markets and that we would start to see more steady state contributions in 2023 from those products.
So we're still in that same phase regarding those. And in some cases, COVID has made it a little bit harder to engage with customers out in the field to support new products in these -- and to drive new markets. But I think that's still to come. So we've got a higher industry environment that's driven us to where we are today, but those contributions are still to come over the next couple of years. And so we're excited about that.
And then on the leverage part, anytime you have revenue that's grown what we saw in calendar '20, where we were up 15% as a company and the growth expectations we now have for 2021, given the industry commentary earlier, any time you drive revenue like that, you're going to drive more leverage through the model.
So yes, we're outperforming our public model by about 4 points in operating margin today. Do I think that, that's sustainable at 4 points? Probably not. But do I think there's a couple of points for sure sustainability there? I do, just given the strength of the products and the expected mix going forward.
So yes, we're -- I think, in a pretty good place relative to the overall model. We have to execute, of course, over the next year or so. And we'll have more to say about the future in the coming months and quarters."

The June 2021 quarter showed continued momentum and strength for KLA. We delivered on our top and bottom line goals and progressed against our long-term strategic objectives. Specifically, quarterly revenue grew",1258,"Hello, and thank you for joining us today. The June 2021 quarter showed continued momentum and strength for KLA. We delivered on our top and bottom line goals and progressed against our long-term strategic objectives. Specifically, quarterly revenue grew 7% sequentially and 32% year-over-year to $1.95 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.43, representing 15% sequential growth and 63% growth compared to the prior year. These results demonstrate strong growth momentum in our core markets, and the operating leverage in the KLA model. We continue to see increased customer demand across each of our major product groups. This demand is related to ongoing secular demand trends driving semiconductor industry growth across a broad range of markets and applications. Our customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investments to address these growth markets and investing in their leading edge R&D efforts.
Against the strong demand backdrop, we are navigating evolving customer needs and persistent supply chain challenges. Still, KLA continues to outperform expectations by operating the purpose and precision and focusing on creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders. This strong execution is led by our talented global teams continuing to go above and beyond, constantly rising to the challenge and opportunities of the marketplace.
I will quickly summarize our view of the industry demand environment. We're in a great position relative to growth drivers that are creating momentum for the industry and our business. As a result, our outlook for the wafer fab equipment industry continues to move higher. We have increased our growth estimate from the low to mid-20s stated last quarter to the low to mid-30s on a percentage basis. This is from a base of approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020. With strong secular semiconductor demand trends continuing, we expect positive industry dynamics to sustain into calendar 2022.
As our business benefits from this increased demand and our customers are also investing in leading-edge node development, fab optimization and regional expansion, KLA offers the leading portfolio of products to solve our customers' challenges. We continue to invest high levels of R&D to ensure we are constantly improving and remaining indispensable to our customers. Specifically, we're prioritizing investment in artificial intelligence and machine learning. KLA's unique capabilities in leveraging these technologies and our product and service offerings to help drive adoption and differentiates KLA against the competition. KLA benefits from long-standing market leadership and high levels of investment in advanced laser, sensor, optics and data analytics technologies that leverage our AI and ML capabilities to identify critical defects in the production process and deliver ever-increasing precision in metrology applications. This investment helps our product and service offerings deliver best-in-class performance lower process variability, higher yields, improved time to market, and reduce cost of ownership for our customers.
Our growing R&D investment is happening as process control intensity is increasing. KLA's market leadership in the process control market remains greater than 4x the nearest competitor as reported by Gartner Research in April of 2021. KLA's sustained performance of process control is augmented by a broader position within the electronics ecosystem through our electronics, packaging and components or EPC businesses, and the contributions of our large and growing services business. For new and long-time KLA investors, it's essential to point out that KLA's market leadership is a result of consistent and focused execution of our company's differentiated strategy.
With this favorable backdrop and our strong execution, we're on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. Let's now move along to the top highlights for our most recent quarter. First, KLA continues to execute well and outperform expectations. In foundry and logic, we see simultaneous investments across multiple nodes, and our customers continue to increase demand forecast. We remain encouraged by the breadth and consistency of investment across our customer base. 
In memory, demand is strong and spread across a broader set of customers. During the quarter, we announced 4 new products targeting the automotive semiconductor market, including patterned and unpatterned wafer inspection and in-line test solutions. KLA's automotive solutions aim to help customers identify and mitigate potential reliability defects in the development and manufacturing of automotive semiconductors early in the manufacturing process, improving device reliability and driving significant value for our customers.
Second, KLA's strong market leadership and optical pattern wafer inspection has helped to drive strong relative growth for our semiconductor process control segment in 2021. In fact, optical pattern wafer inspection is forecast to be among the fastest-growing segments in WFE in 2021 for product segments over $1 billion in revenue and is poised to outpace the overall industry growth by a factor of 2x this year. This follows similar growth and outperformance in 2020.
Third, KLA's flagship reticle inspection business is on pace for a record year in 2021, growing faster than the market and growing our leadership position. As proof of that, we estimate that nearly all the reticles today at 5-nanometer are inspected by KLA systems. Our next-generation e-beam based 8XX mask inspection platform shipped last quarter and has begun customer qualification for applications at 3-nanometer and below. 
Fourth, our services revenue was $444 million in the June quarter or 23% of total sales. 75% of services revenue in our semiconductor process control segment and more than 90% of services revenue in our printed circuit board business is from recurring subscription-based contracts. We believe these are among the highest subscription service rates in the industry. The services business is on track for another year of strong double-digit growth, well above our long-term growth model target. The growth is driven by our expanding installed base, higher utilization rates and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and the EPC group. 
Our Semiconductor Process Control service business revenue continues to grow faster than the rate of the growth of the installed base, approximately 2.8x faster from 2016 through 2020. KLA service business has the advantage of always working in close collaboration with our customers and partners, driving innovation and new initiatives for growth. 
Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, today, we announced that KLA's Board of Directors approved a 17% increase in the company's quarterly dividend level from $0.90 to $1.05 per share. This is the 12th consecutive annual increase in our dividend level, which has grown at a compounded annual rate of 16% since inception in 2006. In addition, we announced a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization targeted for execution over the next 12 to 18 months. We believe KLA's track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders.
Before moving into the financial highlights, let's briefly summarize a few key points. KLA's June quarter results demonstrate the critical nature of KLA's products and services and enabling the digital transformation of our lives, the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation. KLA is exceptionally well positioned with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding customer requirements that balance sensitivity and throughput. The semiconductor and electronics landscape are constantly changing, and we are seeing broadening customer interest driven by more technology innovation than ever before at the leading edge. KLA also delivers enduring value through our commitment to corporate stewardship. We look forward to sharing an update on our ESG vision in our global impact report, which will be released in the coming weeks. 
And with that, I'll pass the call over to Bren."

KLA's June quarter '21 results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs in a robust demand environment while expanding market leadership, growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. Total revenue in the June quarter was $1.93 billion, towards the top end of the guided range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62% and at the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter of 61% to 63%. Non-GAAP EPS was $4.43, above the guided range of $3.47 to $4.35. GAAP EPS was $4.1.
Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $419 million, about $7 million higher than expected, primarily due to engineering materials timing and adjustments to variable compensation programs. Non-GAAP operating expenses included $241 million of R&D expense and $178 million of SG&A. At KLA's technical application support for our customers is included in SG&A that was $44 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D expense and technical application represents about 70% of total operating expenses.
KLA innovation is fundamental to our go-to-market strategy focused on differentiated solutions. R&D is at the heart of KLA and remains a key element in driving our portfolio strategy and product differentiation. This in turn helps sustain our technology and market leadership. Non-GAAP operating income was very strong at 40.2%. 
Given higher revenue expectations for the second half of '21, product development requirements, ongoing regionalization of additional customer engagement resources and increased investment in our global infrastructure due to overall business volume, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $430 million in the September quarter. Going forward, we will continue to size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a multi-quarter horizon.
Other income and expense in the June quarter net was $11 million, reflecting the gain on an investment in a strategic supplier that recently completed an initial public offering. This gain represented $0.15 of earnings per share at the company's tax planning rate of 13.5%. You should continue to model other income and expense net at approximately $43 million per quarter. The quarterly adjusted effective tax rate was 10.4%, reflecting the benefit of favorable audit adjustments recognized in the period. Non-GAAP net income was $684 million, GAAP net income was $633 million. Cash flow from operations was $466 million, and free cash flow was $410 million.
The company had approximately 154 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at quarter end. 
Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $1.581 billion, a sequential quarterly increase of 5% and also up 37% compared with June of last year. The approximate Semiconductor Process Control customer segment mix was in line with our forecast from April, as foundry logic was 68% and memory was 32%. In memory, the business was split roughly 34% NAND and 66% DRAM.
Revenue for Electronics, Packaging, and Components Group hit a record in the quarter, driven by continued strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure, as well as rising demand in automotive. More specifically, the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment generated revenue of $98 million, up 7% sequentially and down 2% over the prior year. Demand in this segment was mostly driven by growth in the automotive power semiconductor applications, where we have a leading position in edge and deposition products. Specialty Semiconductor Processes' performance, was also highlighted by the second straight quarter of record bookings. PCBs, display and component inspection revenue was $247 million, up 20% sequentially and up 22% year-over-year with the data center driving strength in advanced PCB and packaging inspection.
KLA ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in total cash, total debt of almost $3.5 billion. And a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. We were also pleased to see Moody's upgrade our debt rating in early June to A2 from BAA1, further underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and sustainability of our business and financial performance.
We have tremendous confidence in our business over the long run and are committed to a long-term strategy of cash returns to shareholders. Executing a balanced approach split between dividends and share repurchases, targeting long-term returns of at least 70% of free cash flow generated. Our announcement today of our 12th consecutive annual increase in the dividend and the additional share repurchase authorization are representative of our explicit approach and strong track record of predictable and productive capital deployment.
Over the last 12 months, KLA returned $1.5 billion to shareholders, including $559 million in dividends paid and $939 million in share repurchases. While circumstances can change, our current expectation remains that our capital returns for calendar '21 will exceed 85% of expected free cash flow.
KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion and strong free cash flow margins across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. During the quarter, we generated $410 million in free cash flow and repurchased $300 million of common stock, while also paying $139 million in dividends. 
Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook continues to increase from our views earlier in the year. At the start of this year, we characterized the expected growth of the WFE market to be in the low teens, plus or minus a few percentage points. In April, we revised that view to the low to mid-20s on a percentage basis with a bias to the upside. Today, we see further improvement and expect the WFE market to grow in the low to mid-30s from approximately $61 billion in calendar in 2020 to approximately $81 billion at the midpoint in calendar '21. This reflects the broad-based strengthening of demand across all customer segments. 
KLA is in position to deliver strong relative growth this year, driven by our market leadership and strong momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms in both the Semiconductor Process Control and EPC groups. Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile. As a result, we continue to expect total company revenue to improve sequentially quarter-to-quarter throughout the remainder of the calendar year. We also expect the second half of calendar '21 to grow in the mid-teens on a percentage basis versus the first half as more of our manufacturing capacity comes online to support this strong customer demand.
Furthermore, our system shipment expectations point to meaningful growth in Semiconductor Process Control equipment systems, the second half of calendar '21. This strong backdrop supports our current expectations of high 30s to low 40s year-over-year percentage growth for the Semiconductor Process Control Systems business in calendar '21. As a result, we continue to believe that this business is positioned to outperform in '21 relative to the overall WFE market.
Our September quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be in a range of $2.02 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Foundry Logic is forecasted to be approximately 59% and memory is expected to be approximately 41% of Semiconductor Process Control Systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 60% of the segment mix. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61.5% to 63.5%. At the midpoint, this is 50 basis points above the June quarter level due principally to product mix. While in any given quarter, the mix of our business across products and business segments will affect our gross margin results, the structural trends, both in terms of product cost, manufacturing efficiency, and product positioning remain compelling and are sustainable tailwinds going forward.
Other model assumptions for September include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $430 million; other income and expense of approximately $43 million; and an effective adjusted tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $3.76 to $4.64, and and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.01 to $4.89. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 153.5 million shares.
In closing, the industry dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling, with broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across multiple technology nodes. We are encouraged by the leading indicators for our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters. Our customers' multiyear investment plans also point to the stability of demand in the future.
KLA continues to execute well and is on track to exceed our 2023 financial targets, well ahead of expectations. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive mode, strong financial performance and long-standing track record of free cash flow generation and capital return to shareholders.
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A."

I think we are seeing a lot of strength in the process control portfolio, driven -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we look at optical wafer inspection and really seeing a lot of uptake on that. What's interesting about that is it's a pretty good mix between GEN4 and GEN5. So both of the -- GEN5 is more exposed, I would say, to the EUV dynamic, but we're seeing more proliferation of GEN4 also as people continue to add advanced capability. And we expected that with the rising complexity really across the board, and it's not just in the EUV areas of mainly Logic Foundry, but also we're seeing it in memory. That's 1 area. 
We mentioned also reticle is having a really strong year as the number of advanced designs continue. So we're seeing both related to EUV, but also just increased process control intensity really across the entire portfolio. So that's why we feel so strongly about the remainder of the year. And as Bren indicated, we're looking into 2022 for that strength to continue. 
Bren, you want to provide more color?"

So there's a lot of inflections around EUV, but also other process dynamics that are driving that. But the introduction of EUV driving shrinks in the business or shrinks in design rules is creating an opportunity for both platforms. And also leveraging optical inspection for validating reticle quality. 
Also at 5-nanometer in the reticle part of the business, you also have increasing reticle complexity. And our offering in that market, after a number of years where reticle complexity wasn't changing all that much. In the double patterning environment as we move to EUV, radical complexity is changing dramatically. And our offering is a more technical offering, and we're getting strong customer interest in that product. So I think there's sustainable tailwinds here through the rest of this year and as we move into '22."

And then on the gross margin front, can you just help us understand the uptick in your gross margins into the September quarter. It looks like component costs are rising. I'm assuming the team also has to pay expedite fees for some parts. And your end market mix is more weighted towards memory, which I would think would have some slight negative bias on gross margins. So it's great to see the team driving the margin profile higher, but just help us understand some of the drivers of that."

So it really is a mix dynamic that is driving the the quarter-to-quarter, the 50 basis point increase. We have most of the growth quarter-to-quarter is coming from semi process control systems. And those carry higher margins than obviously our service business or our EPC business. So that's been the bigger driver. We have supply chain challenges like everybody else, and we're constantly trying to manage our way through those. Freight costs are higher. Those are embedded. And maybe over time as some of those pressures alleviate, we'll get a little bit of benefit from that into the future. But we certainly have that in our numbers and expecting it to remain at that level over the next couple of quarters.
On the component side, there is pressure on components. There's pressure on raw materials for frames and steel specifically for the frames of our tools. So we're dealing with that labor pressures are different around the world. We have factors at different locations, but we're also dealing with that as well. I would expect as we move forward, we'll see some pressure so far. It's been offset by the strength of the volume so we've worked with our suppliers and the volume upside has been favorable, but I do expect we'll see some pressure on components.
The way we price products tends to be value centric. We have a value pricing model. It's not a cost based model, but we're certainly going to have to deal with that as it comes through. At these revenue levels into the future, I would think we're probably looking at 10 to 20 basis points type of impact over time from some of the inflationary pressures on our COGS. But that's contemplated in the guidance we provided in terms of our margin expectations moving forward."

We've been working on what has been, what is now called, AI and ML for years now. And of course, because we handle so much data, in our systems, especially in the optical wafer system but also in the reticle system, that we've been having to manage that data and look for signal in that data for a long time. What ML enables and machine learning enables along with AI is just extracting more information out of that data. So as we continue to have more capability to manage it, our work on AI has proliferated across most of our products now in some form or another, but we continue to add upgrades.
So I think to answer your question, 1 way to think about it is we can squeeze more capability out of existing generations by leveraging the algorithms and the AI work. And in the past, where we may have needed to ship wavelengths for example, to get more capability, we can do that with algorithms. So 1 of the questions that had been brought up in the past was for example, the limitations of optical wafer inspection and why e-beam was going to maybe take a large priority of the share, that was the thesis a few years ago. But it was through AI and through ML and our advanced optics capability that we've actually created additional node capability out of the optical system.
So I think that's another way that we've expanded and lengthened the lifetime of the products. Part of why GEN4 has a longer life now is we're squeezing more capability out of that leveraging.
To answer your other question, it is expanding into our other products. Those are the first really in the work we do at reticle. But it's also driving some opportunities for us in other segments as we expand the leverage of that capability into both metrology, but also some of our traditionally lower end wafer inspection systems that are applying and trailing edge capability. So it's really kind of across the board. And you're right, it's very -- if you can amortize the engineering the way we do, it's pretty accretive to the overall business volume because you're -- we do make a large investment where by far the -- we have the most investment going on. And no question among our peers, because we're doing it across such a broad portfolio, but we're getting leverage as we have multiple products that are leveraging it. So Bren can speak to how that drives the."

Platform extendability is is 1 of the biggest decisions we make in our product life cycle processes. We're making choices, and we can extend platforms. It means that over time, we get a higher return on investment on those engineering dollars. So we don't have to go develop the next one, which is what drives significant cost of the model as you're developing and bringing a new product to market. So by extending it, we see the leverage in our operating margins.
Now in terms of gross margin, software content or software offerings are increasing across the whole company, not just within Semi Process Control, where we have businesses now that are starting to get to meaningful revenue levels where we're selling software directly and we have that there. And we also have it in the EPC business, where we're providing simulation capabilities, data analytics, other computational methods, design based capabilities to help point our inspectors and get more value out of the KLA offerings.
So there's a few dynamics that are there that I think are good for us in terms of solving some of these problems as technology road maps get more and more complicated, but then also driving operating margin leverage over time."

And are addressing some of these automotive and industrial and some of these other more trailing edge challenges. So I would think from a shipment or revenue point of view, we'll see that business actually start to come to the P&L as we move into '22.
China has been mostly Logic centric this year, needed China. And so I think we'll have to see how that plays out as we move into next year in terms of growth. Certainly, there's, I think, sustainability with the business levels that have been elevating through this year. But I would expect to see a little bit more memory activity probably next year in China. And I think that's probably the 1 area where we don't have as much visibility in terms of logic growth there.

There's some cases where we're helping traceability in terms of how they're driving those fabs.
So yes, that's an area we outlined in our 2019 Analyst Day where we talked about, that was a growth area for us, and we believe it continues to be -- obviously, it was a rough start in 2020, where a lot of customers shut down their plants for automotive semiconductor now to their dismay, but those are back on.

How do you see the incremental opportunities as you go to Gateall around where not only are you seeing new materials, but more materials in that transistor area?"
282225,1672702848,2355391,"KLA Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","KLA Corporation","Executives","Yes, it's a great question. As you know, if you saw our business, any of these technology transitions, inflections present opportunity for process control, because the first thing that our customers need to figure out is how to get the process ramped. So",262,"Yes, it's a great question. As you know, if you saw our business, any of these technology transitions, inflections present opportunity for process control, because the first thing that our customers need to figure out is how to get the process ramped. So I think we're seeing advanced indicators that, that's going to be great for adoption of additional capability. It's also where the portfolio really matters. Because in the case of gate all around, adaptation to the GEN4 wafer inspection, in some ways, more important than what GEN5 does. GEN5 is very important for the smaller defectivity that we need to detect and the lower rates, but GEN4 for the contrast, and so some of the development we've been doing with our customers has been to tune our products for that advanced transistor capability. 
So I think that what you'll see is a continued increase in process control intensity. The way we modeled it is relatively modest over the long term, but of course, the cumulative effect is it adds up, and that's why we think process control intensity outgrows WFE on the order of 0.5 percentage point, if we're going from 15% to 15.5%, depending on what the aggregate, that's a blended between Logic and Memory. But we'll see it over time that you'll see it creep up as a result of those new inflections. Provided we have the products to support it, which is a lot of the work that we've been doing.  So we feel like we're in really good position to support our customers to do that."

That's helpful. And my follow-up question, maybe for you, Bren. In terms of the investments you're making, you talked about systems picking up, expanding capacity, bringing people on board to meet the increased shipments. Services are also growing quite rapidly, and you've mentioned that it's growing faster than the target CAGR you're looking at. What are the types of investments you need to make in services, given that not only your semi services growing at the installed base growth, but PCB tends to be a very service-intensive business as well, and that marketplace is also showing signs of some more secular growth trends, given some of the marketplaces that they're penetrating. How do you look at service investments both near-term and over the next few years?"

And certainly trying to get more leverage out of the service businesses of the acquired companies. Acquired businesses for KLA has been 1 of our parts -- a key component of the investment thesis when we look at at these kinds of transactions. And smaller companies have a hard time trying to have the infrastructure just given the nature of their size to be able to support a broad service footprint.
So being able to leverage our infrastructure, how the go-to-market is different. How we engage with those customers is different. So leveraging the infrastructure we have is, I think, a big part of that. So there's a big cost element. We made the investments, I think we need to make. Certainly, China and the investments we made back in 2016 and 2017 to build infrastructure to support the China business is great for us now, and we're seeing scale on that. With some of the regionalization dynamics that are out there, if you see new fabs popping up, we have to build that capability in some new places. 
We think those are great opportunities for us because our customers rely on us to help bring those kinds of facilities up and to bring our capability to help them do that. And so whenever they're building a new fab in a new geography, it creates a big opportunity for KLA. We're working on remote diagnostics, remote capabilities. So we can do a lot more diagnosis of tool problems from back here from the factory or from our development teams, depending on what's happening. One of the challenges in COVID, obviously, has been getting people in and out when we have an escalation situation.
So I think those are the kinds of areas that we're investing. And it's a great opportunity for us just in terms of growth, given the strength of the WFE, but also the lengthening of lifetime on the tools and how customers are using that from a utilization point of view."

So these investments and given the extendability of our platforms and the lifetime of our tools in terms of how we're shipping to a very broad demand environment from a technology point of view, that these are investments that are important for us in terms of just being able to support that kind of environment moving forward, sort of a through-cycle over time statement. But we're continuing to invest to make sure that we have the flexibility to be able to respond to our customer demand. 
So I think that's -- as I look at it right now in terms of the first half of the year in terms of expectations, hard for me to see how it's at least as strong as what we've seen in the second half of '21 in terms of what we see in the funnel and our backlog in terms of how we're managing it.

The June 2021 quarter showed continued momentum and strength for KLA. We delivered on our top and bottom line goals and progressed against our long-term strategic objectives. Specifically, quarterly revenue grew",1257,"Hello, and thank you for joining us today. The June 2021 quarter showed continued momentum and strength for KLA. We delivered on our top and bottom line goals and progressed against our long-term strategic objectives. Specifically, quarterly revenue grew 7% sequentially and 32% year-over-year to $1.925 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.43, representing 15% sequential growth and 63% growth compared to the prior year. These results demonstrate strong growth momentum in our core markets, and the operating leverage in the KLA model. We continue to see increased customer demand across each of our major product groups. This demand is related to ongoing secular demand trends driving semiconductor industry growth across a broad range of markets and applications. Our customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investments to address these growth markets and investing in their leading edge R&D efforts.
Against the strong demand backdrop, we are navigating evolving customer needs and persistent supply chain challenges. Still, KLA continues to outperform expectations by operating with purpose and precision and focusing on creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders. This strong execution is led by our talented global teams continuing to go above and beyond, constantly rising to the challenge and opportunities of the marketplace.
I will quickly summarize our view of the industry demand environment. We're in a great position relative to growth drivers that are creating momentum for the industry and our business. As a result, our outlook for the wafer fab equipment industry continues to move higher. We have increased our growth estimate from the low to mid-20s stated last quarter to the low to mid-30s on a percentage basis. This is from a base of approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020. With strong secular semiconductor demand trends continuing, we expect positive industry dynamics to sustain into calendar 2022.
As our business benefits from this increased demand and our customers are also investing in leading-edge node development, fab optimization and regional expansion, KLA offers the leading portfolio of products to solve our customers' challenges. We continue to invest high levels of R&D to ensure we are constantly improving and remaining indispensable to our customers. Specifically, we're prioritizing investment in artificial intelligence and machine learning. KLA's unique capabilities in leveraging these technologies and our product and service offerings help drive adoption and differentiates KLA against the competition. KLA benefits from long-standing market leadership and high levels of investment in advanced laser, sensor, optics and data analytics technologies that leverage our AI and ML capabilities to identify critical defects in the production process and deliver ever-increasing precision in metrology applications. This investment helps our product and service offerings deliver best-in-class performance, lower process variability, higher yields, improved time to market, and reduced cost of ownership for our customers.
Our growing R&D investment is happening as process control intensity is increasing. KLA's market leadership in the process control market remains greater than 4x the nearest competitor as reported by Gartner Research in April of 2021. KLA's sustained performance in process control is augmented by a broader position within the electronics ecosystem through our electronics, packaging and components or EPC businesses and the contributions of our large and growing services business. For new and long-time KLA investors, it's essential to point out that KLA's market leadership is a result of consistent and focused execution of our company's differentiated strategy.
With this favorable backdrop and our strong execution, we're on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. Let's now move along to the top highlights for our most recent quarter. First, KLA continues to execute well and outperform expectations. In foundry and logic, we see simultaneous investments across multiple nodes, and our customers continue to increase demand forecasts. We remain encouraged by the breadth and consistency of investment across our customer base. 
In memory, demand is strong and spread across a broader set of customers. During the quarter, we announced 4 new products targeting the automotive semiconductor market, including patterned and unpatterned wafer inspection and in-line test solutions. KLA's automotive solutions aim to help customers identify and mitigate potential reliability defects in the development and manufacturing of automotive semiconductors early in the manufacturing process, improving device reliability and driving significant value for our customers.
Second, KLA's strong market leadership and optical pattern wafer inspection has helped to drive strong relative growth for our semiconductor process control segment in 2021. In fact, optical pattern wafer inspection is forecast to be among the fastest-growing segments in WFE in 2021 for product segments over $1 billion in revenue and is poised to outpace the overall industry growth by a factor of 2x this year. This follows similar growth and outperformance in 2020.
Third, KLA's flagship reticle inspection business is on pace for a record year in 2021, growing faster than the market and growing our leadership position. As proof of that, we estimate that nearly all the reticles today at 5-nanometer are inspected by KLA systems. Our next-generation e-beam based 8XX mask inspection platform shipped last quarter and has begun customer qualification for applications at 3-nanometer and below. 
Fourth, our services revenue was $444 million in the June quarter or 23% of total sales. 75% of services revenue in our semiconductor process control segment and more than 90% of services revenue in our printed circuit board business is from recurring subscription-based contracts. We believe these are among the highest subscription service rates in the industry. The Services business is on track for another year of strong double-digit growth, well above our long-term growth model target. The growth is driven by our expanding installed base, higher utilization rates and increasing expansion of service opportunities at the trailing edge and the EPC group. 
Our Semiconductor Process Control service business revenue continues to grow faster than the rate of the growth of the installed base, approximately 2.8x faster from 2016 through 2020. KLA Service business has the advantage of always working in close collaboration with our customers and partners, driving innovation and new initiatives for growth. 
Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, today, we announced that KLA's Board of Directors approved a 17% increase in the company's quarterly dividend level from $0.90 to $1.05 per share. This is the 12th consecutive annual increase in our dividend level, which has grown at a compounded annual rate of 16% since inception in 2006. In addition, we announced a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization targeted for execution over the next 12 to 18 months. We believe KLA's track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders.
Before moving into the financial highlights, let's briefly summarize a few key points. KLA's June quarter results demonstrate the critical nature of KLA's products and services in enabling the digital transformation of our lives, the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation. KLA is exceptionally well positioned with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding customer requirements that balance sensitivity and throughput. The semiconductor and electronics landscape are constantly changing, and we are seeing broadening customer interest driven by more technology innovation than ever before at the leading edge. KLA also delivers enduring value through our commitment to corporate stewardship. We look forward to sharing an update on our ESG vision in our Global Impact report, which will be released in the coming weeks. 
And with that, I'll pass the call over to Bren."

KLA's June quarter '21 results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs in a robust demand environment while expanding market leadership, growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. Total revenue in the June quarter was $1.93 billion, towards the top end of the guided range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62%, at the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter of 61% to 63%. Non-GAAP EPS was $4.43, above the guided range of $3.47 to $4.35. GAAP EPS was $4.10.
Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $419 million, about $7 million higher than expected, primarily due to engineering materials timing and adjustments to variable compensation programs. Non-GAAP operating expenses included $241 million of R&D expense and $178 million of SG&A. At KLA, technical application support for our customers is included in SG&A and was $44 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D expense and technical applications represents about 70% of total operating expenses.
KLA innovation is fundamental to our go-to-market strategy focused on differentiated solutions. R&D is at the heart of KLA and remains a key element in driving our portfolio strategy and product differentiation. This in turn helps sustain our technology and market leadership. Non-GAAP operating income was very strong at 40.2%. 
Given higher revenue expectations for the second half of '21, product development requirements, ongoing regionalization of additional customer engagement resources and increased investment in our global infrastructure due to overall business volume, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $430 million in the September quarter. Going forward, we will continue to size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a multi-quarter horizon.
Other income and expense in the June quarter net was $11 million, reflecting the gain on an investment in a strategic supplier that recently completed an initial public offering. This gain represented $0.15 of earnings per share at the company's tax planning rate of 13.5%. You should continue to model other income and expense net at approximately $43 million per quarter. The quarterly adjusted effective tax rate was 10.4%, reflecting the benefit of favorable audit adjustments recognized in the period. Non-GAAP net income was $684 million, GAAP net income was $633 million. Cash flow from operations was $466 million, and free cash flow was $410 million.
The company had approximately 154 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at quarter end. 
Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $1.581 billion, a sequential quarterly increase of 5% and also up 37% compared with June of last year. The approximate Semiconductor Process Control customer segment mix was in line with our forecast from April, as Foundry/Logic was 68% and memory was 32%. In memory, the business was split roughly 34% NAND and 66% DRAM.
Revenue for Electronics, Packaging and Components Group hit a record in the quarter, driven by continued strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure, as well as rising demand in automotive. More specifically, the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment generated revenue of $98 million, up 7% sequentially and down 2% over the prior year. Demand in this segment was mostly driven by growth in the automotive power semiconductor applications, where we have a leading position in edge and deposition products. Specialty Semiconductor Processes' performance was also highlighted by the second straight quarter of record bookings. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $247 million, up 20% sequentially and up 22% year-over-year with the data center driving strength in advanced PCB and packaging inspection.
KLA ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in total cash, total debt of almost $3.5 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. We were also pleased to see Moody's upgrade our debt rating in early June to A2 from BAA1, further underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and sustainability of our business and financial performance.
We have tremendous confidence in our business over the long run and are committed to a long-term strategy of cash returns to shareholders, executing a balanced approach split between dividends and share repurchases, targeting long-term returns of at least 70% of free cash flow generated. Our announcement today of our 12th consecutive annual increase in the dividend and the additional share repurchase authorization are representative of our explicit approach and strong track record of predictable and productive capital deployment.
Over the last 12 months, KLA returned $1.5 billion to shareholders, including $559 million in dividends paid and $939 million in share repurchases. While circumstances can change, our current expectation remains that our capital returns for calendar '21 will exceed 85% of expected free cash flow.
KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion and strong free cash flow margins across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. During the quarter, we generated $410 million in free cash flow and repurchased $300 million of common stock, while also paying $139 million in dividends. 
Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook continues to increase from our views earlier in the year. At the start of this year, we characterized the expected growth of the WFE market to be in the low teens, plus or minus a few percentage points. In April, we revised that view to the low to mid-20s on a percentage basis with a bias to the upside. Today, we see further improvement and expect the WFE market to grow in the low to mid-30s from approximately $61 billion in calendar in 2020 to approximately $81 billion at the midpoint in calendar '21. This reflects the broad-based strengthening of demand across all customer segments. 
KLA is in position to deliver strong relative growth this year, driven by our market leadership and strong momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms in both the Semiconductor Process Control and EPC groups. Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile. As a result, we continue to expect total company revenue to improve sequentially quarter-to-quarter throughout the remainder of the calendar year. We also expect the second half of calendar '21 to grow in the mid-teens on a percentage basis versus the first half as more of our manufacturing capacity comes online to support this strong customer demand.
Furthermore, our system shipment expectations point to meaningful growth in Semiconductor Process Control equipment systems the second half of calendar '21. This strong backdrop supports our current expectations of high 30s to low 40s year-over-year percentage growth for the Semiconductor Process Control Systems business in calendar '21. As a result, we continue to believe that this business is positioned to outperform in '21 relative to the overall WFE market.
Our September quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be in a range of $2.02 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Foundry/Logic is forecasted to be approximately 59% and memory is expected to be approximately 41% of Semiconductor Process Control Systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 60% of the segment mix. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.5% to 63.5%. At the midpoint, this is 50 basis points above the June quarter level due principally to product mix. While in any given quarter, the mix of our business across products and business segments will affect our gross margin results, the structural trends, both in terms of product cost, manufacturing efficiency and product positioning remain compelling and are sustainable tailwinds going forward.
Other model assumptions for September include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $430 million; other income and expense of approximately $43 million; and an effective adjusted tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $3.76 to $4.64, and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.01 to $4.89. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 153.5 million shares.
In closing, the industry dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling, with broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across multiple technology nodes. We are encouraged by the leading indicators for our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters. Our customers' multiyear investment plans also point to the stability of demand in the future.
KLA continues to execute well and is on track to exceed our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive mode, strong financial performance and long-standing track record of free cash flow generation and capital return to shareholders.
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A."

If I look at the outlook for EUV litho systems, that's set to grow like mid-30% this year. You have a positive exposure here via your wafer inspection systems, but also the strong leadership in EUV mask inspection and print check. I know this doesn't represent your entire process control business, but it's sort of a good proxy. But you guys are guiding your optical inspection, your mask inspection and your overall process control business to grow well above that range. So what are the 2 or 3 dynamics that are driving the strength above EUV adoption? And more importantly, with the visibility that you guys have, how are you feeling about the sustainability of the overall second half momentum into the first half of next calendar year?"

Thanks for the question. You're right. I think we are seeing a lot of strength in the process control portfolio, driven -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we look at optical wafer inspection and really seeing a lot of uptake on that. What's interesting about that is it's a pretty good mix between GEN4 and GEN5. So both of the -- GEN5 is more exposed, I would say, to the EUV dynamic, but we're seeing more proliferation of GEN4 also as people continue to add advanced capability. And we expected that with the rising complexity really across the board, and it's not just in the EUV areas of mainly Logic and Foundry, but also we're seeing it in memory. That's 1 area. 
We mentioned also reticle is having a really strong year as the number of advanced designs continue. So we're seeing both related to EUV, but also just increased process control intensity really across the entire portfolio. So that's why we feel so strongly about the remainder of the year. And as Bren indicated, we're looking into 2022 for that strength to continue. 
Bren, you want to provide more color?"

So as Rick said, I think as we continue through the second half of this year, both those businesses are growing faster than market, as we said in the prepared remarks. In fact, I would think that the optical inspection business is 1 of the fastest-growing markets in all of WFE, if not the fastest. So there's a lot of inflections around EUV, but also other process dynamics that are driving that. But the introduction of EUV driving shrinks in the business -- or shrinks in design rules is creating an opportunity for both platforms. And also leveraging optical inspection for validating reticle quality. 
Also at 5-nanometer in the reticle part of the business, you also have increasing reticle complexity. And our offering in that market, after a number of years where reticle complexity wasn't changing all that much in the double patterning environment, as we move to EUV, radical complexity is changing dramatically. And our offering is a more technical offering, and we're getting strong customer interest in that product. So I think there's sustainable tailwinds here through the rest of this year and as we move into '22."

So it really is a mix dynamic that is driving the  quarter-to-quarter, the 50 basis point increase. We have most of the growth quarter-to-quarter is coming from semi process control systems. And those carry higher margins than obviously our service business or our EPC business. So that's been the bigger driver. We have supply chain challenges like everybody else, and we're constantly trying to manage our way through those. Freight costs are higher. Those are embedded. And maybe over time as some of those pressures alleviate, we'll get a little bit of benefit from that into the future. But we certainly have that in our numbers and expecting it to remain at that level over the next couple of quarters.
On the component side, there is pressure on components. There's pressure on raw materials for frames and steel specifically for the frames of our tools. So we're dealing with that. Labor pressures are different around the world. We have factories at different locations, but we're also dealing with that as well. I would expect as we move forward, we'll see some pressure. So far, it's been offset by the strength of the volume. So we've worked with our suppliers and the volume upside has been favorable, but I do expect we'll see some pressure on components.
The way we price products tends to be value-centric. We have a value pricing model. It's not a cost-based model, but we're certainly going to have to deal with that as it comes through. At these revenue levels into the future, I would think we're probably looking at 10 to 20 basis points type of impact over time from some of the inflationary pressures on our COGS.

We've been working on what has been, what is now called, AI and ML for years now. And of course, because we handle so much data,in our systems, especially in the optical wafer system but also in the reticle system, that we've been having to manage that data and look for signal in that data for a long time. What ML enables and machine learning enables along with AI is just extracting more information out of that data. So as we continue to have more capability to manage it, our work on AI has proliferated across most of our products now in some form or another, but we continue to add upgrades.
So I think to answer your question, 1 way to think about it is we can squeeze more capability out of existing generations by leveraging the algorithms and the AI work. And in the past, where we may have needed to ship wavelengths for example, to get more capability, we can do that with algorithms. So 1 of the questions that had been brought up in the past was for example, the limitations of optical wafer inspection and why e-beam was going to maybe take a large part of the share. That was the thesis a few years ago. But it was through AI and through ML and our advanced optics capability that we've actually created additional node capability out of the optical systems.
So I think that's another way that we've expanded and lengthened the lifetime of the products. Part of why GEN4 has a longer life now is we're squeezing more capability out of that, leveraging it.
To answer your other question, it is expanding into our other products. Those were the first really in the work we do at reticle. But it's also driving some opportunities for us in other segments as we expand the leverage of that capability into both metrology, but also some of our traditionally lower end wafer inspection systems that are applying in trailing edge capability. So it's really kind of across the board. And you're right, it's very -- if you can amortize the engineering the way we do, it's pretty accretive to the overall business volume because you're -- we do make a large investment.  We're by far the -- we have the most investment going on of -- no question, among our peers, because we're doing it across such a broad portfolio. But we're getting leverage as we have multiple products that are leveraging it. So Bren can speak to how that drives the P&L."

Platform extendability is  1 of the biggest decisions we make in our product life cycle processes. We're making choices, and we can extend platforms. It means that over time, we get a higher return on investment on those engineering dollars. So we don't have to go develop the next one, which is what drives significant cost in the model as you're developing and bringing a new product to market. So by extending it, we see the leverage in our operating margins.
Now in terms of gross margin, software content or software offerings are increasing across the whole company, not just within Semi Process Control, where we have businesses now that are starting to get to meaningful revenue levels where we're selling software directly. And we have that there and we also have it in the EPC business, where we're providing simulation capabilities, data analytics, other computational methods, design-based capabilities to help point our inspectors and get more value out of the KLA offerings.
So there's a few dynamics that are there that I think are good for us in terms of solving some of these problems as technology road maps get more and more complicated, but then also driving operating margin leverage over time."

So I would think from a shipment or revenue point of view, we'll see that business actually start to come to the P&L as we move into '22.

But I would expect to see a little bit more memory activity probably next year in China. And I think that's probably the 1 area where we don't have as much visibility in terms of logic growth there. So I think those are the dynamics and how they're playing.
I think in terms of DRAM and NAND, I would expect those to continue to maintain the momentum that we've been seeing through '21."

So I don't want to put a point out there in terms of the revenue guide, but hopefully, you can get there with the details we have provided.
Components are a daily challenge. We are managing across our factories, across our teams, managing our suppliers to be able to deliver the parts that we need. Some components have intrinsic lead times for us that are long-term. And so we have to make decisions, and we've been making decisions to make investments or for that to commit -- make commitments to those suppliers to be able to provide that supply for us as we move into  '22. So it's a challenge. We're working our way through it. I'm spending more time. I've been with KLA for 21 years, and I'm spending more time on supply chain than I ever have and certainly as CFO since 2013. So we're dealing with it. We're making our way through it.

So we've been developing products that have, I would say, our adaptations of existing products that provide additional capability in support of automotive, where as you know, they're looking for more reliability. There's some cases where we're helping traceability in terms of how they're driving those fabs.
So yes, that's an area we outlined in our 2019 Analyst Day where we talked about that was a growth area for us, and we believe it continues to be. Obviously, it was a rough start in 2020, where a lot of customers shut down their plans for automotive semiconductor now to their dismay, but those are back on. And so we do have those products. We're engaging with customers. There's a strong demand for that, and we think that's sustainable, and we think that will continue to grow as more of the automotive players see the value in that and that will just continue to broaden. So we have a segment and a work area that we're focused on that. And it's also where our business that we got through Orbotech SPTS works also, some of the process capability there. So it's more than just inspection. It's broader for us than that.
So it's pretty exciting. It's a good growth area, and I think it's 1 that we'll continue to see progress over the next several quarters."

One is, as more of the big players are focused on packaging as a source of either maintaining differentiation or closing a differentiation gap, there's more investment with larger players that know KLA. And frankly, I think we're getting more seats at the table and engagements with them, because of their knowledge of KLA and their desire to put their bets behind a proven player. So we have capability. We have some products. We're doing some product development, some product adaptation, in support of that. But the technology there is moving. The process control intensity is significantly lower than it is, of course, in the leading edge. But the rate of growth is very fast, the rate of growth in process control.
So I would say we have an abundance of opportunities there to execute on, but it will require us to bring new capabilities. And so we're engaging with our customers in that. And I can tell you, we're getting as much pull there as we are in the front end for capabilities as customers try to accelerate their road map. So we're seeing strong growth as we increase the process control intensity. And it's not just process control. Once again, some of the process equipment we have with SPTS is also being leveraged in that area as well as in our PCB business, which isn't all inspection and measurement.

As you know, if you follow our business, any of these technology transitions, inflections, present opportunity for process control. Because the first thing that our customers need to figure out is how to get the process ramped. So I think we're seeing advanced indicators that that's going to be great for adoption of additional capability. It's also where the portfolio really matters. Because in the case of gate all around, adaptation to the GEN4 wafer inspection, in some ways, is more important than what GEN5 does. GEN5 is very important for the smaller defectivity that we need to detect and the lower rates, but GEN4 for the contrast. And so some of the development we've been doing with our customers has been to tune our products for that advanced transistor capability. 
So I think that what you'll see is a continued increase in process control intensity. The way we modeled it is relatively modest over the long term, but of course, the cumulative effect is it adds up. And that's why we think process control intensity outgrows WFE on the order of 0.5 percentage point, if we're going from 15% to 15.5%, depending on what the aggregate, that's a blended between Logic and Memory. But we'll see it over time that you'll see it creep up as a result of those new inflections. Provided we have the products to support it, which is a lot of the work that we've been doing. So we feel like we're in really good position to support our customers to do that."

And certainly trying to get more leverage out of the service businesses of the acquired companies, acquired businesses for KLA, has been 1 of our parts -- a key component of the investment thesis when we look at  these kinds of transactions. And smaller companies have a hard time trying to have the infrastructure just given the nature of their size to be able to support a broad service footprint.
So being able to leverage our infrastructure, now the go-to-market is different. How we engage with those customers is different. So leveraging the infrastructure we have is, I think, a big part of that. So there's a big cost element. We made the investments I think we need to make. Certainly, China and the investments we made back in 2016 and 2017 to build infrastructure to support the China business is great for us now, and we're seeing scale on that. With some of the regionalization dynamics that are out there, if you see new fabs popping up, we have to build that capability in some new places. 
We think those are great opportunities for us because our customers rely on us to help bring those kinds of facilities up and to bring our capability to help them do that. And so whenever they're building a new fab in a new geography, it creates a big opportunity for KLA. We're working on remote diagnostics, remote capabilities. So we can do a lot more diagnosis of tool problems from back here, from the factory or from our development teams, depending on what's happening. One of the challenges in COVID, obviously, has been getting people in and out when we have an escalation situation.
So I think those are the kinds of areas that we're investing. And it's a great opportunity for us just in terms of growth, given the strength of the WFE, but also the lengthening of lifetime on the tools and how customers are using that from a utilization point of view."

I think given the strength of the WFE investments and some of the end market drivers that we're talking about that we would expect to see WFE grow over the next few years, at least in line with semiconductor revenue with rising capital intensity probably faster than that.
So these investments and given the extendability of our platforms and the lifetime of our tools in terms of how we're shipping to a very broad demand environment from a technology point of view, that these are investments that are important for us in terms of just being able to support that kind of environment moving forward, sort of a through-cycle over time statement. But we're continuing to invest and make sure that we have the flexibility to be able to respond to our customer demand. 
So I think that's -- as I look at it right now in terms of the first half of the year in terms of expectations, hard for me to see how -- it's at least as strong as what we've seen in the second half of '21 in terms of what we see in the funnel and our backlog in terms of how we're managing it. I don't want to make any statements much beyond that."

The September 2021 quarter continued our track record of consistent execution and commitment to outperformance. The company's focus on delivering on top and bottom line goals remained at the forefront of how we run our business. 
During the quarter, revenue grew 8% sequentially and 35% year-over-year to $2.08 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.64, representing 5% sequential growth and up 53% compared to the prior year. These results demonstrate growth momentum in our core markets and the operating leverage in the KLA financial model. 
Customer demand across KLA's major product groups continues as secular trends drive growth across a broad range of markets and applications in the industry. This growth is putting pressure on the semiconductor industry supply across multiple technology nodes. In parallel, leading-edge customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investments to improve their ability to address market demanding new semiconductor capabilities. Against this intense demand backdrop, we are navigating evolving customer needs and supply chain challenges. Still, KLA continues to outperform expectations by operating with purpose and precision and keeping our focus on creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders. 
Now turning to the industry demand environment. KLA remains in an excellent position when we look at the industry demand landscape. Strong secular growth drivers are creating important tailwinds that translate into momentum for our business. As a result, we are increasing our outlook for the wafer fab equipment, or WFE, industry. Last quarter, we estimated WFE growth would be in the mid-30s percent range. We now estimate that WFE will grow to approximately 40% in 2021. With sustained demand trends, we expect positive industry dynamics to continue into calendar 2022 and fuel another year of growth. 
Along with increased demand due to digitization across multiple categories, KLA's business is benefiting from customers increasing their focus on investment in leading-edge development, optimization of fab utilization or established production nodes and regionalization for future fab construction. To address this growth, we continue to invest high levels of R&D to ensure we're constantly improving and remaining indispensable to our customers. 
For example, we are prioritizing investment in R&D for software that enhances the value customers extract from KLA systems, data analytics, advanced simulation and machine learning technologies are driving adoption of process control. KLA's data analytics performed platforms connect, centralize and analyze the data produced by our systems in the field. This creates a network effect that enhances performance across the product portfolio and for customers. 
KLA's breadth of products is uniquely positioned to speed time to results for our customers. We're making investments in these critical technologies as process control intensity increases. KLA's market leadership in the process control markets remain at an impressive level, at an impressive level of 4x the nearest competitor. Thanks to focus on execution and the industry demand backdrop, we remain on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. 
Let's now move along to the top highlights for the quarter. First, we continue to benefit from strength across all major end markets with overall company revenue expected to be up in the mid-30s on a percentage basis year-over-year based on the midpoint of our guidance for the December quarter. While we're not immune to the unprecedented supply chain challenges affecting the electronics industry, we are navigating them as well as can be expected. 
In foundry/logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and rising capital intensity continues to be a tailwind. In memory, demand remains broad-based across multiple customers with growth in 2021 led by DRAM and 2022 is setting up to be a relatively strong year for NAND. Second, our optical metrology business continues to stand out. KLA's metrology revenue are on track to grow meaningfully faster than the WFE market in 2021 after experiencing similar levels of absolute growth in 2020. The optical metrology market is strongly leveraged to EUV and its critical next-generation architectures, including gate all around and multi-stack 3D NAND. Third, KLA's leadership in the largest and fastest-growing segments of the process control market is fueling strong relative growth in our Semiconductor Process Control segment. 
Optical pattern wafer inspection is forecasted to be among the fastest-growing segments of WFE in 2021 for product segments over $1 billion in revenue. KLA's cadence of innovation and new product introduction continues to outpace the competition. Just last month, we introduced our new Voyager 1035 laser scanning patterned wafer inspector, the latest in an extensive portfolio of in-line defect inspection tools for critical process monitoring application and advanced chip manufacturing. Coupled with the Gen 4 and Gen 5 broadband plasma portfolio, KLA's laser scanning systems help comprise the most comprehensive optical pattern wafer inspection portfolio in the marketplace today. 
Fourth, our services revenue was $454 million in the September quarter, up 15% year-over-year. For the quarter, it was 22% of revenue. More than 75% of service revenue in the Semiconductor Process Control segment and over 90% of services in the PCB business comes from recurring subscription-like contracts. Services is on track for another year of strong double-digit growth in 2021. This is driven by our growing installed base, higher utilization rates and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge. 
Finally, the September quarter was exceptional from a free cash flow perspective. We generated record quarterly free cash flow of $795 million, which helped drive last 12-month free cash flow, up 42% year-over-year to $2.29 billion. We also have remained focused on returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and stock repurchase program, both of which are up materially year-over-year, including $563 million in share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. 
In addition to executing against our strategic objectives and disciplined capital management, KLA delivers storing value through corporate stewardship. KLA's values are reflected in efforts to reduce our environmental footprint, provide for a safe and healthy workplace for employees, advanced inclusion and diversity and make positive contributions to the communities where we live and work. 
We published our latest Global Impact report in August 2021. It highlights how KLA delivers lasting values through corporate citizenship. Our journey on this path began when we opened our doors in 1976. We are now expanding our efforts to be more holistic across environmental, social and governance topics most relevant to our business. 
We've also broadened our tracking and reporting to be inclusive of our full global footprint and acquired companies. We continue to build our long-term ESG strategy to focus on reducing climate impact, increasing disclosure and deepening the positive impact we deliver through our business and community engagement. 
With that, I will pass the call over to Bren to cover our financial highlights, outlook and guidance."

KLA's quarterly results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs in a robust demand environment while expanding market leadership, growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. 
Total quarterly revenue was $2.08 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.9% as the various components performed mostly as expected, with upside coming from the higher-than-expected Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue, which enhanced the product mix for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $4.64. 
Our performance reflected the mark-to-market of an equity position in a strategic supplier that negatively impacted non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.06. Without this adjustment, which is reflected in other income and expense on the income statement, non-GAAP earnings would have been $4.70. 
GAAP diluted EPS was $6.96, due primarily to a onetime tax benefit of $395 million, resulting from changes made to our international structure to better align ownership of certain intellectual property rights with how our business operates. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $432 million and included $252 million of R&D expense and $180 million of SG&A. 
Technical applications is a competitive advantage for KLA and drives demand for our products by helping our customers develop solutions that address their complex process challenges. Technical applications is included in SG&A and was $47 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D and technical applications represented approximately 70% of total operating expenses. 
Given the rapid growth of the business over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations for the business going forward, we expect the company's operating expenses to continue to grow as we invest in global infrastructure, systems to scale the KLA operating model, new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion. Furthermore, we, as most companies are seeing a strong labor market driving cost pressure across our global workforce. As a result, we expect operating expenses to grow sequentially to approximately $470 million in the December quarter, and we forecast sequential growth in operating expenses to continue through calendar 2022. 
While operating expenses are trending higher, going forward, we will make the necessary investments to scale our business, while we continue to size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a normalized time horizon. 
Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was strong at 42.2% in the September quarter. Other income and expense net was $52 million compared with guidance of $43 million, with the variance from guidance reflecting the impact of the mark-to-market of the investment discussed earlier. For December, we forecast other income and expense net at approximately $44 million. 
The quarterly effective tax rate was 13.9%, just above our guided tax rate of 13.5%. Non-GAAP net income was $712 million. GAAP net income was $1.07 billion. Cash flow from operations was $864 million, and free cash flow was a record $795 million, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 112%. 
Turning to our reportable segment and end markets. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $1.78 billion, up 40% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially. The approximate Semiconductor Process Control system customer segment mix was tilted slightly more towards foundry logic than we forecasted at 61%, above our 59% estimate. 
Memory was 39%, and within memory, the business was split roughly 61% DRAM and 39% NAND. Revenue for our EPC group continues to be driven by strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure as well as continued demand in automotive. More specifically, the specialty Semiconductor Process segment, which includes its associated service business, generated record revenue of $102 million, up 15% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially. 
PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $203 million, up 12% year-over-year but down 18% sequentially after a record quarter in the PCB and the component inspection businesses in June. For a breakdown of revenue by major products and regions, please see our shareholder letter or the earnings slides. 
Moving forward to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.63 billion in cash, bonds outstanding of $3.45 billion with no maturities until 2024 and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. 
Over the last 12 months, KLA returned $1.73 billion to shareholders, including $581 million of dividends paid and $1.15 billion in share repurchases. While circumstances can change, current expectations are the capital returns for calendar 2021 will exceed 85% of expected free cash flow generated in the calendar year. 
For the quarter, we generated a record $795 million in free cash flow and repurchased $400 million of common stock while also paying $163 million in dividends. 
Moving to our outlook and guidance. Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook continues to increase from our views earlier in the year. At the start of this year, we characterize the expected growth of the WFE market to be in the low teens plus or minus a few percentage points. In April, we revised that view to the low to mid-20s on a percentage basis with a bias to the upside. In July, we revised our WFE outlook upward again to the mid-30s. Today, we see continued strengthening and expect the WFE market to grow approximately 40% to the mid-$80 billion range to 2021, growing from approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020. This reflects the broad-based strengthening in demand across all customer segments. 
KLA is in a position to deliver strong relative growth this year with the semiconductor process control systems business now expected to grow in the mid-40s on a percentage basis over calendar year 2020. This growth profile is driven by our market leadership and strong momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms. 
Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the strength and sustainability of our current demand profile across all customer segments. For the total company, we expect that the first half of 2022 will grow in the high single digits versus the second half of 2021. It is abundantly clear today that demand is constrained by the industry's ability to supply. This pent demand should enable another year of solid growth in 2022. 
While it's too early to put a fine point on our growth expectations for next calendar year, early indications point towards the WFE industry maintaining its growth momentum. Given our bookings momentum and strong backlog, we believe KLA is well positioned to outperform WFE. As in calendar 2021, we are adding capacity strategically across our global manufacturing footprint to drive this outlook and to enable us to support our customers' process control requirements. 
Our December quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.25 billion, plus or minus $100 million; foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 74%; and memory is expected to be approximately 26% of Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 53% of the segment mix and NAND is forecasted to be 47%. 
We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 64%. At the midpoint, gross margin is roughly flat sequentially as revenue volume and product mix improvement is offset by higher expected service and manufacturing costs. Other model assumptions for December include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $470 million, other income and expense net of approximately $44 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.69 to $5.59 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.95 to $5.85. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 152 million shares. 
In conclusion, the tailwinds driving semiconductor growth and investments in WFE continue to remain compelling. Broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across multiple technology nodes are strong and Brazilian trends. We have confidence in the leading indicators of our business including our backlog and sales funnel visibility, which is spurring us to invest in expanding our business infrastructure and the required capabilities to support our outlook. Our customers' multiyear investment plans provide an element of stability in the demand outlook for the future. 
KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and is on track to exceed our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform our industry and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive mode, leading financial performance, long-standing track record of strong free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A."

And we're in the middle of our strategic planning process right now and assessing not just our top line expectations but how to size the company relative to program demands, but also some of the volume dependencies that we've seen. We're also making significant investments in infrastructure. 
So as you got the world coming back from travel, you've got programs, you've got infrastructure investments. Those are all driving what we're seeing. We're certainly feeling pressure as most companies are, as we said in the prepared remarks, around compensation. So that's also a big part of it. 
I'm not going to guide '22 because we're going through that process. But what I would say is that based on how we size the company, we're going to size -- we do expect growth in the company, and we'll size the company based on our incremental margin model, which is 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth. And so that will be a driver for us. 
Certainly, some of this investment is a catch-up, if you will, in terms of the revenue growing so fast over the last couple of years, and it's been hard for us to catch up in terms of just being able to support the business in the way that we'd like. We're also encouraged by the growth opportunities over time, I'll call it the through cycle or normalized long-term growth, and we want to make sure the company is positioned right for that. 
So I'll have more to say about how to size it. I would say that we're going to be consistent with our long-term model. We've been way ahead of the model over 50% over the last couple of years. I would expect us to be in the target range as we think about '22. Hopefully, that helps."

And I think one of the other challenges we're facing is pressure on cost in the in the supply chain. As I think about '22, I do see an impact from incremental costs, probably somewhere in the 75 to 100 basis point level. I do think that that's implied in the guidance that we provided. I'll have a firmer point on it as I think about '22 in the next call as we start to just lay out a more comprehensive plan around the year. But I do think we're operating in the 63% range, and I'll put a little bit wider range than I normally would today. It may be set plus or minus 75 basis points on that based on our early expectations for next year. 
Absent those pressures, I think we'd be very consistent with the kind of trajectory we've seen. Certainly, the mix is more process control centric given expectations for next year right now. But I do think we'll continue to operate within our longer-term expectations of try to drive somewhere between 60% and 65% incremental. But certainly, these cost pressures are real out there. And we're trying to navigate our way through it. 
But I don't think it will change much from current levels in terms -- but I don't think it's going to go up much there. So I think it's -- we're going to be operating and hovering sort of in this area with mix affecting performance in any given quarter."

So what you're seeing is an increase. It's less of a revolutionary one in the sense that EUV is in 5, and so you're going to see expansion of EUV layers as part of 3. So in that way, I think the mix phenomena will change towards some of the higher end tools. 
So for example, Gen 4 for us is significantly outselling Gen 5 in this calendar year because the bulk of the layers that could be done on a Gen 4 system. So as you move to 3, you're going to have more leverage towards a Gen 5 and -- now it turns out, we'll also be improving the capabilities on Gen 4. But I think you'll see it slightly shift. 
Remember, customers are always looking at the most cost-effective inspection strategy that they can have. So you're going to see it there. It will show up in metrology as well because there'll just be more points that will have to be sampled and that will drive utilization and the throughput requirements on tools. 
So Process Control intensity at the advanced nodes does get pushed harder, and we're definitely getting that feedback from our leading-edge customers the need for more capability and capacity to support that. So I think if anything, you're going to see a shift towards some of the higher ASP capability. At the same time, we're improving it. 
But in terms of a KLA market share perspective, we think it's actually positive for our market share. Because most of the time, when we have competitive situations, we tend to be in price competition at the lower end of most of the competition, and this will push things towards higher end which are the tools that we're really well positioned in and that will allow us to continue to our march towards higher market share over time."

And so getting single-digit upticks sequentially quarter-to-quarter in terms of units can have a pretty big impact on the company's overall revenue. 
So we continue to make those investments and work with those suppliers. Obviously, you never know what the future is, but we do have this belief that with semiconductor revenue growing the way it is, capital intensity rising, that this will be a demand for the company going forward. And so whether it's near term or longer term, I'm willing to make the investments to ensure that we can be as flexible and responsive to customers as we need to be. 
We're also carrying more inventory, and that provides a little bit of extra buffer as well around some of these components. Because our volumes are where they're at, some of the more fungible or more commodity-like parts that are out there. Our challenges are probably a little less than some of the other folks out there just because I don't need as many of them. I need them, but I don't need as many of them just because of the level of volume we have. So I think it's across all those things. 
And we feel pretty good that, look, ultimately, our customers are like things sooner if we could deliver to them, but we are managing our way through it, and I feel pretty good about the guidance that we provided here today."

And let me just add 1 perspective where I think actually it differentiates KLA in a positive light relative to our peers in the industry. Because we've always been high mix, low volume, and we have several strategic relationships with key suppliers, as Bren, we've actually always been working the supply chain and making sure we invested in our suppliers so that we had capability because in many cases, where we've been for years and extricably linked to them. 
So when this thing hit, I think we were able to navigate it better, because to Bren's point, we don't need as many. We don't need the biggest volume. And with the critical ones we've had historically strong relationships which we maintained through the different cycles. So that's why I think, again, it's another example of KLA being less volatile in a dynamic market. So that is part of it. It comes with a lot of work, a lot of hard work with our supply chain. But I think we have the trust and relationships with them that when we make commitments, we could follow through on them. 
So it has taken work to do, but I think that's part of why we've been able to scale and we went through the whole period. We didn't stop guiding. We hit our numbers. We haven't missed our performance expectations. And I think largely, it's because of those things."

That's not something that they're going to be able to readily get a third party to service or do it themselves or just wait. So we're engaging when we sell some of the newer capability into these more, I guess, traditional or trailing edge fabs, we provide more services and capability, and that's been part of the value proposition.

And now we're seeing it, as you know, starting to happen in EUV. And everything that comes with that, all the infrastructure that goes with that, all the work that's going to go on to make sure that you can qualify the reticles, even though they have redundancy, there's a huge fear of throwing away. This is a very expensive infrastructure. So there's a lot of work going on already with Gen 5 to make sure that we can help qualify. 
And of course, you mentioned the high aspect ratio devices, you're going to see more -- I think, they've been in a honeymoon period for actually several years, I would say that some of the DRAMs historically, and you didn't see the Process Control intensity grow. This is a real chance for it to increase as a result of the new capabilities that are bringing just EUV, what that brings on. You also have a lot of metrology applications as well. 
So I think we do see it broadly. I don't think it will ever get to the levels of Process Control intensity we see in leading-edge foundry logic, but it will increase probably at a faster rate in terms of growth of process control as we go forward. Assuming the successful deployment of EUV, which right now is certainly what they're working on. 
Just one example of that is in what we're hearing now is for DRAM is that there seems to be no pellicle is going to be used in the lithography. That's the belief right now. And if so, that puts a lot of pressure on print check, which is a very high intensity application for Gen 5. So there would be an example of a new application. I can't remember -- I can vaguely remember, but it wasn't in any decades since we've been doing it on a print check in DRAM. So this would be a whole new application for those customers. 
And as you know, some of them have experienced in advanced logic, so they know what that means. It's at least 1 of them does. So there's going to be some crossover from that. So we're feeling pretty good about where that's coming in terms of shaping up yet another driver for intensity."

KLA September 2021 quarter continued our track record of consistent execution and commitment to outperformance. The company's focus on delivering on top and bottom line goals remained at the forefront of how we run our business. 
During the quarter, revenue grew 8% sequentially and 35% year-over-year to $2.08 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.64, representing 5% sequential growth and up 53% compared to the prior year. These results demonstrate growth momentum in our core markets and the operating leverage in the KLA financial model. 
Customer demand across KLA's major product groups continues as secular trends drive growth across a broad range of markets and applications in the industry. This growth is putting pressure on the semiconductor industry supply across multiple technology nodes. In parallel, leading-edge customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investments to improve their ability to address market demanding new semiconductor capabilities. Against this intense demand backdrop, we are navigating evolving customer needs and supply chain challenges. Still, KLA continues to outperform expectations by operating with purpose and precision and keeping our focus on creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders. 
Now turning to the industry demand environment. KLA remains in an excellent position when we look at the industry demand landscape. Strong secular growth drivers are creating important tailwinds that translate into momentum for our business. As a result, we are increasing our outlook for the wafer fab equipment, or WFE, industry. Last quarter, we estimated WFE growth would be in the mid-30s percent range. We now estimate that WFE will grow to approximately 40% in 2021. With sustained demand trends, we expect positive industry dynamics to continue into calendar 2022 and fuel another year of growth. 
Along with increased demand due to digitization across multiple categories, KLA's business is benefiting from customers increasing their focus on investment in leading-edge development, optimization of fab utilization or established production nodes and regionalization for future fab construction. To address this growth, we continue to invest high levels of R&D to ensure we're constantly improving and remaining indispensable for our customers. 
For example, we are prioritizing investment in R&D for software that enhances the value customers extract from KLA systems. Data analytics, advanced simulation and machine learning technologies are driving adoption of process control. KLA's data analytics performed platforms connect, centralize and analyze the data produced by our systems in the field. This creates a network effect that enhances performance across the product portfolio and for customers. 
KLA's breadth of products is uniquely positioned to speed time to results for our customers. We're making investments in these critical technologies as process control intensity increases. KLA's market leadership in the process control markets remain in impressive level -- at an impressive level of 4x the nearest competitor. Thanks to focus on execution and the industry demand backdrop, we remain on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. 
Let's now move along to the top highlights for the quarter. First, we continue to benefit from strength across all major end markets with overall company revenue expected to be up in the mid-30s on a percentage basis year-over-year based on the midpoint of our guidance for the December quarter. While we're not immune to the unprecedented supply chain challenges affecting the electronics industry, we are navigating them as well as can be expected. 
In foundry/logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and rising capital intensity continues to be a tailwind. In memory, demand remains broad-based across multiple customers with growth in 2021 led by DRAM and 2022 is setting up to be a relatively strong year for NAND. Second, our optical metrology business continues to stand out. KLA's metrology revenue is on track to grow meaningfully faster than the WFE market in 2021 after experiencing similar levels of absolute growth in 2020. The optical metrology market is strongly leveraged to EUV and its critical next-generation architectures, including gate all around and multi-stack 3D NAND. Third, KLA's leadership in the largest and fastest-growing segments of the process control market is fueling strong relative growth in our Semiconductor Process Control segment. 
Optical pattern wafer inspection is forecasted to be among the fastest-growing segments of WFE in 2021 for product segments over $1 billion in revenue. KLA's cadence of innovation and new product introduction continues to outpace the competition. Just last month, we introduced our new Voyager 1035 laser scanning patterned wafer inspector, the latest in an extensive portfolio of in-line defect inspection tools for critical process monitoring application and advanced chip manufacturing. Coupled with the Gen 4 and Gen 5 broadband plasma portfolio, KLA's laser scanning systems help comprise the most comprehensive optical pattern wafer inspection portfolio in the marketplace today. 
Fourth, our services revenue was $454 million in the September quarter, up 15% year-over-year. For the quarter, it was 22% of revenue. More than 75% of service revenue in the Semiconductor Process Control segment and over 90% of services in the PCB business comes from recurring subscription-like contracts. Services is on track for another year of strong double-digit growth in 2021. This is driven by our growing installed base, higher utilization rates and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge. 
Finally, the September quarter was exceptional from a free cash flow perspective. We generated record quarterly free cash flow of $795 million, which helped drive last 12-month free cash flow, up 42% year-over-year to $2.29 billion. We also have remained focused on returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and stock repurchase program, both of which are up materially year-over-year, including $563 million in share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. 
In addition to executing against our strategic objectives and disciplined capital management, KLA delivers [ during ] value through corporate stewardship. KLA's values are reflected in efforts to reduce our environmental footprint, provide for a safe and healthy workplace for employees, advanced inclusion and diversity and make positive contributions to the communities where we live and work. 
We published our latest Global Impact report in August 2021. It highlights how KLA delivers lasting values through corporate citizenship. Our journey on this path began when we opened our doors in 1976. We are now expanding our efforts to be more holistic across environmental, social and governance topics most relevant to our business. 
We've also broadened our tracking and reporting to be inclusive of our full global footprint and acquired companies. We continue to build our long-term ESG strategy to focus on reducing climate impact, increasing disclosure and deepening the positive impact we deliver through our business and community engagement. 
With that, I will pass the call over to Bren to cover our financial highlights, outlook and guidance."

KLA's quarterly results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs in a robust demand environment while expanding market leadership, growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. 
Total quarterly revenue was $2.08 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.9% as the various components performed mostly as expected, with upside coming from the higher-than-expected Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue, which enhanced the product mix for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $4.64. 
Our performance reflected the mark-to-market of an equity position in a strategic supplier that negatively impacted non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.06. Without this adjustment, which is reflected in other income and expense on the income statement, non-GAAP earnings would have been $4.70. 
GAAP diluted EPS was $6.96, due primarily to a onetime tax benefit of $395 million, resulting from changes made to our international structure to better align ownership of certain intellectual property rights with how our business operates. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $432 million and included $252 million of R&D expense and $180 million of SG&A. 
Technical applications is a competitive advantage for KLA and drives demand for our products by helping our customers develop solutions that address their complex process challenges. Technical applications is included in SG&A and was $47 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D and technical applications represented approximately 70% of total operating expenses. 
Given the rapid growth of the business over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations for the business going forward, we expect the company's operating expenses to continue to grow as we invest in global infrastructure, systems to scale the KLA operating model, new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion. Furthermore, we, as most companies are seeing a strong labor market driving cost pressure across our global workforce. As a result, we expect operating expenses to grow sequentially to approximately $470 million in the December quarter, and we forecast sequential growth in operating expenses to continue through calendar 2022. 
While operating expenses are trending higher, going forward, we will make the necessary investments to scale our business, while we continue to size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a normalized time horizon. 
Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was strong at 42.2% in the September quarter. Other income and expense net was $52 million compared with guidance of $43 million, with the variance from guidance reflecting the impact of the mark-to-market of the investment discussed earlier. For December, we forecast other income and expense net at approximately $44 million. 
The quarterly effective tax rate was 13.9%, just above our guided tax rate of 13.5%. Non-GAAP net income was $712 million. GAAP net income was $1.07 billion. Cash flow from operations was $864 million, and free cash flow was a record $795 million, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 112%. 
Turning to our reportable segment and end markets. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $1.78 billion, up 40% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially. The approximate Semiconductor Process Control system customer segment mix was tilted slightly more towards foundry logic than we forecasted at 61%, above our 59% estimate. 
Memory was 39%, and within memory, the business was split roughly 61% DRAM and 39% NAND. Revenue for our EPC group continues to be driven by strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure as well as continued demand in automotive. More specifically, the specialty Semiconductor Process segment, which includes its associated service business, generated record revenue of $102 million, up 15% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially. 
PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $203 million, up 12% year-over-year but down 18% sequentially after a record quarter in the PCB and the component inspection businesses in June. For a breakdown of revenue by major products and regions, please see our shareholder letter or the earnings slides. 
Moving forward to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.63 billion in cash, bonds outstanding of $3.45 billion with no maturities until 2024 and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. 
Over the last 12 months, KLA returned $1.73 billion to shareholders, including $581 million in dividends paid and $1.15 billion in share repurchases. While circumstances can change, current expectations are the capital returns for calendar 2021 will exceed 85% of expected free cash flow generated in the calendar year. 
For the quarter, we generated a record $795 million in free cash flow and repurchased $400 million of common stock while also paying $163 million in dividends. 
Moving to our outlook and guidance. Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook continues to increase from our views earlier in the year. At the start of this year, we characterize the expected growth of the WFE market to be in the low teens plus or minus a few percentage points. In April, we revised that view to the low to mid-20s on a percentage basis with a bias to the upside. In July, we revised our WFE outlook upward again to the mid-30s. Today, we see continued strengthening and expect the WFE market to grow approximately 40% to the mid-$80 billion range in 2021, growing from approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020. This reflects the broad-based strengthening in demand across all customer segments. 
KLA is in a position to deliver strong relative growth this year with the semiconductor process control systems business now expected to grow in the mid-40s on a percentage basis over calendar year 2020. This growth profile is driven by our market leadership and strong momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms. 
Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the strength and sustainability of our current demand profile across all customer segments. For the total company, we expect that the first half of 2022 will grow in the high single digits versus the second half of 2021. It is abundantly clear today that demand is constrained by the industry's ability to supply. This pent-up demand should enable another year of solid growth in 2022. 
While it's too early to put a fine point on our growth expectations for next calendar year, early indications point towards the WFE industry maintaining its growth momentum. Given our bookings momentum and strong backlog, we believe KLA is well positioned to outperform WFE. As in calendar 2021, we are adding capacity strategically across our global manufacturing footprint to drive this outlook and to enable us to support our customers' process control requirements. 
Our December quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.325 billion, plus or minus $100 million; foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 74%; and memory is expected to be approximately 26% of Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 53% of the segment mix and NAND is forecasted to be 47%. 
We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 64%. At the midpoint, gross margin is roughly flat sequentially as revenue volume and product mix improvement is offset by higher expected service and manufacturing costs. Other model assumptions for December include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $470 million, other income and expense net of approximately $44 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.69 to $5.59 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.95 to $5.85. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 152 million shares. 
In conclusion, the tailwinds driving semiconductor growth and investments in WFE continue to remain compelling. Broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across multiple technology nodes are strong and resilient trends. We have confidence in the leading indicators of our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility, which is spurring us to invest in expanding our business infrastructure and the required capabilities to support our outlook. Our customers' multiyear investment plans provide an element of stability in the demand outlook for the future. 
KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and is on track to exceed our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform our industry and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive mode, leading financial performance, long-standing track record of strong free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A."

And we're in the middle of our strategic planning process right now and assessing not just our top line expectations but how to size the company relative to program demands, but also some of the volume dependencies that we've seen. We're also making significant investments in infrastructure. 
So as you got the world coming back from travel, you've got programs, you've got infrastructure investments. Those are all driving what we're seeing. We're certainly feeling pressure as most companies are, as we said in the prepared remarks, around compensation. So that's also a big part of it. 
I'm not going to guide '22 because we're going through that process. But what I would say is that based on how we size the company, we're going to size -- we do expect growth in the company, and we'll size the company based on our incremental margin model, which is 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth. And so that will be a driver for us. 
Certainly, some of this investment is a catch-up, if you will, in terms of the revenue growing so fast over the last couple of years, and it's been hard for us to catch up in terms of just being able to support the business in the way that we'd like. We're also encouraged by the growth opportunities over time, I'll call it the through cycle or normalized long-term growth, and we want to make sure the company is positioned right for that. 
So I have more to say about how to size it. I would say that we're going to be consistent with our long-term model. We've been way ahead of the model over 50% over the last couple of years. I would expect us to be in the target range as we think about '22. Hopefully, that helps."

As I think about '22, I do see an impact from incremental costs, probably somewhere in the 75 to 100 basis point level. I do think that that's implied in the guidance that we provided. I'll have a firmer point on it as I think about '22 in the next call as we start to just lay out a more comprehensive plan around the year. But I do think we're operating in the 63% range, and I'll put a little bit wider range than I normally would today. It may be set plus or minus 75 basis points on that based on our early expectations for next year. 
Absent those pressures, I think we'd be very consistent with the kind of trajectory we've seen. Certainly, the mix is more process control centric given expectations for next year right now. But I do think we'll continue to operate within our longer-term expectations of trying to drive somewhere between 60% and 65% incremental. But certainly, these cost pressures are real out there. And we're trying to navigate our way through it. 
But I don't think it will change much from current levels in terms -- but I don't think it's going to go up much either. So I think it's -- we're going to be operating and hovering sort of in this area with mix affecting performance in any given quarter."

So what you're seeing is an increase. It's less of a revolutionary one in the sense that EUV is in 5, and so you're going to see expansion of EUV layers as part of 3. So in that way, I think the mix phenomena will change towards some of the higher end tools. 
So for example, Gen 4 for us is significantly outselling Gen 5 in this calendar year because the bulk of the layers that could be done on a Gen 4 system. So as you move to 3, you're going to have more leverage towards a Gen 5 and -- now it turns out, we'll also be improving the capabilities on Gen 4. But I think you'll see it slightly shift. 
Remember, customers are always looking at the most cost-effective inspection strategy that they can have. So you're going to see it there. It will show up in metrology as well because there'll just be more points that will have to be sampled and that will drive utilization and the throughput requirements on tools. 
So Process Control intensity at the advanced nodes does get pushed harder, and we're definitely getting that feedback from our leading-edge customers the need for more capability and capacity to support that. So I think if anything, you're going to see a shift towards some of the higher ASP capability. At the same time, we're improving it. 
But in terms of a KLA market share perspective, we think it's actually positive for our market share. Because most of the time, when we have competitive situations, we tend to be in price competition at the lower end of most of the competition, and this will push things towards higher end which are the tools that we're really well positioned in and that will allow us to continue to our march towards higher market share over time."

So where we are anticipated and planned from a revenue standpoint on these, there are really multiple applications, which we're serving with e-beam. So we feel very good. But just as an overall cautionary reminder, e-beam as a percent of optical wafer inspection continues to be right about where it's been for the last 20 years, and we know that. We're providing this capability because there are some special applications where customers need it.

When I say capacity, I mean people, parts and space. So I am covering all of those things. Certainly, supply chain tends to be the longest pole in the tent, if you will, in terms of our ability to add capability. We've been doing that for a long period of time and go back to the middle of -- for the end of 2020. 
So we have around the key components and subsystems, where there are long lead times. We have very strong partnerships with those suppliers. And we've been working with them. We've been investing where appropriate to ensure that they're able to increase their capacity. So that capacity comes online over time. Our volumes are lower around a lot of those parts. And so getting single-digit upticks sequentially quarter-to-quarter in terms of units can have a pretty big impact on the company's overall revenue. 
So we continue to make those investments and work with those suppliers. Obviously, you never know what the future is, but we do have this belief that with semiconductor revenue growing the way it is, capital intensity rising, that this will be a demand for the company going forward. And so whether it's near term or longer term, I'm willing to make the investments to ensure that we can be as flexible and responsive to customers as we need to be. 
We're also carrying more inventory, and that provides a little bit of extra buffer as well around some of these components. Because our volumes are where they're at, some of the more fungible or more commodity-like parts that are out there. Our challenges are probably a little less than some of the other folks out there just because I don't need as many of them. I need them, but I don't need as many of them just because of the level of volume we have. So I think it's across all those things. 
And we feel pretty good that, look, ultimately, our customers would like things sooner if we could deliver to them, but we are managing our way through it, and I feel pretty good about the guidance that we provided here today."

So when this thing hit, I think we were able to navigate it better, because to Bren's point, we don't need as many. We don't need the biggest volume. And with the critical ones we've had historically strong relationships which we maintained through the different cycles. So that's why I think, again, it's another example of KLA being less volatile in a dynamic market. So that is part of it. It comes with a lot of work, a lot of hard work with our supply chain. But I think we have the trust and relationships with them that when we make commitments, we could follow through on them. 
So it has taken work to do, but I think that's part of why we've been able to scale and we went through the whole period. We didn't stop guiding. We hit our numbers. We haven't missed our performance expectations. And I think largely, it's because of those things."

And now we're seeing it, as you know, starting to happen in EUV. And everything that comes with that, all the infrastructure that goes with that, all the work that's going to go on to make sure that you can qualify the reticles, even though they have redundancy, there's a huge fear of throwing away. This is a very expensive infrastructure. So there's a lot of work going on already with Gen 5 to make sure that we can help qualify. 
And of course, you mentioned the high aspect ratio devices, you're going to see more -- I think, they've been in a honeymoon period for actually several years, I would say that some of the DRAMs historically, and you didn't see the Process Control intensity grow. This is a real chance for it to increase as a result of the new capabilities that are bringing just EUV, what that brings on. You also have a lot of metrology applications as well. 
So I think we do see it broadly. I don't think it will ever get to the levels of Process Control intensity we see in leading-edge foundry logic, but it will increase probably at a faster rate in terms of growth of process control as we go forward. Assuming the successful deployment of EUV, which right now is certainly what they're working on. 
Just one example of that is in what we're hearing now is for DRAM is that there seems to be no pellicle is going to be used in the lithography. That's the belief right now. And if so, that puts a lot of pressure on print check, which is a very high intensity application for Gen 5. So there would be an example of a new application. I can't remember -- I can vaguely remember, but it wasn't in any decades since we've been doing it on a print check in DRAM. So this would be a whole new application for those customers. 
And as you know, some of them have experienced in advanced logic, so they know what that means. It's at least one of them does. So there's going to be some crossover from that. So we're feeling pretty good about where that's coming in terms of shaping up yet another driver for intensity."

And so we can offer it a lower cost because of the configuration and all that, but it has a lot of capabilities. So we're seeing much more interest in newer capability. And remember, these guys are getting pushed very hard by their supply chain, especially in automotive because there's such a focus on preventing some of the defects liability issues. As you know, those are incredibly expensive if they're caught later. So we're seeing pretty good adoption and growth. And it's kind of a little bit countered overall WFE's cyclicality.

KLA September 2021 quarter continued our track record of consistent execution and commitment to outperformance. The company's focus on delivering on top and bottom line goals remained at the forefront of how we run our business. 
During the quarter, revenue grew 8% sequentially and 35% year-over-year to $2.08 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.64, representing 5% sequential growth and up 53% compared to the prior year. These results demonstrate growth momentum in our core markets and the operating leverage in the KLA financial model. 
Customer demand across KLA's major product groups continues as secular trends drive growth across a broad range of markets and applications in the industry. This growth is putting pressure on the semiconductor industry supply across multiple technology nodes. In parallel, leading-edge customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investments to improve their ability to address market demanding new semiconductor capabilities. Against this intense demand backdrop, we are navigating evolving customer needs and supply chain challenges. Still, KLA continues to outperform expectations by operating with purpose and precision and keeping our focus on creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders. 
Now turning to the industry demand environment. KLA remains in an excellent position when we look at the industry demand landscape. Strong secular growth drivers are creating important tailwinds that translate into momentum for our business. As a result, we are increasing our outlook for the wafer fab equipment, or WFE, industry. Last quarter, we estimated WFE growth would be in the mid-30s percent range. We now estimate that WFE will grow to approximately 40% in 2021. With sustained demand trends, we expect positive industry dynamics to continue into calendar 2022 and fuel another year of growth. 
Along with increased demand due to digitization across multiple categories, KLA's business is benefiting from customers increasing their focus on investment in leading-edge development, optimization of fab utilization or established production nodes and regionalization for future fab construction. To address this growth, we continue to invest high levels of R&D to ensure we're constantly improving and remaining indispensable for our customers. 
For example, we are prioritizing investment in R&D for software that enhances the value customers extract from KLA systems. Data analytics, advanced simulation and machine learning technologies are driving adoption of process control. KLA's data analytics performed platforms connect, centralize and analyze the data produced by our systems in the field. This creates a network effect that enhances performance across the product portfolio and for customers. 
KLA's breadth of products is uniquely positioned to speed time to results for our customers. We're making investments in these critical technologies as process control intensity increases. KLA's market leadership in the process control markets remain in impressive level -- at an impressive level of 4x the nearest competitor. Thanks to focus on execution and the industry demand backdrop, we remain on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. 
Let's now move along to the top highlights for the quarter. First, we continue to benefit from strength across all major end markets with overall company revenue expected to be up in the mid-30s on a percentage basis year-over-year based on the midpoint of our guidance for the December quarter. While we're not immune to the unprecedented supply chain challenges affecting the electronics industry, we are navigating them as well as can be expected. 
In foundry/logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and rising capital intensity continues to be a tailwind. In memory, demand remains broad-based across multiple customers with growth in 2021 led by DRAM and 2022 is setting up to be a relatively strong year for NAND. Second, our optical metrology business continues to stand out. KLA's metrology revenue is on track to grow meaningfully faster than the WFE market in 2021 after experiencing similar levels of absolute growth in 2020. The optical metrology market is strongly leveraged to EUV and its critical next-generation architectures, including gate all around and multi-stack 3D NAND. Third, KLA's leadership in the largest and fastest-growing segments of the process control market is fueling strong relative growth in our Semiconductor Process Control segment. 
Optical pattern wafer inspection is forecasted to be among the fastest-growing segments of WFE in 2021 for product segments over $1 billion in revenue. KLA's cadence of innovation and new product introduction continues to outpace the competition. Just last month, we introduced our new Voyager 1035 laser scanning patterned wafer inspector, the latest in an extensive portfolio of in-line defect inspection tools for critical process monitoring application and advanced chip manufacturing. Coupled with the Gen 4 and Gen 5 broadband plasma portfolio, KLA's laser scanning systems help comprise the most comprehensive optical pattern wafer inspection portfolio in the marketplace today. 
Fourth, our services revenue was $454 million in the September quarter, up 15% year-over-year. For the quarter, it was 22% of revenue. More than 75% of service revenue in the Semiconductor Process Control segment and over 90% of services in the PCB business comes from recurring subscription-like contracts. Services is on track for another year of strong double-digit growth in 2021. This is driven by our growing installed base, higher utilization rates and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge. 
Finally, the September quarter was exceptional from a free cash flow perspective. We generated record quarterly free cash flow of $795 million, which helped drive last 12-month free cash flow, up 42% year-over-year to $2.29 billion. We also have remained focused on returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and stock repurchase program, both of which are up materially year-over-year, including $563 million in share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. 
In addition to executing against our strategic objectives and disciplined capital management, KLA delivers enduring value through corporate stewardship. KLA's values are reflected in efforts to reduce our environmental footprint, provide for a safe and healthy workplace for employees, advanced inclusion and diversity and make positive contributions to the communities where we live and work. 
We published our latest Global Impact report in August 2021. It highlights how KLA delivers lasting values through corporate citizenship. Our journey on this path began when we opened our doors in 1976. We are now expanding our efforts to be more holistic across environmental, social and governance topics most relevant to our business. 
We've also broadened our tracking and reporting to be inclusive of our full global footprint and acquired companies. We continue to build our long-term ESG strategy to focus on reducing climate impact, increasing disclosure and deepening the positive impact we deliver through our business and community engagement. 
With that, I will pass the call over to Bren to cover our financial highlights, outlook and guidance."

KLA's quarterly results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs in a robust demand environment while expanding market leadership, growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. 
Total quarterly revenue was $2.08 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.9% as the various components performed mostly as expected, with upside coming from the higher-than-expected Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue, which enhanced the product mix for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $4.64. 
Our performance reflected the mark-to-market of an equity position in a strategic supplier that negatively impacted non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.06. Without this adjustment, which is reflected in other income and expense on the income statement, non-GAAP earnings would have been $4.70. 
GAAP diluted EPS was $6.96, due primarily to a onetime tax benefit of $395 million, resulting from changes made to our international structure to better align ownership of certain intellectual property rights with how our business operates. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $432 million and included $252 million of R&D expense and $180 million of SG&A. 
Technical applications is a competitive advantage for KLA and drives demand for our products by helping our customers develop solutions that address their complex process challenges. Technical applications is included in SG&A and was $47 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D and technical applications represented approximately 70% of total operating expenses. 
Given the rapid growth of the business over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations for the business going forward, we expect the company's operating expenses to continue to grow as we invest in global infrastructure, systems to scale the KLA operating model, new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion. Furthermore, we, as most companies are seeing a strong labor market driving cost pressure across our global workforce. As a result, we expect operating expenses to grow sequentially to approximately $470 million in the December quarter, and we forecast sequential growth in operating expenses to continue through calendar 2022. 
While operating expenses are trending higher, going forward, we will make the necessary investments to scale our business, while we continue to size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a normalized time horizon. 
Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was strong at 42.2% in the September quarter. Other income and expense net was $52 million compared with guidance of $43 million, with the variance from guidance reflecting the impact of the mark-to-market of the investment discussed earlier. For December, we forecast other income and expense net at approximately $44 million. 
The quarterly effective tax rate was 13.9%, just above our guided tax rate of 13.5%. Non-GAAP net income was $712 million. GAAP net income was $1.07 billion. Cash flow from operations was $864 million, and free cash flow was a record $795 million, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 112%. 
Turning to our reportable segment and end markets. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $1.78 billion, up 40% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially. The approximate Semiconductor Process Control system customer segment mix was tilted slightly more towards foundry logic than we forecasted at 61%, above our 59% estimate. 
Memory was 39%, and within memory, the business was split roughly 61% DRAM and 39% NAND. Revenue for our EPC group continues to be driven by strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure as well as continued demand in automotive. More specifically, the specialty Semiconductor Process segment, which includes its associated service business, generated record revenue of $102 million, up 15% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially. 
PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $203 million, up 12% year-over-year but down 18% sequentially after a record quarter in the PCB and the component inspection businesses in June. For a breakdown of revenue by major products and regions, please see our shareholder letter or the earnings slides. 
Moving forward to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.63 billion in cash, bonds outstanding of $3.45 billion with no maturities until 2024 and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. 
Over the last 12 months, KLA returned $1.73 billion to shareholders, including $581 million in dividends paid and $1.15 billion in share repurchases. While circumstances can change, current expectations are the capital returns for calendar 2021 will exceed 85% of expected free cash flow generated in the calendar year. 
For the quarter, we generated a record $795 million in free cash flow and repurchased $400 million of common stock while also paying $163 million in dividends. 
Moving to our outlook and guidance. Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook continues to increase from our views earlier in the year. At the start of this year, we characterize the expected growth of the WFE market to be in the low teens plus or minus a few percentage points. In April, we revised that view to the low to mid-20s on a percentage basis with a bias to the upside. In July, we revised our WFE outlook upward again to the mid-30s. Today, we see continued strengthening and expect the WFE market to grow approximately 40% to the mid-$80 billion range in 2021, growing from approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020. This reflects the broad-based strengthening in demand across all customer segments. 
KLA is in a position to deliver strong relative growth this year with the semiconductor process control systems business now expected to grow in the mid-40s on a percentage basis over calendar year 2020. This growth profile is driven by our market leadership and strong momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms. 
Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the strength and sustainability of our current demand profile across all customer segments. For the total company, we expect that the first half of 2022 will grow in the high single digits versus the second half of 2021. It is abundantly clear today that demand is constrained by the industry's ability to supply. This pent-up demand should enable another year of solid growth in 2022. 
While it's too early to put a fine point on our growth expectations for next calendar year, early indications point towards the WFE industry maintaining its growth momentum. Given our bookings momentum and strong backlog, we believe KLA is well positioned to outperform WFE. As in calendar 2021, we are adding capacity strategically across our global manufacturing footprint to drive this outlook and to enable us to support our customers' process control requirements. 
Our December quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.325 billion, plus or minus $100 million; foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 74%; and memory is expected to be approximately 26% of Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 53% of the segment mix and NAND is forecasted to be 47%. 
We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 64%. At the midpoint, gross margin is roughly flat sequentially as revenue volume and product mix improvement is offset by higher expected service and manufacturing costs. Other model assumptions for December include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $470 million, other income and expense net of approximately $44 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.69 to $5.59 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.95 to $5.85. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 152 million shares. 
In conclusion, the tailwinds driving semiconductor growth and investments in WFE continue to remain compelling. Broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across multiple technology nodes are strong and resilient trends. We have confidence in the leading indicators of our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility, which is spurring us to invest in expanding our business infrastructure and the required capabilities to support our outlook. Our customers' multiyear investment plans provide an element of stability in the demand outlook for the future. 
KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and is on track to exceed our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform our industry and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, leading financial performance, long-standing track record of strong free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A."

And we're in the middle of our strategic planning process right now and assessing not just our top line expectations but how to size the company relative to program demands, but also some of the volume dependencies that we've seen. We're also making significant investments in infrastructure. 
So as you got the world coming back from travel, you've got programs, you've got infrastructure investments. Those are all driving what we're seeing. We're certainly feeling pressure as most companies are, as we said in the prepared remarks, around compensation. So that's also a big part of it. 
I'm not going to guide '22 because we're going through that process. But what I would say is that based on how we size the company, we're going to size -- we do expect growth in the company, and we'll size the company based on our incremental margin model, which is 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth. And so that will be a driver for us. 
Certainly, some of this investment is a catch-up, if you will, in terms of the revenue growing so fast over the last couple of years, and it's been hard for us to catch up in terms of just being able to support the business in the way that we'd like. We're also encouraged by the growth opportunities over time, I'll call it the through cycle or normalized long-term growth, and we want to make sure the company is positioned right for that. 
So I have more to say about how to size it. I would say that we're going to be consistent with our long-term model. We've been way ahead of the model over 50% over the last couple of years. I would expect us to be in the target range as we think about '22. Hopefully, that helps."

And I think one of the other challenges we're facing is pressure on cost in the in the supply chain. As I think about '22, I do see an impact from incremental costs, probably somewhere in the 75 to 100 basis point level. I do think that that's implied in the guidance that we provided. I'll have a firmer point on it as I think about '22 in the next call as we start to just lay out a more comprehensive plan around the year. But I do think we're operating in the 63% range, and I'll put a little bit wider range than I normally would today. It may be set plus or minus 75 basis points on that based on our early expectations for next year. 
Absent those pressures, I think we'd be very consistent with the kind of trajectory we've seen. Certainly, the mix is more process control centric given expectations for next year right now. But I do think we'll continue to operate within our longer-term expectations of trying to drive somewhere between 60% and 65% incremental. But certainly, these cost pressures are real out there. And we're trying to navigate our way through it. 
But I don't think it will change much from current levels in terms -- but I don't think it's going to go up much either. So I think it's -- we're going to be operating and hovering sort of in this area with mix affecting performance in any given quarter."

So what you're seeing is an increase. It's less of a revolutionary one in the sense that EUV is N5, and so you're going to see expansion of EUV layers as part of 3. So in that way, I think the mix phenomena will change towards some of the higher end tools. 
So for example, Gen 4 for us is significantly outselling Gen 5 in this calendar year because the bulk of the layers that could be done on a Gen 4 system. So as you move to 3, you're going to have more leverage towards a Gen 5 and -- now it turns out, we'll also be improving the capabilities on Gen 4. But I think you'll see it slightly shift. 
Remember, customers are always looking at the most cost-effective inspection strategy that they can have. So you're going to see it there. It will show up in metrology as well because there'll just be more points that will have to be sampled and that will drive utilization and the throughput requirements on tools. 
So Process Control intensity at the advanced nodes does get pushed harder, and we're definitely getting that feedback from our leading-edge customers the need for more capability and capacity to support that. So I think if anything, you're going to see a shift towards some of the higher ASP capability. At the same time, we're improving it. 
But in terms of a KLA market share perspective, we think it's actually positive for our market share. Because most of the time, when we have competitive situations, we tend to be in price competition at the lower end of most of the competition, and this will push things towards higher end which are the tools that we're really well positioned in and that will allow us to continue to our march towards higher market share over time."

They're not leading edge, they're supporting domestic demand. And if you think about the EV industry, for example, the car, there's quite a bit of activity in China around that. So they're trying to have more control over their own supply chain for those trailing edge parts. So it's actually quite sustainable when you look at the amount of demand there is for specialty semiconductors in the China market. So I think that that's something that you'll continue to see, and it's a long way away from some of the concerns people have about leading edge in China."

But we -- our strategy around EBI, which is I think you're referring to, inspection, is really to try to leverage and use the EBI technology and the machine learning that we have to drive the inspectors and add more value or more relevancy to the inspection tools.

So where we are anticipated and planned from a revenue standpoint on these, there are really multiple applications, which we're serving with e-beam. So we feel very good. But just as an overall cautionary reminder, e-beam as a percent of optical wafer inspection continues to be right about where it's been for the last 20 years, and we know that. We're providing this capability because there are some special applications where customers need it. And there are actually some expansion opportunities in things like some of the increased demands of overlay that require more people are looking at for e-beam in order to control the very advanced design rules.

When I say capacity, I mean people, parts and space. So I am covering all of those things. Certainly, supply chain tends to be the longest pole in the tent, if you will, in terms of our ability to add capability. We've been doing that for a long period of time and go back to the middle of -- for the end of 2020. 
So we have around the key components and subsystems, where there are long lead times. We have very strong partnerships with those suppliers. And we've been working with them. We've been investing where appropriate to ensure that they're able to increase their capacity. So that capacity comes online over time. Our volumes are lower around a lot of those parts. And so getting single-digit upticks sequentially quarter-to-quarter in terms of units can have a pretty big impact on the company's overall revenue. 
So we continue to make those investments and work with those suppliers. Obviously, you never know what the future is, but we do have this belief that with semiconductor revenue growing the way it is, capital intensity rising, that this will be a demand for the company going forward. And so whether it's near term or longer term, I'm willing to make the investments to ensure that we can be as flexible and responsive to customers as we need to be. 
We're also carrying more inventory, and that provides a little bit of extra buffer as well around some of these components. Because our volumes are where they're at, some of the more fungible or more commodity-like parts that are out there. Our challenges are probably a little less than some of the other folks out there just because I don't need as many of them. I need them, but I don't need as many of them just because of the level of volume we have. So I think it's across all those things. 
And we feel pretty good that, look, ultimately, our customers would like things sooner if we could deliver to them, but we are managing our way through it, and I feel pretty good about the guidance that we provided here today."

So when this thing hit, I think we were able to navigate it better, because to Bren's point, we don't need as many. We don't need the biggest volume. And with the critical ones we've had historically strong relationships which we maintained through the different cycles. So that's why I think, again, it's another example of KLA being less volatile in a dynamic market. So that is part of it. It comes with a lot of work, a lot of hard work with our supply chain. But I think we have the trust and relationships with them that when we make commitments, we could follow through on them. 
So it has taken work to do, but I think that's part of why we've been able to scale and we went through the whole period. We didn't stop guiding. We hit our numbers. We haven't missed our performance expectations. And I think largely, it's because of those things."

And now we're seeing it, as you know, starting to happen in EUV. And everything that comes with that, all the infrastructure that goes with that, all the work that's going to go on to make sure that you can qualify the reticles, even though they have redundancy, there's a huge fear of throwing away. This is a very expensive infrastructure. So there's a lot of work going on already with Gen 5 to make sure that we can help qualify. 
And of course, you mentioned the high aspect ratio devices, you're going to see more -- I think, they've been in a honeymoon period for actually several years, I would say that some of the DRAMs historically, and you didn't see the Process Control intensity grow. This is a real chance for it to increase as a result of the new capabilities that are bringing -- just EUV, what that brings on. You also have a lot of metrology applications as well. 
So I think we do see it broadly. I don't think it will ever get to the levels of Process Control intensity we see in leading-edge foundry logic, but it will increase probably at a faster rate in terms of growth of process control as we go forward. Assuming the successful deployment of EUV, which right now is certainly what they're working on. 
Just one example of that is in what we're hearing now is for DRAM is that there seems to be no pellicle is going to be used in the lithography. That's the belief right now. And if so, that puts a lot of pressure on print check, which is a very high intensity application for Gen 5. So there would be an example of a new application. I can't remember -- I can vaguely remember, but it wasn't in any decades since we've been doing it on a print check in DRAM. So this would be a whole new application for those customers. 
And as you know, some of them have experienced in advanced logic, so they know what that means. At least one of them does. So there's going to be some crossover from that. So we're feeling pretty good about where that's coming in terms of shaping up for yet another driver for intensity."

So our range has been very consistent over the last several quarters. I don't think anything's really changed on that front. It really gets down to our assessment of where we're at. In some cases, we have evaluations, consignments that have to be bought out. So there's always some fluidity to our expectations in our revenue plan as we build it up.

So we're seeing a lot more capability we can offer now in some of these -- and I'd say the C205 is like a derivative tool of the BBP tool. So that's one where you get a lot of capability and certainly take advantage of all the work we've done in the algorithm area. 
And so we can offer it a lower cost because of the configuration and all that, but it has a lot of capabilities. So we're seeing much more interest in newer capability. And remember, these guys are getting pushed very hard by their supply chain, especially in automotive because there's such a focus on preventing some of the defects, reliability issues. As you know, those are incredibly expensive if they're caught later. So we're seeing pretty good adoption and growth. And it's kind of a little bit countered overall WFE's cyclicality. So we think that is a steady area of investment.

KLA September 2021 quarter continued our track record of consistent execution and commitment to outperformance. The company's focus on delivering on top and bottom line goals remained at the forefront of how we run our business. 
During the quarter, revenue grew 8% sequentially and 35% year-over-year to $2.08 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.64, representing 5% sequential growth and up 53% compared to the prior year. These results demonstrate growth momentum in our core markets and the operating leverage in the KLA financial model. 
Customer demand across KLA's major product groups continues as secular trends drive growth across a broad range of markets and applications in the industry. This growth is putting pressure on the semiconductor industry supply across multiple technology nodes. In parallel, leading-edge customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investments to improve their ability to address market demanding new semiconductor capabilities. Against this intense demand backdrop, we are navigating evolving customer needs and supply chain challenges. Still, KLA continues to outperform expectations by operating with purpose and precision and keeping our focus on creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders. 
Now turning to the industry demand environment. KLA remains in an excellent position when we look at the industry demand landscape. Strong secular growth drivers are creating important tailwinds that translate into momentum for our business. As a result, we are increasing our outlook for the wafer fab equipment, or WFE, industry. Last quarter, we estimated WFE growth would be in the mid-30s percent range. We now estimate that WFE will grow to approximately 40% in 2021. With sustained demand trends, we expect positive industry dynamics to continue into calendar 2022 and fuel another year of growth. 
Along with increased demand due to digitization across multiple categories, KLA's business is benefiting from customers increasing their focus on investment in leading-edge development, optimization of fab utilization or established production nodes and regionalization for future fab construction. To address this growth, we continue to invest high levels of R&D to ensure we're constantly improving and remaining indispensable for our customers. 
For example, we are prioritizing investment in R&D for software that enhances the value customers extract from KLA systems. Data analytics, advanced simulation and machine learning technologies are driving adoption of process control. KLA's data analytics performed platforms connect, centralize and analyze the data produced by our systems in the field. This creates a network effect that enhances performance across the product portfolio and for customers. 
KLA's breadth of products is uniquely positioned to speed time to results for our customers. We're making investments in these critical technologies as process control intensity increases. KLA's market leadership in the process control markets remain in impressive level -- at an impressive level of 4x the nearest competitor. Thanks to focus on execution and the industry demand backdrop, we remain on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. 
Let's now move along to the top highlights for the quarter. First, we continue to benefit from strength across all major end markets with overall company revenue expected to be up in the mid-30s on a percentage basis year-over-year based on the midpoint of our guidance for the December quarter. While we're not immune to the unprecedented supply chain challenges affecting the electronics industry, we are navigating them as well as can be expected. 
In foundry/logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and rising capital intensity continues to be a tailwind. In memory, demand remains broad-based across multiple customers with growth in 2021 led by DRAM and 2022 is setting up to be a relatively strong year for NAND. Second, our optical metrology business continues to stand out. KLA's metrology revenue is on track to grow meaningfully faster than the WFE market in 2021 after experiencing similar levels of absolute growth in 2020. The optical metrology market is strongly leveraged to EUV and its critical next-generation architectures, including gate all around and multi-stack 3D NAND. Third, KLA's leadership in the largest and fastest-growing segments of the process control market is fueling strong relative growth in our Semiconductor Process Control segment. 
Optical pattern wafer inspection is forecasted to be among the fastest-growing segments of WFE in 2021 for product segments over $1 billion in revenue. KLA's cadence of innovation and new product introduction continues to outpace the competition. Just last month, we introduced our new Voyager 1035 laser scanning patterned wafer inspector, the latest in an extensive portfolio of in-line defect inspection tools for critical process monitoring application and advanced chip manufacturing. Coupled with the Gen 4 and Gen 5 broadband plasma portfolio, KLA's laser scanning systems help comprise the most comprehensive optical pattern wafer inspection portfolio in the marketplace today. 
Fourth, our services revenue was $454 million in the September quarter, up 15% year-over-year. For the quarter, it was 22% of revenue. More than 75% of service revenue in the Semiconductor Process Control segment and over 90% of services in the PCB business comes from recurring subscription-like contracts. Services is on track for another year of strong double-digit growth in 2021. This is driven by our growing installed base, higher utilization rates and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge. 
Finally, the September quarter was exceptional from a free cash flow perspective. We generated record quarterly free cash flow of $795 million, which helped drive last 12-month free cash flow, up 42% year-over-year to $2.29 billion. We also have remained focused on returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and stock repurchase program, both of which are up materially year-over-year, including $563 million in share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. 
In addition to executing against our strategic objectives and disciplined capital management, KLA delivers enduring value through corporate stewardship. KLA's values are reflected in efforts to reduce our environmental footprint, provide for a safe and healthy workplace for employees, advanced inclusion and diversity and make positive contributions to the communities where we live and work. 
We published our latest Global Impact report in August 2021. It highlights how KLA delivers lasting values through corporate citizenship. Our journey on this path began when we opened our doors in 1976. We are now expanding our efforts to be more holistic across environmental, social and governance topics most relevant to our business. 
We've also broadened our tracking and reporting to be inclusive of our full global footprint and acquired companies. We continue to build our long-term ESG strategy to focus on reducing climate impact, increasing disclosure and deepening the positive impact we deliver through our business and community engagement. 
With that, I will pass the call over to Bren to cover our financial highlights, outlook and guidance."

Total quarterly revenue was $2.08 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.9% as the various components performed mostly as expected, with upside coming from the higher-than-expected Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue, which enhanced the product mix for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $4.64. 
Our performance reflected the mark-to-market of an equity position in a strategic supplier that negatively impacted non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.06. Without this adjustment, which is reflected in other income and expense on the income statement, non-GAAP earnings would have been $4.70. 
GAAP diluted EPS was $6.96, due primarily to a onetime tax benefit of $395 million, resulting from changes made to our international structure to better align ownership of certain intellectual property rights with how our business operates. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $432 million and included $252 million of R&D expense and $180 million of SG&A. 
Technical applications is a competitive advantage for KLA and drives demand for our products by helping our customers develop solutions that address their complex process challenges. Technical applications is included in SG&A and was $47 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D and technical applications represented approximately 70% of total operating expenses. 
Given the rapid growth of the business over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations for the business going forward, we expect the company's operating expenses to continue to grow as we invest in global infrastructure, systems to scale the KLA operating model, new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion. Furthermore, we, as most companies are seeing a strong labor market driving cost pressure across our global workforce. As a result, we expect operating expenses to grow sequentially to approximately $470 million in the December quarter, and we forecast sequential growth in operating expenses to continue through calendar 2022. 
While operating expenses are trending higher, going forward, we will make the necessary investments to scale our business, while we continue to size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a normalized time horizon. 
Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was strong at 42.2% in the September quarter. Other income and expense net was $52 million compared with guidance of $43 million, with the variance from guidance reflecting the impact of the mark-to-market of the investment discussed earlier. For December, we forecast other income and expense net at approximately $44 million. 
The quarterly effective tax rate was 13.9%, just above our guided tax rate of 13.5%. Non-GAAP net income was $712 million. GAAP net income was $1.07 billion. Cash flow from operations was $864 million, and free cash flow was a record $795 million, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 112%. 
Turning to our reportable segment and end markets. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $1.78 billion, up 40% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially. The approximate Semiconductor Process Control system customer segment mix was tilted slightly more towards foundry logic than we forecasted at 61%, above our 59% estimate. 
Memory was 39%, and within memory, the business was split roughly 61% DRAM and 39% NAND. Revenue for our EPC group continues to be driven by strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure as well as continued demand in automotive. More specifically, the specialty Semiconductor Process segment, which includes its associated service business, generated record revenue of $102 million, up 15% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially. 
PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $203 million, up 12% year-over-year but down 18% sequentially after a record quarter in the PCB and the component inspection businesses in June. For a breakdown of revenue by major products and regions, please see our shareholder letter or the earnings slides. 
Moving forward to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.63 billion in cash, bonds outstanding of $3.45 billion with no maturities until 2024 and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. 
Over the last 12 months, KLA returned $1.73 billion to shareholders, including $581 million in dividends paid and $1.15 billion in share repurchases. While circumstances can change, current expectations are the capital returns for calendar 2021 will exceed 85% of expected free cash flow generated in the calendar year. 
For the quarter, we generated a record $795 million in free cash flow and repurchased $400 million of common stock while also paying $163 million in dividends. 
Moving to our outlook and guidance. Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook continues to increase from our views earlier in the year. At the start of this year, we characterize the expected growth of the WFE market to be in the low teens plus or minus a few percentage points. In April, we revised that view to the low to mid-20s on a percentage basis with a bias to the upside. In July, we revised our WFE outlook upward again to the mid-30s. Today, we see continued strengthening and expect the WFE market to grow approximately 40% to the mid-$80 billion range in 2021, growing from approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020. This reflects the broad-based strengthening in demand across all customer segments. 
KLA is in a position to deliver strong relative growth this year with the semiconductor process control systems business now expected to grow in the mid-40s on a percentage basis over calendar year 2020. This growth profile is driven by our market leadership and strong momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms. 
Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the strength and sustainability of our current demand profile across all customer segments. For the total company, we expect that the first half of 2022 will grow in the high single digits versus the second half of 2021. It is abundantly clear today that demand is constrained by the industry's ability to supply. This pent-up demand should enable another year of solid growth in 2022. 
While it's too early to put a fine point on our growth expectations for next calendar year, early indications point towards the WFE industry maintaining its growth momentum. Given our bookings momentum and strong backlog, we believe KLA is well positioned to outperform WFE. As in calendar 2021, we are adding capacity strategically across our global manufacturing footprint to drive this outlook and to enable us to support our customers' process control requirements. 
Our December quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.325 billion, plus or minus $100 million; foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 74%; and memory is expected to be approximately 26% of Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 53% of the segment mix and NAND is forecasted to be 47%. 
We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 64%. At the midpoint, gross margin is roughly flat sequentially as revenue volume and product mix improvement is offset by higher expected service and manufacturing costs. Other model assumptions for December include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $470 million, other income and expense net of approximately $44 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.69 to $5.59 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.95 to $5.85. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 152 million shares. 
In conclusion, the tailwinds driving semiconductor growth and investments in WFE continue to remain compelling. Broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across multiple technology nodes are strong and resilient trends. We have confidence in the leading indicators of our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility, which is spurring us to invest in expanding our business infrastructure and the required capabilities to support our outlook. Our customers' multiyear investment plans provide an element of stability in the demand outlook for the future. 
KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and is on track to exceed our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations.

And we're in the middle of our strategic planning process right now and assessing not just our top line expectations but how to size the company relative to program demands, but also some of the volume dependencies that we've seen. We're also making significant investments in infrastructure. 
So as you got the world coming back from travel, you've got programs, you've got infrastructure investments. Those are all driving what we're seeing. We're certainly feeling pressure as most companies are, as we said in the prepared remarks, around compensation. So that's also a big part of it. 
I'm not going to guide '22 because we're going through that process. But what I would say is that based on how we size the company, we're going to size -- we do expect growth in the company, and we'll size the company based on our incremental margin model, which is 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth. And so that will be a driver for us. 
Certainly, some of this investment is a catch-up, if you will, in terms of the revenue growing so fast over the last couple of years, and it's been hard for us to catch up in terms of just being able to support the business in the way that we'd like. We're also encouraged by the growth opportunities over time, I'll call it the through cycle or normalized long-term growth, and we want to make sure the company is positioned right for that. 
So I have more to say about how to size it. I would say that we're going to be consistent with our long-term model. We've been way ahead of the model over 50% over the last couple of years. I would expect us to be in the target range as we think about '22. Hopefully, that helps."

And I think one of the other challenges we're facing is pressure on cost in the in the supply chain. As I think about '22, I do see an impact from incremental costs, probably somewhere in the 75 to 100 basis point level. I do think that that's implied in the guidance that we provided. I'll have a firmer point on it as I think about '22 in the next call as we start to just lay out a more comprehensive plan around the year. But I do think we're operating in the 63% range, and I'll put a little bit wider range than I normally would today. It may be set plus or minus 75 basis points on that based on our early expectations for next year. 
Absent those pressures, I think we'd be very consistent with the kind of trajectory we've seen. Certainly, the mix is more process control centric given expectations for next year right now. But I do think we'll continue to operate within our longer-term expectations of trying to drive somewhere between 60% and 65% incremental. But certainly, these cost pressures are real out there. And we're trying to navigate our way through it. 
But I don't think it will change much from current levels in terms -- but I don't think it's going to go up much either. So I think it's -- we're going to be operating and hovering sort of in this area with mix affecting performance in any given quarter."

So what you're seeing is an increase. It's less of a revolutionary one in the sense that EUV is N5, and so you're going to see expansion of EUV layers as part of 3. So in that way, I think the mix phenomena will change towards some of the higher end tools. 
So for example, Gen 4 for us is significantly outselling Gen 5 in this calendar year because the bulk of the layers that could be done on a Gen 4 system. So as you move to 3, you're going to have more leverage towards a Gen 5 and -- now it turns out, we'll also be improving the capabilities on Gen 4. But I think you'll see it slightly shift. 
Remember, customers are always looking at the most cost-effective inspection strategy that they can have. So you're going to see it there. It will show up in metrology as well because there'll just be more points that will have to be sampled and that will drive utilization and the throughput requirements on tools. 
So Process Control intensity at the advanced nodes does get pushed harder, and we're definitely getting that feedback from our leading-edge customers the need for more capability and capacity to support that. So I think if anything, you're going to see a shift towards some of the higher ASP capability. At the same time, we're improving it. 
But in terms of a KLA market share perspective, we think it's actually positive for our market share. Because most of the time, when we have competitive situations, we tend to be in price competition at the lower end of most of the competition, and this will push things towards higher end which are the tools that we're really well positioned in and that will allow us to continue to our march towards higher market share over time."

And so we have another product we call the C205, which is targeted for the auto industry, and we're able to sell that, and we're seeing that it really leverages a lot of the R&D that we've done for years. 
So the platform, even -- we talked about a portfolio of products, but the truth is we have a portfolio of BBP products. And it is not just across the different technologies, it's one technology across the different generations. And we're really leveraging that. So what's really surprising when we look at it is that Gen 5, while it's doing quite well, it's actually one of the smaller -- relative to the Gen 4, it's significantly smaller in dollar volume this year, and that will grow over time, which makes us feel really good about the sustainability and the overall potential for us to continue to be able to invest and provide capability for our customers across all nodes. So it's pretty exciting to see."

When I say capacity, I mean people, parts and space. So I am covering all of those things. Certainly, supply chain tends to be the longest pole in the tent, if you will, in terms of our ability to add capability. We've been doing that for a long period of time and go back to the middle of -- for the end of 2020. 
So we have around the key components and subsystems, where there are long lead times. We have very strong partnerships with those suppliers. And we've been working with them. We've been investing where appropriate to ensure that they're able to increase their capacity. So that capacity comes online over time. Our volumes are lower around a lot of those parts. And so getting single-digit upticks sequentially quarter-to-quarter in terms of units can have a pretty big impact on the company's overall revenue. 
So we continue to make those investments and work with those suppliers. Obviously, you never know what the future is, but we do have this belief that with semiconductor revenue growing the way it is, capital intensity rising, that this will be a demand for the company going forward. And so whether it's near term or longer term, I'm willing to make the investments to ensure that we can be as flexible and responsive to customers as we need to be. 
We're also carrying more inventory, and that provides a little bit of extra buffer as well around some of these components. Because our volumes are where they're at, some of the more fungible or more commodity-like parts that are out there. Our challenges are probably a little less than some of the other folks out there just because I don't need as many of them. I need them, but I don't need as many of them just because of the level of volume we have. So I think it's across all those things. 
And we feel pretty good that, look, ultimately, our customers would like things sooner if we could deliver to them, but we are managing our way through it, and I feel pretty good about the guidance that we provided here today."

And let me just add one perspective where I think actually it differentiates KLA in a positive light relative to our peers in the industry. Because we've always been high mix, low volume, and we have several strategic relationships with key suppliers, as Bren, we've actually always been working the supply chain and making sure we invested in our suppliers so that we had capability because in many cases, where we've been for years inextricably linked to them. 
So when this thing hit, I think we were able to navigate it better, because to Bren's point, we don't need as many. We don't need the biggest volume. And with the critical ones we've had historically strong relationships which we maintained through the different cycles. So that's why I think, again, it's another example of KLA being less volatile in a dynamic market. So that is part of it. It comes with a lot of work, a lot of hard work with our supply chain. But I think we have the trust and relationships with them that when we make commitments, we could follow through on them. 
So it has taken work to do, but I think that's part of why we've been able to scale and we went through the whole period. We didn't stop guiding. We hit our numbers. We haven't missed our performance expectations. And I think largely, it's because of those things."

So we're engaging when we sell some of the newer capability into these more, I guess, traditional or trailing edge fabs, we provide more services and capability, and that's been part of the value proposition.

And now we're seeing it, as you know, starting to happen in EUV. And everything that comes with that, all the infrastructure that goes with that, all the work that's going to go on to make sure that you can qualify the reticles, even though they have redundancy, there's a huge fear of throwing away. This is a very expensive infrastructure. So there's a lot of work going on already with Gen 5 to make sure that we can help qualify. 
And of course, you mentioned the high aspect ratio devices, you're going to see more -- I think, they've been in a honeymoon period for actually several years, I would say that some of the DRAMs historically, and you didn't see the Process Control intensity grow. This is a real chance for it to increase as a result of the new capabilities that are bringing -- just EUV, what that brings on. You also have a lot of metrology applications as well. 
So I think we do see it broadly. I don't think it will ever get to the levels of Process Control intensity we see in leading-edge foundry logic, but it will increase probably at a faster rate in terms of growth of process control as we go forward. Assuming the successful deployment of EUV, which right now is certainly what they're working on. 
Just one example of that is in what we're hearing now is for DRAM is that there seems to be no pellicle is going to be used in the lithography. That's the belief right now. And if so, that puts a lot of pressure on print check, which is a very high intensity application for Gen 5. So there would be an example of a new application. I can't remember -- I can vaguely remember, but it wasn't in any decades since we've been doing it on a print check in DRAM. So this would be a whole new application for those customers. 
And as you know, some of them have experienced in advanced logic, so they know what that means. At least one of them does. So there's going to be some crossover from that. So we're feeling pretty good about where that's coming in terms of shaping up for yet another driver for intensity."

So that's one where you get a lot of capability and certainly take advantage of all the work we've done in the algorithm area. 
And so we can offer it a lower cost because of the configuration and all that, but it has a lot of capabilities. So we're seeing much more interest in newer capability. And remember, these guys are getting pushed very hard by their supply chain, especially in automotive because there's such a focus on preventing some of the defects, reliability issues. As you know, those are incredibly expensive if they're caught later. So we're seeing pretty good adoption and growth. And it's kind of a little bit countered overall WFE's cyclicality. So we think that is a steady area of investment. 
What we laid out at the Investment Day, 100 years ago, it feels like 2019, we're still on track, actually ahead of plan for that in terms of automotive. And we anticipated bringing on some of these products at that time."
