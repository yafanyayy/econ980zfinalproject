There's also been a year when our mission has never been more relevant. 
Like many of you, we spent the majority of the year with most of our teams working remotely. During this time, we continue to maintain, invest in and evolve our infrastructure, which enables us to reliably and accurately provide the critical DMS navigation service people around the world rely on more than ever for commerce, education, health care and person-to-person connection, while complying with the high operational standards as required by our ICANN agreements. Thanks to the dedication of our team and the resilience of the specialized network they operate and maintain, we extended our record of BMS availability to over 23 years during 2020, and we will continue our focus as it appears we will be working remotely well into 2021. 
Turning to our results. I'm pleased to report another consistent quarter that concludes a solid year of operational excellence for the company. As I mentioned, in 2020, we marked more than 23 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. We also processed 42.4 million new registrations, delivered revenue of $1.265 billion and generated free cash flow of $687 million. 
During the full year 2020, we repurchased 3.7 million shares for $735 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors has increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $747 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration. 
Our financial and liquidity position remains stable with $1.17 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of December, the domain name basin .com and .net totaled $165.2 million, consisting of 151.8 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 4%. During the fourth quarter, we processed 10.5 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.46 million names. 
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 will be approximately 73.5%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.8% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 73.7% last quarter. 
Looking to 2021, we expect the domain name base growth rate of between 2.5% and 4.5%. As announced in today's earnings release, we have given notice of a price increase of $0.54 to the end of a wholesale price for .com domain names, which raises the price from $7.85 to $8.39, effective September 1, 2021. This represents the first wholesale price increase of .com domain names since 2012 and under an alignment with the limited and regulated pricing flexibility permitted under our Registry Agreement. This announcement is consistent with our statements over the last several months, but we expect it to effectuate an increase in the wholesale price .net domain names before October 25, 2021. We believe this position is competitively in the marketplace. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Operating expense totaled $441 million and was up 3.6% from last year. For the fiscal year, the company delivered operating income of $824 million, up 2.2% from $806 million a year ago and a full year operating margin of 65.2%. 
Fourth quarter revenue came to $320 million, up 3.1% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $116 million compared to $111 million last quarter and $112 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expense is primarily a result of increased sales and marketing expenses. 
Fourth quarter operating income totaled $205 million compared with $199 million in the same quarter of 2019. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.9%, which was unchanged from the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $157 million compared to $148 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.38 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $1.26 in the same quarter last year. 
As noted in our earnings release, net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 included recognition of a $12.4 million of previously unrecognized income tax benefits as a result of the lapse of certain statutes of limitations. This income tax benefit increased Q4 diluted earnings per share by $0.11. 
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $195 million and free cash flow was $189 million compared with $194 million and $185 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year. 
I'll now discuss full year 2021 guidance. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.32 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects the domain name base growth rate of between 2.5% and 4.5% that Jim mentioned earlier. 
The operating margin is expected to be between 64% and 65%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure in 2021. Also, this range reflects the annual $4 million payment to ICANN, which began this year to support activities to preserve, enhance the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS and the Internet. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $88 million to $92 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $55 million and $65 million. This range reflects our ongoing investment in our infrastructure as well as an expected 2020 capital spend that moved into 2021. The GAAp effective tax rate is expected to be between 20% and 23%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2021 to also be within the same guidance range. 
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance throughout last year, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution in 2021. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'd like to say again that our priorities continue to be our mission of ensuring a secure, reliable and accurate operation of our critical Internet infrastructure and the safety of our people. 
I also want to acknowledge once more the team here at Verisign for their hard work in maintaining and operating our infrastructure, even during the challenges of working remote during pandemic. Those efforts are undertaking almost entirely behind the scenes that are not well known, but there are many hundreds of dedicated professionals that develop, maintain and operate our purpose-built network and have done so without service interruptions for over 23 years. 
Even today, some people may think we still operate an SSL certificate authority of PKI business that VeriSign's predecessor RSA data security built going on the way back to 1986. That business was sold in 2010, and we have increasingly tightened our focus on our core mission of secure Internet directory and registration services ever since. More information on just what we do today can be found on our homepage at verisign.com. 
Now we'd like to walk through your questions, which we believe is on your mind before opening the call for your additional questions. Many of you have asked, are there any updates on the status of that lab. As we noted last quarter, a final hearing took place in early August of 2020. We expect a decision from the panel in the coming weeks, but we don't control the timing and the panel is not operating under any deadline. 
And as a reminder, VeriSign is not a party in the IRP proceedings, but was granted the right to participate in certainly limited aspects. Also, as a reminder, an IRP under ICANN bylaws is for the purpose of ensuring that ICANN follow the term policies and procedures were making decisions. Our expectation is that following the resolution of the IRP, the ICANN Board will make a final decision on the delegation of the TLD. The guidance we provided today does not include revenue or expenses related to .web. 
Now I'll open the call to your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

And you see this bearing out in our numbers as both R&D and G&A are up in those areas, and we continue to invest in personnel and hardware and software tools in those areas. 
As far as 2021, we expect our expenses to be similar as a percent of revenue next year for most of the categories that we report on with the exception of cost of revenue, which we expect will increase slightly as a percent of revenue for next year. 
As far as capital expenditures, as stated in my prepared remarks, capital expenditures are expected to be between $55 million and $65 million. And that again reflects ongoing investment in our infrastructure As well as some expected 2020 capital spend that slipped into 2021. 
We -- as I mentioned, we guided between $55 million and $65 million. Last year, we guided between $45 million and $55 million at this time.

But as you saw, yes, in the fourth quarter, we had a pretty solid quarter, delivering about 10.5 million registrations, which was up from 10.3 a year ago. And during the year, as we talked about, we have seen some increased demand in those regions from people looking to get online, new business starts and think there's been new functionality created in the registrate community from website builders. 
As we look into next year, we still see those trends continuing. However, we're not sure how the market will react as we come out of this work-from-home environment.

This has also been a year when our mission has never been more relevant. Like many of you, we spent the majority of the year with most of our teams working remotely. During this time, we continued to maintain, invest in and evolve our infrastructure, which enables us to reliably and accurately provide the critical DNS navigation service people around the world rely on more than ever for commerce, education, health care and person-to-person connection, while complying with the high operational standards as required by our ICANN agreements. 
Thanks to the dedication of our team and the resilience of the specialized network they operate and maintain, we extended our record of DNS availability to over 23 years during 2020, and we will continue our focus as it appears we will be working remotely well into 2021.
Turning to our results. I'm pleased to report another consistent quarter that concludes a solid year of operational excellence for the company. As I mentioned, in 2020, we marked more than 23 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. We also processed 42.4 million new registrations, delivered revenue of $1.265 billion and generated free cash flow of $687 million.
During the full year 2020, we repurchased 3.7 million shares for $735 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors has increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $747 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration.
Our financial and liquidity position remains stable with $1.17 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 165.2 million, consisting of 151.8 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 4%. 
During the fourth quarter, we processed 10.5 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.46 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 will be approximately 73.5%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.8% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 73.7% last quarter.
Looking to 2021, we expect the domain name base growth rate of between 2.5% and 4.5%. As announced in today's earnings release, we have given notice of a price increase of $0.54 to the annual wholesale price for .com domain names, which raises the price from $7.85 to $8.39, effective September 1, 2021. This represents the first wholesale price increase of .com domain name since 2012 and in alignment with a limited and regulated pricing flexibility permitted under our Registry Agreement. 
This announcement is consistent with our statements over the last several months that we expected to effectuate an increase in the wholesale price of .com domain names before October 25, 2021. We believe this position is competitively in the marketplace.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the company generated revenue of $1.265 billion, up 2.7% from 2019. Operating expense totaled $441 million and was up 3.6% from last year.
For the fiscal year, the company delivered operating income of $824 million, up 2.2% from $806 million a year ago and a full year operating margin of 65.2%.
Fourth quarter revenue came to $320 million, up 3.1% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $116 million compared to $111 million last quarter and $112 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expense is primarily a result of increased sales and marketing expenses.
Fourth quarter operating income totaled $205 million compared with $199 million in the same quarter of 2019. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.9%, which was unchanged from the same quarter a year ago.
Net income totaled $157 million compared to $148 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.38 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $1.26 for the same quarter last year.
As noted in our earnings release, net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 included recognition of a $12.4 million of previously unrecognized income tax benefits as a result of the lapse of certain statutes of limitations. This income tax benefit increased Q4 diluted earnings per share by $0.11.
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $195 million and free cash flow was $189 million compared with $194 million and $185 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year.
I'll now discuss full year 2021 guidance. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.300 billion to $1.320 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects the domain name base growth rate of between 2.5% and 4.5% that Jim mentioned earlier.
The operating margin is expected to be between 64% and 65%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure in 2021. Also, this range reflects the annual $4 million payment to ICANN, which began this year to support activities to preserve and enhance the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS and the Internet.
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $88 million to $92 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $55 million and $65 million. This range reflects our ongoing investment in our infrastructure as well as an expected 2020 capital spend that moved into 2021.
The GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 20% and 23%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2021 to also be within the same guidance range.
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance throughout last year, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution in 2021.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I also want to acknowledge once more the team here at Verisign for their hard work in maintaining and operating our infrastructure, even during the challenges of working remote during pandemic. Those efforts are undertaken almost entirely behind the scenes that are not well known, but there are many hundreds of dedicated professionals that develop, maintain and operate our purpose-built network and have done so without service interruption for over 23 years. 
Even today, some people may think we still operate an SSL Certificate Authority of PKI business that VeriSign's predecessor RSA Data Security built going all the way back to 1986. That business was sold in 2010, and we have increasingly tightened our focus on our core mission of secure Internet directory and registration services ever since. More information on just what we do today can be found on our homepage at verisign.com.
Now we'd like to walk through your questions, which we believe is on your mind before opening the call for your additional questions. Many of you have asked, are there any updates on the status of .web. As we noted last quarter, a final hearing took place in early August of 2020. We expect a decision from the panel in the coming weeks, but we don't control the timing, and the panel is not operating under any deadline.
And as a reminder, VeriSign is not a party in these IRP proceedings, but was granted the right to participate in certain limited aspects. Also, as a reminder, an IRP under ICANN bylaws is for the purpose of ensuring that ICANN follow the term policies and procedures when making decisions. Our expectation is that following the resolution of the IRP, the ICANN Board will make a final decision on the delegation of the .web TLD. The guidance we provided today does not include revenue or expenses related to .web.
Now we'll open the call to your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

As far as 2021, we expect our expenses to be similar as a percent of revenue next year for most of the categories that we report on with the exception of cost of revenue, which we expect will increase slightly as a percent of revenue for next year.
As far as capital expenditures, as stated in my prepared remarks, capital expenditures are expected to be between $55 million and $65 million. And that again reflects ongoing investment in our infrastructure as well as some expected 2020 capital spend that slipped into 2021.
We -- as I mentioned, we guided between $55 million and $65 million. Last year, we guided between $45 million and $55 million at this time.

So I would say, in general, the trends that we're seeing in the domain name base are similar to the trends we've been seeing in the last few quarters in that registrars from both North America and EMEA are performing very well, and that growth has been slightly offset by some slower activity from registrars based in China.
But as you saw, yes, in the fourth quarter, we had a pretty solid quarter, delivering about 10.5 million registrations, which was up from 10.3 a year ago. And during the year, as we talked about, we have seen some increased demand in those regions from people looking to get online, new business starts and there's been new functionality created in the registrar community from website builders.
As we look into next year, we still see those trends continuing. However, we're not sure how the market will react as we come out of this work-from-home environment. And so we're being -- we typically do have a range this slide going into the year. January is off to a pretty good start. But right now, we sit here, that's our expectation between 2.5% and 4.5%.

Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2021 will be approximately 75.9%. This preliminary rate compares to 75.4% achieved in the first quarter of 2020 and 73.5% last quarter. As we look forward for fiscal 2021, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 4.0% and 5.5%. The  updated range reflects the strength we've witnessed and new additions to the base and our outlook for the balance of the year. 
During the quarter, we continued to deliver solid financial results while maintaining investing in and evolving our critical infrastructure and complying with high operational standards required by our icaN agreements. Our critical infrastructure enables us to reliably and accurately provide the DNS navigation service people around the world rely on for commerce, education, health care and person-to-person connection. Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $1.18 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Share repurchases during the first quarter totaled $173 million for 876,000 shares. 
At quarter end, $910 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. Regarding .web, we have been informed that the independent review process panel formally declared the IRP hearing closed on April 7, 2021. Under the applicable arbitration rules, the IRP panel should now issue a final decision within 60 days from that date. As a reminder, an IRP under ICANN's bylaws is for the purpose of ensuring that Ican followed its own policies and procedures when making decisions. 
Our expectation is that following the resolution of the IRP, the ICANN Board will make the final decision on the delegation of the .web TLD. The updated guidance we're providing today does not include any revenue or expenses related to .web. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the company generated revenue of $324 million, up 3.6% from the same quarter in 2020 and delivered operating income of $210 million, up 2% from $206 million in the same quart",402,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the company generated revenue of $324 million, up 3.6% from the same quarter in 2020 and delivered operating income of $210 million, up 2% from $206 million in the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense totaled $113 million compared to $116 million last quarter and $106 million in the first quarter a year ago. The year-over-year increase in operating expense is primarily a result of incremental and continued operational investments in personnel and infrastructure. The operating margin in the quarter was 65% compared to 66% over the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $150 million compared to $334 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.33 in the first quarter this year compared to $2.86 for the same quarter last year. As noted in our earnings release, net income for the first quarter last year included the recognition of $168 million of previously unrecognized noncash income tax benefits, which increased diluted earnings per share by $1.44. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $198 million, and free cash flow was $192 million compared with $180 million and $169 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. 
The year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by the increased volume of new registrations and renewals, partially offset by higher cash payments for operating expenses. 
I'll now discuss our updated full year 2021 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of [ $1.315 billion ] to [ $1.330 billion ]. This narrowed and increased revenue range forecast reflects the updated domain name base growth rate expectation of between 4% and 5.5% that Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin is still expected to be between 64% and 65%. This guidance reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure and personnel in 2021. 
Capital expenditures are also still expected to be between $55 million and $65 million. The GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 20% and 23%, and we expect the cash tax rate for our 2021 fiscal year to also be within the same guidance range. In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution throughout 2021. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

And as a result, we're seeing registrar spending a lot more money, advertising and marketing to these small businesses to bring them online. And I think that has been helpful for the domain name industry. As far as the economy, the only insight we have there is that registrars just believe that this is -- this trend is a pretty good trend. I think it will continue for the rest of the year.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter of performance for VeriSign.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter of performance for VeriSign. During the first quarter, we saw increased demand for our domain names across most regions as businesses continue to expand their online presence. During the first quarter, we processed 11.6 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 2.8 million names. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled $168 million, consisting of 154.6 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.6%. 
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2021 will be approximately 75.9%. This preliminary rate compares to 75.4% achieved in the first quarter of 2020 and 73.5% last quarter. As we look forward for fiscal 2021, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 4.0% and 5.5%. This updated range reflects the strength we've witnessed in new additions to the base and our outlook for the balance of the year. 
During the quarter, we continued to deliver solid financial results while maintaining, investing in and evolving our critical infrastructure and complying with high operational standards required by our ICANN agreements. Our critical infrastructure enables us to reliably and accurately provide the DNS navigation service people around the world rely on for commerce, education, health care and person-to-person connection. Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $1.18 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Share repurchases during the first quarter totaled $173 million for 876,000 shares. 
At quarter end, $910 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. Regarding .web, we have been informed that the independent review process panel formally declared the IRP hearing closed on April 7, 2021. Under the applicable arbitration rules, the IRP panel should now issue a final decision within 60 days from that date. As a reminder, an IRP, under ICANN's bylaws, is for the purpose of ensuring that Ican followed its own policies and procedures when making decisions. 
Our expectation is that following the resolution of the IRP, the ICANN Board will make the final decision on the delegation of the .web TLD. The updated guidance we're providing today does not include any revenue or expenses related to .web. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the company generated revenue of $324 million, up 3.6% from the same quarter in 2020 and delivered operating income of $210 million, up 2% from $206 million in the same quart",419,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the company generated revenue of $324 million, up 3.6% from the same quarter in 2020 and delivered operating income of $210 million, up 2% from $206 million in the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense totaled $113 million compared to $116 million last quarter and $106 million in the first quarter a year ago. The year-over-year increase in operating expense is primarily a result of incremental and continued operational investments in personnel and infrastructure. The operating margin in the quarter was 65% compared to 66% over the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $150 million compared to $334 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.33 in the first quarter this year compared to $2.86 for the same quarter last year. As noted in our earnings release, net income for the first quarter last year included the recognition of $168 million of previously unrecognized noncash income tax benefits, which increased diluted earnings per share by $1.44. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $198 million, and free cash flow was $192 million compared with $180 million and $169 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. 
The year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by the increased volume of new registrations and renewals, partially offset by higher cash payments for operating expenses. 
I'll now discuss our updated full year 2021 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.315 billion to $1.330 billion. This narrowed and increased revenue range forecast reflects the updated domain name base growth rate expectation of between 4% and 5.5% that Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin is still expected to be between 64% and 65%. This guidance reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure and personnel in 2021. 
Interest expense in nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $88 million to $ 92 million. Capital expenditures are also still expected to be between $55 million and $65 million. The GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 20% and 23%, and we expect the cash tax rate for our 2021 fiscal year to also be within the same guidance range.  
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution throughout 2021.  
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

So I think until that happens, it's premature to discuss exactly when and how .web will be delegated. And then we get it launched then into the hands of consumers. It's just simply too early to speculate about exactly how that will play out. As I mentioned, we do expect that at the a conclusion here when we do see the IRP report that the ICANN Board will then proceed to determine the delegation of .web. When we get to that point, I think, we'll be able to say more about the timing of our own efforts. But until then, it would be premature.

And as a result, we're seeing registrar spending a lot more money, advertising and marketing to these small businesses to bring them online. And I think that has been helpful for the domain name industry. 
As far as the economy, the only insight we have there is that registrars just believe that this is -- this trend is a pretty good trend. I think it'll continue for the rest of the year.

Joining me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and CEO; Todd Strubbe, President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. 
This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available uner About Verisign on verisign.com. There, you will also find our earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site. And within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. 
Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K. 
VeriSign does not update financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP results and 2 non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. 
GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to the slide presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website available after this call. Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter of operational and financial performance for VeriSign. During the second quarter, we saw continued demand for our domain names, including year-over-year growth in new registrations from some of our foreign geographies. 
During the second quarter, we processed 11.7 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 2.59 million names. At the end of June, the domain name based in .com and.net totaled 170.6 million, consisting of 157 million names for .com and 13.6 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 5.2%. 
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2021 will be approximately 75.3%. This preliminary rate compares to 72.8% achieved in the second quarter of 2020 and 76% last quarter. 
As we look at full year 2021, we now expect the domain name base growth rate of between 4.7% and 6%. This range reflects the strength we continue to observe in new additions to the base and our outlook for the balance of the year. 
During the quarter, we continued to deliver solid financial results while maintaining and investing in and evolving our critical infrastructure, and complying with the high operational standards required by our ICANN agreements. 
Our critical infrastructure enables us to reliably and accurately provide the DNS navigation service, which people around the world depend on for commerce, education, health care and person-to-person connection. Just last week, we marked 24 years of uninterrupted availability of our .com and .net domain name resolution system. 
Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $1.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Share repurchases during the second quarter totaled $172 million or 797,000 shares. 
At quarter end, $737 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
Regarding .web, on May 20, a final decision was issued in the independent review process or IRP. The final decision rejected Affiliates' petition to nullify the results of the .web auction and rejected Affiliates' request to be awarded .web. Also, as we had requested, the final decision directed ICANN's Board of Directors to review the objections, including objections as to Affiliates' conduct and to make a determination on the delegation of .web. 
After the final decision was issued, however, Affiliates filed an Appalachian requesting that the IRP panel interpret and amend its final decision. We believe Affiliates' application is without merit and expects the panel -- we expect the panel to rule on it in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
 Thereafter, we expect ICANN's board will proceed consistent with the final decision, and it will make a determination on the delegation of .web. The updated guidance we are providing today does not include revenue or expenses related to .web. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the company generated revenue of $329 million, up 4.8% from the same quarter in 2020 and delivered operating income of $213 million, up 3% from $207 million in the same quarte",501,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the company generated revenue of $329 million, up 4.8% from the same quarter in 2020 and delivered operating income of $213 million, up 3% from $207 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
Operating expense totaled $116 million compared to $113 million last quarter and $108 million in the second quarter a year ago. The year-over-year increase in operating expense is primarily a result of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure and personnel. 
The operating margin in the quarter was 64.7% compared to 65.8% for the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $148 million compared to $152 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.31 in the second quarter this year compared to $1.32 for the same quarter last year. 
During the quarter, the company redeemed and favorably refinanced its $750 million 4.625% senior notes due in 2023 through the issuance of new $750 million 2.7% senior notes, which mature in June 2031. We are pleased with the results of this refinancing, which will result in interest expense savings of over $14 million annually for the company. 
As part of the refinancing, we wrote off $2.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs on the 2023 notes. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $143 million and free cash flow was $125 million compared with $215 million and $204 million, respectively, for the second quarter of 2020. 
The year-over-year difference in operating cash flow primarily relates to cash taxes from a combination of higher cash taxes this year as well as last year's second quarter operating cash flow benefiting from lower cash flow tax payments due to the permitted deferral of approximately $52 million of U.S. federal tax payments until the third quarter of 2020. 
I will now discuss our updated full year 2021 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.322 billion to $1.331 billion. This narrowed and increased revenue range forecast reflects the updated domain name base growth rate expectation of between 4.7% and 6% that Jim mentioned earlier. 
The operating margin is now expected to be between 64.25% and 65%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure and personnel in 2021. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $83 million to $87 million. This reflects lower interest expense following the refinancing that was completed during the second quarter. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be between $55 million and $65 million. The GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 20% and 23%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2021 to also be within the same guidance range. 
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter and we look forward to continuing our focused execution in 2021. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I've updated you on previous earnings calls on our commitment to responsible corporate citizenship, in particular under our VeriSign Cares program. In recent months, we've expanded our work to help those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in a number of ways, including alleviating food and security caused by COVID-related economic hardship in areas where we have a footprint, providing medical and other relief in India where the pandemic took a significant turn for the worse earlier this year, and our ongoing and growing efforts to help those whose jobs or careers have been affected by COVID to retrain and pivot to new careers in the tech industry. 
We've also kept our focus on the area of equity and justice, both working with existing partners and adding new ones. You can read more about all of these initiatives in the new section we added to our investor website this quarter on our ESG work. And now we'll open the call to your questions.

So with regard to domain demand, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks and as you alluded to, we had a very solid quarter from a domain perspective. New units were [ $11.7 million ], and that was up about $600,000",280,"Yes. Thanks, Jim. Rob, this is George. So with regard to domain demand, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks and as you alluded to, we had a very solid quarter from a domain perspective. New units were [ $11.7 million ], and that was up about $600,000 from the year-ago period. As far as regional preferences -- performance goes, I would say that U.S. registrars performed similar to a year ago quarter, with a slight increase in demand coming from various international regions, as Jim mentioned. For example, both China and the EMEA regions were up year-over-year in new registrations. 
As far as renewal rates, as Jim mentioned, our preliminary renewal rate is 75.3%, and that's up from 72.8% a year ago. I would say part of the improvement there relates to a combination of the mixture of first time and previously renewed names with the previously renewed name cohort getting a little larger at the base ages, as well as the geographic mix. 
As you may recall, back in 2019, we had a higher proportion of new units coming out of China. Out of that region, which came up for renewal in 2020, and contributed to a slightly lower average first-time renewal rate in 2020. 
We had more mature regions like the U.S. and EMEA contribute to a larger portion of new unit growth. So those historically higher renewing rate regions have helped our first-time renewal rate a little bit this year. So a combination of those 2 factors, but our first time renewal rates are in the 50% range, and our previous renewal rates are slightly up, but they're in the -- still in the mid-80% range."

We believe Afilias' application is without merit and expects the panel to -- we expect the panel to rule on it in the fourth quarter of 2021. Thereafter, we expect ICANN's Board will proceed consistent with the final decision, and it will make a determination on the delegation of .web. The updated guidance we are providing today does not include revenue or expenses related to .web. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the company generated revenue of $329 million, up 4.8% from the same quarter in 2020 and delivered operating income of $213 million, up 3% from $207 million in the same quarte",501,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the company generated revenue of $329 million, up 4.8% from the same quarter in 2020 and delivered operating income of $213 million, up 3% from $207 million in the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense totaled $116 million compared to $113 million last quarter and $108 million in the second quarter a year ago. 
The year-over-year increase in operating expense is primarily a result of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure and personnel. The operating margin in the quarter was 64.7% compared to 65.8% for the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $148 million compared to $152 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.31 in the second quarter this year compared to $1.32 for the same quarter last year. 
During the quarter, the company redeemed and favorably refinanced its $750 million, 4.25% senior notes due in 2023 through the issuance of new $750 million, 2.7% senior notes, which mature in June 2031. We are pleased with the results of this refinancing, which will result in interest expense savings of over $14 million annually for the company. As part of the refinancing, we wrote off $2.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs on the 2023 notes. 
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $143 million, and free cash flow was $125 million compared with $215 million and $204 million, respectively, for the second quarter of 2020. The year-over-year difference in operating cash flow primarily relates to cash taxes from a combination of higher cash taxes this year as well as last year's second quarter operating cash flow benefiting from lower cash flow tax payments due to the permitted deferral of approximately $52 million of U.S. federal tax payments until the third quarter of 2020. 
I will now discuss our updated full year 2021 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.322 to $1.331 billion. This narrowed and increased revenue range forecast reflects the updated domain name base growth rate expectation of between 4.7% and 6% that Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin is now expected to be between 64.25% and 65%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure and personnel in 2021. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $83 million to $87 million. This reflects lower interest expense following the refinancing that was completed during the second quarter. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $55 million and $65 million. The GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 20% and 23%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2021 to also be within the same guidance range. 
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution in 2021. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I've updated you on previous earnings calls on our commitment to responsible corporate citizenship, in particular, under our VeriSign Cares program. 
In recent months, we've expanded our work to help those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in a number of ways, including alleviating food and security caused by COVID-related economic hardship in areas where we have a footprint, providing medical and other relief in India where the pandemic took a significant turn for the worse earlier this year, and our ongoing and growing efforts to help those jobs or careers have been affected by COVID to retrain and pivot to new careers in the tech industry. 
We've also kept our focus on the area of equity and justice, both working with existing partners and adding new ones. You can read more about all of these initiatives in the new section we added to our investor website this quarter on our ESG work.

So with regard to domain demand, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks and as you alluded to, we had a very solid quarter from a domain perspective. New units were $11.7 million, and that was up about $600,000 from the year ago period. As far as regional preferences -- performance goes, I would say that U.S. registrars performed similar to a year ago quarter, with a slight increase in demand coming from various international regions, as Jim mentioned, for example, both China and the EMEA regions were up year-over-year in new registrations. 
As far as renewal rates, as Jim mentioned, our preliminary renewal rate is 75.3%, and that's up from 72.8% a year ago. I would say part of the improvement there relates to a combination of the mixture of first-time and previously renewed names with the previously renewed name cohort getting a little larger as the base ages as well as the geographic mix. As you may recall, back in 2019, we had a higher proportion of new units coming out of China out of that region, which came up for renewal in 2020 and it contributed to a slightly lower average first-time renewal rate in 2020. 
We had more mature regions, like the U.S. and EMEA, contribute to a larger portion of new unit growth. So those historically higher renewing rate regions have helped our first-time renewal rate a little bit this year. So a combination of those 2 factors, but our first-time renewal rates are in the 50% range in our previous renewal rates are slightly up, but they're and then still in the mid-80% range."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter of operational and financial performance for Verisign. During the second quarter, we saw continued demand for our domain names, including year-over-year growth in new registrations from some of our foreign geographies. 
During the second quarter, we processed 11.7 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 2.59 million names. At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled $170.6 million, consisting of 157 million names for .com and 13.6 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 5.2%. 
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2021 will be approximately 75.3%. This preliminary rate compares to 72.8% achieved in the second quarter of 2020 and 76% last quarter. 
As we look at full year 2021, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 4.7% and 6%. This range reflects the strength we continue to observe in new additions to the base and our outlook for the balance of the year. 
During the quarter, we continued to deliver solid financial results while maintaining, investing in and evolving our critical infrastructure and complying with the high operational standards required by our ICANN agreements. Our critical infrastructure enables us to reliably and accurately provide the DNS navigation service, which people around the world depend on the commerce, education, health care and person-to-person connection. 
Just last week, we marked 24 years of uninterrupted availability of our. com and .net domain name resolution system. Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $1.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Share repurchases during the second quarter totaled $172 million for 797,000 shares. At quarter end, $737 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
Regarding .web, on May 20, a final decision was issued in the independent review process, or IRP. The final decision rejected Afilias' petition to nullify the results of the .web auction and rejected Afilias' request to be awarded .web. Also, as we had requested, the final decision directed ICANN's Board of Directors to review the objections, including objections as to Afilias' conduct and to make a determination on the delegation of .web. 
After the final decision was issued, however, Afilias filed an application requesting that the IRP panel interpret and amend its final decision. We believe Afilias' application is without merit and expects the panel to -- we expect the panel to rule on it in the fourth quarter of 2021. Thereafter, we expect ICANN's Board will proceed consistent with the final decision, and it will make a determination on the delegation of .web. The updated guidance we are providing today does not include revenue or expenses related to .web. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the company generated revenue of $329 million, up 4.8% from the same quarter in 2020 and delivered operating income of $213 million, up 3% from $207 million in the same quarte",501,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the company generated revenue of $329 million, up 4.8% from the same quarter in 2020 and delivered operating income of $213 million, up 3% from $207 million in the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense totaled $116 million compared to $113 million last quarter and $108 million in the second quarter a year ago. 
The year-over-year increase in operating expense is primarily a result of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure and personnel. The operating margin in the quarter was 64.7% compared to 65.8% for the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $148 million compared to $152 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.31 in the second quarter this year compared to $1.32 for the same quarter last year. 
During the quarter, the company redeemed and favorably refinanced its $750 million, 4.25% senior notes due in 2023 through the issuance of new $750 million, 2.7% senior notes, which mature in June 2031. We are pleased with the results of this refinancing, which will result in interest expense savings of over $14 million annually for the company. As part of the refinancing, we wrote off $2.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs on the 2023 notes. 
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $143 million, and free cash flow was $125 million compared with $215 million and $204 million, respectively, for the second quarter of 2020. The year-over-year difference in operating cash flow primarily relates to cash taxes from a combination of higher cash taxes this year as well as last year's second quarter operating cash flow benefiting from lower cash flow tax payments due to the permitted deferral of approximately $52 million of U.S. federal tax payments until the third quarter of 2020. 
I will now discuss our updated full year 2021 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.322 to $1.331 billion. This narrowed and increased revenue range forecast reflects the updated domain name base growth rate expectation of between 4.7% and 6% that Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin is now expected to be between 64.25% and 65%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure and personnel in 2021. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $83 million to $87 million. This reflects lower interest expense following the refinancing that was completed during the second quarter. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $55 million and $65 million. The GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 20% and 23%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2021 to also be within the same guidance range.

I've updated you on previous earnings calls on our commitment to responsible corporate citizenship, in particular, under our Verisign Cares program. 
In recent months, we've expanded our work to help those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in a number of ways, including alleviating food and security caused by COVID-related economic hardship in areas where we have a footprint, providing medical and other relief in India where the pandemic took a significant turn for the worse earlier this year, and our ongoing and growing efforts to help those jobs or careers have been affected by COVID to retrain and pivot to new careers in the tech industry. 
We've also kept our focus on the area of equity and justice, both working with existing partners and adding new ones. You can read more about all of these initiatives in the new section we added to our investor website this quarter on our ESG work. 
And now we'll open the call to your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

So with regard to domain demand, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks and as you alluded to, we had a very solid quarter from a domain perspective. New units were $11.7 million, and that was up about $600,000 from the year ago period. As far as regional preferences -- performance goes, I would say that U.S. registrars performed similar to a year ago quarter, with a slight increase in demand coming from various international regions, as Jim mentioned, for example, both China and the EMEA regions were up year-over-year in new registrations. 
As far as renewal rates, as Jim mentioned, our preliminary renewal rate is 75.3%, and that's up from 72.8% a year ago. I would say part of the improvement there relates to a combination of the mixture of first-time and previously renewed names with the previously renewed name cohort getting a little larger as the base ages as well as the geographic mix. As you may recall, back in 2019, we had a higher proportion of new units coming out of China out of that region, which came up for renewal in 2020 and it contributed to a slightly lower average first-time renewal rate in 2020. 
We had more mature regions, like the U.S. and EMEA, contribute to a larger portion of new unit growth. So those historically higher renewing rate regions have helped our first-time renewal rate a little bit this year. So a combination of those 2 factors, but our first-time renewal rates are in the 50% range in our previous renewal rates are slightly up, but they're and then still in the mid-80% range."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter of operational and financial performance for VeriSign. During the quarter, we continued to deliver strong financial results while maintaining, investing in and evolving our critical internet infrastructure and complying with the high operational standards required by our ICANN agreements. Our critical infrastructure enables us to reliably and accurately provide the domain name system navigation service, which people around the world depend on for commerce, education, health care and person-to-person connection. 
During the third quarter, we processed 10.7 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.48 million names. At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 172.1 million, consisting of 158.6 million names for .com and 13.5 million names for .net. with a year-over-year growth rate of 5.1%. 
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2021 will be approximately 75%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.7% achieved in the third quarter of 2020 and 75.4% last quarter. 
For the full year 2021, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 4.7% and 5.5%. This narrower range reflects the current pace of new additions to the base and our outlook for the remainder of the year. 
Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Share repurchases during the third quarter totaled $172 million for 785,000 shares. At quarter end, $565 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
As it relates to .web, and as we stated last quarter, after the final IRP decision was issued in May Afilias' filed in June an application requesting that the IRP panel interpret and amend its final decision. The briefing on this application was completed in September, and the panel has now taken the matter under advisement without oral argument, which means we're just waiting for the IRP panel to respond. VeriSign believes Afilias' application is without merit, and we continue to expect the panel to rule on it in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
As we have said before, we continue to look forward to becoming the Web registry operator and establishing it as an additional option for businesses and individual end users worldwide. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the quarter ended September 30, 2021, the company generated revenue of $334 million, up 5.1% from the same quarter in 2020 and delivered operating income of $221 million, up 7.1% from the $207 million in the",461,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone.

Operating expense totaled $113 million compared to $116 million last quarter and $111 million in the third quarter last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 66.2% compared to 64.7% last quarter and 65% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $157 million compared to $171 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.40 in the third quarter this year compared to $1.49 for the same quarter last year. As noted in our earnings release, net income for the third quarter of last year included previously unrecognized tax benefits of $24 million, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.21. 
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $260 million and free cash flow was $245 million compared with $140 million and $125 million, respectively, for the third quarter of 2020. Cash flow this quarter benefited from an increase of $45 million of deferred revenue, which was primarily related to early domain name renewal activity before the .com price increase went into effect. The main impact of these early renewals is the pulling forward of cash flow from future quarters into the third quarter of this year. Additionally, comparing year-over-year third quarter cash flow, last year's third quarter cash flow was lower due to the permitted deferral of approximately $52 million of U.S. federal tax payments from the second quarter to the third quarter of 2020. 
I'll now discuss our updated full year 2021 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.330 billion. This narrowed revenue range reflects the updated domain name base growth rate expectation of between 4.7% and 5.5%, as Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin is now expected to be between 64.8% and 65.3%. This range reflects our expectation of incremental spend on marketing programs and continued investment in our operational infrastructure and personnel during the fourth quarter. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $83 million to $87 million. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $55 million and $60 million. And the GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 20% and 23%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2021 to also be within the same guidance range. 
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I've updated you in previous earnings calls on our commitment to responsible corporate citizenship principally through our VeriSign Cares program. During the third quarter, we established 3 new partnerships under the VeriSign Cares workforce retraining initiative. This greatly increases both the number of individuals we can help and our geographical coverage. Combined, our partners now reach dollars in 17 states plus the District of Columbia with remote options accessible throughout the U.S., and our partner organizations have expansion plans of their own, which we're pleased to support. 
We're delighted to note that our launch partner for this initiative, Virginia Ready, recently passed the milestone of 3,000 scholars who have graduated from their program. And as a reminder, the objective of the VeriSign Cares program is to address pressing economic and social needs in the communities in which we live and work. We instituted this workforce retraining initiative in 2020 to provide individuals whose employment has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with access to training and other assistance to help them pivot into the technology sector.

Now they're improving again. 
I don't know exactly how the timing maps to that. But certainly, that does have some effect. And we can't tell you yet. We haven't studied it sufficiently to tell you exactly what that might do. So certainly, all of those things are factored. Business starts are a factor. But essentially, COM is a strong brand. People are branding themselves. People are acquiring domain names.

And I think as we talked about last quarter, if you look back at 2019, we had a lot of higher percentage of names coming out of registrars from China and other areas that typically have lower first-time renewal rates in 2020. We had more demand coming out of more mature markets like the U.S. and EMEA, which had higher renewal rates. And so those names, obviously, last year are the ones that are renewing this year.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter of operational and financial performance for Verisign. During the quarter, we continued to deliver strong financial results while maintaining, investing in and evolving our critical internet infrastructure and complying with the high operational standards required by our ICANN agreements. Our critical infrastructure enables us to reliably and accurately provide the domain name system navigation service, which people around the world depend on for commerce, education, health care and person-to-person connection. 
During the third quarter, we processed 10.7 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.48 million names. At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 172.1 million, consisting of 158.6 million names for .com and 13.5 million names for .net. with a year-over-year growth rate of 5.1%. 
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2021 will be approximately 75%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.7% achieved in the third quarter of 2020 and 75.4% last quarter. 
For the full year 2021, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 4.7% and 5.5%. This narrower range reflects the current pace of new additions to the base and our outlook for the remainder of the year. 
Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Share repurchases during the third quarter totaled $172 million for 785,000 shares. At quarter end, $565 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
As it relates to .web, and as we stated last quarter, after the final IRP decision was issued in May, Afilias filed in June an application requesting that the IRP panel interpret and amend its final decision. The briefing on this application was completed in September, and the panel has now taken the matter under advisement without oral argument, which means we're just waiting for the IRP panel to respond. Verisign believes Afilias' application is without merit, and we continue to expect the panel to rule on it in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
As we have said before, we continue to look forward to becoming the .web registry operator and establishing it as an additional option for businesses and individual end users worldwide. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the quarter ended September 30, 2021, the company generated revenue of $334 million, up 5.1% from the same quarter in 2020 and delivered operating income of $221 million, up 7.1% from the $207 million in th",461,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. 
For the quarter ended September 30, 2021, the company generated revenue of $334 million, up 5.1% from the same quarter in 2020 and delivered operating income of $221 million, up 7.1% from the $207 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
Operating expense totaled $113 million compared to $116 million last quarter and $111 million in the third quarter last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 66.2% compared to 64.7% last quarter and 65% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $157 million compared to $171 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.40 in the third quarter this year compared to $1.49 for the same quarter last year. As noted in our earnings release, net income for the third quarter of last year included previously unrecognized tax benefits of $24 million, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.21. 
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $260 million and free cash flow was $245 million compared with $140 million and $125 million, respectively, for the third quarter of 2020. Cash flow this quarter benefited from an increase of $45 million of deferred revenue, which was primarily related to early domain name renewal activity before the .com price increase went into effect. The main impact of these early renewals is the pulling forward of cash flow from future quarters into the third quarter of this year. Additionally, comparing year-over-year third quarter cash flow, last year's third quarter cash flow was lower due to the permitted deferral of approximately $52 million of U.S. federal tax payments from the second quarter to the third quarter of 2020. 
I'll now discuss our updated full year 2021 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.330 billion. This narrowed revenue range reflects the updated domain name base growth rate expectation of between 4.7% and 5.5% that Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin is now expected to be between 64.8% and 65.3%. This range reflects our expectation of incremental spend on marketing programs and continued investment in our operational infrastructure and personnel during the fourth quarter. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $83 million to $87 million. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $55 million and $60 million. And the GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 20% and 23%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2021 to also be within the same guidance range. 
In summary, Verisign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

Before we open the call for your questions, I would like to touch on some other things that we continue to do here at Verisign. I've updated you in previous earnings calls on our commitment to responsible corporate citizenship principally through our Verisign Cares program. During the third quarter, we established 3 new partnerships under the Verisign Cares workforce retraining initiative. This greatly increases both the number of individuals we can help and our geographical coverage. Combined, our partners now reach dollars in 17 states plus the District of Columbia with remote options accessible throughout the U.S., and our partner organizations have expansion plans of their own, which we're pleased to support. 
We're delighted to note that our launch partner for this initiative, Virginia Ready, recently passed the milestone of 3,000 scholars who have graduated from their program. And as a reminder, the objective of the Verisign Cares program is to address pressing economic and social needs in the communities in which we live and work. We instituted this workforce retraining initiative in 2020 to provide individuals whose employment has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with access to training and other assistance to help them pivot into the technology sector.

I don't know if I can map with any specificity activity in the domain name space, specifically with any quarterly economic activity. I can tell you that COVID has certainly been a factor. We've seen up and downs with COVID, of course, from early 2020 on through where things improved a bit, then we saw the Delta variant and things went in the wrong direction. Now they're improving again. 
I don't know exactly how the timing maps to that. But certainly, that does have some effect. And we can't tell you yet. We haven't studied it sufficiently to tell you exactly what that might do. So certainly, all of those things are factored. Business starts are a factor. But essentially, com is a strong brand. People are branding themselves. People are acquiring domain names. They're the preferred way to have their identity online. And I think you see that the long-term trend line is not only in the right direction, but I think generally consistent with our yearly performance and seasonality. There's just no doubt a COVID influence that we can't map with any precision for you right now."

And then, George, one for you. Just on the strong margin performance this quarter. And I know you guys have made a series of investments over the past year plus, both in security, timely ones as well as infrastructure and provisioning as well as people.

So when you look at our operating expenses, clearly, the sequential decrease is primarily due to a mix of the small decrease in G&A spending and some marketing activity in the quarter. And as you mentioned, year-over-year, we have a slight increase from our continued investment in our operational infrastructure and personnel. 
Again, I would say we are managing the total expenses of the business as best we can. And we continue to look at where we're spending money and making sure we're spending them in the right areas. And if we're not, we're redirecting that into the business. 
We provided guidance on our operating margin for the full year of 64.8% to 65.3%. And we'll give you some additional guidance on our year-end call as to what we think next year is. But we do have up and downs each quarter, but we continue to make the investments that we feel are appropriate for the business."

We have to let people who have trademarks come in and get theirs first. So it's a bit early to speculate exactly when, but the answer is closer to a couple of quarters.

They were both in the mid-70% range. What I think you're alluding to is a year ago, our renewal rate was 73.7%. And so when you look at the year-over-year improvement, a lot of that does come from the mix of the names coming up for renewal. And I think as we talked about last quarter, if you look back at 2019, we had a lot of higher percentage of names coming out of registrars from China and other areas that typically have lower first-time renewal rates in 2020. We had more demand coming out of more mature markets like the U.S. and EMEA, which had higher renewal rates. And so those names, obviously, last year are the ones that are renewing this year. And so you're seeing a slightly higher renewal rate trend this year compared to last year because the first time and the previous renewed rates are increasing because of the mix. And that's been consistent both in the first quarter and the second quarter of this year."

There are certainly -- the infrastructure that we have is, in a sense -- since we operate multiple TLDs, .web is, in a sense, another TLD.
