I hope that everyone joining us today as well as your loved ones remain healthy and safe. 
Similar to our last few earnings calls, we will focus our commentary today on the progress of our response to the global COVID-19 pandemic; the overall booking and pricing environment, which has shown particular strength in recent weeks; and our view of what the month ahead may look like as we prepare for an eventual return to service. 
To say that 2020 what's challenging would be an incredible understatement as it was, without a doubt, the toughest and most difficult year in our company's 50-plus year history. After a record-breaking 2019, the foundation was well set for 2020 to be even a more successful year. That upward trajectory, however, quickly changed last March. And 2020 instead became a year of great hardship and disappointment and one in which we had to rely on our nimbleness and our ability to adapt by taking swift, proactive and decisive actions to overcome the multifaceted challenges presented by the pandemic. 
These actions included bringing our entire fleet to a halt literally overnight, followed by the complex logistics of safely returning more than 50,000 of our guests home. Next came the challenge of repatriating over 25,000 of our crew members and finding safe haven for our 28 vessels, all while transitioning them to various states of reduced manning. 
We quickly bolstered our liquidity through multiple capital market transactions, totaling in excess of $6 billion and led the industry in establishing cutting-edge health and safety standards through the cofounding of the Healthy Sail Panel. I'm incredibly proud and profoundly grateful for the dedication and perseverance demonstrated by our team members who will continue to adapt, innovate and flawlessly execute while faced with unprecedented challenges. The tremendous efforts of our team are what have enabled our company to prove our resilience time and again in the past and gives me confidence we will do so again. 
As we survey the current public health situation, both in America and around the world, it is extraordinary to consider just how much has transpired in the few months since our last update. As expected, the fourth quarter resurgence of the virus drove caseloads to record highs, resulting in renewed lockdown and stricter global travel restrictions. During this time, perhaps the most important breakthrough, though, was the needed -- to defeat the pandemic was the coming online of several vaccines that were authorized for emergency use. Fast forward to today and caseloads across the globe have been in decline since mid-January, while simultaneously, vaccination programs are ramping up where currently over 6 million doses are being administered globally daily, a number that will only increase as manufacturing, distribution and health care systems align.
So where does that put us in the cruise industry? In reality, we're not sure. But directionally, we're headed in the right direction to an eventual restart of cruising. Public health experts do predict that caseloads, while already on the downside, will continue to decline primarily for 3 reasons: first, a significant portion of the population has already been infected and recovered; second, the number of individuals vaccinated will rapidly increase; and lastly, we will soon move into the less troublesome spring and summer season. All 3 of these factors are expected to combine to begin establishing herd immunity sometime during the third quarter with the spread of variants and the durability of vaccine protection being the 2 main variables that could slow down, but not completely halt, the rapid progress being made. 
And while we are moving in the right direction, scientists continue to caution that we are not yet out of the woods, the crisis is far from over, and we must all remain vigilant and ready to adapt to the ongoing fluidity of the public health environment. Our industry has recently seen some encouraging green shoots. After the first quarter resurgence caused nascent cruise operations in Europe to temporarily halt, several European cruise lines have since resumed or are planning to return to service in the next few weeks, sourcing EU nationals from Italy and Germany. The hope and expectation is that by late spring, sailings will expand to include cross-border European nationals, and eventually, likely during the third quarter, international guests, as virus prevalence decreases to manageable levels. 
Shifting to our company's recent events since our last earnings call, several key milestones marked the fourth quarter, which can be found on Slide 3 of our presentation. These include 2 capital raises, resulting in approximately $1.7 billion of additional liquidity; new debt deferral amendments providing additional financial flexibility; and continued progress on our environmental, social and governance initiatives, which I will touch on in more detail later in the call. 
On Slide 4, we outlined the actions we have undertaken as we continue to navigate through this crisis, remaining focused on what we can control. Subsequent to the issuance of the CDC's Conditional Sail Order in October, we anticipated a return to service in the first quarter of 2021. Since it takes up to 90 days to ready a ship to reenter servers from layup status, we initiated a phased crew restaffing of select vessels and began a ramping up of marketing activities. This initiative, unfortunately, was met with several headwinds, most notably, the rise of confirmed cases to all-time high, and the emergence of new variants, which combined with a slower-than-anticipated rollout of vaccination programs, additional lockdowns and travel restrictions, continued closure of key ports around the world and, most important, the reluctance by public health authorities to lift cruise suspension. These headwinds caused us to change course. With a much hope for a Q1 relaunch postponed, the decision was made to return vessels to reduce manning status until there is certainty on the timing for a return to service. 
With new crew rested, ready and eager to work, we took the opportunity to rotate certain crew that had been onboard beyond their usual contracted term and made the difficult decision to repatriate 4,000 crew members back to their home countries. Next, we continue to execute on our strategic financial action plan, which Mark will provide an update on, and on the incremental actions we have taken to bolster liquidity a little later in the call. 
Turning to our road map to relaunch, which is illustrated on Slide 5. We continue to work with the Healthy Sail Panel, along with the CDC and other public health authorities and governments across the globe, to prepare for a safe and healthy resumption of cruising. As we await for additional technical guidelines from the CDC and other public health officials around the world, we continue to make progress on enhancing our already rigorous health and safety standards, implementing new advancements, including digital technology for contract tracing as well as streamlining safety drills with our state-of-the-art e-mustering technology. While we are confident in the ability of the 74 protocols developed by the Healthy Sail Panel to keep our ships, crew and guests safe, our frontline defense strategy has expanded from protocol-led preventive measures to now also include the protective health and safety benefits of vaccines. 
We view vaccine as a powerful tool, the most powerful tool, that when combined with various protective measures society is already accustomed to, such as space covering and physical distancing, forms a multilayered, science-based approach to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 infection. We expect that by the time cruising resumes, vaccination will most certainly be widely available in the developed world. And we believe that by then, we will be able to secure vaccines for our crew as we are today well along in the procurement process. 
A mix of vaccinated guests and crew, along with the other established protocols, will provide a powerful combination to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 onboard our ships and the communities we visit. Ports and destinations is the next step of our road map, and we are in constant communication with key ports around the world to assess the status of travel restrictions, quarantine requirements and port availability. Of particular importance to the industry was the recent announcement by Canadian authorities to restrict cruise vessels from operating in Canadian waters through February of 2022. Throughout this pandemic, the travel industry has experienced the introduction, subsequent repeal and reintroduction of lockdowns and travel restrictions depending on the prevalence of the virus and other factors. Thankfully, the Canadian order allows for the suspension to be rescinded based on improvements in public health. 
We remain cautiously optimistic that a recision may be possible. And in the meantime, we await the results of several Alaskan delegation-led initiatives, which we want to acknowledge today and greatly appreciate that may allow Alaska Cruises to operate in 2021. 
The third step in our road map is to begin reactivating our sales and marketing machine, which, as you know, is guided by our industry-leading market-to-fill versus discount-to-fill strategy. We have revalidated the effectiveness of this strategy in the pandemic environment, generating demand for the back half of 2021 and especially strong demand into 2022 and beyond. We will resume a disciplined process of ramping up sales and marketing efforts once we finalize an initial voyage resumption plan. 
Lastly, and once there is certainty, we continue to expect a gradual and phased approach to the resumption of cruise voyages. Depending on the timing of our return to service, our vessels could return in certain regions before others. For example, given the seasonality of our operations, a typical year, the deployment of our vessel is concentrated in Europe during the peak summer season with 17 of our 28 ships operating in this region. Therefore, seasonality will likely play a key role in the initial deployment of our vessels. 
Our booking trends that you can see on Slide 6 demonstrate how we continue to experience strong demand for future cruise vacations despite the uncertainties in the broad travel sector, the reduction of demand-generating marketing investments and the temporary absence of a full complement of our all-important travel agent partners. For the second half of 2021, our load factor is below historical ranges, impacted by continued uncertainty around timing of the resumption of cruising and the shift of our limited marketing investments to focus on '22 -- 2022 voyages. Pricing continues to be at [indiscernible] level despite the dilutive impact of the value-added future cruise credits for canceled voyages. And while it is still early in the booking cycle, we are very encouraged and very pleased by the strong booking activity, driven by pent-up demand across all 3 brands for 2022 voyages. 
Volumes during January and February sequentially improved by over 40% from November and December 2020. And as an added bonus, over 80% of these bookings were new cash bookings. For the first half of 2022 and for all of 2022, in fact, our load factor is currently well ahead of prepandemic levels with pricing at each of our award-winning brands in line to up mid-single digits when excluding the diluted impacts of future crew certificates. 
The consumer appetite for global travel for our 28 vessels is so strong that even with limited marketing investments, we are yielding outsized results, and we are experiencing record demand with our launches for our future itineraries and global voyage collections. A case in point is Oceana Cruise's 2023 World Cruise, which sold out within 1 day of opening for sales of the general public. In addition to our loyal pass guests, approximately 1/3 of all bookings for this group came from first-time new-to-brand guests. We believe this achievement, along with multiple booking records we have announced in recent months, demonstrates the pent-up demand that exists from our mature and affluent cruisers even for long and exotic voyages once the severe impact of the pandemic subsides. This demand, coupled with the opening of voyages for sale further in advance, has also resulted in a significant expansion to the booking curve during the fourth quarter, which is now double versus the same time last year. 
I'll be back later to provide closing remarks. But for now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark?"

The global pandemic continues to evolve, and we continue to focus on what we can control and we are prepared to adapt",1221,"Thank you, Frank. My remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 action plan as well as our road map to relaunch. The global pandemic continues to evolve, and we continue to focus on what we can control and we are prepared to adapt and modify our strategy as needed. Slide 7 illustrates 3 focus areas of our action plan and the additional proactive measures taken since the beginning of the fourth quarter. 
First, we have reduced operating expenses and capital expenditures through a number of initiatives, including the further reduction or deferral of near-term marketing expenses, reduction of nonessential capital expenditures, extended salary reductions and furloughs for shoreside team members. In fact, we reduced capital expenditures by approximately 60% for each of the years 2020 and 2021. In addition, we finalized the deferral of EUR 220 million of newbuilding-related shipyard payments through the end of the first quarter 2022. 
Second, we have also made significant progress on improving our debt maturity profile in order to provide additional near-term financial flexibility through the following actions: we amended our Pride of America, Norwegian Jewel and senior secured credit facilities to suspend testing of certain covenants. This covenant relief extends through maturity for the Pride of America and Jewel facilities and through year-end 2022 for the senior secured credit facility. We were also able to defer $70 million of amortization payments due prior to June 30, 2022, for the senior secured credit facility. 
Second, we secured deferrals for approximately $680 million of our export credit agency-backed amortization payments, representing 100% of our ECA payments originally due through the first quarter of 2022. We also received covenant waivers through the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 on our ECA facilities. 
We have tremendous support behind us from our strong, long-standing relationships with our export credit agencies, Sace and Hermes, our ECA and commercial lenders as well as the shipyard. Their assistance is playing a significant role in our ability to weather this pandemic, and we can't thank them enough for their continued and ongoing partnership during these unprecedented times. 
The final focus area of our action plan was securing additional capital. In the fourth quarter, we executed 2 highly successful transactions. In November, we raised $824 million of net proceeds through an equity offering of 40 million ordinary shares. And in December, we issued 850 million of 5 7/8% senior unsecured notes due 2026 in an oversubscribed offering. 
To date, we've accessed the capital markets 5x over a 9-month period. As a result, since the onset of the pandemic, we raised incremental cash of nearly $6.5 billion, including the drawdown of the $875 million revolver early last year. This tremendous accomplishment would not have been possible without the hard work of our finance, treasury, legal and accounting teams who have worked tirelessly around the clock to execute on these initiatives. We have also experienced an incredible outpouring of support from our investors. And again, we can't thank you enough for having conviction in our business model, in our management team and in the long-term potential of our company. 
Slide 8 outlines the improvement of our debt maturity profile in response to the crisis. Since the third quarter, we secured debt amortization deferrals of approximately $750 million, resulting in minimal debt service payments for the remainder of 2021. 
Turning to liquidity. Slide 9 provides our current illustrative liquidity profile. Our total liquidity as of year-end was approximately $3.2 billion, which includes the portion of customer deposit refunds that are included in accounts payable at quarter end. We have also estimated approximately $300 million for anticipated health and safety investments and other collateral obligations. While we anticipate variability in our health and safety investments as we work through the various requirements and continuously improve and refine our protocols, we wanted to earmark this investment in our illustrative liquidity profile. These factors combined result in a net liquidity on a pro forma basis of approximately $2.9 billion, enabling us to continue to navigate through the fluid environment and execute on our return to service plan. 
As for cash burn, our team continues to work day in and day out to further reduce expenses and conserve cash. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have made significant progress in reducing our controllable cash burn rate with the low watermark representing a nearly 80% reduction in cruise operating expenses versus normalized levels. For the fourth quarter, our average monthly cash burn rate was approximately $190 million. This included approximately $15 million per month due to additional expenses related to preparing vessels for a potential return to service in early 2021 and included a limited increase in associated marketing investments as Frank discussed earlier. 
As for the first quarter, we expect the average cash burn to temporarily remain elevated at approximately $190 million per month or approximately $170 million per month, excluding nondebt recurring -- nonrecurring debt modification costs as we ramp down our relaunch-related expenses and repatriate crew. The approximately $60 million of onetime costs we incurred in the quarter is a result of debt deferrals and covenant waivers and suspensions, which, when combined with the newbuild payment extensions, have resulted in approximately $1 billion of additional liquidity over the next 12 months. 
Once the ramp down of relaunch-related expenses, including crew repatriation efforts are complete, we expect that the average cash burn rate to decrease and remain at reduced levels until return to service preparations resume. We will continue to take a thoughtful and disciplined approach to reintroducing costs as we resume voyages in order to conserve cash, while at the same time, balance the need to drive new cash bookings. 
Turning to Slide 10. We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $3.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash balance in the fourth quarter increased, driven by approximately $1.7 billion of net proceeds from capital raises and was partially offset by approximately $570 million of operating cash burn, which includes operating expenses, SG&A, interest and CapEx, customer cash refunds for canceled voyages of approximately $120 million and net working capital and other outflows of approximately $20 million, which includes health and safety investments. Given the continued uncertainty around the timing of our voyage resumption, we are not yet prepared to provide guidance on all metrics. However, we have provided guidance on depreciation and amortization, interest expense and newbuild-related capital expenditures to assist with modeling, which can be found in our earnings release and on slide 19 of the presentation. Broadly speaking, excluding newbuild-related capital expenditures, we still expect the minimum required capital expenditures needed to run the business and maintain our best-in-class fleets is generally a few hundred million dollars per year. 
Before handing the call back, I want to re-emphasize that while we are prioritizing our immediate business needs, we are also very focused on the future of our company. Our medium- and long-term financial recovery plan, which is provided on Slide 11, focuses on 3 critical components: first, rebuild and gradually return to pre-COVID margin levels while continuing to identify opportunities to further drive margin expansion; second, maximize our cash generation; and third, focus on optimizing our balance sheet and charting a path to delever. 
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank to provide closing commentary. Frank?"

Before we wrap up our prepared remarks today, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, which is on Slide 12. 
Despite the current public health challenges we face, our commitment to protect and preserve our oceans, the environment and the destinations we visit while enhancing our culture of diversity, equity and inclusion in the workforce remains at the very core of our everyday operation. To that end, in 2020, we launched unconscious bias, micro aggression and diversity and inclusion training for our global workforce and have committed to expand our diverse hiring practices. 
We are also building upon our supplier diversity program as part of our efforts to facilitate and encourage the growth of small and diverse businesses. We strive to maintain a supportive and empowering workplace for our team members across the globe. We believe our team members are, by far, our most important resource, and that has never been clearer to me than during this crisis. We are pleased that this commitment to our team's development and well-being was recognized recently with our naming to the Forbes Americas Best Employers List in which we ranked among the top 75 companies in the overall large employer category and among the top 10 companies in the travel and leisure sector. 
Just as we support our team members, we are also committed to supporting our local communities and the destinations we visit. This past year, we launched 2 initiatives in partnership with JUST Goods. For Giving Tuesday, we matched every case of JUST Water purchased in December through their online store with a water donation to local food banks in Miami and New York City. Separately, we provided nearly $275,000 of in-kind donations in the form of JUST Water and nonperishable and canned goods to support 2 community organization and assist ongoing relief efforts in the archipelago of San Andres in Colombia after the devastating impact of Category 5 Hurricane Iota. Furthering our partnership with JUST Goods, we are also currently in the process of organizing several truckloads of JUST Water donations to benefit food banks located in areas around the Southwest of the United States that have been severely affected by the recent winter storms. 
Dedication to family and community is ingrained in our culture. And to further demonstrate this commitment, beginning this year, we are offering our U.S. shoreside team members a paid volunteer day to give back to community programs of their choice. On the environmental front, we are proud to have improved our score in our second CDP climate change submission to a B, which is higher than the marine transport sector, North America and global average. For 2021, we will be focused on enhancing our ESG disclosures to provide additional transparency. I look forward to sharing additional details with you as we continue on our ESG journey. 
Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to leave you with a few final key takeaways. First, we are focused on the execution of our road map to relaunch as quickly as possible, and we'll continue to work with our expert advisers, global public health authorities and government agencies to refine our science-backed plans for a swift, safe and healthy return to cruising. 
Second, strong future demand for cruising across all brands, source markets and deployments continue. And early indications for 2022 bookings are extremely positive with load factors besting our previous high by a substantial margin. Lastly, we continue to keep our longer-term strategic and financial priorities in focus, and we will be ready to execute on our recovery plans to improve our balance sheet. 
The strong future demand we are experiencing, coupled with the positive momentum in the public health front, bodes extremely well for our prospects. And with that, Josh, please, let's open the call for questions. Thank you."

We're encouraged that the situation with Alaska and the Canadian closure until spring of '22 has been noted by various government officials, and they're trying to do their best. As you know, tourism is the third largest industry in Alaska. And for certain Alaskan coastal communities, cruising is over 90% of their tourism business. And so if we can't operate in Alaska in 2021, that will be 2 years that they will go without this infusion of business activity, and that's going to be difficult for them. And so we're hopeful, cautiously optimistic. It's a lot of hoops to jump through, both from the Canadian side and also, let's face it, we cannot operate as of today in U.S. waters and Alaska waters. So we have suspended taking new bookings on Alaska. I think the whole industry has. But we do hope -- we do hold out some hope that these initiatives, led by the Alaskan delegation, can open up Alaska for 2021."

I think there -- let's clarify a couple of things. The CDC guidance that we, as an industry, are expecting sometime in the future. And I won't label it as a few days because I simply don't know.

And I won't label it as a few days because I simply don't know. It could be a few days. It could be a few weeks. we simply don't know. 
That doesn't -- that is the next phase, the next phase of this multiphased approach that the CDC is taking. I don't believe that we are awaiting in the next few days the green light to cruise. That would not be correct. 
But in terms of our decision to pull back -- look, when the CDC Conditional Sail Order first came out, there was a great expectation. We had a Conditional Sail Order, and it proved to be more difficult than we first expected. We also were in the middle of a spike in the number of cases. And so it became obvious to us that the the initial expectation that maybe the industry could begin to cruise in the first quarter, which, as you know, is heavily focused on Caribbean theater of operations was not going to take place. And so we took the difficult decision to reduce our cash burn, repatriate those crew members back home and cut down on the marketing expenses that we have begun to ramp up to -- along with the ships that we thought we could operate. 
And so today, I would tell you that we are in a better place, a more encouraging place than we were even just 6 weeks ago. At the end of the day, I think the prevalence of the disease in our own country and around the world will be the greatest indicator of when we can resume cruising. 
And the prevalence is dropping. And we believe, based on all the experts that we talk to, including a Healthy Sail Panel that we're going to see a continuation of the significant drop in cases as we enter spring/summer, as we continue to vaccinate over 1.5 million Americans a day, as more people get infected and recover. So all those things point into a direction where the prevalence should drop considerably, giving us a better opportunity to restart operations."

But we generally believe that from the moment that we get the green light, depending on where the ships are that you want to stand up, depending on the seasonality, summer is a -- where are the ships in summer? Generally, they're in Europe. They're in Alaska. Where are they in the fall/winter? They're primarily in the Caribbean, Mexico, [indiscernible] around the world. 
But I think for planning purposes, we'd like to give ourselves that 90-day window, more or less. And so we've canceled cruises through the end of May. So if you count with your fingers, we -- it's basically March 1, so all of March, all of April, all of May. And it's sequential. We keep bookings and cruising -- cruises available as long as we believe there is a chance that we can operate. Once we know we start entering that 90-day-or-so window, and we owe it to everyone in the ecosystem, whether it's travel agents, consumers, our own employees, the crew to cancel cruises in the future. So we're always hopeful that the public health situation improves and that we can restart as soon as we possibly can."

But I wanted to dig in a little bit more into your luxury brands given the the strong pent-up demand we have seen from the 60-plus age demographic across other consumer verticals.

Look, early in the pandemic, people were writing off the mature market. And it's been anything but that. So as you know, the upscale brands tend to book further out than the contemporary brand partly because of the itineraries. The longer, more exotic itineraries, everything else being equal, people book further out. And so we're continuing to see that. 
I mean both Oceania and Regent are nearly 40% -- 40% booked for 2022. That's much better than they've ever been at this stage of the booking cycle. And so these are folks who are typically over the age of 65. The average age of Oceania and Regent is consistently in the 66, 67 age range. And these are the folks who are getting the vaccine first. And they've been cooped up, and they want to go out. I mean they're no different than 40-year olds or 30-year olds. They've got the money, and they're booking further and further out. As we said in our prepared remarks, the booking curve is now double what it normally is. And that's because of 2 reasons: one, there are literally no bookings being made for the next 3 or 4 months sailing because they've been canceled, and people are booking further and further out. People know that this pandemic will end someday. And that someday is tomorrow, but further out. 
So we have more visibility today in our future business than we've ever had. And so that's one of the things that encourages me the most. I mean I have a lot of things to worry about these days, Steve. Fundamental consumer demand and our ability to fill our ships at strong pricing is not one of them. And to be able to do what we're doing in terms of the load factors and new bookings new cash bookings with the de minimis amount of marketing that we're doing, with the travel agency system being less than 100%, it's truly remarkable and again points to what we've been saying per year, the resiliency of the consumer, the resiliency of those who love to cruise. It's a great value. That hasn't changed. And people are going to get back to the high seas. There's no question about that."

What we have said in the past is that we think that from whatever date that it is that we start, it will likely take 6 to 7 months, assuming that the ports are open around the world. Remember, our ships are seasonal. One of the requirements is that the ports be open, the travel restrictions be lifted. So assuming that those hurdles are cleared, physically, we think it will take 6, 7 months, so roughly a ship a week. And so for us to be 100% operative, we would have to start standing up vessels in the June, July time frame of this year, so that we can be 100% by year-end, early '22."

But since the fall, at least, when we do cancel a set of sailings, like we recently did for the month of May of '22, everyone gets a cash refund. We're no longer offering the option of an FCC or cash. We have the liquidity. FCCs are dilutive to future business. We don't want to negatively impact future business anymore than the dilutive effect of the existing FCCs. So today, there is no choice, you get your money back. 
And in terms of the percentage of FCCs that have been redeemed, it varies by brand. But at the consolidated age level, roughly 40% of all FCCs that we have issued over time have now been redeemed. So there still remains 60% of the FCCs issued in that bucket of folks who've got an ability to rebook. And look, we -- somehow, in some quarters of the investment world, perhaps, FCC bookings are seen as not as good as a cash booking. I think they're both important. Customers who took an FCC showed a great deal of confidence and support in our business. And we want to make sure that they get their cruise. And so if we have to extend the booking date or if we have to extend the sailing date as the suspensions continue, we will do so. We actively encourage people to redeem their FCC. We want them to take a cruise. And we also want to be able to clear the deck, so to speak, as soon as possible.

Some of that is lingering into Q1 as well with the start-up activities. 
And then beyond that, in this environment today, our expectation would be that we're going to get back down to those levels we had seen in the earlier part of the year, absent the clear visibility and clear indication that we can start back up. So again, we started this exercise in the fourth quarter. We were hopeful with the conditional sales order that we were going to be able to operate early in 2021. Obviously, that proved to be a false hope. But it's really going to be dependent upon when we get that green light and when we get that visibility. 
But again, if you look at the fourth quarter and the first quarter, as we've outlined, I think I said on my prepared remarks today, roughly $10 million to $15 million a month was related to some of those restart costs. That's probably the levels you would start to see once we, in earnest, restart back, whether it's a second quarter, third quarter, but again, based on when we get that clear path of resumption."

For our own internal working purposes, we assume that, at the beginning, that maximum occupancy will be in the 50% range. So think about this. Today, our entire fleet is available to book, let's say, in the third quarter, in July moving forward. Every single ship in the fleet has passengers. There's bookings on them. When we know we're going to start, we're not going to be able to start all 28 vessels. As I said, it's going to be a little bit, maybe a week, one a week, something like that, which means that there's going to be a lot of customers who are booked today who will be displaced. And part of that displacement will be in cancellations. People will get their refunds. But part of it is that people will move from the Norwegian Jewel and Alaska to the Norwegian Bliss in Alaska, or they'll move from the the Oceana Riviera in Europe to the Oceana Marina in Europe. And so we believe that there are enough bookings today, if we never took another booking, let's say, for Q3, assuming a reduced capacity at the start, then we don't have to take any more bookings for Q3. And as you move forward from the start date, you have more ships coming online, less ships that are going to be -- those customers going to be displaced. And so there'll be a rebalancing, if you will, at some point, where we do need to start taking more bookings. But my guess is that, that will be beginning month 3, 4 forward. And that's what we were doing. And the restart that Mark and I discussed earlier in our remarks, when we thought we were going to start in Q1, because there's always a book of business there waiting, hoping to cruise that when we do know we're going to start, it won't be the entire fleet, and therefore, we have excess bookings, if you will, at the beginning. 
So again, of all the things we worry about, filling vessels, generating demand just isn't one of them. But we have -- we don't have a short-term issue as we just described. And as you heard me say earlier, 2022, more of a longer term, business is better than ever."

Look, ships have to dry dock. They have to stay within the Classification Society rules. And what I can tell you is while we have pulled back on our capital expenditures and some of that is related to investments, that enhancements that we would have made during dry docks, we're not stopping dry docks. Dry docks have to occur by class. And there are certain investments that we've continued to make. 
A good example of that is some of the scrubbers on the breakaway and getaway. That was -- they were scheduled to be completed in early 2023. And because the ships are out of service and going through their normal dry dock periods, we're able to install those sooner and get the benefit once we restart operating. 
But I think when you look at the ships going forward and you look at the cost structure on the ships, by and large, we've always said this, the cost structure on a ship is generally a highly fixed cost structure. That said, there's always going to be pockets of opportunity. And I think as we think about our costs going forward, we're looking at shoreside. This pause has really given us a chance to reevaluate every cost, everything we do from our supply chain, to everything we do on our shoreside operations. And I think we've mentioned this in the past that we're making some pretty significant learnings in our marketing area. We continue to transform towards the digital world. You get more bang for the dollar there. We're garnering significant amount of booking activity with vis-à-vis a less marketing spend. So we're taking those learnings. And every day that we're in pause, we're going to continue to look at every nook and cranny and ask ourselves, ""Are we doing this correctly?"" So I think there's opportunity for cost enhancement. And then further, as you look further down the future and you think about how does that translate to margin expansion, it's going to be a combination of reduced cost. We have more efficient capacity coming online with our 9 ship newbuild program. And that's going to help drive margin expansion in addition to, again, driving the top line, driving increased pricing that we've always been the industry leader in pricing. And as we think about that, if you look at the industry, capacity has been reduced. So we think that's going to provide even more of an opportunity to help rebuild margins and drive that margin expansion."

That means 30 million people that would have cruised in that year haven't cruised. And this is a finite capacity business. I can't cruise with 150% occupancy. So there's going to be a squeeze play here that demand is going to exceed supply, especially after the withdrawal of some 20-plus ships from the so-called North American fleet. So you got less supply. You've got pent-up demand. You've got people with money in their pocket. I think this is just the making of a boom time for the cruise industry. And since we can't expand supply any faster than it's coming online, pricing is what's going to dictate the day. And we're seeing it. I mean it's astonishing to me in the 25-plus years I've been in this business that given the fact that travel agents are not at full strength, we're spending a fraction of what we normally spend. The bad news cycle of lockdowns and pandemics and travel restrictions and quarantine, that business is as robust as it is, not only in volume, but we're able to tick up prices. So when we say that we just do a couple of connected dots here, 40% of FCCs have been redeemed. Those FCCs had a 25% premium on them. That we are at a flat to slightly ahead of pricing of the all-time high pricing, including the dilutive effect of those 125% FCCs and that we are so well booked into the future, I mean, I've never seen such a positive set of circumstance. We just need to get back to work. We need to get cruising, operating again. And we're hopeful. Look, as much as that bothers being to see other sectors of the travel community open, I'm happy for them. Trust me, I'm happy for the casino operators and the airlines and the hotel operators and the resorts. I want to be happy for us as well. And I think our day should be approaching, should be approaching, given the advances we're making in the vaccine front, prevalence is coming down, the industry -- the protocols we put in place, no other sector of the travel business or any other business has put forth as many comprehensive protocols to combat spread of the virus as we have. And we're eager to get back to work. And we're happy to see it starting in Asia, starting in Europe. We're going to see, I think, more vessels starting in Europe soon. And so we're encouraged by all those developments. But at the end of the day, we've got to get back to work soon. And we're ready. We're all ready. Thank you."

We have to demonstrate to government agencies, society as a whole, our guests, our crew and to ourselves that we can't de facto operate safely in a low prevalence environment where crew and guests are vaccinated. And then this will pivot from being a pandemic to being an endemic. And that's what we have today with the flu.

I hope that everyone joining us today as well as your loved ones remain healthy and safe.  
Similar to our last few earnings calls, we will focus our commentary today on the progress of our response to the global COVID-19 pandemic; the overall booking and pricing environment, which has shown particular strength in recent weeks; and our view of what the month ahead may look like as we prepare for an eventual return to service.  
To say that 2020 was challenging would be an incredible understatement as it was, without a doubt, the toughest and most difficult year in our company's 50-plus year history. After a record-breaking 2019, the foundation was well set for 2020 to be even a more successful year. That upward trajectory, however, quickly changed last March. And 2020 instead became a year of great hardship and disappointment and one in which we had to rely on our nimbleness and our ability to adapt by taking swift, proactive and decisive actions to overcome the multifaceted challenges presented by the pandemic.  
These actions included bringing our entire fleet to a halt literally overnight, followed by the complex logistics of safely returning more than 50,000 of our guests home. Next came the challenge of repatriating over 25,000 of our crew members and finding safe haven for our 28 vessels, all while transitioning them to various states of reduced manning.  
We quickly bolstered our liquidity through multiple capital market transactions, totaling in excess of $6 billion and led the industry in establishing cutting-edge health and safety standards through the cofounding of the Healthy Sail Panel. I'm incredibly proud and profoundly grateful for the dedication and perseverance demonstrated by our team members who continue to adapt, innovate and flawlessly execute while faced with unprecedented challenges. The tremendous efforts of our team are what have enabled our company to prove our resilience, time and again in the past and gives me confidence we will do so again.  
As we survey the current public health situation, both in America and around the world, it is extraordinary to consider just how much has transpired in the few months since our last update. As expected, the fourth quarter resurgence of the virus drove caseload to record highs, resulting in renewed lockdown and stricter global travel restrictions. During this time, perhaps the most important breakthrough though was the needed -- to defeat the pandemic was the coming online of several vaccines that were authorized for emergency use. Fast forward to today and caseloads across the globe have been in decline since mid-January, while simultaneously, vaccination programs are ramping up where currently over 6 million doses are being administered globally daily, a number that will only increase as manufacturing, distribution and health care systems align. 
So where does that put us in the cruise industry? In reality, we're not sure. But directionally, we're headed in the right direction to an eventual restart of cruising. Public health experts do predict that caseload, while already on the downside, will continue to decline primarily for 3 reasons: first, a significant portion of the population has already been infected and recovered; second, the number of individuals vaccinated will rapidly increase; and lastly, we will soon move into the less troublesome spring and summer season. All 3 of these factors are expected to combine to begin establishing herd immunity sometime during the third quarter, with the spread of variants and the durability of vaccine protection being the 2 main variables that could slow down but not completely halt the rapid progress being made.  
And while we are moving in the right direction, scientists continue to caution that we are not yet out of the woods, the crisis is far from over and we must all remain vigilant and ready to adapt to the ongoing fluidity of the public health environment. Our industry has recently seen some encouraging green shoots. After the first quarter resurgence caused nascent cruise operations in Europe to temporarily halt, several European cruise lines have since resumed or are planning to return to service in the next few weeks, sourcing EU nationals from Italy and Germany. The hope and expectation is that by late spring, sailings will expand to include cross-border European nationals, and eventually, likely during the third quarter, international guests, as virus prevalence decreases to manageable level.  
Shifting to our company's recent events since our last earnings call, several key milestones marked the fourth quarter, which can be found on Slide 3 of our presentation. These include 2 capital raises, resulting in approximately $1.7 billion of additional liquidity; new debt deferral amendments providing additional financial flexibility; and continued progress on our environmental, social and governance initiatives, which I will touch on in more detail later in the call.  
On Slide 4, we outlined the actions we have undertaken as we continue to navigate through this crisis, remaining focused on what we can control. Subsequent to the issuance of the CDC's Conditional Sail Order in October, we anticipated a return to service in the first quarter of 2021. Since it takes up to 90 days to ready a ship to re-enter servers from layup status, we initiated a phased crew restaffing of select vessels and began a ramping up of marketing activities. This initiative, unfortunately, was met with several headwinds, most notably, the rise of confirmed cases to all-time high and the emergence of new variants, which combined with a slower-than-anticipated rollout of vaccination programs, additional lockdowns and travel restrictions, continued closure of key ports around the world and, most important, the reluctance by public health authorities to lift cruise suspension. These headwinds caused us to change course. With a much hope for a Q1 relaunch postponed, the decision was made to return vessels to reduce manning status until there is certainty on the timing for a return to service.  
With new crew rested, ready and eager to work, we took the opportunity to rotate certain crew that had been onboard beyond their usual contracted term and made the difficult decision to repatriate 4,000 crew members back to their home countries.  
Next, we continue to execute on our strategic financial action plan, which Mark will provide an update on, and on the incremental actions we have taken to bolster liquidity a little later in the call.  
Turning to our road map to relaunch, which is illustrated on Slide 5. We continue to work with the Healthy Sail Panel, along with the CDC and other public health authorities and governments across the globe, to prepare for a safe and healthy resumption of cruising. As we await for additional technical guidelines from the CDC and other public health officials around the world, we continue to make progress on enhancing our already rigorous health and safety standards, implementing new advancements, including digital technology for contract tracing as well as streamlining safety drill with our state-of-the-art [ e-mustering ] technology. While we are confident in the ability of the 74 protocols developed by the Healthy Sail Panel to keep our ships, crew and guests safe, our frontline defense strategy has expanded from protocol-led preventive measures to now also include the protective health and safety benefits of vaccines.  
We view vaccine as a powerful tool, the most powerful tool, that when combined with various protective measures society is already accustomed to, such as space coverings and physical distancing, forms a multilayered, science-based approach to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 infection. We expect that by the time cruising resumes, vaccination will most certainly be widely available in the developed world. And we believe that by then, we will be able to secure vaccines for our crew as we are today well along in the procurement process.  
A mix of vaccinated guests and crew, along with the other established protocols, will provide a powerful combination to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 onboard our ships and the communities we visit. Ports and destinations is the next step of our road map, and we are in constant communication with key ports around the world to assess the status of travel restrictions, quarantine requirements and port availability. Of particular importance to the industry was the recent announcement by Canadian authorities to restrict cruise vessels from operating in Canadian waters through February of 2022. Throughout this pandemic, the travel industry has experienced the introduction, subsequent repeal and reintroduction of lockdowns and travel restrictions depending on the prevalence of the virus and other factors. Thankfully, the Canadian order allows for the suspension to be rescinded based on improvement in public health.  
We remain cautiously optimistic that a recision may be possible. And in the meantime, we await the results of several Alaskan delegation-led initiatives, which we want to acknowledge today and greatly appreciate that may allow Alaska Cruises to operate in 2021.  
The third step in our road map is to begin reactivating our sales and marketing machine, which as you know, is guided by our industry-leading market-to-fill versus discount-to-fill strategy. We have revalidated the effectiveness of this strategy in the pandemic environment, generating demand for the back half of 2021 and especially strong demand into 2022 and beyond. We will resume a disciplined process of ramping up sales and marketing efforts once we finalize an initial voyage resumption plan.  
Lastly, and once there is certainty, we continue to expect a gradual and phased approach to the resumption of cruise voyages. Depending on the timing of our return to service, our vessels could return in certain regions before others. For example, given the seasonality of our operations, a typical year the deployment of our vessel is concentrated in Europe during the peak summer season with 17 of our 28 ships operating in this region. Therefore, seasonality will likely play a key role in the initial deployment of our vessels.  
Our booking trends that you can see on Slide 6 demonstrate how we continue to experience strong demand for future cruise vacations despite the uncertainties in the broad travel sector, the reduction of demand-generating marketing investments and the temporary absence of a full complement of our all-important travel agent partners. For the second half of 2021, our load factor is below historical ranges, impacted by continued uncertainty around timing of the resumption of cruising and the shift of our limited marketing investments to focus on '22 -- 2022 voyages. Pricing continues to be at [indiscernible]  Level despite the dilutive impact of the value-added future cruise credits for canceled voyages. And while it is still early in the booking cycle, we are very encouraged and very pleased by the strong booking activity, driven by pent-up demand across all 3 brands for 2022 voyages.  
Volumes during January and February sequentially improved by over 40% from November and December 2020. And as an added bonus, over 80% of these bookings were new cash bookings. For the first half of 2022 and for all of 2022, in fact, our load factor is currently well ahead of prepandemic levels with pricing at each of our award-winning brands in line to up mid-single digits when excluding the dilutive impacts of future crew certificates.  
The consumer appetite for global travel aboard our 28 vessels is so strong that even with limited marketing investments, we are yielding outsized results, and we are experiencing record demand with our launches for our future itineraries and global voyage collections. A case in point is Oceania Cruises' 2023 World Cruise, which sold out within 1 day of opening for sale to the general public. In addition to our loyal pass guests, approximately 1/3 of all bookings for this group came from first-time new-to-brand guests. We believe this achievement, along with multiple booking records we have announced in recent months, demonstrates the pent-up demand that exists from our mature and affluent cruisers even for long and exotic voyages once the severe impact of the pandemic subsides. This demand, coupled with the opening of voyages for sale further in advance, has also resulted in a significant expansion to the booking curve during the fourth quarter, which is now double versus the same time last year.  
I'll be back later to provide closing remarks. But for now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark?"

My remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 action plan as well as our road map to relaunch. The global pandemic continues to evolve, and we continue to focus on what we can control and we are prepared to adapt",1221,"Thank you, Frank. My remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 action plan as well as our road map to relaunch. The global pandemic continues to evolve, and we continue to focus on what we can control and we are prepared to adapt and modify our strategy as needed. Slide 7 illustrates 3 focus areas of our action plan and the additional proactive measures taken since the beginning of the fourth quarter.  
First, we have reduced operating expenses and capital expenditures through a number of initiatives, including the further reduction or deferral of near-term marketing expenses, reduction of nonessential capital expenditures, extended salary reductions and furloughs for shoreside team members. In fact, we reduced capital expenditures by approximately 60% for each of the years 2020 and 2021. In addition, we finalized the deferral of EUR 220 million of newbuilding-related shipyard payments through the end of the first quarter 2022.  
Second, we have also made significant progress on improving our debt maturity profile in order to provide additional near-term financial flexibility through the following actions. We amended our Pride of America, Norwegian Jewel and senior secured credit facilities to suspend testing of certain covenants. This covenant relief extends through maturity for the Pride of America and Jewel facilities and through year-end 2022 for the senior secured credit facility. We were also able to defer $70 million of amortization payments due prior to June 30, 2022, for the senior secured credit facility.  
Second, we secured deferrals for approximately $680 million of our export credit agency-backed amortization payments, representing 100% of our ECA payments originally due through the first quarter of 2022. We also received covenant waivers through the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 on our ECA facilities.  
We have tremendous support behind us from our strong, long-standing relationships with our export credit agencies, SACE and Hermes, our ECA and commercial lenders as well as the shipyard. Their assistance is playing a significant role in our ability to weather this pandemic, and we can't thank them enough for their continued and ongoing partnership during these unprecedented times.  
The final focus area of our action plan was securing additional capital. In the fourth quarter, we executed 2 highly successful transactions. In November, we raised $824 million of net proceeds through an equity offering of 40 million ordinary shares. And in December, we issued 850 million of 5 7/8% senior unsecured notes due 2026 in an oversubscribed offering.  
To date, we've accessed the capital markets 5x over a 9-month period. As a result, since the onset of the pandemic, we raised incremental cash of nearly $6.5 billion, including the drawdown of the $875 million revolver early last year. This tremendous accomplishment would not have been possible without the hard work of our finance, treasury, legal and accounting teams who have worked tirelessly around the clock to execute on these initiatives. We have also experienced an incredible outpouring of support from our investors. And again, we can't thank you enough for having conviction in our business model, in our management team and in the long-term potential of our company.  
Slide 8 outlines the improvement of our debt maturity profile in response to the crisis. Since the third quarter, we secured debt amortization deferrals of approximately $750 million, resulting in minimal debt service payments for the remainder of 2021.  
Turning to liquidity. Slide 9 provides our current illustrative liquidity profile. Our total liquidity as of year-end was approximately $3.2 billion, which includes the portion of customer deposit refunds that are included in accounts payable at quarter end. We have also estimated approximately $300 million for anticipated health and safety investments and other collateral obligations. While we anticipate variability in our health and safety investments as we work through the various requirements and continuously improve and refine our protocols, we wanted to earmark this investment in our illustrative liquidity profile. These factors combined result in a net liquidity on a pro forma basis of approximately $2.9 billion, enabling us to continue to navigate through this fluid environment and execute on our return to service plan.  
As for cash burn, our team continues to work day in and day out to further reduce expenses and conserve cash. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have made significant progress in reducing our controllable cash burn rate, with the low watermark representing a nearly 80% reduction in cruise operating expenses versus normalized levels. For the fourth quarter, our average monthly cash burn rate was approximately $190 million. This included approximately $15 million per month due to additional expenses related to preparing vessels for a potential return to service in early 2021 and included a limited increase in associated marketing investments, as Frank discussed earlier.  
As for the first quarter, we expect the average cash burn to temporarily remain elevated at approximately $190 million per month or approximately $170 million per month, excluding nondebt recurring -- nonrecurring debt modification costs as we ramp down our relaunch-related expenses and repatriate crew. The approximately $60 million of onetime costs we incurred in the quarter is a result of debt deferrals and covenant waivers and suspensions, which when combined with the newbuild payment extensions, have resulted in approximately $1 billion of additional liquidity over the next 12 months.  
Once the ramp down of relaunch-related expenses, including crew repatriation efforts are complete, we expect that the average cash burn rate to decrease and remain at reduced levels until return to service preparations resume. We will continue to take a thoughtful and disciplined approach to reintroducing costs as we resume voyages in order to conserve cash, while at the same time, balance the need to drive new cash bookings.  
Turning to Slide 10. We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $3.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash balance in the fourth quarter increased, driven by approximately $1.7 billion of net proceeds from capital raises and was partially offset by approximately $570 million of operating cash burn, which includes operating expenses, SG&A, interest and CapEx, customer cash refunds for canceled voyages of approximately $120 million and net working capital and other outflows of approximately $20 million, which includes health and safety investments. Given the continued uncertainty around the timing of our voyage resumption, we are not yet prepared to provide guidance on all metrics. However, we have provided guidance on depreciation and amortization, interest expense and newbuild-related capital expenditures to assist with modeling, which can be found in our earnings release and on Slide 19 of the presentation.  
Broadly speaking, excluding newbuild-related capital expenditures, we still expect the minimum required capital expenditures needed to run the business and maintain our best-in-class fleets is generally a few hundred million dollars per year.  
Before handing the call back, I want to re-emphasize that while we are prioritizing our immediate business needs, we are also very focused on the future of our company. Our medium- and long-term financial recovery plan, which is provided on Slide 11, focuses on 3 critical components: first, rebuild and gradually return to pre-COVID margin levels while continuing to identify opportunities to further drive margin expansion; second, maximize our cash generation; and third, focus on optimizing our balance sheet and charting a path to delever.  
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank to provide closing commentary. Frank?"

Before we wrap up our prepared remarks today, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, which is on Slide 12.  
Despite the current public health challenges we face, our commitment to protect and preserve our oceans, the environment and the destinations we visit while enhancing our culture of diversity, equity and inclusion in the workforce remains at the very core of our everyday operation. To that end, in 2020, we launched unconscious bias, microaggression and diversity and inclusion training for our global workforce and have committed to expand our diverse hiring practices.  
We are also building upon our supplier diversity program as part of our efforts to facilitate and encourage the growth of small and diverse businesses. We strive to maintain a supportive and empowering workforce -- workplace for our team members across the globe. We believe our team members are, by far, our most important resource, and that has never been clearer to me than during this crisis. We are pleased that this commitment to our team's development and well-being was recognized recently with our naming to the Forbes America's Best Employers list, in which we ranked among the top 75 companies in the overall Large Employer category and among the 10 top companies in the Travel & Leisure sector.  
Just as we support our team members, we are also committed to supporting our local communities and the destinations we visit. This past year, we launched 2 initiatives in partnership with JUST Goods. For Giving Tuesday, we matched every case of JUST Water purchased in December through their online store with a water donation to local food banks in Miami and New York City. Separately, we provided nearly $275,000 of in-kind donations in the form of JUST Water and nonperishable and canned goods to support 2 community organization and assist ongoing relief efforts in the archipelago of San Andrés in Colombia after the devastating impact of Category 5 Hurricane Iota. Furthering our partnership with JUST Goods, we are also currently in the process of organizing several truckloads of JUST Water donations to benefit food banks located in areas around the Southwest of the United States that have been severely affected by the recent winter storms.  
Dedication to family and community is ingrained in our culture. And to further demonstrate this commitment, beginning this year, we are offering our U.S. shoreside team members a paid volunteer day to give back to community programs of their choice. 
On the environmental front, we are proud to have improved our score in our second CDP climate change submission to a B, which is higher than the marine transport sector, North America and global average. For 2021, we will be focused on enhancing our ESG disclosures to provide additional transparency. I look forward to sharing additional details with you as we continue on our ESG journey.  
Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to leave you with a few final key takeaways. First, we are focused on the execution of our road map to relaunch as quickly as possible, and we'll continue to work with our expert advisers, global public health authorities and government agencies to refine our science-backed plans for a swift, safe and healthy return to cruising.  
Second, strong future demand for cruising across all brands, source markets and deployments continue. And early indications for 2022 bookings are extremely positive, with load factors besting our previous high by a substantial margin. Lastly, we continue to keep our longer-term strategic and financial priorities in focus, and we will be ready to execute on our recovery plans to improve our balance sheet.  The strong future demand we are experiencing, coupled with the positive momentum in the public health front, bodes extremely well for our prospects. And with that, Josh, please, let's open the call for questions. Thank you."

We're encouraged that the situation with Alaska and the Canadian closure until spring of '22 has been noted by various government officials, and they're trying to do their best. As you know, tourism is the third largest industry in Alaska. And for certain Alaskan coastal communities, cruising is over 90% of their tourism business. And so if we can't operate in Alaska in 2021, that will be 2 years that they will go without this infusion of business activity, and that's going to be difficult for them. And so we're hopeful, cautiously optimistic. It's a lot of hoops to jump through, both from the Canadian side and also, let's face it, we cannot operate as of today in U.S. waters and Alaska waters. So we have suspended taking new bookings on Alaska. I think the whole industry has. But we do hope -- we do hold out some hope that these initiatives led by the Alaskan delegation can open up Alaska for 2021."

I think there -- let's clarify a couple of things. The CDC guidance that we, as an industry, are expecting sometime in the future and I won't label it as a few days because I simply don't know.

The CDC guidance that we, as an industry, are expecting sometime in the future and I won't label it as a few days because I simply don't know. It could be a few days. It could be a few weeks. We simply don't know. 
That doesn't -- that is the next phase, the next phase of this multiphase approach that the CDC is taking. I don't believe that we are awaiting, in the next few days, the green light to cruise. That would not be correct. 
But in terms of our decision to pull back, look, when the CDC Conditional Sail Order first came out, there was great expectation. We had a Conditional Sail Order, and it proved to be more difficult than we first expected. We also were in the middle of a spike in the number of cases. And so it became obvious to us that the initial expectation that maybe the industry could begin to cruise in the first quarter, which as you know, is heavily focused on Caribbean theater of operations was not going to take place. And so we took the difficult decision to reduce our cash burn, repatriate those crew members back home and cut down on the marketing expenses that we have begun to ramp up to -- along with the ships that we thought we could operate. 
And so today, I would tell you that we are in a better place, a more encouraging place than we were even just 6 weeks ago. At the end of the day, I think the prevalence of the disease in our own country and around the world will be the greatest indicator of when we can resume cruising. 
And the prevalence is dropping. And we believe, based on all the experts that we talk to, including a Healthy Sail Panel that we're going to see a continuation of the significant drop in cases as we enter spring/summer, as we continue to vaccinate over 1.5 million Americans a day, as more people get infected and recover. So all those things point into a direction where the prevalence should drop considerably, giving us a better opportunity to restart operations."

But we generally believe that from the moment that we get the green light, depending on where the ships are that you want to stand up, depending on the seasonality, summer is a -- where are the ships in summer? Generally, they're in Europe. They're in Alaska. Where are they in the fall/winter? They're primarily in the Caribbean, Mexico, Panama Canal, around the world. 
But I think for planning purposes, we'd like to give ourselves that 90-day window, more or less. And so we've canceled cruises through the end of May. So if you count with your fingers, we -- it's basically March 1, so all of March, all of April, all of May. And it's sequential. We keep bookings and cruising -- cruises available as long as we believe there is a chance that we can operate. Once we know we start entering that 90-day-or-so window, and we owe it to everyone in the ecosystem, whether it's travel agents, consumers, our own employees, the crew to cancel cruises in the future. So we're always hopeful, always hopeful that the public health situation improves and that we can restart as soon as we possibly can."

But I wanted to dig in a little bit more into your luxury brands given the strong pent-up demand we have seen from the 60-plus age demographic across other consumer verticals.

I hope that makes sense."

Look, early in the pandemic, people were writing off the mature market. And it's been anything but that. So as you know, the upscale brands tend to book further out than the contemporary brand partly because of the itineraries. The longer, more exotic itineraries, everything else being equal, people book further out. And so we're continuing to see that. 
I mean both Oceania and Regent are nearly 40% -- 40% booked for 2022. That's much better than they've ever been at this stage of the booking cycle. And so these are folks who are typically over the age of 65. The average age at Oceania and Regent is consistently in the 66, 67 age range. And these are the folks who are getting the vaccine first. And they've been cooped up, and they want to go out. I mean they're no different than 40-year olds or 30-year olds. They've got the money, and they're booking further and further out. As we said in our prepared remarks, the booking curve is now double what it normally is. And that's because of 2 reasons: one, there are literally no bookings being made for the next 3 or 4 months sailing because they've been canceled; and people are booking further and further out. People know that this pandemic will end someday. And that someday is tomorrow but further out. 
So we have more visibility today in our future business than we've ever had. And so that's one of the things that encourages me the most. I mean I have a lot of things to worry about these days, Steve. Fundamental consumer demand and our ability to fill our ships at strong pricing is not one of them. And to be able to do what we're doing in terms of the load factors and new bookings, new cash bookings with the de minimis amount of marketing that we're doing, with the travel agency system being less than 100%, it's truly remarkable and again points to what we've been saying per year, the resiliency of the consumer, the resiliency of those who love to cruise. It's a great value. That hasn't changed, and people are going to get back to the high seas. There's no question about that."

What we have said in the past is that we think that from whatever date that it is that we start, that it will likely take 6 to 7 months, assuming that the ports are open around the world. Remember, our ships are seasonal. One of the requirements is that the ports be open, the travel restrictions be lifted. So assuming that those hurdles are cleared, physically, we think it will take 6, 7 months, so roughly a ship a week. And so for us to be 100% operative, we would have to start standing up vessels in the June/July time frame of this year so that we can be 100% by year-end, early '22."

We have the liquidity. FCCs are dilutive to future business. We don't want to negatively impact future business anymore than the dilutive effect of the existing FCCs. So today, there is no choice, you get your money back. 
And in terms of the percentage of FCCs that have been redeemed, it varies by brand. But at the consolidated age level, roughly 40% of all FCCs that we have issued over time have now been redeemed. So there still remains 60% of the FCCs issued in that bucket of folks who've got an ability to rebook. And look, we -- somehow, in some quarters of the investment world perhaps, FCC bookings are seen as not as good as a cash booking. I think they're both important. Customers who took an FCC showed a great deal of confidence and support in our business. And we want to make sure that they get their cruise. And so if we have to extend the booking date or if we have to extend the sailing date as the suspensions continue, we will do so. We actively encourage people to redeem their FCC.

Some of that is lingering into Q1 as well with the start-up activities. 
And then beyond that, in this environment today, our expectation would be that we're going to get back down to those levels we had seen in the earlier part of the year, absent the clear visibility and clear indication that we can start back up. So again, we started this exercise in the fourth quarter. We were hopeful with the Conditional Sails Order that we were going to be able to operate early in 2021. Obviously, that proved to be a false hope. But it's really going to be dependent upon when we get that green light and when we get that visibility. 
But again, if you look at the fourth quarter and the first quarter, as we've outlined, I think I said on my prepared remarks today, roughly $10 million to $15 million a month was related to some of those restart costs. That's probably the levels you would start to see once we, in earnest, restart back, whether it's a second quarter, third quarter, but again, based on when we get that clear path of resumption."

So the pent-up demand for them for this cohort, I think, is greater than younger cohorts."

For our own internal working purposes, we assume that at the beginning, that maximum occupancy will be in the 50% range. So think about this. Today, our entire fleet is available to book, let's say, in the third quarter, in July moving forward. Every single ship in the fleet has passengers. There's bookings on them. When we know we're going to start, we're not going to be able to start all 28 vessels. 
As I said, it's going to be a little bit, maybe a week, one a week, something like that, which means that there's going to be a lot of customers who are booked today who will be displaced. And part of that displacement will be in cancellation, people will get their refunds. But part of it is that people will move from the Norwegian Jewel in Alaska to the Norwegian Bliss in Alaska, or they'll move from the Oceania Riviera in Europe to the Oceania Marina in Europe. And so we believe that there are enough bookings today. If we never took another booking, let's say, for Q3, assuming a reduced capacity at the start, then we don't have to take any more bookings for Q3. And as you move forward from the start date, you have more ships coming online, less ships that are going to be -- those customers going to be displaced. 
And so there'll be a rebalancing, if you will, at some point, where we do need to start taking more bookings. But my guess is that, that will be beginning month 3, 4 forward. And that's what we were doing. And the restart that Mark and I discussed earlier in our remarks, when we thought we were going to start in Q1, because there's always a book of business there waiting, hoping to cruise that when we do know we're going to start, it won't be the entire fleet and, therefore, we have excess bookings, if you will, at the beginning. 
So again, of all the things we worry about, filling vessels, generating demand just isn't one of them. But we have -- we don't have a short-term issue as we just described. And as you heard me say earlier, 2022, more of a longer term, business is better than ever."

Look, ships have to dry dock. They have to stay within the classification society rules. And what I can tell you is while we have pulled back on our capital expenditures and some of that is related to investments, that enhancements that we would have made during dry docks, we're not stopping dry docks. Dry docks have to occur by class. And there are certain investments that we've continued to make. 
A good example of that is some of the scrubbers on the Breakaway and Getaway. That was -- they were scheduled to be completed in early 2023. And because the ships are out of service and going through their normal dry dock periods, we're able to install those sooner and get the benefit once we restart operating. 
But I think when you look at the ships going forward and you look at the cost structure on the ships, by and large, we've always said this, the cost structure on a ship is generally a highly fixed cost structure. That said, there's always going to be pockets of opportunity. And I think as we think about our costs going forward, we're looking at shoreside. This pause has really given us a chance to reevaluate every cost, everything we do from our supply chain to everything we do on our shoreside operations. And I think we've mentioned this in the past that we're making some pretty significant learnings in our marketing area. 
We continue to transform towards the digital world. You get more bang for the dollar there. We're garnering significant amount of booking activity with vis-à-vis a less marketing spend. So we're taking those learnings. And every day that we're in pause, we're going to continue to look at every nook and cranny and ask ourselves, ""Are we doing this correctly?"" So I think there's opportunity for cost enhancement. And then further, as you look further down the future and you think about how does that translate to margin expansion, it's going to be a combination of reduced cost. We have more efficient capacity coming online with our 9-ship newbuild program. And that's going to help drive margin expansion in addition to, again, driving the top line, driving increased pricing that we've always been the industry leader in pricing. And as we think about that, if you look at the industry, capacity has been reduced. So we think that's going to provide even more of an opportunity to help rebuild margins and drive that margin expansion."

That means 30 million people that would have cruised in that year haven't cruised. And this is a finite capacity business. I can't cruise with 150% occupancy. So there's going to be a squeeze play here that demand is going to exceed supply, especially after the withdrawal of some 20-plus ships from the so-called North American fleet. So you got less supply. You've got pent-up demand. You've got people with money in their pocket. 
I think this is just the making of a boom time for the cruise industry. And since we can't expand supply any faster than it's coming online, pricing is what's going to dictate the day. And we're seeing it. I mean it's astonishing to me in the 25-plus years I've been in this business that given the fact that travel agents are not at full strength, we're spending a fraction of what we normally spend. The bad news cycle of lockdowns and pandemics and travel restrictions and quarantine, that business is as robust as it is, not only in volume, but we're able to tick up prices. So when we say that we just do a couple of connect the dots here, 40% of FCCs have been redeemed. Those FCCs had a 25% premium on them. That we are at a flat to slightly ahead of pricing of the all-time high pricing, including the dilutive effect of those 125% FCCs and that we are so well booked into the future. I mean I've never seen such a positive set of circumstance. We just need to get back to work. We need to get cruising operating again. And we're hopeful. Look, as much as that bothers me to see other sectors of the travel community open, I'm happy for them. Trust me, I'm happy for the casino operators and the airlines and the hotel operators and the resorts. I want to be happy for us as well. And I think our day should be approaching, should be approaching, Ivan, given the advances we're making in the vaccine front, prevalence is coming down, the industry -- the protocols we put in place, no other sector of the travel business or any other business has put forth as many comprehensive protocols to combat spread of the virus as we have. And we're eager to get back to work. And we're happy to see it starting in Asia, starting in Europe. We're going to see, I think, more vessels starting in Europe soon. And so we're encouraged by all those developments. But at the end of the day, we've got to get back to work soon. And we're ready. We're all ready. Thank you."

Today, we will focus our commentary on the progress we have made thus far towards the resumption of cruising, the overall strength of the booking and pricing environment and our efforts to bolster our liquidity and maximize financial flexibility as we methodically return our fleet to operation. 
Over a year since the suspension of voyages worldwide, our team at Norwegian has accelerated that the time has finally come to where we shift our focus to what I like to call our Great Cruise Comeback, even if the comeback starts from international ports. 
As you can see on Slide 4, our return to service plan is centered around 3 key phases. First, we developed our multilayered SailSAFE health and safety strategy, including mandatory vaccinations for all guests and crew at its cornerstone, which I will touch on in more detail later in the call. Second, last month, we announced our initial voyage resumption plan with a two-pronged approach to restarting cruises from both within and outside of U.S. orders starting this summer. All 3 of our brands have now announced initial voyages embarking from both new and normally scheduled international ports, and we are -- and we remain engaged in active dialogue with the CDC regarding a potential resumption of cruising from U.S. ports. Lastly is the phased relaunch of the remainder of our fleet, the timing of which will depend on several factors such as the global public health environment, port openings, travel restrictions and the all-important CDC. 
Slide 5 further details our 2-pronged voyage  resumption plan. Outside of the U.S., our long-awaited return to cruising will begin in July, first with 3 Norwegian Cruise Line vessels sailing from Athens and throughout the Greek Isles and new Caribbean home ports in Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Oceana Cruises will start in late August with voyages from Copenhagen, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises were resumed from South Hampton England beginning in September with Seven Seas Splendor, our newest and most luxurious vessel, resuming her inaugural season. 
The response to our international voyage resumption has been overwhelming, and even sailings from our new Caribbean home ports are performing less than expected despite the extremely condensed booking window. I can't thank our loyal guests, value travel partners and all of our stakeholders enough for their patience and support over the past year as we prepare for our return to cruising. 
As for our work to restart voyages in the U.S., on April 5, we submitted a comprehensive ironclad proposal to the CDC requesting authorization to resume cruising this summer with the robust and healthy safety strategy I just described, which includes 100% vaccination of all guests and crew. We and the rest of the cruise industry have since continued dialogue with the CDC. And just last week, the CDC issued additional clarification for its previously outlined technical guidance, which alleviated some of the pain points in the original Phase IIa guidance. 
Even more importantly, we were pleased to see the CDC incorporate vaccines, our most powerful tool against COVID-19, into its guidance creating 2 different pathways for the resumption of cruising from U.S. ports: one for vaccinated voyages with a vaccination threshold of 95% for guests and 98% for crew; and one for nonvaccinated voyages that fall below this threshold. The vaccinated path, which is consistent with, but falls short of, our plan for 100% vaccination of guests and crew has fewer hurdles to clear before we turn to cruising, including the removal of the requirement for simulated voyages prior to [ resumed ] sailings and the relaxing of certain burdensome and costly testing requirements. 
In addition, yesterday, the CDC issued technical guidance for Phase IIb and III, which covers simulated voyages and restricted voyages and the application process for a conditional sailing certificate. The guidance includes an operations manual for simulated and restricted voyages for which we need more clarity on whether the numerous and onerous requirements would apply to vaccinated voyages as well or only to those that are not. Our team is working through the new guidance, but at first glance, however, it appears the path forward is a bit rockier and a bit steeper than originally expected. 
As time goes by, and given how long it takes to stand up a shift from cold layup, the urgent need for an acceptable and definitive agreement with the CDC is imperative as a potential mid-summer restart from U.S. ports could be in jeopardy. However, the CDC's recent willingness to engage with the industry and constructive dialogue has shown that they are committed to working with us to find an acceptable path forward, and we are certainly in a better place today than we were just 30 days ago. 
The progress we have made so far has been possible in part due to the incredible grassroots efforts undertaken across the cruise ecosystem to encourage elected officials to help resume cruising in the U.S., which supports thousands of jobs, families and small businesses throughout the country. Through CLIA's ready set sail platform,  and our own safe to sail advocacy campaign, we were able to send over 150,000 messages to elected officials throughout the United States. Thank you to all of you who have called, e-mailed or tweeted your officials in support of the cruise industry. The wind is at our back and now is the time to keep the positive momentum going with our advocacy efforts. So I encourage you to continue reaching out to your elected officials by cruising -- or excuse me, by texting cruise to 52886 and have your voices heard. 
Turning to Slide 6. We unveiled our robust and multilayered SailSAFE health and safety program, which includes mandatory vaccinations for all guests and crew as its cornerstone. We believe that vaccinations, combined with a dozens of science-backed preventive protocols including universal COVID-19 testing that were developed by the Healthy Sail Panel will provide one of if not the safest vacation option available anywhere on land or at sea. 
Our protocols extend well beyond those of the already successfully reopened travel and hospitality sectors, including hotels, resorts, casinos, theme parks, restaurants, movie theaters, arenas and airlines. SailSAFE was developed in conjunction with our expert advisers, including the Healthy Sail Panel and our newly announced SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council chaired by former FDA Commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb. The council, which is comprised of 6 of public health and scientific experts featured on Slide 7, will complement the work of the Healthy Sail Panel and provide Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings with specific expert advice on the implementation and continuous improvement of our SailSAFE program. 
Shifting to our booking trends, which you can see on Slide 8. We continue to see the strongest demand we have ever experienced for future cruise vacations across all 3 of our brands despite continued reductions of demand-generating marketing investments, the absence of a full complement of our all-important travel agent partners and a virtual lockdown from many of our international source markets. Perhaps the best indicator of this pent-up demand is our booking volumes, which during what is probably the most unorthodox wait season in our industry's history, accelerated considerably with bookings net of cancellations more than doubling versus the prior quarter. As I touched on at our last call, this demand, coupled with the opening of voyages for sale further in advance, continues to result in a significant expansion of the booking curve with the first quarter's curve nearly doubling versus the same time last year. 
Pent-up demand is particularly evident for 2022 voyages. For the first half of 2022, our load factor is meaningfully ahead of 2019 with pricing higher when excluding the dilutive impact of future cruise credits. Keep in mind that 2019 was a record year which makes the strong booking trends we are experiencing even more impressive. 
In addition, approximately 70% of our book position is comprised of new cash bookings with the remainders comprised of future cruise certificates.  By the time summer 2021 comes around and the industry begins to resume operations, more than 50 million would-be cruises will have been left ashore. So the pent-up demand is real and it's deep. And you can see that in our growing advanced ticket sales, which increased approximately $200 million on a gross basis in the quarter or up approximately 40% versus the prior quarter's build. We believe we have reached an inflection point as this is the highest gross build since the beginning of the pandemic. And as we get closer to our resumption of cruising and begin phasing in the rest of our fleet, we expect this momentum to continue to accelerate sequentially. 
Another exciting milestone reached in the quarter was the naming of Vista, the first of 2 new 1,200 guest Allura Class ships for the Oceana Cruises brand and the first new build to the line in over a decade, which you can see on Slide 9. The upscale vessel, the seventh for the line, will set sail in early 2023 followed by a sister ship in 2025. Like sister vessels, Vista will deliver the finest at sea and will introduce several unique first for the brand in the realm of dining and guest experience. More reveals of Vista's venues and experiences will begin later this month and the lead-up to the launch of sales for her inaugural voyages in September of 2021. I'll be back later to provide an update on our ESG efforts as well as provide closing remarks. But now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark?"

My remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 financial action plan and our planned return to cruising later this summer. I am pleased to say that we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel with the significant progress we have made in recent months on our return to cruising. Despite this positive momentum, we have not lost sight that the pandemic is not yet over, and we remain focused on maintaining our cost discipline and pulling all levers available to conserve cash and maximize financial flexibility in what is an improving but still uncertain environment. 
As I have said before, our team is focused on what we can control, and we continue to adapt our strategy as needed as the pandemic evolves. Slide 10 illustrates the 3 focus areas of our action plan and the additional proactive measures taken since the beginning of the first quarter. First, we continue to tightly control operating expenses and capital expenditures through a number of initiatives, including the significant reduction or outright deferral of near-term demand-generating marketing expenses and nonessential capital expenditures. As an example, our non-newbuild capital expenditures continue to be less than half our pre-pandemic expectations for 2021. In addition, we finalized EUR 50 million of incremental deferrals of newbuild related shipyard payments since our last earnings call, resulting in a total deferral of EUR 270 million through the end of the second quarter 2022. 
Second, we have made significant progress on improving our debt maturity profile to provide additional near-term financial flexibility. In March, we repaid the Pride of America and Norwegian Jewel facilities which were set to mature in 2022, leaving no significant debt maturities until 2024. We also worked with our lenders to amend certain credit agreements to free up approximately $2 billion of additional debt capacity, most of which is on an unsecured basis. While we believe our liquidity position today is strong this incremental debt capacity meaningfully improves our financial flexibility and gives us additional optionality should the need arise. And the final focus of -- area of our action plan is securing additional capital. We successfully tapped the market, which resulted in an approximately $1 billion of incremental liquidity in the quarter. 
Slide 11 illustrates the 2 highly successful capital market transactions executed in March. First, we issued $1.1 billion of senior unsecured notes consisting of a $575 million tack-on to the December unsecured notes offering and $525 million of new unsecured notes due 2028. These transactions generated approximately $650 million of incremental liquidity after repaying the Norwegian Jewel and Pride of America facilities, both of which were to mature in 2022. 
Second, we went to the market with a strategic multifaceted offering to proactively manage our balance sheet. We raised approximately $1.6 billion of proceeds net of underwriting fees through a public common equity offering of approximately 53 million shares at $30 per share. We then used approximately $1 billion of the net proceeds to fully repay the L Catterton exchangeable notes due 2026. 
This opportunistic transaction had several strategic benefits. First, it enhanced our balance sheet by effectively converting debt to equity with the prepayment of debt at par. Second, the early redemption of the L Catterton notes enabled us to repurchase a significantly lower number of shares than what would have been required if the notes were held to maturity. Third, we unlocked value and added approximately $530 million of incremental liquidity with limited additional dilution to shareholders as the vast majority of the shares were already reserved for the L Catterton notes. And lastly, we reduced our future interest expense burden. 
To date, we've accessed the capital market 7x over a 12-month period with several multi-instrument transactions. As a result, since the onset of the pandemic, we've raised more than $7.5 billion, including the drawdown of the $875 million revolver early last year. This incredible feat would not have been possible without the hard work, support and partnership of countless individuals, including our team at Norwegian, our lenders, the shipyards, investors, bankers and many, many more. 
Turning to our illustrative liquidity profile on Slide 12. Total liquidity as of March 31 was approximately $3.4 billion, which is net of the portion of customer deposit refunds that are included in accounts payable as of quarter end. We have also estimated approximately $100 million for anticipated health and safety investments. These factors combined result in a net liquidity on a pro forma basis of approximately $3.3 billion, enabling us to continue to navigate through this fluid environment and execute on our return to service plan. 
As for cash burn, our team continues to be laser-focused on cost containment and cash conservation. For the first quarter, our average monthly cash burn was in line with prior guidance at approximately $190 million or approximately $170 million per month excluding nonrecurring debt modification costs. We paid approximately $50 million of onetime costs in the quarter as a result of debt deferrals and covenant waivers and suspensions, which, when combined with the newbuild payment extensions, have resulted in approximately $1 billion of additional liquidity through first quarter of 2022. 
As for the second quarter, we expect the average cash burn to be approximately $190 million per month as we prepare for a resumption of cruising beginning in July. Restart expenses are primarily related to repositioning, provisioning and staffing of vessels, implementing new health and safety protocols and a measured ramp-up of demand-generating marketing investments. We will continue to be disciplined and take a thoughtful approach to reintroducing costs with our voyage resumptions in order to conserve cash while at the same time balancing the need to drive new cash bookings. 
Slide 21 details additional guidance we have provided for certain metrics, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and newbuild-related capital expenditures. 
Turning to Slide 13. We ended the first quarter with approximately $3.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our balance -- our cash balance in the first quarter increased driven by approximately $1.2 billion of net proceeds from capital raises. This was partially offset by approximately $570 million of operating cash burn, including operating expenses, SG&A, interest and CapEx; customer cash refunds for canceled voyages of approximately $100 million; collateral obligations of approximately $250 million; and a net working capital and other outflow of approximately $50 million, which includes health and safety investments. 
Before handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate that as we continue to navigate through this crisis and prepare to execute on our voyage resumption plans, we have not taken our focus off the future. Our medium- and long-term financial recovery plan, which is provided on Slide 14, is focused on 3 critical components: first, rebuilding and gradually returning to pre-COVID margin levels while continuing to identify opportunities to further drive margin expansion; second, maximize our cash generation; and third, focus on optimizing our balance sheet and charting a path to delever. 
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank for closing commentary."

And before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, which is reflected on Slide 15. 
Despite the current public health challenges we face, our commitment to drive a positive impact on society and the environment through the advancement of our ESG strategy remains at the core of our everyday operations. Throughout the crisis, we have remained committed to supporting our local communities and the destinations we visit. Earlier this week, we announced that we are providing a $10 million cash support to 6 Alaskan port communities to help families and small businesses with basic relief programs in the localities that are really impacted by the ongoing crew suspensions. My heart breaks for Alaska and its wonderful people as we face a potential second year of 0 or, at best, limited cruise operations during the all-important summer tourism season which would bring in another blow to Alaska's hard-hit tourism economy. We are doing everything in our power to resume cruising in the U.S. as soon as possible, so we can provide additional much-needed relied to this important region. 
In addition, we also joined the Shop Local Alaska program, which is a joint initiative between Buy Alaska and voyage. com to encourage the support of severely impacted small businesses in Alaska. This virtual platform allows consumers to live around the globe to browse and purchase a wide range of items from virtual Alaska shops. 
In our local Miami community, we provided $100,000 worth of Visa gift cards to the cruise members of the International Longshoremen’s Association Local 1416, who saw over 60% of their business wiped out nearly overnight with the suspension of cruise voyages. We were proud to support this pillar of the local community, which has been providing longshore labor to Port Miami for over 85 years and holds the historic position as the oldest Black Union in Florida. 
As part of our ongoing humanitarian efforts and in the spirit of giving back, we also provided more than $2 million of in-kind humanitarian relief to support various community organizations worldwide throughout 2020 and 2021. This support was directed to a variety of efforts, including local food banks, disaster relief and COVID-19 recovery efforts. In addition, and in celebration of teacher appreciation week on Monday, we relaunched our Giving Joy contest, which provides educators with 100 free cruises and a chance to win up to $25,000 cash awards for their schools. Throughout this unprecedented period, countless teachers have worked tirelessly to give their all to their students. And we believe now, more than ever, they deserve our recognition and gratitude. 
On the environmental front, we are honored to receive the prestigious 2021 ACG Build America Merit Award for environmental enhancement for our newly constructed double ship peer at Ward Cove in Alaska. Through this project, we were able to transform Ward Cove a superfund site into a sustainable, environmentally friendly and entertaining sites for the local community and cruise visitors alike. Going forward, we continue to be focused on enhancing our ESG disclosures to provide additional transparency, and I look forward to sharing additional details with you as we continue on our ESG journey. 
Turning to Slide 16. I'd like to leave you with a few final key takeaways. First, we are putting health and safety at the forefront of our return to service plan as demonstrated by our science-backed SailSAFE health and safety program which includes 100% vaccination of all guests and crew in addition to comprehensive protocols. We will continue to work with our expert advisers to involve these protocols over time with the latest science and technology developments. 
We are focused on our Great Cruise Comeback with our phased voyage resumption plans, both within and outside of U.S. ports. At the same time, we are keeping our longer-term strategic and financial priorities in focus as we execute on our recovery plans. And lastly, we continue to experience strong future demand for cruising across all 3 of our award-winning brands with very positive booking and pricing trends for 2022 and beyond. 
Overall, I am more hopeful today than when I spoke with you last. I can't thank enough our dedicated and passionate team members around the globe for all their hard work and perseverance which has brought us to this critical point in which will propel us forward. We still have a long road to full recovery ahead of us, but we are optimistic and encouraged by the progress we have recently made to a resumption of cruising as well as the continued robust demand we are seeing from our loyal guests. We can't wait to get back to what we do best, providing guests with incredible experiences and lifetime memories and our shareholders with industry-leading financial metrics and year-over-year improved financial results. And with that, Josh, please let's open the call for questions."

So putting the crew together with the vaccine, these are all challenges that may impact our ability to stand up ships in the future but we don't really believe that it will. With vaccines coming on, the surplus of vaccines now coming on pretty strong around, at least around the U.S., we feel that we'll be able to stand up the vessels on a pretty good clip."

CDC, themselves, have stated that cruising or any activity cannot be zero risk. They've acknowledged that vaccines is the game changer. That's why society is racing towards vaccinations as fast as possible. which is why we proposed the CDC back on April 5 an ironclad multipronged approach to the situation, which is everyone on board has to be vaccinated. So I have to tell you that I am disappointed at first read. I'm going to give the CDC an opportunity to expand and clarify, we have a call with them this afternoon, on some of the requirements. 
For example, as we read yesterday's pronouncements, even though everyone on board would be vaccinated, in between bites of your meal and in between sips of your beverage, you have to put on your mask, take off your mask. So nobody should order soup because your mass might get sloppy. So that, to me, is just prosperous. It's not in the spirit of where the country is heading, where President Biden wants to open the country. 70% of American adults will be vaccinated by the beginning of the third quarter. So we hope that we're reading it wrong. We hope that there would be clarifications. Quite frankly, we're hoping that these -- some of these more onerous requirements in Phase IIb only apply to cruises and ships or brands or companies that are not going to vaccinate the 95% of passengers and 98% of crew as mandated by the CDC. We hope that if you do get to 95%, 98% or even better the 100, 100 that Norwegian is proposing, that there won't be a need for such impractical, onerous, burdensome requirements. So we'll see what happens over the next few days as we engage with them, reengage with them on these particular phases. But certainly, on first read, we were disappointed."

So from April 5, when we submitted our proposal, 90 days would have been early July, and that was possible. But today, we're in early May. So now we're looking past that. But look, there's more to it than just what the CDC says. There is only so much capacity to be able to stand up vessels. We -- standing up a vessel after a 15-, 18-month cold layup is not an overnight exercise. It takes a while, and making it more complicated is the travel restrictions for crew, the vaccination mandates that we are imposing for crews. So we are focused on standing up our first 5 vessels that we've announced, first 6 vessels that we've announced for Norwegian, Oceania region outside the U.S. As you know, we, the industry, we -- our company regularly operate vessels outside the U.S., especially in the summer season, where Europe is the big draw. And so July, August, September is summer, and the best and highest use for our vessels is to operate in Europe, and that's what we're doing. In a couple of occasions, we are standing up vessels in the Caribbean because the CDC up to now has not given us a pathway. We'll see how things progress over time. But remember, it is a seasonal industry. And outside of Alaska, which is in doubt, not only because of the CDC, but because of the Canadian situation, outside of Alaska, The world's cruise fleets are typically outside of the U.S. in the summertime, where we're cruising elsewhere. We're including primarily in the Mediterranean and Northern Europe, et cetera. So seasonality plays a big role and as well the final CDC regulations will play a big role."

And we can operate from the Caribbean for ships that otherwise would have gone to Florida. We certainly hope it doesn't come to that. Everyone wants to operate out of Florida. It's a very lucrative market. It's close drive market. So -- but it is an issue. Can't ignore it. And we hope that everyone is pushing in the same direction, which is we want to resume cruising in a safe manner, especially at the beginning. 
Things might be different 6 months from now or a year from now. But today, with the pandemic still being front and center in everybody's mind and we're just getting out of the worst part of it just weeks ago, I think everyone should be wanting to start cruising in the safest possible manner. And that's exactly what the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings plan does, 100% vaccination of both crew and passengers. For the life of me, I don't understand 98% and not 100%. So you got a -- you have a big shift. You have 1,800 crew members on board and you're going to vaccinate 1,764 of them but not 36. I mean what a loophole to allow potential COVID to be introduced In the crew area, 100% 100%, at least at the beginning, I believe, should be the model. And if the CDC wants to go in a different direction, the rest of the industry wants to go, great. We want to go 100%. We want clearance for 100%. And as of today, which is a little over a month since we submitted our proposal to the CDC, we've not yet heard back from them, and that is very disappointing."

We're simply keeping on our radar that as we recover and as we rebuild, those are opportunities where we can invest and see a significant return on. 
So I wouldn't read too much into it.

Your first question, All 3 of the initial savings we announced for Norwegian, one vessel out of Athens to the Greek Isles doing incredibly well. And to tie that with your second question, consistent with our prior history, a little over 80% of the people who are booked on those cruises out of Greece are Americans. So Americans are willing to get on an airplane and fly over there. The 2 sailings out of the Caribbean are doing better than expected. Remember that, normally, Caribbean sailings out of Miami out of South Florida, this is the low season. So we have 2 ships where we normally have 1. So the -- on relative terms, they're not going to be the highest producing vessels in terms of yields. But given what we expected, they were doing better than expected, especially given the fact that we introduced them only about a month ago. And so the booking window is very, very compressed. 
But again, speaking to the pent-up demand, it's filling up quickly. And so I'm glad we did it. It's certainly deep keeping the ship laid up, but we would have preferred to start those vessels in Alaska. start those vessels in Europe. But because of other reasons that you know of, we couldn't. And so the next best thing was to start new home ports. And we'll see what happens. We're very encouraged, especially with the vessel out of the Dominican Republic. The DR has a very good airlift to the U.S. I believe it's the #1 destination for Americans to the Caribbean. And who knows? That vessel might prove to be so profitable there that it never returns back to U.S. waters. which would be, again, one of the economic casualties of this prolonged CDC-induced suspension."

Look, I think that the narrative of too much capacity coming online pre-pandemic had pretty much been debunked. All the cruise industries were taking on the new delivery, digesting that new capacity very nicely and increasing pricing. And so we always -- our comeback always was we only have 28 ships. There are many unserved -- underserved markets that we simply don't have ships to operate in. And so we're eager to get our hands on our new vessels, all 9 of them across the 3 brands. And what we're seeing now with the pandemic is pricing is strong, demand is stronger than ever. I mean to give you a nugget of data, the Oceania and Regent brands reached their 50% load factor for 2022 over 100 days earlier than they did for the record year of 2019. Nearly 4 months they hit their 50% load factor mark earlier than ever before and at higher prices. 
So pricing power is there. In terms of capacity exits, I think from what I can see, and I don't know because different companies -- you got to ask the individual company. But from what I can see, the capacity exits have already occurred. We have the youngest fleet in the industry. So we never considered any exits and still haven't. And the order book and the future hasn't changed. So it's - they're coming. with very, very few delays, and whatever is delayed is delayed by a few weeks, a month or so. 
So look, the industry was healthy as heck before the pandemic. We're seeing during the pandemic how resilient it is, how much pent-up demand there is. We just need to get started. We just need to get all these ridiculous regulations overreach eliminated. The CDC embarking -- disembarking guests. But the rest of -- Asia has to open up. South America has to open, and a handful are open today.

Today, we will focus our commentary on the progress we have made thus far towards the resumption of cruising, the overall strength of the booking and pricing environment and our efforts to bolster our liquidity and maximize financial flexibility as we methodically return our fleet to operation. 
Over a year since the suspension of voyages worldwide, our team at Norwegian has accelerated that the time has finally come to where we shift our focus to what I like to call our Great Cruise Comeback, even if the comeback starts from international ports. 
As you can see on Slide 4, our return to service plan is centered around 3 key phases. First, we developed our multilayered SailSAFE health and safety strategy, including mandatory vaccinations for all guests and crew at its cornerstone, which I will touch on in more detail later in the call. Second, last month, we announced our initial voyage resumption plan with a two-pronged approach to restarting cruises from both within and outside of U.S. orders starting this summer. All 3 of our brands have now announced initial voyages embarking from both new and normally scheduled international ports, and we are -- and we remain engaged in active dialogue with the CDC regarding a potential resumption of cruising from U.S. ports. Lastly is the phased relaunch of the remainder of our fleet, the timing of which will depend on several factors such as the global public health environment, port openings, travel restrictions and the all-important CDC. 
Slide 5 further details our 2-pronged voyage  resumption plan. Outside of the U.S., our long-awaited return to cruising will begin in July, first with 3 Norwegian Cruise Line vessels sailing from Athens and throughout the Greek Isles and new Caribbean home ports in Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Oceania Cruises will start in late August with voyages from Copenhagen, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises were resumed from South Hampton England beginning in September with Seven Seas Splendor, our newest and most luxurious vessel, resuming her inaugural season. 
The response to our international voyage resumption has been overwhelming, and even sailings from our new Caribbean home ports are performing less than expected despite the extremely condensed booking window. I can't thank our loyal guests, value travel partners and all of our stakeholders enough for their patience and support over the past year as we prepare for our return to cruising. 
As for our work to restart voyages in the U.S., on April 5, we submitted a comprehensive ironclad proposal to the CDC requesting authorization to resume cruising this summer with the robust and healthy safety strategy I just described, which includes 100% vaccination of all guests and crew. We and the rest of the cruise industry have since continued dialogue with the CDC. And just last week, the CDC issued additional clarification for its previously outlined technical guidance, which alleviated some of the pain points in the original Phase IIa guidance. 
Even more importantly, we were pleased to see the CDC incorporate vaccines, our most powerful tool against COVID-19, into its guidance creating 2 different pathways for the resumption of cruising from U.S. ports: one for vaccinated voyages with a vaccination threshold of 95% for guests and 98% for crew; and one for nonvaccinated voyages that fall below this threshold. The vaccinated path, which is consistent with, but falls short of, our plan for 100% vaccination of guests and crew has fewer hurdles to clear before we turn to cruising, including the removal of the requirement for simulated voyages prior to [ resumed ] sailings and the relaxing of certain burdensome and costly testing requirements. 
In addition, yesterday, the CDC issued technical guidance for Phase IIb and III, which covers simulated voyages and restricted voyages and the application process for a conditional sailing certificate. The guidance includes an operations manual for simulated and restricted voyages for which we need more clarity on whether the numerous and onerous requirements would apply to vaccinated voyages as well or only to those that are not. Our team is working through the new guidance, but at first glance, however, it appears the path forward is a bit rockier and a bit steeper than originally expected. 
As time goes by, and given how long it takes to stand up a shift from cold layup, the urgent need for an acceptable and definitive agreement with the CDC is imperative as a potential mid-summer restart from U.S. ports could be in jeopardy. However, the CDC's recent willingness to engage with the industry and constructive dialogue has shown that they are committed to working with us to find an acceptable path forward, and we are certainly in a better place today than we were just 30 days ago. 
The progress we have made so far has been possible in part due to the incredible grassroots efforts undertaken across the cruise ecosystem to encourage elected officials to help resume cruising in the U.S., which supports thousands of jobs, families and small businesses throughout the country. Through CLIA's ready set sail platform,  and our own safe to sail advocacy campaign, we were able to send over 150,000 messages to elected officials throughout the United States. Thank you to all of you who have called, e-mailed or tweeted your officials in support of the cruise industry. The wind is at our back and now is the time to keep the positive momentum going with our advocacy efforts. So I encourage you to continue reaching out to your elected officials by cruising -- or excuse me, by texting cruise to 52886 and have your voices heard. 
Turning to Slide 6. We unveiled our robust and multilayered SailSAFE health and safety program, which includes mandatory vaccinations for all guests and crew as its cornerstone. We believe that vaccinations, combined with a dozens of science-backed preventive protocols including universal COVID-19 testing that were developed by the Healthy Sail Panel will provide one of if not the safest vacation option available anywhere on land or at sea. 
Our protocols extend well beyond those of the already successfully reopened travel and hospitality sectors, including hotels, resorts, casinos, theme parks, restaurants, movie theaters, arenas and airlines. SailSAFE was developed in conjunction with our expert advisers, including the Healthy Sail Panel and our newly announced SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council chaired by former FDA Commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb. The council, which is comprised of 6 of public health and scientific experts featured on Slide 7, will complement the work of the Healthy Sail Panel and provide Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings with specific expert advice on the implementation and continuous improvement of our SailSAFE program. 
Shifting to our booking trends, which you can see on Slide 8. We continue to see the strongest demand we have ever experienced for future cruise vacations across all 3 of our brands despite continued reductions of demand-generating marketing investments, the absence of a full complement of our all-important travel agent partners and a virtual lockdown from many of our international source markets. Perhaps the best indicator of this pent-up demand is our booking volumes, which during what is probably the most unorthodox wait season in our industry's history, accelerated considerably with bookings net of cancellations more than doubling versus the prior quarter. As I touched on at our last call, this demand, coupled with the opening of voyages for sale further in advance, continues to result in a significant expansion of the booking curve with the first quarter's curve nearly doubling versus the same time last year. 
Pent-up demand is particularly evident for 2022 voyages. For the first half of 2022, our load factor is meaningfully ahead of 2019 with pricing higher when excluding the dilutive impact of future cruise credits. Keep in mind that 2019 was a record year which makes the strong booking trends we are experiencing even more impressive. 
In addition, approximately 70% of our book position is comprised of new cash bookings with the remainders comprised of future cruise certificates.  By the time summer 2021 comes around and the industry begins to resume operations, more than 50 million would-be cruises will have been left ashore. So the pent-up demand is real and it's deep. And you can see that in our growing advanced ticket sales, which increased approximately $200 million on a gross basis in the quarter or up approximately 40% versus the prior quarter's build. We believe we have reached an inflection point as this is the highest gross build since the beginning of the pandemic. And as we get closer to our resumption of cruising and begin phasing in the rest of our fleet, we expect this momentum to continue to accelerate sequentially. 
Another exciting milestone reached in the quarter was the naming of Vista, the first of 2 new 1,200 guest Allura Class ships for the Oceania Cruises brand and the first new build to the line in over a decade, which you can see on Slide 9. The upscale vessel, the seventh for the line, will set sail in early 2023 followed by a sister ship in 2025. Like sister vessels, Vista will deliver the finest at sea and will introduce several unique first for the brand in the realm of dining and guest experience. More reveals of Vista's venues and experiences will begin later this month and the lead-up to the launch of sales for her inaugural voyages in September of 2021. I'll be back later to provide an update on our ESG efforts as well as provide closing remarks. But now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark?"

My remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 financial action plan and our planned return to cruising later this summer. I am pleased to say that we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel with the significant progress we have made in recent months on our return to cruising. Despite this positive momentum, we have not lost sight that the pandemic is not yet over, and we remain focused on maintaining our cost discipline and pulling all levers available to conserve cash and maximize financial flexibility in what is an improving but still uncertain environment. 
As I have said before, our team is focused on what we can control, and we continue to adapt our strategy as needed as the pandemic evolves. Slide 10 illustrates the 3 focus areas of our action plan and the additional proactive measures taken since the beginning of the first quarter. First, we continue to tightly control operating expenses and capital expenditures through a number of initiatives, including the significant reduction or outright deferral of near-term demand-generating marketing expenses and nonessential capital expenditures. As an example, our non-newbuild capital expenditures continue to be less than half our pre-pandemic expectations for 2021. In addition, we finalized EUR 50 million of incremental deferrals of newbuild related shipyard payments since our last earnings call, resulting in a total deferral of EUR 270 million through the end of the second quarter 2022. 
Second, we have made significant progress on improving our debt maturity profile to provide additional near-term financial flexibility. In March, we repaid the Pride of America and Norwegian Jewel facilities which were set to mature in 2022, leaving no significant debt maturities until 2024. We also worked with our lenders to amend certain credit agreements to free up approximately $2 billion of additional debt capacity, most of which is on an unsecured basis. While we believe our liquidity position today is strong this incremental debt capacity meaningfully improves our financial flexibility and gives us additional optionality should the need arise. And the final focus of -- area of our action plan is securing additional capital. We successfully tapped the market, which resulted in an approximately $1 billion of incremental liquidity in the quarter. 
Slide 11 illustrates the 2 highly successful capital market transactions executed in March. First, we issued $1.1 billion of senior unsecured notes consisting of a $575 million tack-on to the December unsecured notes offering and $525 million of new unsecured notes due 2028. These transactions generated approximately $650 million of incremental liquidity after repaying the Norwegian Jewel and Pride of America facilities, both of which were to mature in 2022. 
Second, we went to the market with a strategic multifaceted offering to proactively manage our balance sheet. We raised approximately $1.6 billion of proceeds net of underwriting fees through a public common equity offering of approximately 53 million shares at $30 per share. We then used approximately $1 billion of the net proceeds to fully repay the L Catterton exchangeable notes due 2026. 
This opportunistic transaction had several strategic benefits. First, it enhanced our balance sheet by effectively converting debt to equity with the prepayment of debt at par. Second, the early redemption of the L Catterton notes enabled us to repurchase a significantly lower number of shares than what would have been required if the notes were held to maturity. Third, we unlocked value and added approximately $530 million of incremental liquidity with limited additional dilution to shareholders as the vast majority of the shares were already reserved for the L Catterton notes. And lastly, we reduced our future interest expense burden. 
To date, we've accessed the capital market 7x over a 12-month period with several multi-instrument transactions. As a result, since the onset of the pandemic, we've raised more than $7.5 billion, including the drawdown of the $875 million revolver early last year. This incredible feat would not have been possible without the hard work, support and partnership of countless individuals, including our team at Norwegian, our lenders, the shipyards, investors, bankers and many, many more. 
Turning to our illustrative liquidity profile on Slide 12. Total liquidity as of March 31 was approximately $3.4 billion, which is net of the portion of customer deposit refunds that are included in accounts payable as of quarter end. We have also estimated approximately $100 million for anticipated health and safety investments. These factors combined result in a net liquidity on a pro forma basis of approximately $3.3 billion, enabling us to continue to navigate through this fluid environment and execute on our return to service plan. 
As for cash burn, our team continues to be laser-focused on cost containment and cash conservation. For the first quarter, our average monthly cash burn was in line with prior guidance at approximately $190 million or approximately $170 million per month excluding nonrecurring debt modification costs. We paid approximately $50 million of onetime costs in the quarter as a result of debt deferrals and covenant waivers and suspensions, which, when combined with the newbuild payment extensions, have resulted in approximately $1 billion of additional liquidity through first quarter of 2022. 
As for the second quarter, we expect the average cash burn to be approximately $190 million per month as we prepare for a resumption of cruising beginning in July. Restart expenses are primarily related to repositioning, provisioning and staffing of vessels, implementing new health and safety protocols and a measured ramp-up of demand-generating marketing investments. We will continue to be disciplined and take a thoughtful approach to reintroducing costs with our voyage resumptions in order to conserve cash while at the same time balancing the need to drive new cash bookings. 
Slide 21 details additional guidance we have provided for certain metrics, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and newbuild-related capital expenditures. 
Turning to Slide 13. We ended the first quarter with approximately $3.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our balance -- our cash balance in the first quarter increased driven by approximately $1.2 billion of net proceeds from capital raises. This was partially offset by approximately $570 million of operating cash burn, including operating expenses, SG&A, interest and CapEx; customer cash refunds for canceled voyages of approximately $100 million; collateral obligations of approximately $250 million; and a net working capital and other outflow of approximately $50 million, which includes health and safety investments. 
Before handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate that as we continue to navigate through this crisis and prepare to execute on our voyage resumption plans, we have not taken our focus off the future. Our medium- and long-term financial recovery plan, which is provided on Slide 14, is focused on 3 critical components: first, rebuilding and gradually returning to pre-COVID margin levels while continuing to identify opportunities to further drive margin expansion; second, maximize our cash generation; and third, focus on optimizing our balance sheet and charting a path to delever. 
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank for closing commentary."

And before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, which is reflected on Slide 15. 
Despite the current public health challenges we face, our commitment to drive a positive impact on society and the environment through the advancement of our ESG strategy remains at the core of our everyday operations. Throughout the crisis, we have remained committed to supporting our local communities and the destinations we visit. Earlier this week, we announced that we are providing a $10 million cash support to 6 Alaskan port communities to help families and small businesses with basic relief programs in the localities that are really impacted by the ongoing crew suspensions. My heart breaks for Alaska and its wonderful people as we face a potential second year of 0 or, at best, limited cruise operations during the all-important summer tourism season which would bring in another blow to Alaska's hard-hit tourism economy. We are doing everything in our power to resume cruising in the U.S. as soon as possible, so we can provide additional much-needed relied to this important region. 
In addition, we also joined the Shop Local Alaska program, which is a joint initiative between Buy Alaska and voyage. com to encourage the support of severely impacted small businesses in Alaska. This virtual platform allows consumers to live around the globe to browse and purchase a wide range of items from virtual Alaska shops. 
In our local Miami community, we provided $100,000 worth of Visa gift cards to the cruise members of the International Longshoremen’s Association Local 1416, who saw over 60% of their business wiped out nearly overnight with the suspension of cruise voyages. We were proud to support this pillar of the local community, which has been providing longshore labor to Port Miami for over 85 years and holds the historic position as the oldest Black Union in Florida. 
As part of our ongoing humanitarian efforts and in the spirit of giving back, we also provided more than $2 million of in-kind humanitarian relief to support various community organizations worldwide throughout 2020 and 2021. This support was directed to a variety of efforts, including local food banks, disaster relief and COVID-19 recovery efforts. In addition, and in celebration of teacher appreciation week on Monday, we relaunched our Giving Joy contest, which provides educators with 100 free cruises and a chance to win up to $25,000 cash awards for their schools. Throughout this unprecedented period, countless teachers have worked tirelessly to give their all to their students. And we believe now, more than ever, they deserve our recognition and gratitude. 
On the environmental front, we are honored to receive the prestigious 2021 ACG Build America Merit Award for environmental enhancement for our newly constructed double ship peer at Ward Cove in Alaska. Through this project, we were able to transform Ward Cove a superfund site into a sustainable, environmentally friendly and entertaining sites for the local community and cruise visitors alike. Going forward, we continue to be focused on enhancing our ESG disclosures to provide additional transparency, and I look forward to sharing additional details with you as we continue on our ESG journey. 
Turning to Slide 16. I'd like to leave you with a few final key takeaways. First, we are putting health and safety at the forefront of our return to service plan as demonstrated by our science-backed SailSAFE health and safety program which includes 100% vaccination of all guests and crew in addition to comprehensive protocols. We will continue to work with our expert advisers to involve these protocols over time with the latest science and technology developments. 
We are focused on our Great Cruise Comeback with our phased voyage resumption plans, both within and outside of U.S. ports. At the same time, we are keeping our longer-term strategic and financial priorities in focus as we execute on our recovery plans. And lastly, we continue to experience strong future demand for cruising across all 3 of our award-winning brands with very positive booking and pricing trends for 2022 and beyond. 
Overall, I am more hopeful today than when I spoke with you last. I can't thank enough our dedicated and passionate team members around the globe for all their hard work and perseverance which has brought us to this critical point in which will propel us forward. We still have a long road to full recovery ahead of us, but we are optimistic and encouraged by the progress we have recently made to a resumption of cruising as well as the continued robust demand we are seeing from our loyal guests. We can't wait to get back to what we do best, providing guests with incredible experiences and lifetime memories and our shareholders with industry-leading financial metrics and year-over-year improved financial results. And with that, Josh, please let's open the call for questions."

So putting the crew together with the vaccine, these are all challenges that may impact our ability to stand up ships in the future but we don't really believe that it will. With vaccines coming on, the surplus of vaccines now coming on pretty strong around, at least around the U.S., we feel that we'll be able to stand up the vessels on a pretty good clip."

CDC, themselves, have stated that cruising or any activity cannot be zero risk. They've acknowledged that vaccines is the game changer. That's why society is racing towards vaccinations as fast as possible. which is why we proposed the CDC back on April 5 an ironclad multipronged approach to the situation, which is everyone on board has to be vaccinated. So I have to tell you that I am disappointed at first read. I'm going to give the CDC an opportunity to expand and clarify, we have a call with them this afternoon, on some of the requirements. 
For example, as we read yesterday's pronouncements, even though everyone on board would be vaccinated, in between bites of your meal and in between sips of your beverage, you have to put on your mask, take off your mask. So nobody should order soup because your mass might get sloppy. So that, to me, is just prosperous. It's not in the spirit of where the country is heading, where President Biden wants to open the country. 70% of American adults will be vaccinated by the beginning of the third quarter. So we hope that we're reading it wrong. We hope that there would be clarifications. Quite frankly, we're hoping that these -- some of these more onerous requirements in Phase IIb only apply to cruises and ships or brands or companies that are not going to vaccinate the 95% of passengers and 98% of crew as mandated by the CDC. We hope that if you do get to 95%, 98% or even better the 100, 100 that Norwegian is proposing, that there won't be a need for such impractical, onerous, burdensome requirements. So we'll see what happens over the next few days as we engage with them, reengage with them on these particular phases. But certainly, on first read, we were disappointed."

So from April 5, when we submitted our proposal, 90 days would have been early July, and that was possible. But today, we're in early May. So now we're looking past that. But look, there's more to it than just what the CDC says. There is only so much capacity to be able to stand up vessels. We -- standing up a vessel after a 15-, 18-month cold layup is not an overnight exercise. It takes a while, and making it more complicated is the travel restrictions for crew, the vaccination mandates that we are imposing for crews. So we are focused on standing up our first 5 vessels that we've announced, first 6 vessels that we've announced for Norwegian, Oceania region outside the U.S. As you know, we, the industry, we -- our company regularly operate vessels outside the U.S., especially in the summer season, where Europe is the big draw. And so July, August, September is summer, and the best and highest use for our vessels is to operate in Europe, and that's what we're doing. In a couple of occasions, we are standing up vessels in the Caribbean because the CDC up to now has not given us a pathway. We'll see how things progress over time. But remember, it is a seasonal industry. And outside of Alaska, which is in doubt, not only because of the CDC, but because of the Canadian situation, outside of Alaska, The world's cruise fleets are typically outside of the U.S. in the summertime, where we're cruising elsewhere. We're including primarily in the Mediterranean and Northern Europe, et cetera. So seasonality plays a big role and as well the final CDC regulations will play a big role."

When we talk about our islands and our infrastructure, we've been talking about this for a while that we believe the private islands are a unique destination that we can continue to monetize in a positive economic way. That said, we are not targeting anything with our comeback, where it would force us to have significant CapEx around that. We're simply keeping on our radar that as we recover and as we rebuild, those are opportunities where we can invest and see a significant return on. 
So I wouldn't read too much into it. But as we go forward, we're going to balance all needs, whether it's delevering, trying to take out some debt, investing in the fleet, investing in our islands, investments to become more efficient. That's all going to be in our playbook, and we'll balance the needs accordingly."

Your first question, All 3 of the initial savings we announced for Norwegian, one vessel out of Athens to the Greek Isles doing incredibly well. And to tie that with your second question, consistent with our prior history, a little over 80% of the people who are booked on those cruises out of Greece are Americans. So Americans are willing to get on an airplane and fly over there. The 2 sailings out of the Caribbean are doing better than expected. Remember that, normally, Caribbean sailings out of Miami out of South Florida, this is the low season. So we have 2 ships where we normally have 1. So the -- on relative terms, they're not going to be the highest producing vessels in terms of yields. But given what we expected, they were doing better than expected, especially given the fact that we introduced them only about a month ago. And so the booking window is very, very compressed. 
But again, speaking to the pent-up demand, it's filling up quickly. And so I'm glad we did it. It's certainly deep keeping the ship laid up, but we would have preferred to start those vessels in Alaska. start those vessels in Europe. But because of other reasons that you know of, we couldn't. And so the next best thing was to start new home ports. And we'll see what happens. We're very encouraged, especially with the vessel out of the Dominican Republic. The DR has a very good airlift to the U.S. I believe it's the #1 destination for Americans to the Caribbean. And who knows? That vessel might prove to be so profitable there that it never returns back to U.S. waters. which would be, again, one of the economic casualties of this prolonged CDC-induced suspension."

Pre-COVID, there was concern in the industry of elevated capacity additions, limiting pricing power. Based on what you're seeing today with scrapping or delaying of the scheduled arrivals, how much lower do you think industry capacity ends up shaking out over the next couple of years? And what are you seeing early on right now for longer-dated sailings in '22 and '23? And how does that shape your view of industry pricing going forward?"

Look, I think that the narrative of too much capacity coming online pre-pandemic had pretty much been debunked. All the cruise industries were taking on the new delivery, digesting that new capacity very nicely and increasing pricing. And so we always -- our comeback always was we only have 28 ships. There are many unserved -- underserved markets that we simply don't have ships to operate in. And so we're eager to get our hands on our new vessels, all 9 of them across the 3 brands. And what we're seeing now with the pandemic is pricing is strong, demand is stronger than ever. I mean to give you a nugget of data, the Oceania and Regent brands reached their 50% load factor for 2022 over 100 days earlier than they did for the record year of 2019. Nearly 4 months they hit their 50% load factor mark earlier than ever before and at higher prices. 
So pricing power is there. In terms of capacity exits, I think from what I can see, and I don't know because different companies -- you got to ask the individual company. But from what I can see, the capacity exits have already occurred. We have the youngest fleet in the industry. So we never considered any exits and still haven't. And the order book and the future hasn't changed. So it's - they're coming. with very, very few delays, and whatever is delayed by a few weeks, a month or so. 
So look, the industry was healthy as heck before the pandemic. We're seeing during the pandemic how resilient it is, how much pent-up demand there is. We just need to get started. We just need to get all these ridiculous regulations, this overreach eliminated. And listen, I'll tell you this, if we could operate -- given what's on the books right now for 2022, if we can operate the itineraries that we're actually selling, 2022 could be a record year. That's how good things are. But the big risk is can we operate. Are we going to have to continue to cancel sailings because of this rolling conditional sail order, which is very difficult to comply with? 
And it's not just the CDC. Let's -- let me try to be a little fair here. The rest of the world has got to open up as well. The CDC affects U.S. embarking, disembarking guests, but the rest of Europe has to open up. Asia has to open up. South America has to open up. Remember, this is a global industry. Cruise companies visit 500 ports around the world, and only a handful are open today. And so that's the risk. How quickly can the world return to normal, to opening up the ports, to lifting the travel restrictions, et cetera? But from a pure market dynamic point of view, 2022 would be a record year."

And just kind of a couple of quick questions.

And also, which ones of your lines are seeing the strongest demand and the best pricing?
And then one last thing. No. A lot of the travel industry has started to embrace the concept that's been driven by a certain company that books houses as working from home doesn't have to be your home. And the work from anywhere can be anywhere, and maybe there's an opportunity to address people that want to work from anywhere, including a cruise ship from time to time would be a great place to work."

I think that's a little fatty Remember, you work from home because you have this incredible fast Internet service. As you know, Internet service on a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean is not optimal. So I wouldn't get too carried away on that one, Ivan. 
Look, in terms of overall demand, we're hitting only on partial cylinders. The U.S. is by far the biggest driver of new demand, even though we have 50,000 cases a day and all the restrictions that we still have to live with in the new cycle and everything else. Europe, for the most part, has not reopened in terms of a robust marketing and travel agencies coming back. The U.K. is doing okay, Australia, New Zealand, which, as I think you know, has always been #3, #4 top source market for us, is completely closed down. 
So the fact that we're doing as well as we're doing with marketing spend that is in the neighborhood of 30% to 40% of what we normally spend, the new cycle, the travel restrictions, the unknown, right, we're just not sure what's going to be happening. There is no certainty. The international source markets for the most part being suboptimal. I mean, like I said in my prepared remarks, the pent-up demand is deep, 50 million people. By the time summer rolls around, 33 million people cruise a year. We will have been shut down 18 months. That's 50 million people that would have cruised that haven't cruised. 
And so I think we have a pent-up demand tail that we're going to be able to enjoy over the next couple of years, certainly in '22 and into '23 and perhaps beyond. Because look, it's sort of like the yin and the yang. We've gone with no cruising. It was 0. And these people want to cruise and they're going to cruise in the future. And so we believe that sets up a beautiful dynamic for increased pricing, and we're taking advantage of it to be as well booked as we are. And again, I gave you a nugget that Oceania and Regent hit their 50% load factor for 2022 over 100 days earlier than they ever had before, and their pricing is up. Even with the FCC dilution, it's just unbelievable. Just let me cruise CDC, and we'll have incredible financial results. Just let us cruise."

As always, I hope that all of you joining us today, as well as your loved ones, remain healthy and safe.  
Today, we will focus our commentary on the progress we have made thus far towards the resumption of cruising, the overall strength of the booking and pricing environment and our efforts to bolster our liquidity and maximize financial flexibility as we methodically return our fleet to operations.  
Over a year since the suspension of voyages worldwide, our team at Norwegian has accelerated, yet the time has finally come to where we shift our focus to what I like to call our Great Cruise Comeback, even if the comeback starts from international ports.  
As you can see on Slide 4, our return to service plan is centered around 3 key phases. First, we developed our multilayered SailSAFE health and safety strategy, including mandatory vaccinations for all guests and crew at its cornerstone, which I will touch on in more detail later in the call. 
Second, last month, we announced our initial voyage resumption plan with a two-pronged approach to restarting cruises from both within and outside of U.S. waters starting this summer. All 3 of our brands have now announced initial voyages embarking from both new and normally scheduled international ports, and we are -- and we remain engaged in active dialogue with the CDC regarding a potential resumption of cruising from U.S. ports. 
Lastly is the phased relaunch of the remainder of our fleet, the timing of which will depend on several factors such as the global public health environment, port openings, travel restrictions and the all-important CDC.  
Slide 5 further details our 2-pronged voyage  resumption plan. Outside of the U.S., our long-awaited return to cruising will begin in July, first with 3 Norwegian Cruise Line vessels sailing from Athens and throughout the Greek Isles and new Caribbean home ports in Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Oceania Cruises will start in late August with voyages from Copenhagen, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises will resume from South Hampton England beginning in September, with Seven Seas Splendor, our newest and most luxurious vessel, resuming her inaugural season. 
The response to our international voyage resumption has been overwhelming, and even sailings from our new Caribbean home ports are performing better than expected, despite the extremely condensed booking window. I can't thank our loyal guests, value travel partners and all of our stakeholders enough for their patience and support over the past year as we prepare for our return to cruising.  
As for our work to restart voyages in the U.S., on April 5, we submitted a comprehensive ironclad proposal to the CDC requesting authorization to resume cruising this summer with the robust and healthy safety strategy I just described, which includes 100% vaccination of all guests and crew. We and the rest of the cruise industry have since continued dialogue with the CDC. And just last week, the CDC issued additional clarification for its previously outlined technical guidance, which alleviated some of the pain points in the original Phase IIa guidance.  
Even more importantly, we were pleased to see the CDC incorporate vaccines, our most powerful tool against COVID-19, into its guidance, creating 2 different pathways for the resumption of cruising from U.S. ports: one for vaccinated voyages with a vaccination threshold of 95% for guests and 98% for crew; and one for nonvaccinated voyages that fall below this threshold. 
The vaccinated path, which is consistent with, but falls short of, our plan for 100% vaccination of guests and crew has fewer hurdles to clear before we turn to cruising, including the removal of the requirement for simulated voyages prior to revenue sailings and the relaxing of certain burdensome and costly testing requirements.  
In addition, yesterday, the CDC issued technical guidance for Phase IIb and III, which covers simulated voyages and restricted voyages and the application process for a conditional sailing certificate. The guidance includes an operations manual for simulated and restricted voyages for which we need more clarity on whether the numerous and onerous requirements would apply to vaccinated voyages as well or only to those that are not. 
Our team is working through the new guidance. But at first glance, however, it appears the path forward is a bit rockier and a bit steeper than originally expected.  
As time goes by, and given how long it takes to stand up a shift from cold layup, the urgent need for an acceptable and definitive agreement with the CDC is imperative as a potential mid-summer restart from U.S. ports could be in jeopardy. However, the CDC's recent willingness to engage with the industry in constructive dialogue has shown that they are committed to working with us to find an acceptable path forward, and we are certainly in a better place today than we were just 30 days ago.  
The progress we have made so far has been possible in part due to the incredible grassroot efforts undertaken across the cruise ecosystem to encourage elected officials to help resume cruising in the U.S., which supports thousands of jobs, families and small businesses throughout the country. Through CLIA's Ready, Set, Sail platform,  and our own Safe to Sail advocacy campaign, we were able to send over 150,000 messages to elected officials throughout the United States. Thank you to all of you who have called, e-mailed or tweeted your officials in support of the cruise industry.  
The wind is at our back, and now is the time to keep the positive momentum going with our advocacy efforts, so I encourage you to continue reaching out to your elected officials by cruising -- or excuse me, by texting Cruise to 52886 and have your voices heard.  
Turning to Slide 6. We unveiled our robust and multilayered SailSAFE health and safety program, which includes mandatory vaccinations for all guests and crew as its cornerstone. We believe that vaccinations, combined with a dozens of science-backed preventive protocols, including universal COVID-19 testing that were developed by the Healthy Sail Panel, will provide one of, if not, the safest vacation option available anywhere on land or at sea.  
Our protocols extend well beyond those of the already successfully reopened travel and hospitality sectors, including hotels, resorts, casinos, theme parks, restaurants, movie theaters, arenas and airlines. SailSAFE was developed in conjunction with our expert advisers, including the Healthy Sail Panel and our newly announced SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council chaired by former FDA Commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb. The Council, which is comprised of 6 public health and scientific experts featured on Slide 7, will complement the work of the Healthy Sail Panel and provide Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings with specific expert advice on the implementation and continuous improvement of our SailSAFE program.  
Shifting to our booking trends, which you can see on Slide 8, we continue to see the strongest demand we have ever experienced for future cruise vacations across all 3 of our brands, despite continued reductions of demand-generating marketing investments, the absence of a full complement of our all-important travel agent partners and a virtual lockdown for many of our international source markets. Perhaps the best indicator of this pent-up demand is our booking volumes, which, during what is probably the most unorthodox wait season in our industry's history, accelerated considerably with bookings net of cancellations more than doubling versus the prior quarter.  
As I touched on at our last call, this demand, coupled with the opening of voyages for sale further in advance, continues to result in a significant expansion of the booking curve, with the first quarter's curve nearly doubling versus the same time last year. 
Pent-up demand is particularly evident for 2022 voyages. For the first half of 2022, our load factor is meaningfully ahead of 2019, with pricing higher when excluding the dilutive impact of future cruise credits. Keep in mind that 2019 was a record year, which makes the strong booking trends we are experiencing even more impressive.  
In addition, approximately 70% of our book position is comprised of new cash bookings, with the remainders comprised of future cruise certificates.  By the time summer 2021 comes around and the industry begins to resume operations, more than 50 million would-be cruises will have been left ashore, so the pent-up demand is real and it's deep, and you can see that in our growing advanced ticket sales, which increased approximately $200 million on a gross basis in the quarter or up approximately 40% versus the prior quarter's build. 
We believe we have reached an inflection point, as this is the highest gross build since the beginning of the pandemic. And as we get closer to our resumption of cruising and begin phasing in the rest of our fleet, we expect this momentum to continue to accelerate sequentially.  
Another exciting milestone reached in the quarter was the naming of Vista, the first of 2 new 1,200 guest Allura Class ships for the Oceania Cruises brand and the first new build to the line in over a decade, which you can see on Slide 9. The upscale vessel, the seventh for the line, will set sail in early 2023 followed by a sister ship in 2025. Like her sister vessels, Vista will deliver the finest cuisine at sea and will introduce several unique first for the brand in the realm of dining and guest experience. 
More reveals of Vista's venues and experiences will begin later this month, and the lead-up to the launch and sails for her inaugural voyages in September of 2021. I'll be back later to provide an update on our ESG efforts as well as provide closing remarks. 
But now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark?"

I am pleased to say that we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel, with the significant progress we have made in recent months on our return to cruising. Despite this positive momentum, we have not lost sight that the pandemic is not yet over, and we remain focused on maintaining our cost discipline and pulling all levers available to conserve cash and maximize financial flexibility in what is an improving but still uncertain environment.  
As I have said before, our team is focused on what we can control, and we continue to adapt our strategy as needed as the pandemic evolves. Slide 10 illustrates the 3 focus areas of our action plan and the additional proactive measures taken since the beginning of the first quarter. 
First, we continue to tightly control operating expenses and capital expenditures through a number of initiatives, including the significant reduction or outright deferral of near-term demand-generating marketing expenses and nonessential capital expenditures. As an example, our non-newbuild capital expenditures continue to be less than half our pre-pandemic expectations for 2021. In addition, we finalized EUR 50 million of incremental deferrals of newbuild-related shipyard payments since our last earnings call, resulting in a total deferral of EUR 270 million through the end of the second quarter 2022.  
Second, we have made significant progress on improving our debt maturity profile to provide additional near-term financial flexibility. In March, we repaid the Pride of America and Norwegian Jewel facilities, which were set to mature in 2022, leaving no significant debt maturities until 2024. 
We also worked with our lenders to amend certain credit agreements to free up approximately $2 billion of additional debt capacity, most of which is on an unsecured basis. While we believe our liquidity position today is strong, this incremental debt capacity meaningfully improves our financial flexibility and gives us additional optionality should the need arise.  
And the final focus of -- area of our action plan is securing additional capital. We successfully tapped the market, which resulted in an approximately $1 billion of incremental liquidity in the quarter. 
Slide 11 illustrates the 2 highly successful capital market transactions executed in March. First, we issued $1.1 billion of senior unsecured notes consisting of a $575 million tack-on to the December unsecured notes offering and $525 million of new unsecured notes due 2028. These transactions generated approximately $650 million of incremental liquidity after repaying the Norwegian Jewel and Pride of America facilities, both of which were to mature in 2022.  
Second, we went to the market with a strategic multifaceted offering to proactively manage our balance sheet. We raised approximately $1.6 billion of proceeds net of underwriting fees through a public common equity offering of approximately 53 million shares at $30 per share. We then used approximately $1 billion of the net proceeds to fully repay the L Catterton exchangeable notes due 2026.  
This opportunistic transaction had several strategic benefits. First, it enhanced our balance sheet by effectively converting debt to equity with the prepayment of debt at par. Second, the early redemption of the L Catterton notes enabled us to repurchase a significantly lower number of shares than what would have been required if the notes were held to maturity. Third, we unlocked value and added approximately $530 million of incremental liquidity, with limited additional dilution to shareholders, as the vast majority of the shares were already reserved for the L Catterton notes. And lastly, we reduced our future interest expense burden. 
To date, we've accessed the capital market 7x over a 12-month period with several multi-instrument transactions. As a result, since the onset of the pandemic, we've raised more than $7.5 billion, including the drawdown of the $875 million revolver early last year. This incredible feat would not have been possible without the hard work, support and partnership of countless individuals, including our team at Norwegian, our lenders, the shipyards, investors, bankers and many, many more.
Turning to our illustrative liquidity profile on Slide 12. Total liquidity as of March 31 was approximately $3.4 billion, which is net of the portion of customer deposit refunds that are included in accounts payable as of quarter end. We have also estimated approximately $100 million for anticipated health and safety investments. These factors combined result in a net liquidity on a pro forma basis of approximately $3.3 billion, enabling us to continue to navigate through this fluid environment and execute on our return to service plan.  
As for cash burn, our team continues to be laser-focused on cost containment and cash conservation. For the first quarter, our average monthly cash burn was in line with prior guidance at approximately $190 million or approximately $170 million per month, excluding nonrecurring debt modification costs. We paid approximately $50 million of onetime costs in the quarter as a result of debt deferrals and covenant waivers and suspensions, which, when combined with the newbuild payment extensions, have resulted in approximately $1 billion of additional liquidity through first quarter of 2022.  
As for the second quarter, we expect the average cash burn to be approximately $190 million per month as we prepare for a resumption of cruising beginning in July. Restart expenses are primarily related to repositioning, provisioning and staffing of vessels, implementing new health and safety protocols and a measured ramp-up of demand-generating marketing investments. We will continue to be disciplined and take a thoughtful approach to reintroducing costs with our voyage resumptions in order to conserve cash while, at the same time, balancing the need to drive new cash bookings.  
Slide 21 details additional guidance we have provided for certain metrics, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and newbuild-related capital expenditures.  
Turning to Slide 13. We ended the first quarter with approximately $3.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our balance -- our cash balance in the first quarter increased driven by approximately $1.2 billion of net proceeds from capital raises. This was partially offset by approximately $570 million of operating cash burn, including operating expenses, SG&A, interest and CapEx; customer cash refunds for canceled voyages of approximately $100 million; collateral obligations of approximately $250 million; and a net working capital and other outflow of approximately $50 million, which includes health and safety investments.  
Before handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate that, as we continue to navigate through this crisis and prepare to execute on our voyage resumption plans, we have not taken our focus off the future. Our medium- and long-term financial recovery plan, which is provided on Slide 14, is focused on 3 critical components: first, rebuilding and gradually returning to pre-COVID margin levels, while continuing to identify opportunities to further drive margin expansion; second, maximize our cash generation; and third, focus on optimizing our balance sheet and charting a path to delever.  
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank for closing commentary."

And before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, which is reflected on Slide 15.  
Despite the current public health challenges we face, our commitment to drive a positive impact on society and the environment through the advancement of our ESG strategy remains at the core of our everyday operations. Throughout the crisis, we have remained committed to supporting our local communities and the destinations we visit. 
Earlier this week, we announced that we are providing a $10 million cash support to 6 Alaskan port communities to help families and small businesses with basic relief programs in the localities that are really impacted by the ongoing cruise suspensions. My heart breaks for Alaska and its wonderful people as we face a potential second year of 0 or, at best, limited cruise operations during the all-important summer tourism season, which would bring in another blow to Alaska's hard-hit tourism economy. We are doing everything in our power to resume cruising in the U.S. as soon as possible, so we can provide additional much-needed relief to this important region.  
In addition, we also joined the Shop Local Alaska program, which is a joint initiative between BuyAlaska and Voyij.com to encourage and support the severely impacted small businesses in Alaska. This virtual platform allows consumers who live around the globe to browse and purchase a wide range of items from virtual Alaska shops.  
In our local Miami community, we provided $100,000 worth of Visa gift cards to the cruise members of the International Longshoremen's Association Local 1416, who saw over 60% of their business wiped out nearly overnight with the suspension of cruise voyages. We were proud to support this pillar of the local community, which has been providing longshore labor to Port Miami for over 85 years and holds the historic position as the oldest Black union in Florida.  
As part of our ongoing humanitarian efforts and in the spirit of giving back, we also provided more than $2 million of in-kind humanitarian relief to support various community organizations worldwide throughout 2020 and 2021. This support was directed to a variety of efforts, including local food banks, disaster relief and COVID-19 recovery efforts. 
In addition, and in celebration of Teacher Appreciation Week on Monday, we relaunched our Giving Joy contest, which provides educators with 100 free cruises and a chance to win up to $25,000 cash awards for their schools. Throughout this unprecedented period, countless teachers have worked tirelessly to give their all to their students. And we believe now, more than ever, they deserve our recognition and gratitude.  
On the environmental front, we are honored to receive the prestigious 2021 ACG Build America Merit Award for environmental enhancement for our newly constructed double ship pier at Ward Cove in Ketchikan, Alaska. Through this project, we were able to transform Ward Cove, a superfund site, into a sustainable, environmentally friendly and entertaining sites for the local community and cruise visitors alike. 
Going forward, we continue to be focused on enhancing our ESG disclosures to provide additional transparency, and I look forward to sharing additional details with you as we continue on our ESG journey.  
Turning to Slide 16. I'd like to leave you with a few final key takeaways. First, we are putting health and safety at the forefront of our return to service plan as demonstrated by our science-backed SailSAFE health and safety program, which includes 100% vaccination of all guests and crew, in addition to comprehensive protocols. We will continue to work with our expert advisers to evolve these protocols over time with the latest science and technology developments.  
We are focused on our Great Cruise Comeback with our phased voyage resumption plans, both within and outside of U.S. ports. At the same time, we are keeping our longer-term strategic and financial priorities in focus, as we execute on our recovery plans.  
And lastly, we continue to experience strong future demand for cruising across all 3 of our award-winning brands with very positive booking and pricing trends for 2022 and beyond.  
Overall, I am more hopeful today than when I spoke with you last. I can't thank enough our dedicated and passionate team members around the globe for all their hard work and perseverance, which has brought us to this critical point and which will propel us forward. We still have a long road to full recovery ahead of us, but we are optimistic and encouraged by the progress we have recently made to a resumption of cruising as well as the continued robust demand we are seeing from our loyal guests. 
We can't wait to get back to what we do best, providing guests with incredible experiences and lifetime memories, and our shareholders with industry-leading financial metrics and year-over-year improved financial results. 
And with that, Josh, please let's open the call for questions."

Visas -- consulates and embassies are slow in issuing visas. The situation in India, now we all know about. And then, of course, we have committed to 100% vaccination of crew. 
So putting the crew together with the vaccine, these are all challenges that may impact our ability to stand up ships in the future, but we don't really believe that it will. With vaccines coming on -- the surplus of vaccines now coming on pretty strong around -- at least around the U.S., we feel that we'll be able to stand up the vessels on a pretty good clip."

CDC, themselves, have stated that cruising or any activity cannot be zero risk. They've acknowledged that vaccines is the game changer, that's why society is racing towards vaccinations as fast as possible. which is why we proposed to the CDC back on April 5 an ironclad multipronged approach to the situation, which is everyone on board has to be vaccinated. 
So I have to tell you that I am disappointed at first read. I'm going to give the CDC an opportunity to expand and clarify. We have a call with them this afternoon on some of the requirements. For example, as we read yesterday's pronouncements, even though everyone on board would be vaccinated, in between bites of your meal and in between sips of your beverage, you have to put on your mask, take off your mask. So nobody should order soup because your mask might get sloppy. 
So that, to me, is just prosperous. It's not in the spirit of where the country is heading, where President Biden wants to open the country. 70% of American adults will be vaccinated by the beginning of the third quarter. So we hope that we're reading it wrong. We hope that there would be clarifications. 
Quite frankly, we're hoping that these -- some of these more onerous requirements in the -- in Phase IIb only apply to cruises or ships or brands or companies that are not going to vaccinate the 95% of passengers and 98% of crew as mandated by the CDC. We hope that if you do get to 95%, 98% or even better the 100% that Norwegian is proposing that there won't be a need for such impractical, onerous, burdensome requirements. 
So we'll see what happens over the next few days as we engage with them -- reengage with them on these particular phases. But certainly, on first read, we were disappointed."

So from April 5, when we submitted our proposal, 90 days would have been early July, and that was possible. But today, we're in early May. So now we're looking past that. 
But look, there's more to it than just what the CDC says. There is only so much capacity to be able to stand up vessels. We -- standing up a vessel after a 15-, 18-month cold layup is not an overnight exercise. It takes a while, and making it more complicated is the travel restrictions for crew, the vaccination mandates that we are imposing for crews. 
So we are focused on standing up our first 5 vessels that we've announced -- first 6 vessels that we've announced for Norwegian, Oceania and Regent outside the U.S. As you know, we, the industry, we -- our company regularly operate vessels outside the U.S., especially in the summer season, where Europe is the big draw. 
And so July, August, September is summer, and the best and highest use for our vessels is to operate in Europe, and that's what we're doing. In a couple of occasions, we are standing up vessels in the Caribbean because the CDC up to now has not given us a pathway. 
We'll see how things progress over time. But remember, it is a seasonal industry. And outside of Alaska, which is in doubt, not only because of the CDC, but because of the Canadian situation, outside of Alaska, the world's cruise fleets are typically outside of the U.S. in the summertime, where we're cruising elsewhere. We're cruising primarily in the Mediterranean and Northern Europe, et cetera. So seasonality plays a big role. And as well, the final CDC regulations will play a big role."

And look, it's not like the CDC has done a great job of controlling the virus around the country. We ranked #1 in the world for the most infections, the most hospitalization, I think the most deaths. Yet they pick on the cruise industry to an extreme. That is just unbelievable, unexplainable and frustrates us to no end.

Those continue, but it is a classic state versus federal government issue. Legally, lawyers believe that federal law applies and not state law, but I'm not a lawyer. And we hope that this hasn't become a legal football or a political football. 
But at the end of the day, cruise ships have motors, propellers and rudders. And God forbid, we can't operate in the state of Florida for whatever reason, then there are other states that we do operate from. And we can operate from the Caribbean for ships that otherwise would have gone to Florida. 
We certainly hope it doesn't come to that. Everyone wants to operate out of Florida. It's a very lucrative market. It's close drive market. So -- but it is an issue. Can't ignore it. And we hope that everyone is pushing in the same direction, which is we want to resume cruising in a safe manner, especially at the beginning.  
Things might be different 6 months from now or a year from now. But today, with the pandemic still being front and center in everybody's mind, and we're just getting out of the worst part of it just weeks ago, I think everyone should be wanting to start cruising in the safest possible manner, and that's exactly what the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings plan does, 100% vaccination of both crew and passengers. 
For the life of me, I don't understand 98% and not 100%. So you got a -- you have a big shift. You have 1,800 crew members on board and you're going to vaccinate 1,764 of them, but not 36. I mean, what a loophole to allow potential COVID to be introduced In the crew area. 100%, 100% at least at the beginning, I believe, should be the model. And if the CDC wants to go in a different direction, the rest of the industry wants to go, great. 
We want to go 100%. We want clearance for 100%. And as of today, which is a little over a month since we submitted our proposal to the CDC, we've not yet heard back from them, and that is very disappointing."

That said, we are not targeting anything with our comeback, where it would force us to have significant CapEx around that. We're simply keeping on our radar that as we recover and as we rebuild, those are opportunities where we can invest and see a significant return on. 
So I wouldn't read too much into it. But as we go forward, we're going to balance all needs, whether it's delevering, trying to take out some debt, investing in the fleet, investing in our islands, investments to become more efficient.

Your first question, all 3 of the initial savings we announced for Norwegian, one vessel out of Athens to the Greek Isles doing incredibly well. And to tie that with your second question, consistent with our prior history, a little over 80% of the people who are booked on those cruises out of Greece are Americans. So Americans are willing to get on an airplane and fly over there. 
The 2 sailings out of the Caribbean are doing better than expected. Remember that normally, Caribbean sailings out of Miami, out of South Florida, this is the low season, so we have 2 ships where we normally have 1. So the -- on relative terms, they're not going to be the highest producing vessels in terms of yields. But given what we expected, they're doing better than expected, especially given the fact that we introduced them only about a month ago, and so the booking window is very, very compressed. 
But again, speaking to the pent-up demand, it's filling up quickly, and so I'm glad we did it. It's certainly the -- keeping the ship laid up, but we would have preferred to start those vessels in Alaska, start those vessels in Europe. But because of other reasons that you know of, we couldn't. 
And so the next best thing was to start new home ports, and we'll see what happens. We're very encouraged, especially with the vessel out of the Dominican Republic. The DR has a very good airlift to the U.S. I believe it's the #1 destination for Americans to the Caribbean. And who knows? That vessel might prove to be so profitable there that it never returns back to U.S. waters. which would be, again, one of the economic casualties of this prolonged CDC-induced suspension."

Pre-COVID, there was concern in the industry of elevated capacity additions limiting pricing power.

And what are you seeing early on right now for longer-dated sailings in '22 and '23? And how does that shape your view of industry pricing going forward?"

Look, I think that the narrative of too much capacity coming online pre-pandemic had pretty much been debunked. All the cruise industries were taking on the new delivery, digesting that new capacity very nicely and increasing pricing. And so we always -- our comeback always was we only have 28 ships. There are many unserved -- underserved markets that we simply don't have ships to operate in. And so we're eager to get our hands on our new vessels, all 9 of them across the 3 brands. 
 
And what we're seeing now with the -- in the pandemic is pricing is strong, demand is stronger than ever. I mean, to give you a nugget of data, the Oceania and Regent brands reached their 50% load factor for 2022 over 100 days earlier than they did for the record year of 2019. Nearly 4 months, they hit their 50% load factor mark earlier than ever before and at higher prices. So pricing power is there. 
In terms of capacity exits, I think, from what I can see, and I don't know because different companies -- you got to ask the individual company. But from what I can see, the capacity exits have already occurred. We have the youngest fleet in the industry, so we never considered any exits and still haven't. 
And the order book and the future hasn't changed. So it's - they're coming with very, very few delays. And whatever is delayed is delayed by a few weeks, a month or so. 
So look, the industry was healthy as heck before the pandemic. We're seeing during the pandemic how resilient it is, how much pent-up demand there is. We just need to get started. We just need to get all these ridiculous regulations, this overreach eliminated. 
And listen, I'll tell you this. If we could operate -- given what's on the books right now for 2022, if we can operate the itineraries that we're actually selling, 2022 could be a record year. That's how good things are. But the big risk is can we operate? Are we going to have to continue to cancel sailings because of this rolling conditional sail order, which is very difficult to comply with? 
And it's not just the CDC. Let's -- let me try to be a little fair here. The rest of the world has got to open up as well. The CDC affects U.S. embarking, disembarking guests, but the rest of Europe has to open up. Asia has to open up. South America has to open up. Remember, this is a global industry. 
Cruise companies visit 500 ports around the world, and only a handful are open today. And so that's the risk, how quickly can the world return to normal, to opening up the ports, to lifting the travel restrictions, et cetera. But from a pure market dynamic point of view, 2022 would be a record year."

And also what -- which ones of your lines are seeing the strongest demand and the best pricing?
And then one last thing. A lot of the travel industry has started to embrace the concept that's been driven by a certain company that books houses as working from home doesn't have to be your home. And the work from anywhere can be anywhere, and maybe there's some opportunity to address people that want to work from anywhere, including a cruise ship from time to time would be a great place to work."

Remember, you work from home because you have this incredible fast Internet service. As you know, Internet service on a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean is not optimal. So I wouldn't get too carried away on that one, Ivan. 
Look, in terms of overall demand, we're hitting only on partial cylinders. The U.S. is by far the biggest driver of new demand, even though we have 50,000 cases a day, and all the restrictions that we still have to live with and the new cycle and everything else. Europe, for the most part, has not reopened in terms of a robust marketing and travel agencies coming back. The U.K. is doing okay. Australia, New Zealand, which, as I think you know, has always been #3, #4 top source market for us, is completely closed down. 
So the fact that we're doing as well as we're doing, with marketing spend that is in the neighborhood of 30% to 40% of what we normally spend, the new cycle, the travel restrictions, the unknown, right, we're just not sure what's going to be happening. There is no certainty. 
The international source markets for the most part being suboptimal. I mean, like I said in my prepared remarks, the pent-up demand is deep, 50 million people. By the time summer rolls around, 33 million people cruise a year. We will have been shut down 18 months. That's 50 million people that would have cruised that haven't cruised. 
And so I think we have a pent-up demand tail that we're going to be able to enjoy over the next couple of years, certainly in '22 and into '23 and perhaps beyond because, look, it's sort of like the yin and the yang. We've gone with no cruising. It was 0. And these people want to cruise, and they're going to cruise in the future. 
And so we believe that sets up a beautiful dynamic for increased pricing, and we're taking advantage of it to be as well booked as we are. And again, I gave you a nugget that Oceania and Regent hit their 50% load factor for 2022 over 100 days earlier than they ever had before, and their pricing is up. Even with the FCC dilution, it's just unbelievable. Just let me cruise CDC, and we'll have incredible financial results. Just let us cruise."

I hope that everyone joining us today as well as your loved ones remain healthy and safe.  
Similar to our last few earnings calls, we will focus our commentary today on the progress of our response to the global COVID-19 pandemic; the overall booking and pricing environment, which has shown particular strength in recent weeks; and our view of what the month ahead may look like as we prepare for an eventual return to service.  
To say that 2020 was challenging would be an incredible understatement as it was, without a doubt, the toughest and most difficult year in our company's 50-plus-year history. After a record-breaking 2019, the foundation was well set for 2020 to be even a more successful year. That upward trajectory, however, quickly changed last March. And 2020 instead became a year of great hardship and disappointment and one in which we had to rely on our nimbleness and our ability to adapt by taking swift, proactive and decisive actions to overcome the multifaceted challenges presented by the pandemic.  
These actions included bringing our entire fleet to a halt literally overnight, followed by the complex logistics of safely returning more than 50,000 of our guests home. Next came the challenge of repatriating over 25,000 of our crew members and finding safe haven for our 28 vessels, all while transitioning them to various states of reduced manning.  
We quickly bolstered our liquidity through multiple capital market transactions, totaling in excess of $6 billion; and led the industry in establishing cutting-edge health and safety standards through the cofounding of the Healthy Sail Panel. I'm incredibly proud and profoundly grateful for the dedication and perseverance demonstrated by our team members who continue to adapt, innovate and flawlessly execute while faced with unprecedented challenges. The tremendous efforts of our team are what have enabled our company to prove our resilience time and again in the past and gives me confidence we will do so again.  
As we survey the current public health situation, both in America and around the world, it is extraordinary to consider just how much has transpired in the few months since our last update. As expected, the fourth quarter resurgence of the virus drove caseloads to record highs, resulting in renewed lockdown and stricter global travel restrictions. During this time, perhaps the most important breakthrough though was the needed -- to defeat the pandemic was the coming online of several vaccines that were authorized for emergency use. Fast forward to today and caseloads across the globe have been in decline since mid-January, while simultaneously, vaccination programs are ramping up where currently over 6 million doses are being administered globally daily, a number that will only increase as manufacturing, distribution and health care systems align. 
So where does that put us in the cruise industry? In reality, we're not sure. But directionally, we're headed in the right direction to an eventual restart of cruising. Public health experts do predict that caseload, while already on the downside, will continue to decline primarily for 3 reasons: first, a significant portion of the population has already been infected and recovered; second, the number of individuals vaccinated will rapidly increase; and lastly, we will soon move into the less troublesome spring and summer season. All 3 of these factors are expected to combine to begin establishing herd immunity sometime during the third quarter, with the spread of variants and the durability of vaccine protection being the 2 main variables that could slow down but not completely halt the rapid progress being made.  
And while we are moving in the right direction, scientists continue to caution that we are not yet out of the woods, the crisis is far from over, and we must all remain vigilant and ready to adapt to the ongoing fluidity of the public health environment. Our industry has recently seen some encouraging green shoots. After the first quarter resurgence caused nascent cruise operations in Europe to temporarily halt, several European cruise lines have since resumed or are planning to return to service in the next few weeks, sourcing EU nationals from Italy and Germany. The hope and expectation is that by late spring, sailings will expand to include cross-border European nationals, and eventually, likely during the third quarter, international guest  as virus prevalence decreases to manageable level.  
Shifting to our company's recent events since our last earnings call, several key milestones marked the fourth quarter, which can be found on Slide 3 of our presentation. These include 2 capital raises, resulting in approximately $1.7 billion of additional liquidity, new debt deferral amendments providing additional financial flexibility and continued progress on our environmental, social and governance initiatives, which I will touch on in more detail later in the call.  
On Slide 4, we outlined the actions we have undertaken as we continue to navigate through this crisis, remaining focused on what we can control. Subsequent to the issuance of the CDC's Conditional Sail Order in October, we anticipated a return to service in the first quarter of 2021. Since it takes up to 90 days to ready a ship to re-enter servers from layup status, we initiated a phased crew restaffing of select vessels and began a ramping up of marketing activities. This initiative, unfortunately, was met with several headwinds, most notably, the rise of confirmed cases to all-time high and the emergence of new variants, which combined with a slower-than-anticipated rollout of vaccination programs, additional lockdowns and travel restrictions, continued closure of key ports around the world and, most important, the reluctance by public health authorities to lift cruise suspension. 
These headwinds caused us to change course. With much hope for a Q1 relaunch postponed, the decision was made to return vessels to reduce manning status until there is certainty on the timing for a return to service. With new crew rested, ready and eager to work, we took the opportunity to rotate certain crew that had been onboard beyond their usual contracted term and made the difficult decision to repatriate 4,000 crew members back to their home countries.  Next, we continue to execute on our strategic financial action plan, which Mark will provide an update on; and on the incremental actions we have taken to bolster liquidity a little later in the call.  
Turning to our road map to relaunch, which is illustrated on Slide 5. We continue to work with the Healthy Sail Panel, along with the CDC and other public health authorities and governments across the globe, to prepare for a safe and healthy resumption of cruising. As we await for additional technical guidelines from the CDC and other public health officials around the world, we continue to make progress on enhancing our already rigorous health and safety standards, implementing new advancements, including digital technology for contract tracing; as well as streamlining safety drills with our state-of-the-art e-mustering technology. While we are confident in the ability of the 74 protocols developed by the Healthy Sail Panel to keep our ships, crew and guests safe, our frontline defense strategy has expanded from protocol-led preventive measures to now also include the protective health and safety benefits of vaccines.  
We view vaccine as a powerful tool, the most powerful tool, that when combined with various protective measures society is already accustomed to, such as space coverings and physical distancing, forms a multilayered, science-based approach to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 infection. We expect that by the time cruising resumes, vaccination will most certainly be widely available in the developed world. And we believe that by then, we will be able to secure vaccines for our crew as we are today well along in the procurement process. A mix of vaccinated guests and crew, along with the other established protocols, will provide a powerful combination to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 onboard our ships and the communities we visit. 
Ports and destinations is the next step of our road map, and we are in constant communication with key ports around the world to assess the status of travel restrictions, quarantine requirements and port availability. Of particular importance to the industry was the recent announcement by Canadian authorities to restrict cruise vessels from operating in Canadian waters to February of 2022. Throughout this pandemic, the travel industry has experienced the introduction, subsequent repeal and reintroduction of lockdowns and travel restrictions, depending on the prevalence of the virus and other factors. 
Thankfully, the Canadian order allows for the suspension to be rescinded based on improvement in public health. We remain cautiously optimistic that a rescission may be possible. And in the meantime, we await the results of several Alaskan delegation-led initiatives, which we want to acknowledge today and greatly appreciate that may allow Alaska cruises to operate in 2021.  
The third step in our road map is to begin reactivating our sales and marketing machine, which as you know, is guided by our industry-leading market-to-fill versus discount-to-fill strategy. We have revalidated the effectiveness of this strategy in the pandemic environment, generating demand for the back half of 2021 and especially strong demand into 2022 and beyond. We will resume a disciplined process of ramping up sales and marketing efforts once we finalize an initial voyage resumption plan.  
Lastly, and once there is certainty, we continue to expect a gradual and phased approach to the resumption of cruise voyages. Depending on the timing of our return to service, our vessels could return in certain regions before others. For example, given the seasonality of our operations, a typical year, the deployment of our vessel is concentrated in Europe during the peak summer season with 17 of our 28 ships operating in this region. Therefore, seasonality will likely play a key role in the initial deployment of our vessels.  
Our booking trends, which you can see on Slide 6,  demonstrate how we continue to experience strong demand for future cruise vacations despite the uncertainties in the broad travel sector, the reduction of demand-generating marketing investments and the temporary absence of a full complement of our all-important travel agent partners. For the second half of 2021, our load factor is below historical ranges, impacted by continued uncertainty around timing of the resumption of cruising and the shift of our limited marketing investments to focus on 2022 voyages. Pricing continues to be [ in line with ] pre-pandemic level despite the dilutive impact of the value-added future cruise credits for canceled voyages. 
And while it is still early in the booking cycle, we are very encouraged and very pleased by the strong booking activity, driven by pent-up demand across all 3 brands for 2022 voyages. Volumes during January and February sequentially improved by over 40% from November and December 2020. And as an added bonus, over 80% of these bookings were new cash bookings. For the first half of 2022 and for all of 2022, in fact, our load factor is currently well ahead of pre-pandemic levels with pricing at each of our award-winning brands in line to up mid-single digits when excluding the dilutive impacts of future cruise certificates.  
The consumer appetite for global travel aboard our 28 vessels is so strong that even with limited marketing investments, we are yielding outsized results, and we are experiencing record demand with our launches for our future itineraries and global voyage collections. A case in point is Oceania Cruises' 2023 World Cruise, which sold out within 1 day of opening for sale to the general public. In addition to our loyal past guests, approximately 1/3 of all bookings for this group came from first-time new-to-brand guests. 
We believe this achievement, along with multiple booking records we have announced in recent months, demonstrates the pent-up demand that exists from our mature and affluent cruisers even for long and exotic voyages once the severe impact of the pandemic subsides. This demand, coupled with the opening of voyages for sale further in advance, has also resulted in a significant expansion to the booking curve during the fourth quarter, which is now double versus the same time last year.  
I'll be back later to provide closing remarks. But for now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark?"

My remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 action plan as well as our road map to relaunch. The global pandemic continues to evolve, and we continue to focus on what we can control and we are prepared to adapt",1222,"Thank you, Frank. My remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 action plan as well as our road map to relaunch. The global pandemic continues to evolve, and we continue to focus on what we can control and we are prepared to adapt and modify our strategy as needed. Slide 7 illustrates 3 focus areas of our action plan and the additional proactive measures taken since the beginning of the fourth quarter.  
First, we have reduced operating expenses and capital expenditures through a number of initiatives, including the further reduction or deferral of near-term marketing expenses, reduction of nonessential capital expenditures, extended salary reductions and furloughs for shoreside team members. In fact, we reduced capital expenditures by approximately 60% for each of the years 2020 and 2021. In addition, we finalized the deferral of EUR 220 million of newbuilding-related shipyard payments through the end of the first quarter 2022.  
Second, we have also made significant progress on improving our debt maturity profile in order to provide additional near-term financial flexibility through the following actions. We amended our Pride of America, Norwegian Jewel and senior secured credit facilities to suspend testing of certain covenants. This covenant relief extends through maturity for the Pride of America and Jewel facilities and through year-end 2022 for the senior secured credit facility. We were also able to defer $70 million of amortization payments due prior to June 30, 2022, for the senior secured credit facility.  
Second, we secured deferrals for approximately $680 million of our export credit agency-backed amortization payments, representing 100% of our ECA payments originally due through the first quarter of 2022. We also received covenant waivers through the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 on our ECA facilities. We have tremendous support behind us from our strong, longstanding relationships with our export credit agencies, SACE and Hermes; our ECA and commercial lenders; as well as the shipyard. Their assistance is playing a significant role in our ability to weather this pandemic, and we can't thank them enough for their continued and ongoing partnership during these unprecedented times.  
The final focus area of our action plan was securing additional capital. In the fourth quarter, we executed 2 highly successful transactions. In November, we raised $824 million of net proceeds through an equity offering of 40 million ordinary shares. And in December, we issued 850 million of 5 7/8% senior unsecured notes due 2026 in an oversubscribed offering.  
To date, we've accessed the capital markets 5 times over a 9-month period. As a result, since the onset of the pandemic, we raised incremental cash of nearly $6.5 billion, including the drawdown of the $875 million revolver early last year. This tremendous accomplishment would not have been possible without the hard work of our finance, treasury, legal and accounting teams who have worked tirelessly around the clock to execute on these initiatives. We have also experienced an incredible outpouring of support from our investors. And again, we can't thank you enough for having conviction in our business model, in our management team and in the long-term potential of our company.  
Slide 8 outlines the improvement of our debt maturity profile in response to the crisis. Since the third quarter, we secured debt amortization deferrals of approximately $750 million, resulting in minimal debt service payments for the remainder of 2021.  
Turning to liquidity. Slide 9 provides our current illustrative liquidity profile. Our total liquidity as of year-end was approximately $3.2 billion, which includes the portion of customer deposit refunds that are included in accounts payable at quarter end. We have also estimated approximately $300 million for anticipated health and safety investments and other collateral obligations. While we anticipate variability in our health and safety investments as we work through the various requirements and continuously improve and refine our protocols, we wanted to earmark this investment in our illustrative liquidity profile. These factors combined result in a net liquidity on a pro forma basis of approximately $2.9 billion, enabling us to continue to navigate through this fluid environment and execute on our return to service plan.  
As for cash burn, our team continues to work day in and day out to further reduce expenses and conserve cash. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have made significant progress in reducing our controllable cash burn rate, with the low watermark representing a nearly 80% reduction in cruise operating expenses versus normalized levels. For the fourth quarter, our average monthly cash burn rate was approximately $190 million. This included approximately $15 million per month due to additional expenses related to preparing vessels for a potential return to service in early 2021 and included a limited increase in associated marketing investments, as Frank discussed earlier.  
As for the first quarter, we expect the average cash burn to temporarily remain elevated at approximately $190 million per month or approximately $170 million per month, excluding nondebt recurring -- nonrecurring debt modification costs as we ramp down our relaunch-related expenses and repatriate crew. The approximately $60 million of onetime costs we incurred in the quarter is a result of debt deferrals and covenant waivers and suspensions, which, when combined with the newbuild payment extensions, have resulted in approximately $1 billion of additional liquidity over the next 12 months.  
Once the ramp down of relaunch-related expenses, including crew repatriation efforts are complete, we expect that the average cash burn rate to decrease and remain at reduced levels until return to service preparations resume. We will continue to take a thoughtful and disciplined approach to reintroducing costs as we resume voyages in order to conserve cash, while at the same time, balance the need to drive new cash bookings.  
Turning to Slide 10. We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $3.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash balance in the fourth quarter increased, driven by approximately $1.7 billion of net proceeds from capital raises and was partially offset by approximately $570 million of operating cash burn, which includes operating expenses; SG&A, interest and CapEx; customer cash refunds for canceled voyages of approximately $120 million; and net working capital and other outflows of approximately $20 million, which includes health and safety investments. 
Given the continued uncertainty around the timing of our voyage resumption, we are not yet prepared to provide guidance on all metrics. However, we have provided guidance on depreciation and amortization, interest expense and newbuild-related capital expenditures to assist with modeling, which can be found in our earnings release and on Slide 19 of the presentation. Broadly speaking, excluding newbuild-related capital expenditures, we still expect the minimum required capital expenditures needed to run the business and maintain our best-in-class fleets is generally a few hundred million dollars per year.  
Before handing the call back, I want to re-emphasize that while we are prioritizing our immediate business needs, we are also very focused on the future of our company. Our medium- and long-term financial recovery plan, which is provided on Slide 11, focuses on 3 critical components: first, rebuild and gradually return to pre-COVID margin levels while continuing to identify opportunities to further drive margin expansion; second, maximize our cash generation; and third, focus on optimizing our balance sheet and charting a path to delever.  
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank to provide closing commentary. Frank?"

Before we wrap up our prepared remarks today, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, which is on Slide 12.  
Despite the current public health challenges we face, our commitment to protect and preserve our oceans, the environment and the destinations we visit while enhancing our culture of diversity, equity and inclusion in the workforce remains at the very core of our everyday operation. To that end, in 2020, we launched unconscious bias, microaggression and diversity and inclusion training for our global workforce and have committed to expand our diverse hiring practices.  
We are also building upon our supplier diversity program as part of our efforts to facilitate and encourage the growth of small and diverse businesses. We strive to maintain a supportive and empowering workforce -- workplace for our team members across the globe. We believe our team members are, by far, our most important resource, and that has never been clearer to me than during this crisis. We are pleased that this commitment to our team's development and well-being was recognized recently with our naming to the Forbes America's Best Employers list, in which we ranked among the top 75 companies in the overall Large Employer category and among the 10 top companies in the Travel & Leisure sector.  
Just as we support our team members, we are also committed to supporting our local communities and the destinations we visit. This past year, we launched 2 initiatives in partnership with JUST Goods. For Giving Tuesday, we matched every case of JUST Water purchased in December through their online store with a water donation to local food banks in Miami and New York City. Separately, we provided nearly $275,000 of in-kind donations in the form of JUST Water and nonperishable and canned goods to support 2 community organization and assist ongoing relief efforts in the archipelago of San Andrés in Colombia after the devastating impact of Category 5 Hurricane Iota. 
Furthering our partnership with JUST Goods, we are also currently in the process of organizing several truckloads of JUST Water donations to benefit food banks located in areas around the Southwest of the United States that have been severely affected by the recent winter storms. Dedication to family and community is ingrained in our culture. And to further demonstrate this commitment, beginning this year, we are offering our U.S. shoreside team members a paid volunteer day to give back to community programs of their choice. 
On the environmental front, we are proud to have improved our score in our second CDP climate change submission to a B, which is higher than the marine transport sector, North America and global average. For 2021, we will be focused on enhancing our ESG disclosures to provide additional transparency, and I look forward to sharing additional details with you as we continue on our ESG journey.  
Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to leave you with a few final key takeaways. First, we are focused on the execution of our road map to relaunch as quickly as possible, and we'll continue to work with our expert advisers, global public health authorities and government agencies to refine our science-backed plans for a swift, safe and healthy return to cruising. Second, strong future demand for cruising across all brands, source markets and deployments continue. And early indications for 2022 bookings are extremely positive with load factors besting our previous high by a substantial margin. Lastly, we continue to keep our longer-term strategic and financial priorities in focus, and we will be ready to execute on our recovery plans to improve our balance sheet.  
The strong future demand we are experiencing, coupled with the positive momentum in the public health front, bodes extremely well for our prospects. 
And with that, Josh, please, let's open the call for questions. Thank you."

We're encouraged that the situation with Alaska and the Canadian closure until spring of '22 has been noted by various government officials, and they're trying to do their best. As you know, tourism is the third largest industry in Alaska. And for certain Alaskan coastal communities, cruising is over 90% of their tourism business. And so if we can't operate in Alaska in 2021, that will be 2 years that they will go without this infusion of business activity, and that's going to be difficult for them. 
And so we're hopeful, cautiously optimistic. It's a lot of hoops to jump through, both from the Canadian side and also, let's face it, we cannot operate as of today in U.S. waters and Alaska waters. So we have suspended taking new bookings on Alaska. I think the whole industry has. But we do hope -- we do hold out some hope that these initiatives led by the Alaskan delegation can open up Alaska for 2021."

I think there -- let's clarify a couple of things.

I think there -- let's clarify a couple of things. The CDC guidance that we, as an industry, are expecting sometime in the future, and I won't label it as a few days because I simply don't know, it could be a few days, it could be a few weeks, we simply don't know, that doesn't -- that is the next phase of this multiped approach that the CDC is taking. I don't believe that we are awaiting, in the next few days, the green light to cruise. That would not be correct. 
But in terms of our decision to pull back, look, when the CDC Conditional Sail Order first came out, there was great expectation, we had a Conditional Sail Order. And it proved to be more difficult than we first expected. We also were in the middle of a spike in the number of cases. And so it became obvious to us that the initial expectation that maybe the industry could begin to cruise in the first quarter, which as you know, is heavily focused on Caribbean theater of operations, was not going to take place. And so we took the difficult decision to reduce our cash burn, repatriate those crew members back home and cut down on the marketing expenses that we had begun to ramp up to -- along with the ships that we thought we could operate. 
And so today, I would tell you that we are in a better place, a more encouraging place than we were even just 6 weeks ago. At the end of the day, I think the prevalence of the disease in our own country and around the world will be the greatest indicator of when we can resume cruising. And the prevalence is dropping. And we believe, based on all the experts that we talk to, including the Healthy Sail Panel, that we're going to see a continuation of the significant drop in cases as we enter spring/summer, as we continue to vaccinate over 1.5 million Americans a day, as more people get infected and recover. So all those things point into a direction where the prevalence should drop considerably, giving us a better opportunity to restart operations."

Generally, they're in Europe. They're in Alaska. Where are they in the fall/winter? They're primarily in the Caribbean, Mexico, Panama Canal, around the world. 
But I think for planning purposes, we'd like to give ourselves that 90-day window, more or less. And so we've canceled cruises through the end of May. So if you count with your fingers, we -- it's basically March 1, so all of March, all of April, all of May. And it's sequential. We keep bookings and cruising -- cruises available as long as we believe there is a chance that we can operate. But once we know we start entering that 90-day-or-so window, then we owe it to everyone in the ecosystem, whether it's travel agents, consumers, our own employees, the crew, to cancel cruises in the future. So we're always hopeful, always hopeful that the public health situation improves and that we can restart as soon as we possibly can."

Look, early in the pandemic, people were writing off the mature market, and it's been anything but that. So as you know, the upscale brands tend to book further out than the contemporary brand, partly because of the itineraries. The longer, more exotic itineraries, everything else being equal, people book further out. And so we're continuing to see that. I mean both Oceania and Regent are nearly 40% -- are 40% booked for 2022. That's much better than they've ever been at this stage of the booking cycle. 
And so these are folks who are typically over the age of 65. The average age at Oceania and Regent is consistently in the 66, 67 age range. And these are the folks who are getting the vaccine first, and they've been cooped up, and they want to go out. I mean they're no different than 40-year olds or 30-year olds. They've got the money, and they're booking further and further out. As we said in our prepared remarks, the booking curve is now double what it normally is. And that's because of 2 reasons. One, there are literally no bookings being made for the next 3 or 4 months sailing because they've been canceled. And people are booking further and further out. People know that this pandemic will end someday. And that someday is not tomorrow but further out. 
So we have more visibility today in our future business than we've ever had. And so that's one of the things that encourages me the most. I mean I have a lot of things to worry about these days, Steve. Fundamental consumer demand and our ability to fill our ships at strong pricing is not one of them. And to be able to do what we're doing in terms of the load factors and new bookings, new cash bookings with the de minimis amount of marketing that we're doing, with the travel agency system being less than 100%, it's truly remarkable and again points to what we've been saying for years, the resiliency of the consumer, the resiliency of those who love to cruise. It's a great value. That hasn't changed, and people are going to get back to the high seas. There's no question about that."

What we have said in the past is that we think that from whatever date that it is that we start that it will likely take 6 to 7 months, assuming that the ports are open around the world. Remember, our ships are seasonal. One of the requirements is that the ports be open, the travel restrictions be lifted. So assuming that those hurdles are cleared, physically, we think it will take 6, 7 months, so roughly a ship a week. And so for us to be 100% operative, we would have to start standing up vessels in the June, July time frame of this year so that we can be 100% by year-end, early '22."

We're no longer offering the option of an FCC or cash. We have the liquidity. FCCs are dilutive to future business. We don't want to negatively impact future business any more than the dilutive effect of the existing FCCs. So today, there is no choice, you get your money back. And in terms of the percentage of FCCs that have been redeemed, it varies by brand. But at the consolidated age level, roughly 40% of all FCCs that we have issued over time have now been redeemed. So there still remains 60% of the FCCs issued in that bucket of folks who've got an ability to rebook. 
And look, we -- somehow, in some corridors of the investment world perhaps, FCC bookings are seen as not as good as a cash booking. I think they're both important. Customers who took an FCC showed a great deal of confidence and support in our business, and we want to make sure that they get their cruise. And so if we have to extend the booking date or if we have to extend the sailing date as the suspensions continue, we will do so. We actively encourage people to redeem their FCC. We want them to take a cruise. And we also want to be able to clear the deck, so to speak, as soon as possible so that when we do resume cruising, we can get back to what we do best, which is selling cruises at the highest yields in the industry, both on ticket and on onboard revenue, so that we can resume our positive momentum that we had at the end of 2019."

So when we really reduced our cash burn in the third -- when you look at the second quarter, third quarter, we were down to levels of $150 million, $160 million. It's slightly elevated in the fourth quarter, primarily due to some additional cash interest and some of our start-up activities, which we noted. Some of that is lingering into Q1 as well with the start-up activities. And then beyond that, in this environment today, our expectation would be that we're going to get back down to those levels we had seen in the earlier part of the year, absent the clear visibility and clear indication that we can start back up. 
So again, we started this exercise in the fourth quarter. We were hopeful with the Conditional Sails Order that we were going to be able to operate early in 2021. Obviously, that proved to be a false hope. But it's really going to be dependent upon when we get that green light and when we get that visibility. But again, if you look at the fourth quarter and the first quarter, as we've outlined, I think I said on my prepared remarks today, roughly $10 million to $15 million a month was related to some of those restart costs. That's probably the levels you would start to see once we, in earnest, restart back, whether it's a second quarter, third quarter, but again, based on when we get that clear path of resumption."

Historically, that is the cohort that the greatest percentage of our guests across all 3 brands comes from, and we have seen a slight increase in the proportion of total bookings coming from that cohort.

For our own internal working purposes, we assume that at the beginning, that maximum occupancy will be in the 50% range. So think about this. Today, our entire fleet is available to book, let's say, in the third quarter, in July moving forward. Every single ship in the fleet has passengers. There's bookings on them. When we know we're going to start, we're not going to be able to start all 28 vessels. As I said, it's going to be a little bit, maybe a week -- one a week, something like that, which means that there's going to be a lot of customers who are booked today who will be displaced. And part of that displacement will be in cancellations, people will get their refunds. But part of it is that people will move from the Norwegian Jewel in Alaska to the Norwegian Bliss in Alaska or they'll move from the Oceania Riviera in Europe to the Oceania Marina in Europe. 
And so we believe that there are enough bookings today. If we never took another booking, let's say, for Q3, assuming a reduced capacity at the start, then we don't have to take any more bookings for Q3. And as you move forward from the start date, you have more ships coming online, less ships that are going to be -- those customers going to be displaced. And so there'll be a rebalancing, if you will, at some point, where we do need to start taking more bookings. But my guess is that, that will be beginning month 3, 4 forward. And that's what we were doing. And the restart that Mark and I discussed earlier in our remarks when we thought we were going to start in Q1 because there's always a book of business there waiting, hoping to cruise that when we do know we're going to start, it won't be the entire fleet and, therefore, we have excess bookings, if you will, at the beginning. 
So again, of all the things we worry about, filling vessels, generating demand just isn't one of them. But we have -- we don't have a short-term issue as we just described. And as you heard me say earlier, 2022, more of a longer term, business is better than ever."

Look, ships have to dry dock. They have to stay within the classification society rules. And what I can tell you is while we have pulled back on our capital expenditures and some of that is related to investments -- enhancements that we would have made during dry docks, we're not stopping dry docks. Dry docks have to occur by class. And there are certain investments that we've continued to make. A good example of that is some of the scrubbers on the Breakaway and Getaway. That was -- they were scheduled to be completed in early 2023. And because the ships are out of service and going through their normal dry dock periods, we're able to install those sooner and get the benefit once we restart operating. 
But I think when you look at the ships going forward and you look at the cost structure on the ships, by and large, we've always said this, the cost structure on a ship is generally a highly fixed cost structure. That said, there's always going to be pockets of opportunity. And I think as we think about our costs going forward, we're looking at shoreside. This pause has really given us a chance to reevaluate every cost, everything we do from our supply chain to everything we do on our shoreside operations. And I think we've mentioned this in the past that we're making some pretty significant learnings in our marketing area. We continue to transform towards the digital world. You get more bang for the dollar there. We're garnering significant amount of booking activity with vis-à-vis a less marketing spend. So we're taking those learnings. 
And every day that we're in pause, we're going to continue to look at every nook and cranny and ask ourselves, ""Are we doing this correctly?"" So I think there's opportunity for cost enhancement. And then further, as you look further down the future and you think about how does that translate to margin expansion, it's going to be a combination of reduced cost. We have more efficient capacity coming online with our 9-ship newbuild program. And that's going to help drive margin expansion in addition to, again, driving the top line, driving increased pricing that we've always been the industry leader in pricing. And as we think about that, if you look at the industry, capacity has been reduced. So we think that's going to provide even more of an opportunity to help rebuild margins and drive that margin expansion."

That means 30 million people that would have cruised in that year, haven't cruised. And this is a finite capacity business. I can't cruise with 150% occupancy. So there's going to be a squeeze play here that demand is going to exceed supply, especially after the withdrawal of some 20-plus ships from the so-called North American fleet. So you got less supply. You've got pent-up demand. You've got people with money in their pocket. I think this is just the making of a boom time for the cruise industry. And since we can't expand supply any faster than it's coming online, pricing is what's going to dictate the day. 
And we're seeing it. I mean it's astonishing to me in the 25-plus years I've been in this business that given the fact that travel agents are not at full strength, we're spending a fraction of what we normally spend, the bad news cycle of lockdowns and pandemics and travel restrictions and quarantine, that business is as robust as it is, not only in volume, but we're able to tick up prices. So when we say that we -- just do a couple of connect the dots here, 40% of FCCs have been redeemed. Those FCCs had a 25% premium on them. That we are at a flat to slightly ahead of pricing of the all-time high pricing, including the dilutive effect of those 125% FCCs. And that we are so well booked into the future, I mean I've never seen such a positive set of circumstance. We just need to get back to work. We need to get cruising operating again. 
And we're hopeful. Look, as much as it bothers me to see other sectors of the travel community open, I'm happy for them. Trust me, I'm happy for the casino operators and the airlines and the hotel operators and the resorts. I want to be happy for us as well. And I think our day should be approaching, should be approaching, Ivan, given the advances we're making in the vaccine front, the prevalence is coming down. The industry -- the protocols we've put in place. No other sector of the travel business or any other business has put forth as many comprehensive protocols to combat the spread of the virus as we have. And we're eager to get back to work, and we're happy to see it starting in Asia, starting in Europe. We're going to see, I think, more vessels starting in Europe soon. And so we're encouraged by all those developments. But at the end of the day, we've got to get back to work soon. And we're ready. We're all ready. Thank you."

I hope that everyone joining us today as well as your loved ones remain healthy and safe.  
Similar to our last few earnings calls, we will focus our commentary today on the progress of our response to the global COVID-19 pandemic; the overall booking and pricing environment, which has shown particular strength in recent weeks; and our view of what the month ahead may look like as we prepare for an eventual return to service.  
To say that 2020 was challenging would be an incredible understatement as it was, without a doubt, the toughest and most difficult year in our company's 50-plus-year history. After a record-breaking 2019, the foundation was well set for 2020 to be even a more successful year. That upward trajectory, however, quickly changed last March. And 2020 instead became a year of great hardship and disappointment and one in which we had to rely on our nimbleness and our ability to adapt by taking swift, proactive and decisive actions to overcome the multifaceted challenges presented by the pandemic.  
These actions included bringing our entire fleet to a halt literally overnight, followed by the complex logistics of safely returning more than 50,000 of our guests home. Next came the challenge of repatriating over 25,000 of our crew members and finding safe haven for our 28 vessels, all while transitioning them to various states of reduced manning.  
We quickly bolstered our liquidity through multiple capital market transactions, totaling in excess of $6 billion; and led the industry in establishing cutting-edge health and safety standards through the cofounding of the Healthy Sail Panel. I'm incredibly proud and profoundly grateful for the dedication and perseverance demonstrated by our team members who continue to adapt, innovate and flawlessly execute while faced with unprecedented challenges. The tremendous efforts of our team are what have enabled our company to prove our resilience time and again in the past and gives me confidence we will do so again.  
As we survey the current public health situation, both in America and around the world, it is extraordinary to consider just how much has transpired in the few months since our last update. As expected, the fourth quarter resurgence of the virus drove caseloads to record highs, resulting in renewed lockdown and stricter global travel restrictions. During this time, perhaps the most important breakthrough though was the needed -- to defeat the pandemic was the coming online of several vaccines that were authorized for emergency use. Fast forward to today and caseloads across the globe have been in decline since mid-January, while simultaneously, vaccination programs are ramping up where currently over 6 million doses are being administered globally daily, a number that will only increase as manufacturing, distribution and health care systems align. 
So where does that put us in the cruise industry? In reality, we're not sure. But directionally, we're headed in the right direction to an eventual restart of cruising. Public health experts do predict that caseload, while already on the downside, will continue to decline primarily for 3 reasons: first, a significant portion of the population has already been infected and recovered; second, the number of individuals vaccinated will rapidly increase; and lastly, we will soon move into the less troublesome spring and summer season. All 3 of these factors are expected to combine to begin establishing herd immunity sometime during the third quarter, with the spread of variants and the durability of vaccine protection being the 2 main variables that could slow down but not completely halt the rapid progress being made.  
And while we are moving in the right direction, scientists continue to caution that we are not yet out of the woods, the crisis is far from over, and we must all remain vigilant and ready to adapt to the ongoing fluidity of the public health environment. Our industry has recently seen some encouraging green shoots. After the first quarter resurgence caused nascent cruise operations in Europe to temporarily halt, several European cruise lines have since resumed or are planning to return to service in the next few weeks, sourcing EU nationals from Italy and Germany. The hope and expectation is that by late spring, sailings will expand to include cross-border European nationals, and eventually, likely during the third quarter, international guest  as virus prevalence decreases to manageable level.  
Shifting to our company's recent events since our last earnings call, several key milestones marked the fourth quarter, which can be found on Slide 3 of our presentation. These include 2 capital raises, resulting in approximately $1.7 billion of additional liquidity, new debt deferral amendments providing additional financial flexibility and continued progress on our environmental, social and governance initiatives, which I will touch on in more detail later in the call.  
On Slide 4, we outlined the actions we have undertaken as we continue to navigate through this crisis, remaining focused on what we can control. Subsequent to the issuance of the CDC's Conditional Sail Order in October, we anticipated a return to service in the first quarter of 2021. Since it takes up to 90 days to ready a ship to re-enter servers from layup status, we initiated a phased crew restaffing of select vessels and began a ramping up of marketing activities. This initiative, unfortunately, was met with several headwinds, most notably, the rise of confirmed cases to all-time high and the emergence of new variants, which combined with a slower-than-anticipated rollout of vaccination programs, additional lockdowns and travel restrictions, continued closure of key ports around the world and, most important, the reluctance by public health authorities to lift cruise suspension. 
These headwinds caused us to change course. With much hope for a Q1 relaunch postponed, the decision was made to return vessels to reduce manning status until there is certainty on the timing for a return to service. With new crew rested, ready and eager to work, we took the opportunity to rotate certain crew that had been onboard beyond their usual contracted term and made the difficult decision to repatriate 4,000 crew members back to their home countries.  Next, we continue to execute on our strategic financial action plan, which Mark will provide an update on; and on the incremental actions we have taken to bolster liquidity a little later in the call.  
Turning to our road map to relaunch, which is illustrated on Slide 5. We continue to work with the Healthy Sail Panel, along with the CDC and other public health authorities and governments across the globe, to prepare for a safe and healthy resumption of cruising. As we await for additional technical guidelines from the CDC and other public health officials around the world, we continue to make progress on enhancing our already rigorous health and safety standards, implementing new advancements, including digital technology for contract tracing; as well as streamlining safety drills with our state-of-the-art e-mustering technology. While we are confident in the ability of the 74 protocols developed by the Healthy Sail Panel to keep our ships, crew and guests safe, our frontline defense strategy has expanded from protocol-led preventive measures to now also include the protective health and safety benefits of vaccines.  
We view vaccine as a powerful tool, the most powerful tool, that when combined with various protective measures society is already accustomed to, such as space coverings and physical distancing, forms a multilayered, science-based approach to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 infection. We expect that by the time cruising resumes, vaccination will most certainly be widely available in the developed world. And we believe that by then, we will be able to secure vaccines for our crew as we are today well along in the procurement process. A mix of vaccinated guests and crew, along with the other established protocols, will provide a powerful combination to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 onboard our ships and the communities we visit. 
Ports and destinations is the next step of our road map, and we are in constant communication with key ports around the world to assess the status of travel restrictions, quarantine requirements and port availability. Of particular importance to the industry was the recent announcement by Canadian authorities to restrict cruise vessels from operating in Canadian waters to February of 2022. Throughout this pandemic, the travel industry has experienced the introduction, subsequent repeal and reintroduction of lockdowns and travel restrictions, depending on the prevalence of the virus and other factors. 
Thankfully, the Canadian order allows for the suspension to be rescinded based on improvement in public health. We remain cautiously optimistic that a rescission may be possible. And in the meantime, we await the results of several Alaskan delegation-led initiatives, which we want to acknowledge today and greatly appreciate that may allow Alaska cruises to operate in 2021.  
The third step in our road map is to begin reactivating our sales and marketing machine, which as you know, is guided by our industry-leading market-to-fill versus discount-to-fill strategy. We have revalidated the effectiveness of this strategy in the pandemic environment, generating demand for the back half of 2021 and especially strong demand into 2022 and beyond. We will resume a disciplined process of ramping up sales and marketing efforts once we finalize an initial voyage resumption plan.  
Lastly, and once there is certainty, we continue to expect a gradual and phased approach to the resumption of cruise voyages. Depending on the timing of our return to service, our vessels could return in certain regions before others. For example, given the seasonality of our operations, a typical year, the deployment of our vessel is concentrated in Europe during the peak summer season with 17 of our 28 ships operating in this region. Therefore, seasonality will likely play a key role in the initial deployment of our vessels.  
Our booking trends, which you can see on Slide 6,  demonstrate how we continue to experience strong demand for future cruise vacations despite the uncertainties in the broad travel sector, the reduction of demand-generating marketing investments and the temporary absence of a full complement of our all-important travel agent partners. For the second half of 2021, our load factor is below historical ranges, impacted by continued uncertainty around timing of the resumption of cruising and the shift of our limited marketing investments to focus on 2022 voyages. Pricing continues to be [ in line with ] pre-pandemic level despite the dilutive impact of the value-added future cruise credits for canceled voyages. 
And while it is still early in the booking cycle, we are very encouraged and very pleased by the strong booking activity, driven by pent-up demand across all 3 brands for 2022 voyages. Volumes during January and February sequentially improved by over 40% from November and December 2020. And as an added bonus, over 80% of these bookings were new cash bookings. For the first half of 2022 and for all of 2022, in fact, our load factor is currently well ahead of pre-pandemic levels with pricing at each of our award-winning brands in line to up mid-single digits when excluding the dilutive impacts of future cruise certificates.  
The consumer appetite for global travel aboard our 28 vessels is so strong that even with limited marketing investments, we are yielding outsized results, and we are experiencing record demand with our launches for our future itineraries and global voyage collections. A case in point is Oceania Cruises' 2023 World Cruise, which sold out within 1 day of opening for sale to the general public. In addition to our loyal past guests, approximately 1/3 of all bookings for this group came from first-time new-to-brand guests. 
We believe this achievement, along with multiple booking records we have announced in recent months, demonstrates the pent-up demand that exists from our mature and affluent cruisers even for long and exotic voyages once the severe impact of the pandemic subsides. This demand, coupled with the opening of voyages for sale further in advance, has also resulted in a significant expansion to the booking curve during the fourth quarter, which is now double versus the same time last year.  
I'll be back later to provide closing remarks. But for now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark?"

My remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 action plan as well as our road map to relaunch. The global pandemic continues to evolve, and we continue to focus on what we can control and we are prepared to adapt",1222,"Thank you, Frank. My remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 action plan as well as our road map to relaunch. The global pandemic continues to evolve, and we continue to focus on what we can control and we are prepared to adapt and modify our strategy as needed. Slide 7 illustrates 3 focus areas of our action plan and the additional proactive measures taken since the beginning of the fourth quarter.  
First, we have reduced operating expenses and capital expenditures through a number of initiatives, including the further reduction or deferral of near-term marketing expenses, reduction of nonessential capital expenditures, extended salary reductions and furloughs for shoreside team members. In fact, we reduced capital expenditures by approximately 60% for each of the years 2020 and 2021. In addition, we finalized the deferral of EUR 220 million of newbuilding-related shipyard payments through the end of the first quarter 2022.  
Second, we have also made significant progress on improving our debt maturity profile in order to provide additional near-term financial flexibility through the following actions. We amended our Pride of America, Norwegian Jewel and senior secured credit facilities to suspend testing of certain covenants. This covenant relief extends through maturity for the Pride of America and Jewel facilities and through year-end 2022 for the senior secured credit facility. We were also able to defer $70 million of amortization payments due prior to June 30, 2022, for the senior secured credit facility.  
Second, we secured deferrals for approximately $680 million of our export credit agency-backed amortization payments, representing 100% of our ECA payments originally due through the first quarter of 2022. We also received covenant waivers through the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 on our ECA facilities. We have tremendous support behind us from our strong, longstanding relationships with our export credit agencies, SACE and Hermes; our ECA and commercial lenders; as well as the shipyard. Their assistance is playing a significant role in our ability to weather this pandemic, and we can't thank them enough for their continued and ongoing partnership during these unprecedented times.  
The final focus area of our action plan was securing additional capital. In the fourth quarter, we executed 2 highly successful transactions. In November, we raised $824 million of net proceeds through an equity offering of 40 million ordinary shares. And in December, we issued 850 million of 5 7/8% senior unsecured notes due 2026 in an oversubscribed offering.  
To date, we've accessed the capital markets 5 times over a 9-month period. As a result, since the onset of the pandemic, we raised incremental cash of nearly $6.5 billion, including the drawdown of the $875 million revolver early last year. This tremendous accomplishment would not have been possible without the hard work of our finance, treasury, legal and accounting teams who have worked tirelessly around the clock to execute on these initiatives. We have also experienced an incredible outpouring of support from our investors. And again, we can't thank you enough for having conviction in our business model, in our management team and in the long-term potential of our company.  
Slide 8 outlines the improvement of our debt maturity profile in response to the crisis. Since the third quarter, we secured debt amortization deferrals of approximately $750 million, resulting in minimal debt service payments for the remainder of 2021.  
Turning to liquidity. Slide 9 provides our current illustrative liquidity profile. Our total liquidity as of year-end was approximately $3.2 billion, which includes the portion of customer deposit refunds that are included in accounts payable at quarter end. We have also estimated approximately $300 million for anticipated health and safety investments and other collateral obligations. While we anticipate variability in our health and safety investments as we work through the various requirements and continuously improve and refine our protocols, we wanted to earmark this investment in our illustrative liquidity profile. These factors combined result in a net liquidity on a pro forma basis of approximately $2.9 billion, enabling us to continue to navigate through this fluid environment and execute on our return to service plan.  
As for cash burn, our team continues to work day in and day out to further reduce expenses and conserve cash. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have made significant progress in reducing our controllable cash burn rate, with the low watermark representing a nearly 80% reduction in cruise operating expenses versus normalized levels. For the fourth quarter, our average monthly cash burn rate was approximately $190 million. This included approximately $15 million per month due to additional expenses related to preparing vessels for a potential return to service in early 2021 and included a limited increase in associated marketing investments, as Frank discussed earlier.  
As for the first quarter, we expect the average cash burn to temporarily remain elevated at approximately $190 million per month or approximately $170 million per month, excluding nondebt recurring -- nonrecurring debt modification costs as we ramp down our relaunch-related expenses and repatriate crew. The approximately $60 million of onetime costs we incurred in the quarter is a result of debt deferrals and covenant waivers and suspensions, which, when combined with the newbuild payment extensions, have resulted in approximately $1 billion of additional liquidity over the next 12 months.  
Once the ramp down of relaunch-related expenses, including crew repatriation efforts are complete, we expect that the average cash burn rate to decrease and remain at reduced levels until return to service preparations resume. We will continue to take a thoughtful and disciplined approach to reintroducing costs as we resume voyages in order to conserve cash, while at the same time, balance the need to drive new cash bookings.  
Turning to Slide 10. We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $3.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash balance in the fourth quarter increased, driven by approximately $1.7 billion of net proceeds from capital raises and was partially offset by approximately $570 million of operating cash burn, which includes operating expenses; SG&A, interest and CapEx; customer cash refunds for canceled voyages of approximately $120 million; and net working capital and other outflows of approximately $20 million, which includes health and safety investments. 
Given the continued uncertainty around the timing of our voyage resumption, we are not yet prepared to provide guidance on all metrics. However, we have provided guidance on depreciation and amortization, interest expense and newbuild-related capital expenditures to assist with modeling, which can be found in our earnings release and on Slide 19 of the presentation. Broadly speaking, excluding newbuild-related capital expenditures, we still expect the minimum required capital expenditures needed to run the business and maintain our best-in-class fleets is generally a few hundred million dollars per year.  
Before handing the call back, I want to re-emphasize that while we are prioritizing our immediate business needs, we are also very focused on the future of our company. Our medium- and long-term financial recovery plan, which is provided on Slide 11, focuses on 3 critical components: first, rebuild and gradually return to pre-COVID margin levels while continuing to identify opportunities to further drive margin expansion; second, maximize our cash generation; and third, focus on optimizing our balance sheet and charting a path to delever.  
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank to provide closing commentary. Frank?"

Before we wrap up our prepared remarks today, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, which is on Slide 12.  
Despite the current public health challenges we face, our commitment to protect and preserve our oceans, the environment and the destinations we visit while enhancing our culture of diversity, equity and inclusion in the workforce remains at the very core of our everyday operation. To that end, in 2020, we launched unconscious bias, microaggression and diversity and inclusion training for our global workforce and have committed to expand our diverse hiring practices.  
We are also building upon our supplier diversity program as part of our efforts to facilitate and encourage the growth of small and diverse businesses. We strive to maintain a supportive and empowering workforce -- workplace for our team members across the globe. We believe our team members are, by far, our most important resource, and that has never been clearer to me than during this crisis. We are pleased that this commitment to our team's development and well-being was recognized recently with our naming to the Forbes America's Best Employers list, in which we ranked among the top 75 companies in the overall Large Employer category and among the 10 top companies in the Travel & Leisure sector.  
Just as we support our team members, we are also committed to supporting our local communities and the destinations we visit. This past year, we launched 2 initiatives in partnership with JUST Goods. For Giving Tuesday, we matched every case of JUST Water purchased in December through their online store with a water donation to local food banks in Miami and New York City. Separately, we provided nearly $275,000 of in-kind donations in the form of JUST Water and nonperishable and canned goods to support 2 community organization and assist ongoing relief efforts in the archipelago of San Andrés in Colombia after the devastating impact of Category 5 Hurricane Iota. 
Furthering our partnership with JUST Goods, we are also currently in the process of organizing several truckloads of JUST Water donations to benefit food banks located in areas around the Southwest of the United States that have been severely affected by the recent winter storms. Dedication to family and community is ingrained in our culture. And to further demonstrate this commitment, beginning this year, we are offering our U.S. shoreside team members a paid volunteer day to give back to community programs of their choice. 
On the environmental front, we are proud to have improved our score in our second CDP climate change submission to a B, which is higher than the marine transport sector, North America and global average. For 2021, we will be focused on enhancing our ESG disclosures to provide additional transparency, and I look forward to sharing additional details with you as we continue on our ESG journey.  
Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to leave you with a few final key takeaways. First, we are focused on the execution of our road map to relaunch as quickly as possible, and we'll continue to work with our expert advisers, global public health authorities and government agencies to refine our science-backed plans for a swift, safe and healthy return to cruising. Second, strong future demand for cruising across all brands, source markets and deployments continue. And early indications for 2022 bookings are extremely positive with load factors besting our previous high by a substantial margin. Lastly, we continue to keep our longer-term strategic and financial priorities in focus, and we will be ready to execute on our recovery plans to improve our balance sheet.  
The strong future demand we are experiencing, coupled with the positive momentum in the public health front, bodes extremely well for our prospects. 
And with that, Josh, please, let's open the call for questions. Thank you."

We're encouraged that the situation with Alaska and the Canadian closure until spring of '22 has been noted by various government officials, and they're trying to do their best. As you know, tourism is the third largest industry in Alaska. And for certain Alaskan coastal communities, cruising is over 90% of their tourism business. And so if we can't operate in Alaska in 2021, that will be 2 years that they will go without this infusion of business activity, and that's going to be difficult for them. 
And so we're hopeful, cautiously optimistic. It's a lot of hoops to jump through, both from the Canadian side and also, let's face it, we cannot operate as of today in U.S. waters and Alaska waters. So we have suspended taking new bookings on Alaska. I think the whole industry has. But we do hope -- we do hold out some hope that these initiatives led by the Alaskan delegation can open up Alaska for 2021."

I think there -- let's clarify a couple of things.

I think there -- let's clarify a couple of things. The CDC guidance that we, as an industry, are expecting sometime in the future, and I won't label it as a few days because I simply don't know, it could be a few days, it could be a few weeks, we simply don't know, that doesn't -- that is the next phase of this multiped approach that the CDC is taking. I don't believe that we are awaiting, in the next few days, the green light to cruise. That would not be correct. 
But in terms of our decision to pull back, look, when the CDC Conditional Sail Order first came out, there was great expectation, we had a Conditional Sail Order. And it proved to be more difficult than we first expected. We also were in the middle of a spike in the number of cases. And so it became obvious to us that the initial expectation that maybe the industry could begin to cruise in the first quarter, which as you know, is heavily focused on Caribbean theater of operations, was not going to take place. And so we took the difficult decision to reduce our cash burn, repatriate those crew members back home and cut down on the marketing expenses that we had begun to ramp up to -- along with the ships that we thought we could operate. 
And so today, I would tell you that we are in a better place, a more encouraging place than we were even just 6 weeks ago. At the end of the day, I think the prevalence of the disease in our own country and around the world will be the greatest indicator of when we can resume cruising. And the prevalence is dropping. And we believe, based on all the experts that we talk to, including the Healthy Sail Panel, that we're going to see a continuation of the significant drop in cases as we enter spring/summer, as we continue to vaccinate over 1.5 million Americans a day, as more people get infected and recover. So all those things point into a direction where the prevalence should drop considerably, giving us a better opportunity to restart operations."

But we generally believe that from the moment that we get the green light, depending on where the ships are that you want to stand up, depending on the seasonality, summer is a -- where are the ships in summer? Generally, they're in Europe. They're in Alaska. Where are they in the fall/winter? They're primarily in the Caribbean, Mexico, Panama Canal, around the world. 
But I think for planning purposes, we'd like to give ourselves that 90-day window, more or less. And so we've canceled cruises through the end of May. So if you count with your fingers, we -- it's basically March 1, so all of March, all of April, all of May. And it's sequential. We keep bookings and cruising -- cruises available as long as we believe there is a chance that we can operate. But once we know we start entering that 90-day-or-so window, then we owe it to everyone in the ecosystem, whether it's travel agents, consumers, our own employees, the crew, to cancel cruises in the future. So we're always hopeful, always hopeful that the public health situation improves and that we can restart as soon as we possibly can."

Look, early in the pandemic, people were writing off the mature market, and it's been anything but that. So as you know, the upscale brands tend to book further out than the contemporary brand, partly because of the itineraries. The longer, more exotic itineraries, everything else being equal, people book further out. And so we're continuing to see that. I mean both Oceania and Regent are nearly 40% -- are 40% booked for 2022. That's much better than they've ever been at this stage of the booking cycle. 
And so these are folks who are typically over the age of 65. The average age at Oceania and Regent is consistently in the 66, 67 age range. And these are the folks who are getting the vaccine first, and they've been cooped up, and they want to go out. I mean they're no different than 40-year olds or 30-year olds. They've got the money, and they're booking further and further out. As we said in our prepared remarks, the booking curve is now double what it normally is. And that's because of 2 reasons. One, there are literally no bookings being made for the next 3 or 4 months sailing because they've been canceled. And people are booking further and further out. People know that this pandemic will end someday. And that someday is not tomorrow but further out. 
So we have more visibility today in our future business than we've ever had. And so that's one of the things that encourages me the most. I mean I have a lot of things to worry about these days, Steve. Fundamental consumer demand and our ability to fill our ships at strong pricing is not one of them. And to be able to do what we're doing in terms of the load factors and new bookings, new cash bookings with the de minimis amount of marketing that we're doing, with the travel agency system being less than 100%, it's truly remarkable and again points to what we've been saying for years, the resiliency of the consumer, the resiliency of those who love to cruise. It's a great value. That hasn't changed, and people are going to get back to the high seas. There's no question about that."

So assuming that those hurdles are cleared, physically, we think it will take 6, 7 months, so roughly a ship a week.

We're no longer offering the option of an FCC or cash. We have the liquidity. FCCs are dilutive to future business. We don't want to negatively impact future business any more than the dilutive effect of the existing FCCs. So today, there is no choice, you get your money back. And in terms of the percentage of FCCs that have been redeemed, it varies by brand. But at the consolidated age level, roughly 40% of all FCCs that we have issued over time have now been redeemed. So there still remains 60% of the FCCs issued in that bucket of folks who've got an ability to rebook. 
And look, we -- somehow, in some corridors of the investment world perhaps, FCC bookings are seen as not as good as a cash booking. I think they're both important. Customers who took an FCC showed a great deal of confidence and support in our business, and we want to make sure that they get their cruise. And so if we have to extend the booking date or if we have to extend the sailing date as the suspensions continue, we will do so. We actively encourage people to redeem their FCC.

So when we really reduced our cash burn in the third -- when you look at the second quarter, third quarter, we were down to levels of $150 million, $160 million.

Some of that is lingering into Q1 as well with the start-up activities. And then beyond that, in this environment today, our expectation would be that we're going to get back down to those levels we had seen in the earlier part of the year, absent the clear visibility and clear indication that we can start back up. 
So again, we started this exercise in the fourth quarter. We were hopeful with the Conditional Sails Order that we were going to be able to operate early in 2021. Obviously, that proved to be a false hope. But it's really going to be dependent upon when we get that green light and when we get that visibility. But again, if you look at the fourth quarter and the first quarter, as we've outlined, I think I said on my prepared remarks today, roughly $10 million to $15 million a month was related to some of those restart costs.

For our own internal working purposes, we assume that at the beginning, that maximum occupancy will be in the 50% range. So think about this. Today, our entire fleet is available to book, let's say, in the third quarter, in July moving forward. Every single ship in the fleet has passengers. There's bookings on them. When we know we're going to start, we're not going to be able to start all 28 vessels. As I said, it's going to be a little bit, maybe a week -- one a week, something like that, which means that there's going to be a lot of customers who are booked today who will be displaced. And part of that displacement will be in cancellations, people will get their refunds. But part of it is that people will move from the Norwegian Jewel in Alaska to the Norwegian Bliss in Alaska or they'll move from the Oceania Riviera in Europe to the Oceania Marina in Europe. 
And so we believe that there are enough bookings today. If we never took another booking, let's say, for Q3, assuming a reduced capacity at the start, then we don't have to take any more bookings for Q3. And as you move forward from the start date, you have more ships coming online, less ships that are going to be -- those customers going to be displaced. And so there'll be a rebalancing, if you will, at some point, where we do need to start taking more bookings. But my guess is that, that will be beginning month 3, 4 forward. And that's what we were doing. And the restart that Mark and I discussed earlier in our remarks when we thought we were going to start in Q1 because there's always a book of business there waiting, hoping to cruise that when we do know we're going to start, it won't be the entire fleet and, therefore, we have excess bookings, if you will, at the beginning. 
So again, of all the things we worry about, filling vessels, generating demand just isn't one of them. But we have -- we don't have a short-term issue as we just described. And as you heard me say earlier, 2022, more of a longer term, business is better than ever."

Look, ships have to dry dock. They have to stay within the classification society rules. And what I can tell you is while we have pulled back on our capital expenditures and some of that is related to investments -- enhancements that we would have made during dry docks, we're not stopping dry docks. Dry docks have to occur by class. And there are certain investments that we've continued to make. A good example of that is some of the scrubbers on the Breakaway and Getaway. That was -- they were scheduled to be completed in early 2023. And because the ships are out of service and going through their normal dry dock periods, we're able to install those sooner and get the benefit once we restart operating. 
But I think when you look at the ships going forward and you look at the cost structure on the ships, by and large, we've always said this, the cost structure on a ship is generally a highly fixed cost structure. That said, there's always going to be pockets of opportunity. And I think as we think about our costs going forward, we're looking at shoreside. This pause has really given us a chance to reevaluate every cost, everything we do from our supply chain to everything we do on our shoreside operations. And I think we've mentioned this in the past that we're making some pretty significant learnings in our marketing area. We continue to transform towards the digital world. You get more bang for the dollar there. We're garnering significant amount of booking activity with vis-à-vis a less marketing spend. So we're taking those learnings. 
And every day that we're in pause, we're going to continue to look at every nook and cranny and ask ourselves, ""Are we doing this correctly?"" So I think there's opportunity for cost enhancement. And then further, as you look further down the future and you think about how does that translate to margin expansion, it's going to be a combination of reduced cost. We have more efficient capacity coming online with our 9-ship newbuild program. And that's going to help drive margin expansion in addition to, again, driving the top line, driving increased pricing that we've always been the industry leader in pricing. And as we think about that, if you look at the industry, capacity has been reduced. So we think that's going to provide even more of an opportunity to help rebuild margins and drive that margin expansion."

That means 30 million people that would have cruised in that year, haven't cruised. And this is a finite capacity business. I can't cruise with 150% occupancy. So there's going to be a squeeze play here that demand is going to exceed supply, especially after the withdrawal of some 20-plus ships from the so-called North American fleet. So you got less supply. You've got pent-up demand. You've got people with money in their pocket. I think this is just the making of a boom time for the cruise industry. And since we can't expand supply any faster than it's coming online, pricing is what's going to dictate the day. 
And we're seeing it. I mean it's astonishing to me in the 25-plus years I've been in this business that given the fact that travel agents are not at full strength, we're spending a fraction of what we normally spend, the bad news cycle of lockdowns and pandemics and travel restrictions and quarantine, that business is as robust as it is, not only in volume, but we're able to tick up prices. So when we say that we -- just do a couple of connect the dots here, 40% of FCCs have been redeemed. Those FCCs had a 25% premium on them. That we are at a flat to slightly ahead of pricing of the all-time high pricing, including the dilutive effect of those 125% FCCs. And that we are so well booked into the future, I mean I've never seen such a positive set of circumstance. We just need to get back to work. We need to get cruising operating again. 
And we're hopeful. Look, as much as it bothers me to see other sectors of the travel community open, I'm happy for them. Trust me, I'm happy for the casino operators and the airlines and the hotel operators and the resorts. I want to be happy for us as well. And I think our day should be approaching, should be approaching, Ivan, given the advances we're making in the vaccine front, the prevalence is coming down. The industry -- the protocols we've put in place. No other sector of the travel business or any other business has put forth as many comprehensive protocols to combat the spread of the virus as we have. And we're eager to get back to work, and we're happy to see it starting in Asia, starting in Europe. We're going to see, I think, more vessels starting in Europe soon. And so we're encouraged by all those developments. But at the end of the day, we've got to get back to work soon. And we're ready. We're all ready. Thank you."

But look, one step at a time. We just have to start. We have to start. We have to build momentum. We have to demonstrate to government agencies, society as a whole, our guests, our crew and to ourselves that we can de facto operate safely in a low prevalence environment where crew and guests are vaccinated. And then this will pivot from being a pandemic to being an endemic. And that's what we have today with the flu.

I hope that everyone joining us today as well as your loved ones remain healthy and safe.  
Similar to our last few earnings calls, we will focus our commentary today on the progress of our response to the global COVID-19 pandemic; the overall booking and pricing environment, which has shown particular strength in recent weeks; and our view of what the month ahead may look like as we prepare for an eventual return to service.  
To say that 2020 was challenging would be an incredible understatement as it was, without a doubt, the toughest and most difficult year in our company's 50-plus-year history. After a record-breaking 2019, the foundation was well set for 2020 to be even a more successful year. That upward trajectory, however, quickly changed last March. And 2020 instead became a year of great hardship and disappointment and one in which we had to rely on our nimbleness and our ability to adapt by taking swift, proactive and decisive actions to overcome the multifaceted challenges presented by the pandemic.  
These actions included bringing our entire fleet to a halt literally overnight, followed by the complex logistics of safely returning more than 50,000 of our guests home. Next came the challenge of repatriating over 25,000 of our crew members and finding safe haven for our 28 vessels, all while transitioning them to various states of reduced manning.  
We quickly bolstered our liquidity through multiple capital market transactions, totaling in excess of $6 billion; and led the industry in establishing cutting-edge health and safety standards through the cofounding of the Healthy Sail Panel. I'm incredibly proud and profoundly grateful for the dedication and perseverance demonstrated by our team members who continue to adapt, innovate and flawlessly execute while faced with unprecedented challenges. The tremendous efforts of our team are what have enabled our company to prove our resilience time and again in the past and gives me confidence we will do so again.  
As we survey the current public health situation, both in America and around the world, it is extraordinary to consider just how much has transpired in the few months since our last update. As expected, the fourth quarter resurgence of the virus drove caseloads to record highs, resulting in renewed lockdown and stricter global travel restrictions. During this time, perhaps the most important breakthrough though was the needed -- to defeat the pandemic was the coming online of several vaccines that were authorized for emergency use. Fast forward to today and caseloads across the globe have been in decline since mid-January, while simultaneously, vaccination programs are ramping up where currently over 6 million doses are being administered globally daily, a number that will only increase as manufacturing, distribution and health care systems align. 
So where does that put us in the cruise industry? In reality, we're not sure. But directionally, we're headed in the right direction to an eventual restart of cruising. Public health experts do predict that caseload, while already on the downside, will continue to decline primarily for 3 reasons: first, a significant portion of the population has already been infected and recovered; second, the number of individuals vaccinated will rapidly increase; and lastly, we will soon move into the less troublesome spring and summer season. All 3 of these factors are expected to combine to begin establishing herd immunity sometime during the third quarter, with the spread of variants and the durability of vaccine protection being the 2 main variables that could slow down but not completely halt the rapid progress being made.  
And while we are moving in the right direction, scientists continue to caution that we are not yet out of the woods, the crisis is far from over, and we must all remain vigilant and ready to adapt to the ongoing fluidity of the public health environment. Our industry has recently seen some encouraging green shoots. After the first quarter resurgence caused nascent cruise operations in Europe to temporarily halt, several European cruise lines have since resumed or are planning to return to service in the next few weeks, sourcing EU nationals from Italy and Germany. The hope and expectation is that by late spring, sailings will expand to include cross-border European nationals, and eventually, likely during the third quarter, international guest  as virus prevalence decreases to manageable level.  
Shifting to our company's recent events since our last earnings call, several key milestones marked the fourth quarter, which can be found on Slide 3 of our presentation. These include 2 capital raises, resulting in approximately $1.7 billion of additional liquidity, new debt deferral amendments providing additional financial flexibility and continued progress on our environmental, social and governance initiatives, which I will touch on in more detail later in the call.  
On Slide 4, we outlined the actions we have undertaken as we continue to navigate through this crisis, remaining focused on what we can control. Subsequent to the issuance of the CDC's Conditional Sail Order in October, we anticipated a return to service in the first quarter of 2021. Since it takes up to 90 days to ready a ship to re-enter service from layup status, we initiated a phased crew restaffing of select vessels and began a ramping up of marketing activities. This initiative, unfortunately, was met with several headwinds, most notably, the rise of confirmed cases to all-time high and the emergence of new variants, which combined with a slower-than-anticipated rollout of vaccination programs, additional lockdowns and travel restrictions, continued closure of key ports around the world and, most important, the reluctance by public health authorities to lift cruise suspension. 
These headwinds caused us to change course. With much hope for a Q1 relaunch postponed, the decision was made to return vessels to reduce manning status until there is certainty on the timing for a return to service. With new crew rested, ready and eager to work, we took the opportunity to rotate certain crew that had been onboard beyond their usual contracted term and made the difficult decision to repatriate 4,000 crew members back to their home countries.  Next, we continue to execute on our strategic financial action plan, which Mark will provide an update on; and on the incremental actions we have taken to bolster liquidity a little later in the call.  
Turning to our road map to relaunch, which is illustrated on Slide 5. We continue to work with the Healthy Sail Panel, along with the CDC and other public health authorities and governments across the globe, to prepare for a safe and healthy resumption of cruising. As we await for additional technical guidelines from the CDC and other public health officials around the world, we continue to make progress on enhancing our already rigorous health and safety standards, implementing new advancements, including digital technology for contract tracing; as well as streamlining safety drills with our state-of-the-art e-mustering technology. While we are confident in the ability of the 74 protocols developed by the Healthy Sail Panel to keep our ships, crew and guests safe, our frontline defense strategy has expanded from protocol-led preventive measures to now also include the protective health and safety benefits of vaccines.  
We view vaccine as a powerful tool, the most powerful tool, that when combined with various protective measures society is already accustomed to, such as face coverings and physical distancing, forms a multilayered, science-based approach to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 infection. We expect that by the time cruising resumes, vaccination will most certainly be widely available in the developed world. And we believe that by then, we will be able to secure vaccines for our crew as we are today well along in the procurement process. A mix of vaccinated guests and crew, along with the other established protocols, will provide a powerful combination to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 onboard our ships and the communities we visit. 
Ports and destinations is the next step of our road map, and we are in constant communication with key ports around the world to assess the status of travel restrictions, quarantine requirements and port availability. Of particular importance to the industry was the recent announcement by Canadian authorities to restrict cruise vessels from operating in Canadian waters to February of 2022. Throughout this pandemic, the travel industry has experienced the introduction, subsequent repeal and reintroduction of lockdowns and travel restrictions, depending on the prevalence of the virus and other factors. 
Thankfully, the Canadian order allows for the suspension to be rescinded based on improvement in public health. We remain cautiously optimistic that a rescission may be possible. And in the meantime, we await the results of several Alaskan delegation-led initiatives, which we want to acknowledge today and greatly appreciate that may allow Alaska cruises to operate in 2021.  
The third step in our road map is to begin reactivating our sales and marketing machine, which as you know, is guided by our industry-leading market-to-fill versus discount-to-fill strategy. We have revalidated the effectiveness of this strategy in the pandemic environment, generating demand for the back half of 2021 and especially strong demand into 2022 and beyond. We will resume a disciplined process of ramping up sales and marketing efforts once we finalize an initial voyage resumption plan.  
Lastly, and once there is certainty, we continue to expect a gradual and phased approach to the resumption of cruise voyages. Depending on the timing of our return to service, our vessels could return in certain regions before others. For example, given the seasonality of our operations, a typical year, the deployment of our vessel is concentrated in Europe during the peak summer season with 17 of our 28 ships operating in this region. Therefore, seasonality will likely play a key role in the initial deployment of our vessels.  
Our booking trends, which you can see on Slide 6,  demonstrate how we continue to experience strong demand for future cruise vacations despite the uncertainties in the broad travel sector, the reduction of demand-generating marketing investments and the temporary absence of a full complement of our all-important travel agent partners. For the second half of 2021, our load factor is below historical ranges, impacted by continued uncertainty around timing of the resumption of cruising and the shift of our limited marketing investments to focus on 2022 voyages. Pricing continues to be [ in line with ] pre-pandemic level despite the dilutive impact of the value-added future cruise credits for canceled voyages. 
And while it is still early in the booking cycle, we are very encouraged and very pleased by the strong booking activity, driven by pent-up demand across all 3 brands for 2022 voyages. Volumes during January and February sequentially improved by over 40% from November and December 2020. And as an added bonus, over 80% of these bookings were new cash bookings. For the first half of 2022 and for all of 2022, in fact, our load factor is currently well ahead of pre-pandemic levels with pricing at each of our award-winning brands in line to up mid-single digits when excluding the dilutive impacts of future cruise certificates.  
The consumer appetite for global travel aboard our 28 vessels is so strong that even with limited marketing investments, we are yielding outsized results, and we are experiencing record demand with our launches for our future itineraries and global voyage collections. A case in point is Oceania Cruises' 2023 World Cruise, which sold out within 1 day of opening for sale to the general public. In addition to our loyal past guests, approximately 1/3 of all bookings for this group came from first-time new-to-brand guests. 
We believe this achievement, along with multiple booking records we have announced in recent months, demonstrates the pent-up demand that exists from our mature and affluent cruisers even for long and exotic voyages once the severe impact of the pandemic subsides. This demand, coupled with the opening of voyages for sale further in advance, has also resulted in a significant expansion to the booking curve during the fourth quarter, which is now double versus the same time last year.  
I'll be back later to provide closing remarks. But for now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark?"

My remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 action plan as well as our road map to relaunch.

My remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 action plan as well as our road map to relaunch. The global pandemic continues to evolve, and we continue to focus on what we can control and we are prepared to adapt and modify our strategy as needed. Slide 7 illustrates 3 focus areas of our action plan and the additional proactive measures taken since the beginning of the fourth quarter.  
First, we have reduced operating expenses and capital expenditures through a number of initiatives, including the further reduction or deferral of near-term marketing expenses, reduction of nonessential capital expenditures, extended salary reductions and furloughs for shoreside team members. In fact, we reduced capital expenditures by approximately 60% for each of the years 2020 and 2021. In addition, we finalized the deferral of EUR 220 million of newbuilding-related shipyard payments through the end of the first quarter 2022.  
Second, we have also made significant progress on improving our debt maturity profile in order to provide additional near-term financial flexibility through the following actions. We amended our Pride of America, Norwegian Jewel and senior secured credit facilities to suspend testing of certain covenants. This covenant relief extends through maturity for the Pride of America and Jewel facilities and through year-end 2022 for the senior secured credit facility. We were also able to defer $70 million of amortization payments due prior to June 30, 2022, for the senior secured credit facility.  
Second, we secured deferrals for approximately $680 million of our export credit agency-backed amortization payments, representing 100% of our ECA payments originally due through the first quarter of 2022. We also received covenant waivers through the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 on our ECA facilities. We have tremendous support behind us from our strong, longstanding relationships with our export credit agencies, SACE and Hermes; our ECA and commercial lenders; as well as the shipyard. Their assistance is playing a significant role in our ability to weather this pandemic, and we can't thank them enough for their continued and ongoing partnership during these unprecedented times.  
The final focus area of our action plan was securing additional capital. In the fourth quarter, we executed 2 highly successful transactions. In November, we raised $824 million of net proceeds through an equity offering of 40 million ordinary shares. And in December, we issued 850 million of 5 7/8% senior unsecured notes due 2026 in an oversubscribed offering.  
To date, we've accessed the capital markets 5 times over a 9-month period. As a result, since the onset of the pandemic, we raised incremental cash of nearly $6.5 billion, including the drawdown of the $875 million revolver early last year. This tremendous accomplishment would not have been possible without the hard work of our finance, treasury, legal and accounting teams who have worked tirelessly around the clock to execute on these initiatives. We have also experienced an incredible outpouring of support from our investors. And again, we can't thank you enough for having conviction in our business model, in our management team and in the long-term potential of our company.  
Slide 8 outlines the improvement of our debt maturity profile in response to the crisis. Since the third quarter, we secured debt amortization deferrals of approximately $750 million, resulting in minimal debt service payments for the remainder of 2021.  
Turning to liquidity. Slide 9 provides our current illustrative liquidity profile. Our total liquidity as of year-end was approximately $3.2 billion, which includes the portion of customer deposit refunds that are included in accounts payable at quarter end. We have also estimated approximately $300 million for anticipated health and safety investments and other collateral obligations. While we anticipate variability in our health and safety investments as we work through the various requirements and continuously improve and refine our protocols, we wanted to earmark this investment in our illustrative liquidity profile. These factors combined result in a net liquidity on a pro forma basis of approximately $2.9 billion, enabling us to continue to navigate through this fluid environment and execute on our return to service plan.  
As for cash burn, our team continues to work day in and day out to further reduce expenses and conserve cash. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have made significant progress in reducing our controllable cash burn rate, with the low watermark representing a nearly 80% reduction in cruise operating expenses versus normalized levels. For the fourth quarter, our average monthly cash burn rate was approximately $190 million. This included approximately $15 million per month due to additional expenses related to preparing vessels for a potential return to service in early 2021 and included a limited increase in associated marketing investments, as Frank discussed earlier.  
As for the first quarter, we expect the average cash burn to temporarily remain elevated at approximately $190 million per month or approximately $170 million per month, excluding nondebt recurring -- nonrecurring debt modification costs as we ramp down our relaunch-related expenses and repatriate crew. The approximately $60 million of onetime costs we incurred in the quarter is a result of debt deferrals and covenant waivers and suspensions, which, when combined with the newbuild payment extensions, have resulted in approximately $1 billion of additional liquidity over the next 12 months.  
Once the ramp down of relaunch-related expenses, including crew repatriation efforts are complete, we expect that the average cash burn rate to decrease and remain at reduced levels until return to service preparations resume. We will continue to take a thoughtful and disciplined approach to reintroducing costs as we resume voyages in order to conserve cash, while at the same time, balance the need to drive new cash bookings.  
Turning to Slide 10. We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $3.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash balance in the fourth quarter increased, driven by approximately $1.7 billion of net proceeds from capital raises and was partially offset by approximately $570 million of operating cash burn, which includes operating expenses; SG&A, interest and CapEx; customer cash refunds for canceled voyages of approximately $120 million; and net working capital and other outflows of approximately $20 million, which includes health and safety investments. 
Given the continued uncertainty around the timing of our voyage resumption, we are not yet prepared to provide guidance on all metrics. However, we have provided guidance on depreciation and amortization, interest expense and newbuild-related capital expenditures to assist with modeling, which can be found in our earnings release and on Slide 19 of the presentation. Broadly speaking, excluding newbuild-related capital expenditures, we still expect the minimum required capital expenditures needed to run the business and maintain our best-in-class fleets is generally a few hundred million dollars per year.  
Before handing the call back, I want to re-emphasize that while we are prioritizing our immediate business needs, we are also very focused on the future of our company. Our medium- and long-term financial recovery plan, which is provided on Slide 11, focuses on 3 critical components: first, rebuild and gradually return to pre-COVID margin levels while continuing to identify opportunities to further drive margin expansion; second, maximize our cash generation; and third, focus on optimizing our balance sheet and charting a path to delever.  
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank to provide closing commentary. Frank?"

Just as we support our team members, we are also committed to supporting our local communities and the destinations we visit. This past year, we launched 2 initiatives in partnership with JUST Goods. For Giving Tuesday, we matched every case of JUST Water purchased in December through their online store with a water donation to local food banks in Miami and New York City. Separately, we provided nearly $275,000 of in-kind donations in the form of JUST Water and nonperishable and canned goods to support 2 community organization and assist ongoing relief efforts in the archipelago of San Andrés in Colombia after the devastating impact of Category 5 Hurricane Iota. 
Furthering our partnership with JUST Goods, we are also currently in the process of organizing several truckloads of JUST Water donations to benefit food banks located in areas around the Southwest of the United States that have been severely affected by the recent winter storms. Dedication to family and community is ingrained in our culture. And to further demonstrate this commitment, beginning this year, we are offering our U.S. shoreside team members a paid volunteer day to give back to community programs of their choice. 
On the environmental front, we are proud to have improved our score in our second CDP climate change submission to a B, which is higher than the marine transport sector, North America and global average. For 2021, we will be focused on enhancing our ESG disclosures to provide additional transparency, and I look forward to sharing additional details with you as we continue on our ESG journey.  
Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to leave you with a few final key takeaways. First, we are focused on the execution of our road map to relaunch as quickly as possible, and we'll continue to work with our expert advisers, global public health authorities and government agencies to refine our science-backed plans for a swift, safe and healthy return to cruising. Second, strong future demand for cruising across all brands, source markets and deployments continue. And early indications for 2022 bookings are extremely positive with load factors besting our previous high by a substantial margin. Lastly, we continue to keep our longer-term strategic and financial priorities in focus, and we will be ready to execute on our recovery plans to improve our balance sheet.  
The strong future demand we are experiencing, coupled with the positive momentum in the public health front, bodes extremely well for our prospects. 
And with that, Josh, please, let's open the call for questions. Thank you."

We're encouraged that the situation with Alaska and the Canadian closure until spring of '22 has been noted by various government officials, and they're trying to do their best. As you know, tourism is the third largest industry in Alaska. And for certain Alaskan coastal communities, cruising is over 90% of their tourism business. And so if we can't operate in Alaska in 2021, that will be 2 years that they will go without this infusion of business activity, and that's going to be difficult for them. 
And so we're hopeful, cautiously optimistic. It's a lot of hoops to jump through, both from the Canadian side and also, let's face it, we cannot operate as of today in U.S. waters and Alaska waters. So we have suspended taking new bookings on Alaska. I think the whole industry has. But we do hope -- we do hold out some hope that these initiatives led by the Alaskan delegation can open up Alaska for 2021."

I think there -- let's clarify a couple of things. The CDC guidance that we, as an industry, are expecting sometime in the future, and I won't label it as a few days because I simply don't know, it could be a few days, it could be a few weeks, we sim",370,"Yes. I think there -- let's clarify a couple of things. The CDC guidance that we, as an industry, are expecting sometime in the future, and I won't label it as a few days because I simply don't know, it could be a few days, it could be a few weeks, we simply don't know, that doesn't -- that is the next phase of this multiped approach that the CDC is taking. I don't believe that we are awaiting, in the next few days, the green light to cruise. That would not be correct. 
But in terms of our decision to pull back, look, when the CDC Conditional Sail Order first came out, there was great expectation, we had a Conditional Sail Order. And it proved to be more difficult than we first expected. We also were in the middle of a spike in the number of cases. And so it became obvious to us that the initial expectation that maybe the industry could begin to cruise in the first quarter, which as you know, is heavily focused on Caribbean theater of operations, was not going to take place. And so we took the difficult decision to reduce our cash burn, repatriate those crew members back home and cut down on the marketing expenses that we had begun to ramp up to -- along with the ships that we thought we could operate. 
And so today, I would tell you that we are in a better place, a more encouraging place than we were even just 6 weeks ago. At the end of the day, I think the prevalence of the disease in our own country and around the world will be the greatest indicator of when we can resume cruising. And the prevalence is dropping. And we believe, based on all the experts that we talk to, including the Healthy Sail Panel, that we're going to see a continuation of the significant drop in cases as we enter spring/summer, as we continue to vaccinate over 1.5 million Americans a day, as more people get infected and recover. So all those things point into a direction where the prevalence should drop considerably, giving us a better opportunity to restart operations."

But we generally believe that from the moment that we get the green light, depending on where the ships are that you want to stand up, depending on the seasonality, summer is a -- where are the ships in summer? Generally, they're in Europe. They're in Alaska. Where are they in the fall/winter? They're primarily in the Caribbean, Mexico, Panama Canal, around the world. 
But I think for planning purposes, we'd like to give ourselves that 90-day window, more or less. And so we've canceled cruises through the end of May. So if you count with your fingers, we -- it's basically March 1, so all of March, all of April, all of May. And it's sequential. We keep bookings and cruising -- cruises available as long as we believe there is a chance that we can operate. But once we know we start entering that 90-day-or-so window, then we owe it to everyone in the ecosystem, whether it's travel agents, consumers, our own employees, the crew, to cancel cruises in the future. So we're always hopeful, always hopeful that the public health situation improves and that we can restart as soon as we possibly can."

I hope that makes sense."

Look, early in the pandemic, people were writing off the mature market, and it's been anything but that. So as you know, the upscale brands tend to book further out than the contemporary brand, partly because of the itineraries. The longer, more exotic itineraries, everything else being equal, people book further out. And so we're continuing to see that. I mean both Oceania and Regent are nearly 40% -- are 40% booked for 2022. That's much better than they've ever been at this stage of the booking cycle. 
And so these are folks who are typically over the age of 65. The average age at Oceania and Regent is consistently in the 66, 67 age range. And these are the folks who are getting the vaccine first, and they've been cooped up, and they want to go out. I mean they're no different than 40-year olds or 30-year olds. They've got the money, and they're booking further and further out. As we said in our prepared remarks, the booking curve is now double what it normally is. And that's because of 2 reasons. One, there are literally no bookings being made for the next 3 or 4 months sailing because they've been canceled. And people are booking further and further out. People know that this pandemic will end someday. And that someday is not tomorrow but further out. 
So we have more visibility today in our future business than we've ever had. And so that's one of the things that encourages me the most. I mean I have a lot of things to worry about these days, Steve. Fundamental consumer demand and our ability to fill our ships at strong pricing is not one of them. And to be able to do what we're doing in terms of the load factors and new bookings, new cash bookings with the de minimis amount of marketing that we're doing, with the travel agency system being less than 100%, it's truly remarkable and again points to what we've been saying for years, the resiliency of the consumer, the resiliency of those who love to cruise. It's a great value. That hasn't changed, and people are eager to get back to the high seas. There's no question about that."

So assuming that those hurdles are cleared, physically, we think it will take 6, 7 months, so roughly a ship a week.

We don't want to negatively impact future business any more than the dilutive effect of the existing FCCs. So today, there is no choice, you get your money back. And in terms of the percentage of FCCs that have been redeemed, it varies by brand. But at the consolidated age level, roughly 40% of all FCCs that we have issued over time have now been redeemed. So there still remains 60% of the FCCs issued in that bucket of folks who've got an ability to rebook. 
And look, we -- somehow, in some corridors of the investment world perhaps, FCC bookings are seen as not as good as a cash booking. I think they're both important. Customers who took an FCC showed a great deal of confidence and support in our business, and we want to make sure that they get their cruise. And so if we have to extend the booking date or if we have to extend the sailing date as the suspensions continue, we will do so. We actively encourage people to redeem their FCC.

And then beyond that, in this environment today, our expectation would be that we're going to get back down to those levels we had seen in the earlier part of the year, absent the clear visibility and clear indication that we can start back up. 
So again, we started this exercise in the fourth quarter. We were hopeful with the Conditional Sails Order that we were going to be able to operate early in 2021. Obviously, that proved to be a false hope. But it's really going to be dependent upon when we get that green light and when we get that visibility. But again, if you look at the fourth quarter and the first quarter, as we've outlined, I think I said on my prepared remarks today, roughly $10 million to $15 million a month was related to some of those restart costs. That's probably the levels you would start to see once we, in earnest, restart back, whether it's a second quarter, third quarter, but again, based on when we get that clear path of resumption."

I will tell you that the sweet spot is for folks 55 plus. Historically, that is the cohort that the greatest percentage of our guests across all 3 brands comes from, and we have seen a slight increase in the proportion of total bookings coming from that cohort. And as I said earlier, that is partly because those are the cohorts that have been vaccinated more so than younger ones. These folks are retired, semiretired. The stock market has been doing well. Investments have been doing well. They've got cash. And these are people who tend to travel more and they haven't been able to. So the pent-up demand for them for this cohort, I think, is greater than younger cohorts."

For our own internal working purposes, we assume that at the beginning, that maximum occupancy will be in the 50% range. So think about this. Today, our entire fleet is available to book, let's say, in the third quarter, in July moving forward. Every single ship in the fleet has passengers. There's bookings on them. When we know we're going to start, we're not going to be able to start all 28 vessels. As I said, it's going to be a little bit, maybe a week -- one a week, something like that, which means that there's going to be a lot of customers who are booked today who will be displaced. And part of that displacement will be in cancellations, people will get their refunds. But part of it is that people will move from the Norwegian Jewel in Alaska to the Norwegian Bliss in Alaska or they'll move from the Oceania Riviera in Europe to the Oceania Marina in Europe. 
And so we believe that there are enough bookings today. If we never took another booking, let's say, for Q3, assuming a reduced capacity at the start, then we don't have to take any more bookings for Q3. And as you move forward from the start date, you have more ships coming online, less ships that are going to be -- those customers going to be displaced. And so there'll be a rebalancing, if you will, at some point, where we do need to start taking more bookings. But my guess is that, that will be beginning month 3, 4 forward. And that's what we were doing. And the restart that Mark and I discussed earlier in our remarks when we thought we were going to start in Q1 because there's always a book of business there waiting, hoping to cruise that when we do know we're going to start, it won't be the entire fleet and, therefore, we have excess bookings, if you will, at the beginning. 
So again, of all the things we worry about, filling vessels, generating demand just isn't one of them. But we have -- we don't have a short-term issue as we just described. And as you heard me say earlier, 2022, more of a longer term, business is better than ever."

Look, ships have to dry dock. They have to stay within the classification society rules. And what I can tell you is while we have pulled back on our capital expenditures and some of that is related to investments -- enhancements that we would have made during dry docks, we're not stopping dry docks. Dry docks have to occur by class. And there are certain investments that we've continued to make. A good example of that is some of the scrubbers on the Breakaway and Getaway. That was -- they were scheduled to be completed in early 2023. And because the ships are out of service and going through their normal dry dock periods, we're able to install those sooner and get the benefit once we restart operating. 
But I think when you look at the ships going forward and you look at the cost structure on the ships, by and large, we've always said this, the cost structure on a ship is generally a highly fixed cost structure. That said, there's always going to be pockets of opportunity. And I think as we think about our costs going forward, we're looking at shoreside. This pause has really given us a chance to reevaluate every cost, everything we do from our supply chain to everything we do on our shoreside operations. And I think we've mentioned this in the past that we're making some pretty significant learnings in our marketing area. We continue to transform towards the digital world. You get more bang for the dollar there. We're garnering significant amount of booking activity with vis-à-vis a less marketing spend. So we're taking those learnings. 
And every day that we're in pause, we're going to continue to look at every nook and cranny and ask ourselves, ""Are we doing this correctly?"" So I think there's opportunity for cost enhancement. And then further, as you look further down the future and you think about how does that translate to margin expansion, it's going to be a combination of reduced cost. We have more efficient capacity coming online with our 9-ship newbuild program. And that's going to help drive margin expansion in addition to, again, driving the top line, driving increased pricing that we've always been the industry leader in pricing. And as we think about that, if you look at the industry, capacity has been reduced. So we think that's going to provide even more of an opportunity to help rebuild margins and drive that margin expansion."

That means 30 million people that would have cruised in that year, haven't cruised. And this is a finite capacity business. I can't cruise with 150% occupancy. So there's going to be a squeeze play here that demand is going to exceed supply, especially after the withdrawal of some 20-plus ships from the so-called North American fleet. So you got less supply. You've got pent-up demand. You've got people with money in their pocket. I think this is just the making of a boom time for the cruise industry. And since we can't expand supply any faster than it's coming online, pricing is what's going to dictate the day. 
And we're seeing it. I mean it's astonishing to me in the 25-plus years I've been in this business that given the fact that travel agents are not at full strength, we're spending a fraction of what we normally spend, the bad news cycle of lockdowns and pandemics and travel restrictions and quarantine, that business is as robust as it is, not only in volume, but we're able to tick up prices. So when we say that we -- just do a couple of connect the dots here, 40% of FCCs have been redeemed. Those FCCs had a 25% premium on them. That we are at a flat to slightly ahead of pricing of the all-time high pricing, including the dilutive effect of those 125% FCCs. And that we are so well booked into the future, I mean I've never seen such a positive set of circumstance. We just need to get back to work. We need to get cruising operating again. 
And we're hopeful. Look, as much as it bothers me to see other sectors of the travel community open, I'm happy for them. Trust me, I'm happy for the casino operators and the airlines and the hotel operators and the resorts. I want to be happy for us as well. And I think our day should be approaching, should be approaching, Ivan, given the advances we're making in the vaccine front, the prevalence is coming down. The industry -- the protocols we've put in place. No other sector of the travel business or any other business has put forth as many comprehensive protocols to combat the spread of the virus as we have. And we're eager to get back to work, and we're happy to see it starting in Asia, starting in Europe. We're going to see, I think, more vessels starting in Europe soon. And so we're encouraged by all those developments. But at the end of the day, we've got to get back to work soon. And we're ready. We're all ready. Thank you."

I am pleased to say that we are taking this morning's call from Seattle, Washington as we prepare for a very exciting day tomorrow, the relaunch of our first ship from the United States in over 16 months. 
And as Andrea mentioned, we also have a very special guest with us today, former FDA Commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb. After over a year of working together remotely to reach this long-awaited milestone, it is truly a pleasure to finally meet Dr. Gottlieb and the other public health experts on our SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council in person and for the first time today as we kick off our grade crews come back. 
Today, we will focus our commentary on the progress we have made on our return to cruising, our comprehensive plan for the phased resumption of operations for our entire 28-ship fleet and the record-setting strength we continue to experience in consumer demand, which has translated into a record load and record pricing for calendar year 2022 and beyond. 
As you can see on Slide 4, our return to service plan is centered around 3 key phases. First, we developed our multilayered SailSAFE health and safety strategy, including mandatory FDA-, WHO- or EMA-authorized vaccinations for all guests and crew at its cornerstone. In addition, we test all guests at the terminal prior to embarkation, and all crew undergo weekly routine testing. 
Next, we have now announced voyage resumption plans for all 28 ships in our fleet. And lastly, we are intently focused on the flawless execution of the phase relaunch of our fleet, which we expect to complete by April 1, 2022. 
Against a still ever-changing COVID backdrop, we remain vigilant and ready to adapt as needed, keeping a close watch on port availability, travel restrictions and any changes to the global public health environment, which could affect our planned operations. Overall, we are encouraged to see some relaxation of travel restrictions and opening of borders in recent weeks, particularly for vaccinated travelers. 
Just a few weeks ago, Canada moved up its plans to allow the return of cruise ships in November, 4 months earlier than previously announced. Many countries in the EU are now allowing travelers from the U.S. And in the past few weeks, both Canada and the U.K. announced entry to vaccinated travelers without quarantine. 
Travel restrictions and port closures do remain in place in other parts of the world, but we are ready to execute on our cruise assumption strategy and have backup plans ready to go, which we can implement and adapt to as needed. 
Slide 5 details our voyage resumption plans by brand and by vessel. After 500 days, the time has finally come, and I could not be more pleased to say that our Great Cruise Comeback officially commenced last week with Norwegian Jade operating Greek Isles voyage out of Athens. The relaunch went off without a hitch and demonstrated that strict vaccination requirements, comprehensive preboarding testing and a suite of other robust protocols are working as designed to help mitigate the introduction and transmission of COVID-19 aboard our vessels. 
A special thank you goes out to the officers and crew of Norwegian Jade, who, even after 16 months of not operating, seamlessly adapted our new protocols and delivered the same exceptional service and world-class cruise experience that our guests expect from our company. As an indication of this top-notch service delivery, our onboard revenue on this first crew significantly exceeded our target, which was focused on 2019 actual results by over 50%. 
All of our incredible team members around the world work tirelessly to prepare for this critical moment, and I am truly grateful for the privilege to work day in and day out alongside such a dedicated passionate and talented team. I also want to express our sincere thanks to our loyal guests, valued travel partners and all of our stakeholders for their patience and support during these challenging times as we ramp up our return-to-cruise plans. 
Norwegian Jade's successful relaunch is just the first of many to come, including our much anticipated return to cruising in the United States. Tomorrow, Norwegian Encore, the line's newest and most innovative ship, will make her West Coast debut with a 7-night sailings to Alaska from Seattle. We are looking forward to once again bringing guests to explore the last frontier, one of the most popular destinations with our guests and providing some much-needed economic relief to the communities, families and small businesses throughout coastal Alaska, who have been devastated by the loss of cruise tourism revenue during this prolonged suspension. The next step in our relaunch plan is our return to Miami, the cruise capital of the world. 
I'd like to address our request for a preliminary injunction that we filed last month, which will allow us to confirm guest vaccination status for sailings departing from the State of Florida that has been heard in a Miami Federal Court today. Combating this virus is an unprecedented historic challenge. That requires everyone, including governments at the local, state and federal levels plus private enterprise and society at large, to do their part. I have a tremendous empathy for our elected officials, business leaders, friends and families, neighbors who are all doing the best they can under enormously difficult circumstances to beat back this virus. 
Having had the pleasure to work in the cruise industry for nearly 30 years, I am confident that in the current global health environment and especially with the rise of the Delta variant, having a fully vaccinated and tested population on board our vessels is the best path to keeping our guests, our dedicated crew members and the peoples of the communities we visit safe from COVID. In order to do that, we must be able to confirm vaccination status of our guests at every port we sail from, including those in the State of Florida. 
We owe it to all our stakeholders to do everything possible to make sure we deliver on this critical mission. We hope that the federal courts will agree with our vision and our mission. 
When we say the health and safety of our guest crew and communities we visit is our #1 priority, we mean it. It is not a slogan nor a tagline. The legal actions we have taken in Florida reflect our deep commitment to resume sailing in accordance with our robust science-backed SailSAFE health and safety protocols outlined on Slide 6. 
Our policy of 100% vaccinations, coupled with preboarding testing of guests and routine testing of crew is in place without issue in the nearly 500 ports we sail to and from around the world, except Florida ports. Nothing takes priority over health and safety. And we have gone to great length and expense to pursue this commitment to our guests, crew and all stakeholders. 
Again, this commitment is not a slogan nor a tagline. Health and safety is far and away the most important principle to guide how our company operates at all levels. And this fundamental philosophy has never been more important than right now. 
We want to use every tool available to us that science and medicine have developed to prepare our ships to return to service, and vaccines are our most powerful tool. 
Given that we have Dr. Gottlieb here today, who is not only a world-renowned expert, but is also the Chairman of our SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council, I'd like to give them the floor for his thoughts on our health and safety program. Dr. Gottlieb?"

It's a great pleasure to be here with you today and to witness the culmination of over a year's collaboration on enhancing Norwegian's health and safety protocols. All of the scientific and medical experts on our SailSAFE Council fully support and recommend a fully vaccinated and tested population to relaunch cruising as it's the most effective way to mitigate the introduction or spread of the virus onboard a cruise ship or anywhere else in society. 
Even with vaccines, however, the risk can't be fully mitigated. But this approach mitigates the risk to the greatest extent possible and significantly reduces the severity of any potential breakthrough cases. While the Delta variant is fueling the current rise in cases, if the U.K. is any guide, I believe we're perhaps further into this epidemic surge. And we'll hopefully be turning a corner in the next several weeks. 
In fact, some of the states hardest hit by the Delta surge in the south are already showing some indication that their epidemic waves could be starting to peak. In the meantime, the vaccines are highly effective even against the Delta variant. 
And Norwegian is taking the extra step of coupling vaccines with multiple additional layers of protection against COVID-19, including universal testing prior to boarding the ship. This goes well beyond what we're seeing in other travel and hospitality sectors. And with the controlled environment a cruise ship provides, it can offer one of the safest vacation options. 
I look forward to seeing our protocols in practice with you tomorrow on Norwegian Encore."

I, again, want to thank you and the members of the SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council for all the hard work and expert guidance that you and the council have provided us. 
Now with our safety protocols in place and our voyage resumption plan in full swing, we'll shift a discussion to our booking trends, which you can see on Slide 7. In short, pent-up demand for cruise vacations, especially for 2022 sailings, are very strong as we have experienced record-breaking demand for future cruise vacations across all 3 of our brands. 
This outsized demand is even more impressive when considering that this strength is true despite significantly reduced levels of demand-generating marketing investments and the absence of a full complement of our all-important travel agent partners throughout the world. The unparalleled pent-up demand I speak of is demonstrated by our record book position and pricing. 
For full year 2022, load factor continues to be meaningfully ahead of 2019 record levels by a wide margin. And when you look at our booking curve at the same point in time versus 2 and 3 years ago, we are now booked 9 to 10 weeks ahead of those levels. 
Pricing is also higher than 2019's record level even when including the dilutive effect of future cruise credits. The strength we are experiencing is evident throughout 2022, but particularly strong sequentially as we move through the year and our fleet rollout is completed and becomes fully operational. 
In addition, approximately 75% of our booked position in 2022 is comprised of new cash bookings with the remainder comprised of future cruise credit bookings. So far, approximately 45% of our outstanding future cruise credits have been redeemed. 
The strong demand is also extending beyond 2022. Last month, Regent Seven Seas Cruises easily broke the opening day booking record for its World Cruise for the third year in a row. The 2024 World Cruise, a 132-night sailing, surpassed all expectations and sold out in under 3 hours and at higher pricing than the 2023 World Cruise. Not only was this without a doubt the strongest World Cruise launch day in the line's history, but it also saw a strong increase in new-to-brand guests, which comprise approximately 1/3 of bookings. 
This is further evidence of the continued demand we are seeing, both from our loyal past guests and new-to-brand cruisers even for these long exotic itineraries. As I have said time and time again, the pent-up demand is real. Last quarter, we reached an inflection point in our advanced ticket sales build, which continued its positive trajectory throughout the quarter. Our advanced ticket sales increased approximately $300 million on a gross basis or over 50% versus the prior quarter's builds. 
As we begin phasing in the rest of our fleet, we expect this momentum to continue to accelerate sequentially. As we look to the future, the growth opportunity we have planned for as we emerge from this crisis is impressive. In May, Norwegian Cruise Line unveiled Norwegian Prima, the first of 6 Prima Class ships, which marked the first new class of vessels for the brand in nearly a decade. 
Debuting in summer 2022, Norwegian Prima, which you can see a rendering of on Slide 8, is absolutely stunning, offering the most outdoor deck space of any new cruise ship, including more total pool deck space than any other ship in the lines fleet as well as multiple infinity pools and vast outdoor walkways. She will also take the line's groundbreaking ship-within-a-ship concept with the haven to the next level. 
Most importantly, however, she is resonating with guests unlike any other new ship launch we have ever seen before. Her sales debut in May hit a single best booking day and best initial booking week record, doubling the previous record set by Norwegian Bliss in 2018 and at prices approximately 20% higher than Bliss commanded. 
Turning to Slide 9. We also had an exciting announcement from Regent Seven Seas Cruises, which unveiled the name of its newest ship, Seven Seas Grandeur, the sixth ship in the world's most luxurious fleet. Seven Seas Grandeur will host 750 guests and is a sister ship to Seven Seas Explorer and Seven Seas Splendor. There are more reveals to come leading after her launch in the fourth quarter of 2023 with her inaugural season set to be unveiled and open for reservations next month. 
As you can see on Slide 10, we have an industry-leading growth profile with 9 ships coming online through 2027. These newbuilds represent approximately 24,000 additional berths, growing our fleet by approximately 40%. 
In 2023, when our fleet is back in full force, we expect our capacity to be approximately 20% higher than 2019 prepandemic levels with the benefit not only of our 4 2022 and 2023 newbuilds, but also a full year of both Norwegian Encore, which joined the fleet in November of 2019 and Regent Seven Seas Splendor, which launched in February 2020. 
With a smaller footprint of 28 ships in our fleet, the addition of our new 9 ships strongly positions us to further diversify our product offerings and penetrate unserved and underserved markets globally, which is expected to drive meaningful growth to both the top and bottom lines. 
As Slide 11 clearly demonstrates, our excellent track record speaks for itself in our ability to successfully absorb capacity and turn that capacity growth into outsized revenue EBITDA and net cash flow growth. Our new ships are expected to be accretive to earnings into cash flow, and I expect our historical industry-leading performance to continue in the years to come with the addition of our new ship deliveries. 
I'll be back later to provide and an update on our ESG efforts as well as provide closing remarks. But now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark?"

Our remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 financial action plan, our liquidity profile and our all-important phased voyage resumption plan. I am pleased with the significant progress we've made on our return",755,"Thank you, Frank. Our remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 financial action plan, our liquidity profile and our all-important phased voyage resumption plan. I am pleased with the significant progress we've made on our return to cruising. 
As Frank mentioned, we are here in Seattle ready to relaunch Norwegian Encore tomorrow. We have a comprehensive voyage resumption plan in place and are focused on the execution of this phased relaunch. 
We expect to have 8 ships, representing approximately 40% of our total capacity, operating by the end of the third quarter and 17 ships, representing approximately 75% of our capacity, by year-end. The last ship, Oceana's Nautica, will emerge better than new after an extensive dry dock and reinspiration and join the rest of the fleet on April 1, 2022. 
While we've reached several important milestones in our road to recovery, we recognize that the global health environment is still fluid. So we remain focused on maintaining our cost discipline and pulling all available levers to conserve cash and maximize financial flexibility as we execute our relaunch plan. 
As you can see on Slide 12, since the halt in global cruise operations in March of 2020, we worked quickly to implement our COVID-19 financial action plan. During the pause in operations, we successfully reduced operating expenses by nearly 60% and capital expenditures by over 75%. 
As we ready our ships to return to service, costs will increase as expected. But we will do so in a strategic and disciplined manner to balance our cash needs while maintaining a strong liquidity profile. 
Since the beginning of the second quarter, we've taken several additional proactive measures on our financial action plan. We continue to significantly reduce or defer near-term demand-generating marketing expenses and nonessential capital expenditures. 
In July, we amended 9 credit facilities for our newbuild program to increase the commitments by approximately $770 million to cover owner supply costs, modification costs and financing premium fees. We want to thank our banking partners for their continued support of our company during these extremely challenging times. 
Turning to our liquidity and cash burn on Slide 13. We had approximately $2.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30. This provides us with significant financial flexibility to continue to navigate through this fluid environment and execute on a return-to-service plan. 
As for cash burn for the second quarter, our average monthly cash burn rate was approximately $200 million per month. This was slightly higher than our guidance of $190 million driven by the announcement of additional ship relaunches in our voyage resumption plan and the associated restart expenses. 
As for the third quarter, we expect our average monthly cash burn rate to increase to approximately $285 million as restart expenses accelerate with additional vessels entering service. Restart expenses are primarily related to repositioning, provisioning and stopping of vessels, implementing new health and safety protocols and a measured ramp-up of demand-generating marketing investments. 
Note that this cash burn estimate does not include our expected cash inflows from both new and existing bookings. We will continue to take a disciplined approach to reintroducing costs as voyages resume, while at the same time, balancing the need to drive new cash bookings. 
Looking ahead, based on our resumption plan, we expect to reach a crucial inflection point with operating cash flow turning positive over the course of the first quarter of 2022. 
To assist with modeling, Slide 22 details additional guidance we have provided for certain metrics, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and newbuild-related capital expenditures. 
Turning to Slide 14. We ended the second quarter with approximately $2.8 billion of cash. Our cash balance in the second quarter decreased driven primarily by approximately $600 million of operating cash burn, including operating expenses, SG&A, interest and CapEx, customer cash refunds for canceled voyages of approximately $150 million and net working capital and other outflow of approximately $10 million, which includes health and safety investments. 
Before handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate that as we continue to navigate through this crisis and relaunch our fleet over the next few quarters, we have not taken our focus off the future. Our relaunch milestones bring us one step closer to executing on our medium- and long-term financial recovery plan as outlined on Slide 15 and to rebuild and continue to drive margin expansion, maximize cash flow generation and optimize our balance sheet. 
With that, I'll hand the call back to Frank to provide closing comments."

Before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, shown on Slide 16. This summer, we reached several key milestones on our ESG journey starting with the publication",714,"Thank you, Mark. Before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, shown on Slide 16. This summer, we reached several key milestones on our ESG journey starting with the publication of our first comprehensive ESG report, which included disclosures aligning with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board or SASB index. 
This was a significant step forward in our efforts to enhance our transparency. And I encourage you all to take a look at the report, which is on our website if you haven't done so already. 
We also unveiled our redesigned Sail & Sustain program, which is structured around 5 pillars developed through cross-functional collaboration with key internal and external stakeholders. The pillars include reducing environmental impact, sailing safely, empowering people, strengthening our communities and operating with integrity and accountability. 
In addition, we have aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and have identified 10 goals where we believe we can make the greatest contribution to achieve a more sustainable future for all. In conjunction with the report, we have also developed a new sustainability website, which we will use to continue to provide critical disclosure to all of our stakeholders. 
On the environmental front, we were pleased to announce our newly created long-term climate action strategy and our goal to reach carbon neutrality. This ambitious program is centered around 3 key action areas, including reducing carbon intensity; identifying and investing in technologies, including exploring alternative fuels; and implementing a carbon offset program. 
We continuously seek opportunities to reduce our overall footprint by minimizing fuel consumption. And in fact, our ongoing investments in systems and technologies have resulted in a reduction of fuel consumption per capacity day of approximately 17% from 2008 to 2019 for our entire 28-ship fleet. 
With the introduction of our 9 new and more fuel-efficient vessels through 2027, we expect to see further improvement in our intensity rates. In addition to ongoing initiatives to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions rate, we have committed to purchasing high-quality verified carbon credits to offset 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent over a 3-year period beginning last year. This is a measurable step in the near-term emissions reductions, which will help bridge the gap in our decarbonization efforts until new technologies become available. 
Our 3 million-ton commitment is sizable. To put it in perspective, it is the equivalent of over 7.5 billion miles driven by an average passenger car. And we plan to increase offset purchases in future years to help us reach our goal of carbon neutrality. 
We are very proud of the progress we have made so far in ESG, and we are committed to making a lasting impact on the world as responsible corporate citizens and ESG leaders. I look forward to sharing additional details with you as we continue on our ESG journey. 
Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to leave you with a few final key takeaways. First, we are putting health and safety at the forefront of our return to service as demonstrated by the great length we are taking to resume cruising in the safest manner possible with our universal mandatory vaccination and preboarding testing policy across our 3 brands. 
Our Great Cruise Comeback has commenced, and we are focused on the flawless execution of our phased voyage resumption plan with a target to have our full fleet in operation by April 1, 2022. We continue to experience strong future demand for cruising with very positive booking and pricing trends for 2022 and beyond. 
And lastly, as we emerge from the pandemic and focus on our longer-term prospects, we have an attractive and well-thought out growth profile, which we expect will provide a meaningful boost to our financial results and shareholder value in the coming years. 
Overall, while we still have a long road to full recovery ahead of us, we are encouraged by the significant milestones we have reached in recent days on return to cruising. Tomorrow, we will take another monumental step forward with our official U.S. relaunch. And I look forward to getting back to what we do best, providing exceptional vacation experiences and lifetime memories for our guests. 
And with that, we can open the call for questions."

We think we have a very measured and disciplined plan with approximately 75% to 80% of our fleet in operation by year-end. 
And as a result of that, when we look at our cash flow, both the inflows and just the regular operating contribution from each of our vessels, yes, we expect to be cash flow positive sometime over the course of the first quarter of 2022. And that's only -- to put that in perspective, that's 5 to 6 months away. 
So we're very pleased with the booking trends that we've seen. Obviously, as we restart and our ships enter service, that starts to generate that cash flywheel that we've been talking about. So we're very pleased. We don't think -- with anything, there's always a little bit of risk out there. But based on our measured plan, we think we have a solid game plan of returning to cash flow-positive operations."

We think that's a competitive advantage, quite frankly. During a pandemic, people who are willing to travel want to travel safely. And the Norwegian Cruise Line platform allows you to do that. Dr. Gottlieb spoke about it. It becomes just about the safest place on Earth, to be on a Norwegian Cruise Line ship. 
And I'm glad to see my peers in the industry following suit because now they have begun to introduce at least some of the measures that we have announced early on.

When we look at our relaunch cost, look, everything -- all the costs that we're incurring, they're normal, they're expected. You look at how many ships we're restarting over the course of the next 5 to 6 months. There's nothing out of the ordinary. 
Most of -- there is going to be some onetime front-end loaded costs. Again, you're relocating whether it's 1,000 or 1,500 crew per vessel from across the globe. So you have some onetime initial cost. But that will settle. That will balance as typical. 
But most importantly, as our vessels start to sail and as we've said publicly, we are -- most of our vessels are starting at either 60 and then ramping -- 60% load factor and then slowly ramping up to 80 and then hopefully to over -- back to our normal load factors in a short time. Those vessels which are operating are cash flow positive out of the gate. And that's very, very important.

And yes, it is on an apples-to-apples basis of a similar voyage, similar itinerary from 2019's record levels. And when you look at the mix of passengers, I think that voyage was predominantly probably the majority U.S.-based and then followed by a European-based. 
And you look -- when you look at the spending trends of it, it was your normal areas. Shore ex was very intense, food and beverage and then casino. So it's great to see that we're seeing the trends that we're used to. Customers are willing to spend. While it's early, it is certainly very, very encouraging."

But as we look forward, our goals right now are we want to get below 5. And then obviously, we'll look to get into the 4s. 
It's a bit premature to decide or to really telegraph when we're going to get to those levels. As we've said before, if 2022 continues on the path that we're seeing today, it could be a very nice year in terms of EBITDA and subsequent cash flow generation. 
So that's certainly going to assist and help us with that delevering story. So we are focused on it. We have not lost sight of that because we know that's important. But right now, we're focused on relaunching and providing the best experience that we can to our customers. And if we can do that, that's going to subsequently turn into significant cash flow generation. 
And I will reiterate, we've said and we expect in our conservative relaunch plan, we expect to be cash flow positive over the course of the first quarter of 2022. So when you think about that from a restart within a 6-month period to be cash flow positive, we feel that's pretty tremendous. And we're pretty proud of that. So we look forward over the next few months of restarting our fleet. And again, that the cash flow that, that spins off."

So curious, as you look out over the next couple of years, is just a little bit ahead of '19 the right way to think about it? Or could pricing be even better than that in years ahead for cruise?"

It's -- if you -- I hesitate to give you any specific numbers, but when you strip out the dilutive effects of the future cruise credits, the like-for-like pricing, the pricing to the public, so to speak, is up significantly, up multiples of what our typical year-over-year growth is in yields. 
And so the pent-up demand is real, and we're taking advantage of it. We do have these future cruise certificates to deal with, which will end in 2022, that these FCCs will not be dilutive at all in 2023. The FCCs have to be used by the end of 2022 or else we're going to refund the customer or whatever they paid in. 
And also, remember, as I mentioned, I believe it's Slide 11, look at our future growth. We have 20% more capacity coming online through the end of '23. Look at our historic ability to absorb that growth and how we turn the capacity growth into gross revenue growth, outsized EBITDA growth and outsized net cash growth. So we're very much looking forward to taking delivery of these vessels over the next few years. 
Four of them come online in '22 and '23. They're going to be accretive. They're going to be higher than the corporate average. So we believe that, that's a wonderful setup. 
As Mark mentioned before the pandemic hit, NCLH was hitting on all cylinders. We were delevering to investment grade. We're going to start paying a dividend. The biggest problem we used to sit around the boardroom was, what are we going to do with all this cash? And well, we're going to start generating cash again, and that cash is first going to go to pay down debt that we took on to survive the pandemic, and then we're going to look to do what companies do: buy back stock if it's opportunistically to do so, perhaps expand the business. 
We're bullish on this business. We know how to operate a cruise in this top line cruise company. We haven't forgotten how to do that over the pandemic. And we're seeing the pent-up demand from customers that allow us to do what -- exactly what we do best. So we're very much bullish on the future."

I think the second part of your question was related to the carbon credits. We're very excited about this. This is something we're serious about. We've really taken a hard stance on our ESG efforts over the last year or 2. And we're committed to this. So we spent a few million dollars on purchasing these carbon credits. I think that, together with our other investments that we continue to make with the fleet, whether it's exhaust gas cleaning technology, waste heat recovery, we're looking at all viable investments where we can to reduce our carbon footprint.

So many Americans have not been able to go overseas for such a long period of time that the pent-up demand that we're seeing for cruising overall is higher indexed by Americans wanting these long-haul travel plans to places like Greece. So we don't think that's sustainable in the long term, perhaps in the short to medium term as this pent-up demand is sort of burned off. 
But it's good to see that we have the marketing strength and the sales platforms throughout the world to be able to fill our ships. And whether it's Americans want to come over or Europeans, we're seeing strong demand across the board."

So while our vessels are coming online over the course of the next 2 to 3 quarters, Q1, I think, is going to essentially look pretty normal as well, so to speak. Again, we do have, I think, believe it's 9 or 10 vessels that are coming on in Q1. So certainly, by the second quarter, we had to anticipate that all of our vessels or the vast majority should be back at their normal load factor levels. And if we're lucky, maybe some time sooner than that. 
But it's not that we don't care about '21. We've taken the stand that we want to do this right. We want to create confidence in our customers and our shareholders and our employees. And we want to make sure we're learning from all the cruises that we're launching.

We would also like to welcome a special guest joining us today, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Chairman of our company's SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council and author of the soon-to-be-released book, Uncontrolled Spread. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Mark will follow to discuss our financial results before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. 
As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nchlltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. 
Before we begin, I'd like to cover just a few items. Our press release with second quarter 2021 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. 
Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank?"

As always, I hope that all of you joining us today as well as your loved ones remain healthy and safe. 
Before I go into my prepared remarks, and if you haven't already heard the good news, I would like to congratulate Andrea on her new appointment to Chief Sales and Marketing Officer of our luxury brand, Regent Seven Seas Cruises. After more than 30 earnings calls with our company, we will all miss her but wish her the very best of luck in her new role. Jessica John, who many of you have already met, will assume the role of Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Communications and ESG beginning September 1. Congratulations, Andrea and Jessica. 
I am pleased to say that we are taking this morning's call from Seattle, Washington as we prepare for a very exciting day tomorrow, the relaunch of our first ship from the United States in over 16 months. And as Andrea mentioned, we also have a very special guest with us today, former FDA Commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb. After over a year of working together remotely to reach this long-awaited milestone, it is truly a pleasure to finally meet Dr. Gottlieb and the other public health experts on our SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council in person and for the first time today as we kick off our Great Cruise Comeback. 
Today, we will focus our commentary on the progress we have made on our return to cruising, our comprehensive plan for the phased resumption of operations for our entire 28-ship fleet and the record-setting strength we continue to experience in consumer demand, which has translated into a record load and record pricing for calendar year 2022 and beyond. 
As you can see on Slide 4, our return to service plan is centered around 3 key phases. First, we developed our multilayered SailSAFE health and safety strategy, including mandatory FDA-, WHO- or EMA-authorized vaccinations for all guests and crew at its cornerstone. In addition, we test all guests at the terminal prior to embarkation, and all crew undergo weekly routine testing. Next, we have now announced voyage resumption plans for all 28 ships in our fleet. And lastly, we are intently focused on the flawless execution of the phased relaunch of our fleet, which we expect to complete by April 1, 2022. 
Against a still ever-changing COVID backdrop, we remain vigilant and ready to adapt as needed, keeping a close watch on port availability, travel restrictions and any changes to the global public health environment, which could affect our planned operations. Overall, we are encouraged to see some relaxation of travel restrictions and opening of borders in recent weeks, particularly for vaccinated travelers. 
Just a few weeks ago, Canada moved up its plans to allow the return of cruise ships in November, 4 months earlier than previously announced. Many countries in the EU are now allowing travelers from the U.S. And in the past few weeks, both Canada and the U.K. announced entry to vaccinated travelers without quarantine. Travel restrictions and port closures do remain in place in other parts of the world, but we are ready to execute on our cruise assumption strategy and have backup plans ready to go, which we can implement and adapt to as needed. 
Slide 5 details our voyage resumption plans by brand and by vessel. After 500 days, the time has finally come, and I could not be more pleased to say that our Great Cruise Comeback officially commenced last week, with Norwegian Jade operating Greek Isles voyages out of Athens. The relaunch went off without a hitch and demonstrated that strict vaccination requirements, comprehensive preboarding testing and a suite of other robust protocols are working as designed to help mitigate the introduction and transmission of COVID-19 aboard our vessels. 
A special thank you goes out to the officers and crew of Norwegian Jade, who, even after 16 months of not operating, seamlessly adapted our new protocols and delivered the same exceptional service and world-class cruise experience that our guests expect from our company. As an indication of this top-notch service delivery, our onboard revenue on this first crew significantly exceeded our target, which was focused on 2019 actual results by over 50%. 
All of our incredible team members around the world worked tirelessly to prepare for this critical moment, and I am truly grateful for the privilege to work day in and day out alongside such a dedicated, passionate and talented team. I also want to express our sincere thanks to our loyal guests, valued travel partners and all of our stakeholders for their patience and support during these challenging times as we ramp up our return-to-cruise plans. 
Norwegian Jade's successful relaunch is just the first of many to come, including our much anticipated return to cruising in the United States. Tomorrow, Norwegian Encore, the line's newest and most innovative ship, will make her West Coast debut with a 7-night sailings to Alaska from Seattle. We are looking forward to once again bringing guests to explore the last frontier, one of the most popular destinations with our guests, and providing some much-needed economic relief to the communities, families and small businesses throughout coastal Alaska, who have been devastated by the loss of cruise tourism revenue during this prolonged suspension. 
The next step in our relaunch plan is our return to Miami, the cruise capital of the world. I'd like to address our request for a preliminary injunction that we filed last month, which will allow us to confirm guest vaccination status for sailings departing from the State of Florida that is being heard in a Miami Federal Court today. Combating this virus is an unprecedented historic challenge that requires everyone, including governments at the local, state and federal levels plus private enterprise and society at large, to do their part. I have a tremendous empathy for our elected officials, business leaders, friends and families, neighbors who are all doing the best they can under enormously difficult circumstances to beat back this virus. 
Having had the pleasure to work in the cruise industry for nearly 30 years, I am confident that in the current global health environment and especially with the rise of the Delta variant, having a fully vaccinated and tested population on board our vessels is the best path to keeping our guests, our dedicated crew members and the peoples of the communities we visit safe from COVID. In order to do that, we must be able to confirm vaccination status of our guests at every port we sail from, including those in the State of Florida. We owe it to all our stakeholders to do everything possible to make sure we deliver on this critical mission. We hope that the Federal Court will agree with our vision and our mission. 
When we say the health and safety of our guests, crew and communities we visit is the #1 priority, we mean it. It is not a slogan nor a tagline. The legal actions we have taken in Florida reflect our deep commitment to resume sailing in accordance with our robust science-backed SailSAFE health and safety protocols outlined on Slide 6. Our policy of 100% vaccinations, coupled with preboarding testing of guests and routine testing of crew, is in place without issue in the nearly 500 ports we sail to and from around the world, except Florida ports. Nothing takes priority over health and safety, and we have gone to great length and expense to pursue this commitment to our guests, crew and all stakeholders. 
Again, this commitment is not a slogan nor a tagline. Health and safety is far and away the most important principle that guides how our company operates at all levels, and this fundamental philosophy has never been more important than right now. We want to use every tool available to us that science and medicine have developed to prepare our ships to return to service, and vaccines are our most powerful tool. 
Given that we have Dr. Gottlieb here today, who is not only a world-renowned expert but is also the Chairman of our SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council, I'd like to give them the floor for his thoughts on our health and safety program. Dr. Gottlieb?"

It's a great pleasure to be here with you today and to witness the culmination of over a year's collaboration on enhancing Norwegian's health and safety protocols. All of the scientific and medical experts on our SailSAFE Council fully support and recommend a fully vaccinated and tested population to relaunch cruising as it's the most effective way to mitigate the introduction or spread of the virus onboard a cruise ship or anywhere else in society. 
Even with vaccines, however, the risk can't be fully mitigated. But this approach mitigates the risk to the greatest extent possible and significantly reduces the severity of any potential breakthrough cases. While the Delta variant is fueling the current rise in cases, if the U.K. is any guide, I believe we're perhaps further into this epidemic surge and will hopefully be turning a corner in the next several weeks. In fact, some of the states hardest hit by the Delta surge in the South are already showing some indication that their epidemic waves could be starting to peak. 
In the meantime, the vaccines are highly effective even against the Delta variant. And Norwegian is taking the extra step of coupling vaccines with multiple additional layers of protection against COVID-19, including universal testing prior to boarding the ship. This goes well beyond what we're seeing in other travel and hospitality sectors. And with the controlled environment a cruise ship provides, it can offer one of the safest vacation options. 
I look forward to seeing our protocols in practice with you tomorrow on Norwegian Encore."
4180463,1674890336,2368318,"Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2021",2021-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Dr. Gottlieb, for your insights. I again want to thank you and the members of the SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council for all the hard work and expert guidance that you and the council have provided us. Now with our safety protocols i",987,"Thank you, Dr. Gottlieb, for your insights. I again want to thank you and the members of the SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council for all the hard work and expert guidance that you and the council have provided us. 
Now with our safety protocols in place and our voyage resumption plan in full swing, we'll shift the discussion to our booking trends, which you can see on Slide 7. In short, pent-up demand for cruise vacations, especially for 2022 sailings, are very strong as we have experienced record-breaking demand for future cruise vacations across all 3 of our brands. 
This outsized demand is even more impressive when considering that this strength is true despite significantly reduced levels of demand-generating marketing investments and the absence of a full complement of our all-important travel agent partners throughout the world. 
The unparalleled pent-up demand I speak of is demonstrated by our record book position and pricing. For full year 2022, load factor continues to be meaningfully ahead of 2019 record levels by a wide margin. And when you look at our booking curve at the same point in time versus 2 and 3 years ago, we are now booked 9 to 10 weeks ahead of those levels. 
Pricing is also higher than 2019's record level even when including the dilutive effect of future cruise credits. The strength we are experiencing is evident throughout 2022, but particularly strong sequentially as we move through the year and our fleet rollout is completed and becomes fully operational. 
In addition, approximately 75% of our booked position in 2022 is comprised of new cash bookings, with the remainder comprised of future cruise credit bookings. So far, approximately 45% of our outstanding future cruise credits have been redeemed. 
The strong demand is also extending beyond 2022. Last month, Regent Seven Seas Cruises easily broke the opening day booking record for its World Cruise for the third year in a row. The 2024 World Cruise, a 132-night sailing, surpassed all expectations and sold out in under 3 hours and at higher pricing than the 2023 World Cruise. Not only was this without a doubt the strongest World Cruise launch day in the line's history, but it also saw a strong increase in new-to-brand guests, which comprise approximately 1/3 of bookings. This is further evidence of the continued demand we are seeing, both from our loyal past guests and new-to-brand cruisers even for these long exotic itineraries. 
As I have said time and time again, the pent-up demand is real. Last quarter, we reached an inflection point in our advanced ticket sales build, which continued its positive trajectory throughout the quarter. Our advanced ticket sales increased approximately $300 million on a gross basis or over 50% versus the prior quarter's builds. As we begin phasing in the rest of our fleet, we expect this momentum to continue to accelerate sequentially. 
As we look to the future, the growth opportunity we have planned for as we emerge from this crisis is impressive. In May, Norwegian Cruise Line unveiled Norwegian Prima, the first of 6 Prima Class ships, which marked the first new class of vessels for the brand in nearly a decade. Debuting in summer 2022, Norwegian Prima, which you can see a rendering of on Slide 8, is absolutely stunning, offering the most outdoor deck space of any new cruise ship, including more total pool deck space than any other ship in the line's fleet as well as multiple infinity pools and vast outdoor walkways. She will also take the line's groundbreaking ship-within-a-ship concept with the Haven to the next level. 
Most importantly, however, she is resonating with guests unlike any other new ship launch we have ever seen before. Her sales debut in May hit a single best booking day and best initial booking week record, doubling the previous record set by Norwegian Bliss in 2018 and at prices approximately 20% higher than Bliss commanded. 
Turning to Slide 9. We also had an exciting announcement from Regent Seven Seas Cruises, which unveiled the name of its newest ship, Seven Seas Grandeur, the sixth ship in the world's most luxurious fleet. Seven Seas Grandeur will host 750 guests and is a sister ship to Seven Seas Explorer and Seven Seas Splendor. There are more reveals to come leading after her launch in the fourth quarter of 2023, with her inaugural season set to be unveiled and open for reservations next month. 
As you can see on Slide 10, we have an industry-leading growth profile with 9 ships coming online through 2027. These newbuilds represent approximately 24,000 additional berths, growing our fleet by approximately 40%. 
In 2023, when our fleet is back in full force, we expect our capacity to be approximately 20% higher than 2019 prepandemic levels, with the benefit not only of our 4 2022 and 2023 newbuilds, but also a full year of both Norwegian Encore, which joined the fleet in November of 2019, and Regent Seven Seas Splendor, which launched in February of 2020. 
With a smaller footprint of 28 ships in our fleet, the addition of our new 9 ships strongly positions us to further diversify our product offerings and penetrate unserved and underserved markets globally, which is expected to drive meaningful growth to both the top and bottom lines. 
As Slide 11 clearly demonstrates, our excellent track record speaks for itself in our ability to successfully absorb capacity and turn that capacity growth into outsized revenue, EBITDA and net cash flow growth. Our new ships are expected to be accretive to earnings into cash flow, and I expect our historical industry-leading performance to continue in the years to come with the addition of our new ship deliveries. 
I'll be back later to provide and an update on our ESG efforts as well as provide closing remarks. But now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark?"

Our remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 financial action plan, our liquidity profile and our all-important phased voyage resumption plan. I am pleased with the significant progress we've made on our return to cruising. As Frank mentioned, we are here in Seattle ready to relaunch Norwegian Encore tomorrow. We have a comprehensive voyage resumption plan in place and are focused on the execution of this phased relaunch. We expect to have 8 ships representing approximately 40% of our total capacity operating by the end of the third quarter and 17 ships representing approximately 75% of our capacity by year-end. 
The last ship, Oceana's Nautica, will emerge better than new after an extensive dry dock and reinspiration and join the rest of the fleet on April 1, 2022. While we've reached several important milestones in our road to recovery, we recognize that the global health environment is still fluid so we remain focused on maintaining our cost discipline and pulling all available levers to conserve cash and maximize financial flexibility as we execute our relaunch plan. 
As you can see on Slide 12, since the halt in global cruise operations in March of 2020, we worked quickly to implement our COVID-19 financial action plan. During the pause in operations, we successfully reduced operating expenses by nearly 60% and capital expenditures by over 75%. As we ready our ships to return to service, costs will increase as expected. But we will do so in a strategic and disciplined manner to balance our cash needs while maintaining a strong liquidity profile. 
Since the beginning of the second quarter, we've taken several additional proactive measures on our financial action plan. We continue to significantly reduce or defer near-term demand-generating marketing expenses and nonessential capital expenditures. In July, we amended 9 credit facilities for our newbuild program to increase the commitments by approximately $770 million to cover owner supply costs, modification costs and financing premium fees. We want to thank our banking partners for their continued support of our company during these extremely challenging times. 
Turning to our liquidity and cash burn on Slide 13. We had approximately $2.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30. This provides us with significant financial flexibility to continue to navigate through this fluid environment and execute on a return-to-service plan. 
As for cash burn for the second quarter, our average monthly cash burn rate was approximately $200 million per month. This was slightly higher than our guidance of $190 million driven by the announcement of additional ship relaunches in our voyage resumption plan and the associated restart expenses. 
As for the third quarter, we expect our average monthly cash burn rate to increase to approximately $285 million as restart expenses accelerate with additional vessels entering service. Restart expenses are primarily related to repositioning, provisioning and stopping of vessels, implementing new health and safety protocols and a measured ramp-up of demand-generating marketing investments. Note that this cash burn estimate does not include our expected cash inflows from both new and existing bookings. We will continue to take a disciplined approach to reintroducing costs as voyages resume while, at the same time, balancing the need to drive new cash bookings. 
Looking ahead, based on our resumption plan, we expect to reach a crucial inflection point with operating cash flow turning positive over the course of the first quarter of 2022. To assist with modeling, Slide 22 details additional guidance we have provided for certain metrics, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and newbuild-related capital expenditures. 
Turning to Slide 14. We ended the second quarter with approximately $2.8 billion of cash. Our cash balance in the second quarter decreased, driven primarily by approximately $600 million of operating cash burn, including operating expenses, SG&A, interest and CapEx; customer cash refunds for canceled voyages of approximately $150 million; and net working capital and other outflow of approximately $10 million, which includes health and safety investments. 
Before handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate that as we continue to navigate through this crisis and relaunch our fleet over the next few quarters, we have not taken our focus off the future. Our relaunch milestones bring us one step closer to executing on our medium- and long-term financial recovery plan, as outlined on Slide 15, and to rebuild and continue to drive margin expansion, maximize cash flow generation and optimize our balance sheet. 
With that, I'll hand the call back to Frank to provide closing comments."

Before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, shown on Slide 16. This summer, we reached several key milestones on our ESG journey starting with the publication of our first comprehensive ESG report, which included disclosures aligning with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB index. This was a significant step forward in our efforts to enhance our transparency, and I encourage you all to take a look at the report, which is on our website if you haven't done so already. 
We also unveiled our redesigned Sail & Sustain program, which is structured around 5 pillars developed through cross-functional collaboration with key internal and external stakeholders. The pillars include reducing environmental impact, sailing safely, empowering people, strengthening our communities and operating with integrity and accountability. 
In addition, we have aligned to the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals and have identified 10 goals where we believe we can make the greatest contribution to achieve a more sustainable future for all. In conjunction with the report, we have also developed a new sustainability website, which we will use to continue to provide critical disclosure to all of our stakeholders. 
On the environmental front, we were pleased to announce our newly created long-term climate action strategy and our goal to reach carbon neutrality. This ambitious program is centered around 3 key action areas, including reducing carbon intensity; identifying and investing in technologies, including exploring alternative fuels; and implementing a carbon offset program. We continuously seek opportunities to reduce our overall footprint by minimizing fuel consumption. And in fact, our ongoing investments in systems and technologies have resulted in a reduction of fuel consumption per capacity day of approximately 17% from 2008 to 2019 for our entire 28-ship fleet. With the introduction of our 9 new and more fuel-efficient vessels through 2027, we expect to see further improvement in our intensity rates. 
In addition to ongoing initiatives to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions rate, we have committed to purchasing high-quality verified carbon credits to offset 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent over a 3-year period beginning last year. This is a measurable step in the near-term emissions reductions, which will help bridge the gap in our decarbonization efforts until new technologies become available. 
Our 3 million-ton commitment is sizable. To put it in perspective, it is the equivalent of over 7.5 billion miles driven by an average passenger car. And we plan to increase offset purchases in future years to help us reach our goal of carbon neutrality. We are very proud of the progress we have made so far in ESG, and we are committed to making a lasting impact on the world as responsible corporate citizens and ESG leaders. I look forward to sharing additional details with you as we continue on our ESG journey. 
Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to leave you with a few final key takeaways. First, we are putting health and safety at the forefront of our return to service, as demonstrated by the great lengths we are taking to resume cruising in the safest manner possible with a universal mandatory vaccination and preboarding testing policy across our 3 brands. 
Our Great Cruise Comeback has commenced, and we are focused on the flawless execution of our phased voyage resumption plan with a target to have our full fleet in operation by April 1, 2022. We continue to experience strong future demand for cruising with very positive booking and pricing trends for 2022 and beyond. 
And lastly, as we emerge from the pandemic and focus on our longer-term prospects, we have an attractive and well-thought out growth profile, which we expect will provide a meaningful boost to our financial results and shareholder value in the coming years. 
Overall, while we still have a long road to full recovery ahead of us, we are encouraged by the significant milestones we have reached in recent days on return to cruising. Tomorrow, we will take another monumental step forward with our official U.S. relaunch. And I look forward to getting back to what we do best, providing exceptional vacation experiences and lifetime memories for our guests. 
And with that, we can open the call for questions."

We think that's a competitive advantage, quite frankly. During a pandemic, people who are willing to travel want to travel safely, and the Norwegian Cruise Line platform allows you to do that. Dr. Gottlieb spoke about it. It becomes just about the safest place on Earth to be on a Norwegian Cruise Line ship. 
And I'm glad to see my peers in the industry following suit because now they have begun to introduce at least some of the measures that we have announced early on. So to me, it is a competitive advantage. We continue -- we will continue to do the right thing, and that is to protect the health and safety of our guests and the communities we visit in every possible way we can."

So look, when we look at our customer deposits, as we said in our prepared remarks, our customer deposits increased 50% versus the prior quarter, roughly $300 million on a gross basis. So obviously, as we continue to relaunch and restart and we get closer to the voyages operating, we expect that to accelerate. So we're very, very pleased with that. 
When we look at our relaunch cost, look, everything -- all the costs that we're incurring, they're normal, they're expected. You look at how many ships we're restarting over the course of the next 5 to 6 months, there's nothing out of the ordinary. Most of -- there is going to be some onetime front-end loaded costs. Again, you're relocating whether it's 1,000 or 1,500 crew per vessel from across the globe. So you have some onetime initial cost. But that will settle. That will balance as typical. 
But most importantly, as our vessels start to sail, and as we've said publicly, we are -- most of our vessels are starting at either 60% and then ramping -- 60% load factor and then slowly ramping up to 80% and then hopefully to over -- back to our normal load factors in a short time. Those vessels which are operating are cash flow positive out of the gate, and that's very, very important. And we've seen that with our first 2 initial voyages that have just been completed by Norwegian Jade. And we expect that to be the case for the coming voyages as well for the rest of the fleet."

It's a bit premature to decide -- or to really telegraph when we're going to get to those levels.

It's -- if you -- I hesitate to give you any specific numbers. But when you strip out the dilutive effects of the future cruise credits, the like-for-like pricing, the pricing to the public, so to speak, is up significantly, up multiples of what our typical year-over-year growth is in yields. And so the pent-up demand is real, and we're taking advantage of it. We do have these future cruise certificates to deal with, which will end in 2022. These FCCs will not be dilutive at all in 2023. The FCCs have to be used by the end of 2022 or else we're going to refund the customer or whatever they paid in. 
And also, remember, as I mentioned, I believe it's Slide 11, look at our future growth. We have 20% more capacity coming online through the end of '23. Look at our historic ability to absorb that growth and how we turn the capacity growth into gross revenue growth, outsized EBITDA growth and outsized net cash growth. So we're very much looking forward to taking delivery of these vessels over the next few years. 4 of them come online in '22 and '23. They're going to be accretive. They're going to be higher than the corporate average. So we believe that that's a wonderful setup. 
As Mark mentioned, before the pandemic hit, NCLH was hitting on all cylinders. We were delevering to investment-grade. We're going to start paying a dividend. The biggest problem we used to sit around the boardroom was, what are we going to do with all this cash? And well, we're going to start generating cash again, and that cash is first going to go to pay down debt that we took on to survive the pandemic. And then we're going to look to do what companies do: buy back stock if it's opportunistically to do so, perhaps expand the business. 
We're bullish on this business. We know how to operate a cruise in this -- top line cruise company. We haven't forgotten how to do that over the pandemic. And we're seeing the pent-up demand from customers that allowed us to do what -- exactly what we do best. So we're very much bullish on the future."

But let me just go back in the time line here, something we just said about Norwegian Jade's first 2 voyages. Even at reduced capacity, we are seeing significant strength and significant spend on those vessels. So while our vessels are coming online over the course of the next 2 to 3 quarters, Q1, I think, is going to essentially look pretty normal as well, so to speak. 
Again, we do have, I think, I believe it's 9 or 10 vessels that are coming on in Q1. So certainly, by the second quarter, we would anticipate that all of our vessels or the vast majority should be back at their normal load factor levels. And if we're lucky, maybe some time sooner than that. 
But it's not that we don't care about '21. We've taken the stand that we want to do this right. We want to create confidence in our customers and our shareholders and our employees. And we want to make sure we're learning from all the cruises that we're launching. So we look -- we're excited about 2022 and beyond.

So we're comfortable where our liquidity is today. We believe we have a strong foundation. We've taken significant measures to get where we are today. So as long as we can reasonably execute on our resumption -- on our voyage resumption plan, we feel that we're in a very, very strong position as we sit here today."

When we see employees on the vessel, they just break down in tears of joy because they have the opportunity to work again. So we don't anticipate any issues around the labor sector or the labor portion of our operating model. 
In terms of good old fashioned food, consumables, things of that nature, yes, we're not immune to it. We are seeing some inflationary pressure. We have started to see some of it stabilize.

And as always, I hope that all of you as well as your loved ones remain healthy and safe. 
Today, we will discuss commentary on 3 areas: first, the progress we have made on our great cruise come back; second, our recent booking and demand trends, which have shown particular strength for sailings operating in the second half of '22 and for all of 2023, when our fleet is expected to be back in full operation and at normalized occupancy levels. And finally, on our exciting pipeline of new vessels, which we expect to contribute outsized EBITDA growth and other important financial metric improvements. 
Slide 4 outlines how far we have come on our return to service plan. When we last spoke in early August, we had just relaunched the first vessel in our fleet, Norwegian Jade in Greece, and we're on the verge of resuming cruising in the U.S. with Norwegian Encore, making her West Coast debut, sailing to Alaska from Seattle. 
Since then, we have successfully relaunched 11 of our 28 vessels with all 3 of our award-winning brands resuming operations. We couldn't be more pleased with the performance of our relaunch ships. First, our crew has not missed a beat since returning, seamlessly adapting to our new health and safety protocols and going above and beyond to deliver the exceptional vacation experiences our brands are known for. This commitment has resulted in record high guest satisfaction scores with each month sequentially better than the month before. And second, we are seeing the power of our industry-leading bundling strategy pay off as guests are boarding our vessels with fresh wallets, which coupled with robust pent-up demands for all kinds of experiences is translating to remarkably strong onboard revenue generation. 
In fact, onboard revenue has exceeded our baseline expectations by over 20% with broad-based strength across all ships, region and revenue streams. While I would caution though, against extrapolating these figures as permanent, or indicative of steady-state future performance just yet. As there are several transitory factors that may be contributing to the elevated current levels, including pent-up demand, cabin and guest mix, it is nonetheless an encouraging and positive signal of the healthy consumer demand we are experiencing. 
Lastly and most importantly, these relaunch ships have already contributed positive cash flow in the third quarter, even with our self-imposed occupancy level caps. Despite returning to service coinciding with the unfortunate summer surge as a Delta variant, I'm happy to say there are robust multilayered sales health and safety protocols work as designed to mitigate the introduction and transmission of COVID-19 aboard our vessels. The prevalence of cases we identified in preboarding testing, mid cruise and then a deep patient were inconsequential and well below what we all saw in the general population during this time. 
In short, we were able to fairly evaluate and fine-tune our rigorous protocols during one of the highest heights of the pandemic and the stellar results speak for themselves. Today, all ships in our fleet continue operating with a strict 100% vaccination requirement, coupled with universal pre-embarkation testing and multiple layers of additional protection once on board, including upgraded air fill fishing systems and well resourced medical centers. 
We will continue to follow the science and evaluate and modify our protocols as needed with guidance from our team of experts led by former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb and from applicable public health authorities. As I have said time and time again, our commitment to health and safety is far and away the most important principle that guides how our company operates at all levels. 
And not just now but pre- and post-pandemic as well, and we are willing to go to great lengths to protect our guests, crew and the communities we visit. Just last week, we were pleased to receive positive news from the CDC with a temporary extension of the framework for conditional sailing order through January 15, 2022, at which point the order will revert to a voluntary program. 
We view this as a positive step forward for our company and the industry at large, and we were encouraged to see positive recognition by the CDC of the successful resumption of cruising and the length we have all taken to enhance our already stringent health and safety protocols and respond to COVID-19, which continue to be much more rigorous and much more comprehensive than those implemented by any other travel, leisure or hospitality sector. 
With the progress society has met with vaccinations therapeutics and adapting to living in the ongoing pandemic environment, the worst is seemingly behind us. Each day, we become increasingly confident in our ability to flawlessly execute on our phased-voyage assumption, which is detailed by brand and by vessel on Slide 5. We continue to expect our full fleet to be back in operation by April 1, 2022. And with the steady and improving trajectory, we are well positioned for a projected return to pre-pandemic occupancy levels across our fleet no later than the beginning of the third quarter of 2022 and in time to capture peak summer season demand and pricing. While we expect to continue seeing some fits and starts as we ramp up our relaunch, we are keeping a close watch on port availability, travel restrictions and any other changes to the global public health environment, which could affect our return to service plans as we are ready to adapt accordingly. 
Turning to Slide 6. We shift today's discussion to our booking and demand trends. I am pleased to report that we continue to see robust future demand for cruising, particularly for sailings operating in the second half of 2022 and all of 2023 as evidenced by our record cumulative book position during these periods. You'll recall at the beginning of our third quarter, our book position for full year 2022 was meaningfully and significantly ahead of 2019's record levels and at higher pricing. 
However, and consistent with the pullback seen by the broader economy and in particular, the travel and leisure sector, the summer Delta variance surge resulted in a marked slowdown in our net booking volumes. The impact was heavily weighted to closer in sailings, particularly for fourth quarter 2021 and first quarter 2022, with the impact lessening sequentially throughout 2022 and beyond. 
Rather than chase scarce demand during the Delta surge by dropping prices and/or spending marketing funds in a less than optimal manner, we strategically chose to wait for consumer sentiment to rebound as we have seen direct ebbs and flows in our booking patterns throughout the pandemic, coinciding with changes in the public health environment. 
Throughout this difficult 10-week period, we remain disciplined and continue to hold or even raise pricing and the outcome is that today, we see both record load and record pricing for the second half of 2022 and for all of 2023. We are intently focused on the long-term brand positioning and profitability of the company and are simply not willing to sacrifice pricing in order to increase load factors in the upcoming transitional quarters. 
As has happened in past surges and as the COVID-19 situation recently improved, we have experienced a rebound in bookings with net booking volumes improving sequentially over the past 6 weeks. We believe this improvement will accelerate moving forward as first, our brands begin to ramp up their demand-generating marketing investments in mid-November, coinciding with Black Friday and suburb Monday promotion; and second, the much anticipated and expected recovery in the travel agent channel space. 
And lastly, the approval of vaccines for children ages 5 to 11, which came just last night and will allow for an expanded group of 100% back new guests, especially families to sale on our brand. Our go-to-market and full vaccination strategy has paid off and drove. 
And today, our full year 2022 load factor remains in line with 2019 record levels and at higher pricing even when including the dilutive impact of future cruise credits. In addition, we are meaningfully better booked for second half of '22 and full year '23 sailings and at better pricing than at any similar point in time in the past. Our primary focus continues to be on these periods when our fleet is expected to be in full operation and at normalized occupancy levels. 
And as I mentioned before, just in time to capture the all-important third quarter peak summer season, which traditionally is the most profitable quarter for the industry. Now breaking down our book position for full year 2022 further, more than 55% of bookings are from loyal repeat cruises to our brand. 
In addition, approximately 75% is comprised of new cash bookings with the remainder comprised of future cruise credits. So far, approximately 60% of the total value of our outstanding FCCs have been redeemed. As a reminder, the value-added 125% future cruise credits will issue -- that we issued at the beginning of the pandemic can only be applied to sailings through year-end 2022, resulting in zero yield dilution when we look to 2023 and beyond. 
And while still early, booking trends for 2023 as I hinted thus far, are also off to an impressive start. Our booking windows continue to be elongated versus historical levels with guests booking further into the future, particularly for the Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brand, Case in point, in August, Regent set a record for the largest booking day in his 29-year history with the launch of its 2023, 2024 voyage collection. Reservation surpassed its previous record by approximately 15%. 
And while all itineraries were popular, notable destinations of interest were Africa, Asia and the Baltics, demonstrating our guests continued appetite for long and exotic itineraries. And in September, the sales launch of just a single ships, Oceania Cruise's new 1,200 passenger Vista, which doesn't debut until April '23, set an all-time single-day booking record for that brand that surpassed the most recent record set in March of 2021 by nearly 60%. Half of the available inventory for Vista's inaugural season was sold in a single day with 30% of bookings coming from new to brand guests. 
These incredible record-breaking milestones are further proof of the exceptional demand we continue to experience for our brand's unique product offerings from both new and loyal guests alike. Strong future demand in both load factor and pricing is also empirically evident in our advanced ticket sales build. Our advanced ticket sales increased approximately $500 million on a gross basis in the quarter, equating to an approximately 65% increase versus the prior quarter's build. 
In addition, and more importantly, our cash advance ticket sales for sailings beginning in the second quarter of 2022 and beyond, are approximately 45% higher than at the same time for record year 2019. As we move forward with phasing in the rest of our fleet, we expect this tremendous momentum to continue sequentially. Looking to the future, 2022 will also mark an exciting new chapter for our company as we welcome the first ship in the next class of vessels for Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Prima in summer of 2022. 
I just returned from the shipyard in Italy a few weeks ago, while I was able to witness firsthand what an evolution Prima is for the Norwegian brand and for the industry at large, which you can see on Slide 7. Everything about her was impressive. She has been meticulously designed to elevate the guest experience. 
Last month, we unveiled Prima's entertainment lineup, including its interactive headline show, the Tony Award nominated Musical Summer, the Donna Summer Musical. Norwegian Prima will also showcase numerous cruise industry first and new-to-brand experiences, including the world's first transforming venue that converts a 3-story theater into a Vegas-style nightclub, exhilarating freefall drop-dry slide and a tri-level 1,200-foot long racetrack, the largest at see. 
The Prima Speedway will be the first-ever 3-level racetrack and is over 20% larger than that on Norwegian Encore, featuring 14 turns where drivers can reach speeds of nearly 40 miles per hour. Prima advanced sales continue to impress even after her record-shattering sales debut in May, which set a single best booking day and best initial booking week record, doubling the previous record set by Norwegian Bliss in 2018. And despite her introduction being 6 weeks later than Norwegian Bliss, her booking volumes are trending in line with that of Bliss, the previous fastest selling new builds for the line and at materially higher prices. As you can see on Slide 8, Norwegian Prima is just the first ship to look forward to in our industry-leading growth profile of 9 world-class ships coming online through 2027. 
These new builds will grow our birth count by approximately 40%, adding 24,000 additional births across our 3 brands. In 2023, when our fleet is back in full force, we expect our birth capacity to be approximately 20% higher than 2019's pre-endemic levels. The addition of these new cutting-edge ships will also favorably change our cabin mix, as illustrated on Slide 9, with premium cabins increasing to approximately 65% of total births versus approximately 60% today. 
In addition to the premium mix of real estate on board, our new ships of all the bells and whistles, additional streams for onboard revenue generation with new and innovative experiences and the latest technology to improve efficiency versus our existing fleet. Excitement around new ship is also a significant demand driver and a powerful engine to fuel future yields, EBITDA, cash flow and ROIC growth. It brings new guests to our brand, and it brings back repeat guests as well, helping us to appeal to every segment that we are targeting. And given our base of only 28 ships in our fleet, we are ready and eager to easily and profitably absorb this new capacity as it will allow us to further diversify our product offerings and penetrate numerous attractive and high potential unserved and underserved markets globally. 
The strategic addition of the Prima and Prima Plus Class, for example, which are smaller but more upscale than our previous breakaway and Breakaway Plus class at approximately 3,200 births for the first 2 Prima Class ships and increasing to nearly 3,600 births for the next 4 Prima Plus Class ships will give us additional bandwidth and flexibility to optimize the deployments that are most profitable and allow the line to continue commanding premium pricing with the right size shift in the right place and at the right time. 
And as Slide 10 shows we have historically demonstrated, our success in not only absorbing capacity, but translating this capacity growth into outsized revenue, outside adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow growth that significantly outpaces the growth in absolute capacity. We fully expect to continue this trend and drive meaningful growth to the top and bottom line with the addition of these exciting new ships. I'll be back here to provide an update on our ESG efforts as well as provide closing remarks. But for now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark?"
4180463,1686209724,2423038,"Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Frank. We reached a significant financial milestone in the third quarter with our first voyages resuming sailing after a previously unimaginable 500-plus days with zero revenue-generating operations. Our return to service has been very successf",1105,"Thank you, Frank. We reached a significant financial milestone in the third quarter with our first voyages resuming sailing after a previously unimaginable 500-plus days with zero revenue-generating operations. Our return to service has been very successful, and we remain on track to execute on our phased voyage resumption plan. By the end of the third quarter, we had started 37 voyages, completed 29 and had 8 ships in service, representing approximately 40% of our birth capacity. 
Occupancy in the third quarter was approximately 57%, in line with our expectations and reflecting our self-imposed occupancy limits. As we have outlined previously, we have taken a conservative approach to occupancy with our voyage resumption, which proved to be prudent with the rise of the Delta variant to ensure that health and safety remains our #1 priority. Increasing our occupancy is not a race, and we are focused on being diligent and thoughtful in ramping up of occupancy levels to protect not just our guests and crew, but also our long-term brand equity. Despite the reduced occupancy levels in the quarter, I am extremely happy to report that the fleet that operated in the period was cash flow positive. 
Looking ahead, by year-end, we expect to have 17 ships representing approximately 75% of capacity back in service with the full fleet operating as we enter the second quarter 2022. Turning to liquidity and cash flow on Slide 11. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents. In addition, earlier this week, we further enhanced the liquidity profile by entering into a $1 billion commitment through mid-August 2022. This liquidity backstop enhances our financial flexibility and provides immediate and additional liquidity should the need arise. 
If drawn, the commitment would convert into an unsecured note, maturing in April 2024. For sake of clarity, we have not drawn on this facility and do not intend to do so given our current projected recovery at this time. As for cash burn for the third quarter, our average monthly cash burn rate was approximately $275 million, lower than prior guidance of $285 million. For the fourth quarter, we expect our average monthly cash burn to increase to approximately $350 million as we continue to ramp up restart expenses and  [indiscernible] additional vessels reenter service. During the quarter, we are expecting a ramp-up of demand-generating marketing investments as we head into the holidays with Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Wave season. 
It is important to note that this cash burn estimate does not include our expected cash inflows from both new and existing bookings or the contribution from ships that have reentered service, both of which we expect to accelerate as we move forward. On a net basis, based on our current resumption plan, we continue to expect to reach a crucial inflection point with operating cash flow turning positive toward the tail end of the first quarter of 2022. 
In addition, based on our current trajectory and market conditions, we are on a solid path to return to profitability for the second half of 2022. Turning to Slide 12. Our cash balance in the third quarter decreased to $1.9 billion of cash and equivalents, driven by approximately $825 million of operating cash burn, including OpEx expenses, SG&A, interest and CapEx, customer cash refunds of approximately $115 million and net working capital and other inflows of approximately $125 million, which is net of health and safety investments and cash collections from current and future voyages. With 2022 now just around the corner, we have provided some additional guidance to assist with modeling for certain metrics on Slide 17, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, fuel consumption and capital expenditures. 
In addition, we have provided detail on our annual capacity growth expectations on Slide 18. As we gear up to deliver on our impressive growth profile through 2027, which we expect to be meaningfully accretive to both earnings and cash flow generation. Lastly, with much of the focus in the market on inflationary pressure, I wanted to touch quickly on what we are experiencing. We are still fine-tuning our 2022 plans and related projections, and we'll provide more color on our cost outlook on our next earnings call. 
However, similar to almost all other industries, we are seeing pockets of pressures in areas such as fuel, food and other commodities. Our supply chain group continues to work diligently to mitigate these costs, and we are fortunate that the timing of our ramp-up in operations is relieving some of the transitory cost pressures. The good news is that we are a primarily fixed cost business, which is beneficial in an inflationary environment. On the labor front, we have a high degree of visibility on our costs as the vast majority of our crew, which comprises the bulk of our employee base are covered under multiyear agreements. On the flip side, we are also seeing very strong pricing power, which is helping to offset inflationary pressure. 
Even with the pricing power we are seeing, cruise vacations continue to offer an incredibly compelling value proposition versus a land-based vacation alternative. We have said in the past that a cruise vacation typically offers at least 20% to 30% better value than a similar land-based alternative. With the current inflationary backdrop, and on a relative scale, we believe our offering and value proposition is even more compelling now than ever before. 
Without the same labor market pressures that many of our land-based peers are experiencing, we can provide a consistent and exceptional level of service for our guests, which is evidenced by our record high guest satisfaction scores since resuming sailing. These factors combined will continue to allow us to further increase our prices on our multiyear strategy to achieving pricing parity to that of land-based vacation offerings. 
Before handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate that while the global public health environment remains fluid, and we are not yet completely out of the woods, we are increasingly optimistic as we continue on our road to recovery. 
We are now in a position to pivot to a more offensive approach and shift our attention to executing on our medium- and long-term financial recovery plan, which is outlined on Slide 13. As part of this plan, we will remain focused on rebuilding our strong track record of financial performance, optimizing our balance sheet and delivering on our attractive and disciplined growth profile. I look forward to updating you on our progress in our next call. But for now, I'll hand the call back over to Frank to provide closing commentary. Frank?"

Before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain on Slide 14. We are committed to driving a positive impact on society and the environment through the advancement of this program. On the environmental front, in addition to ongoing initiatives to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions rate, during the quarter, we made the first purchase under our new carbon offset program. As a reminder, over the summer, we announced that we have committed to purchasing high-quality, verified carbon credits to offset the equivalent of 3 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide over a 3-year period. 
This is a measurable step in near-term emissions reductions, which will help bridge the gap in our decarbonization efforts until new technologies become feasible. Our 3 million-tonne  commitment is sizable, and we plan to increase offset purchases in future years to help us reach our goal of carbon neutrality. We also strive to maintain a supportive and empowering workplace for our team members across the globe who are without doubt our most valuable asset. 
As such, we recently announced that we have definitely moved to a 4:1 flexible work model for our shoreside team members globally, which requires employees to work in office Monday through Thursday and remotely on Friday. This new work model allows us to provide additional flexibility for our team members while also supporting our business goals, maintaining productivity and fostering the in-person collaboration and workplace culture that we are so proud of. We are honored that this commitment to our team was recognized with our naming to the Forbes World's Best Employers list. This recognition came after also being named to the Forbes America's Best Employers list earlier this year in which we ranked among the top 75 companies in the overall large employer category and among the top 10 companies in the travel and leisure sector. 
And while we are pleased with the progress we have made to date on our ESG efforts, we have no plans to stop here. We are committed to continuing to drive positive change and make a lasting impact on the world as responsible corporate citizens. In addition, we remain focused on enhancing disclosures around our ESG efforts to ensure transparency and accountability around this critical topic for our key stakeholders. And I look forward to sharing additional details with you as we continue on our ESG journey. 
Turning to Slide 15. I'd like to leave you with a few final key takeaways. First, our return to service is on track and initial voyages have been successful on all fronts. Our health and safety protocols are working as intended, and we are seeing strong onboard revenue and high guest satisfaction scores. We are increasingly confident in our ability to execute on our phased voyage resumption plan with a target to have our full fleet in operation by April 1 of next year. Despite headwinds in the third quarter related to the Delta variant, we continue to experience strong future demand for cruising with positive booking and pricing trends, particularly for the back half of 2022 and throughout 2023. 
And lastly, we believe we are nearing an inflection point with the worst of the pandemic now appearing to be behind us. Our future is bright, and we look forward to the next chain our company's storied history as we deliver on our industry-leading growth profile, which we expect will provide a meaningful boost to our financial results and shareholder value in the coming years. And with that, Laurie, let's open up for questions."

And so I don't see major changes in how we deploy our vessels in '22 and beyond, assuming even if the world reopens. Today, the world is in the process of reopening. As you know, Asia is still primarily closed. 
But we believe that by the time our next Asia season begins, which would be about this time in '22, that it will be open. We do have new vessels coming online, like I said, for over the next 2 years, and we're eager to take possession of those vessels. We said time and time again, we have many unserved and underserved markets because we only have a fleet of 28 vessels. So we're anxiously awaiting the receipt of those vessels, which we believe will be accretive to the yields and certainly EBITDA and ROIC and all the financial metrics. Turning to 2022. We have to start looking at '22 not as a year, not as a block but sequentially. Certainly, the back half of '22 today is looking much better than the first half, partly because of the effects of the Delta variant and on booking trends and consumer behavior will affect Q1 more than Q2 and Q2 more than Q3. 
But sequentially, 2022 is ramping up very, very nicely. We said in our prepared remarks, the back half of '22 today is meaningfully and significantly better booked than we were at this time for 2019 or any year. So we're way ahead in load and that gives us confidence to continue with the price discipline because today, not only do we have that meaningful load, but we're ahead in pricing. 
So I feel very, very good about 2022, and I can make the same identical remarks about '23. Ahead in load, meaningfully and ahead in pricing. Q2 is a -- what I would really call the pivot quarter. We see our demand coming back strongly for '22. But as you know, we're -- we still have -- by the end of the year, we'll have 17 ships in the water. That means that we're going to introduce 11 vessels between January 1 and April 1, those will be ramping up. And so second quarter will be a transition year, transitioning quarter where all the vessels will be in operation. But we look -- we feel very, very good about Q2 as well. So look, I'm feeling better than I have in nearly 2 years. Advanced bookings are strong. 
One of the wonderful things about this industry is that we have incredible visibility into the future. And because consumers are booking earlier than ever as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have visibility into -- further into the future than we ever have, and that visibility is a very positive one."

And as we continue in the first quarter, we'll have almost our entire fleet operational effectively by the end of the first quarter. 
So rather than look at occupancy, I think a better metric is looking at the number of passengers that we're carrying. I think in the third quarter, we had about 60,000 roughly passengers carried. That's going to increase to roughly 150,000, 175,000 in Q4. 250,000 or to 300,000 in Q1 and then you're up back into the 0.5 million. So our occupancy is ramping up in line with our fleet rollout. 
Pricing discipline is important to us. We've said time and time and again, we want to protect that. We want to protect the long-term brand equity. So we're going to do it in a thoughtful and rational manner rather than chasing that cheap customer just to gain that point of occupancy."

All I can tell you is the empirical evidence that we have based on bookings people are booking out booking further out than ever before. That's the combination of the fact that we have introduced iConcierge earlier than ever. So they're available for sale. 
Also people's -- the psyche of the consumer, they want a cruise, they want to travel, maybe they don't want to travel this quarter or maybe even next quarter and they're pushing it out further and further, hoping that the COVID situation improves drastically. So I do believe that we're going to continue having greater visibility than we've had in the past then that will continue for some time. 
In terms of onboard revenue, look, we see the consumer spending across lots of different sectors are up and it's no different onboard our vessels. As you know, we lead the industry by a very wide margin in onboard yield, onboard revenue yield and that continues. I cautioned in my prepared remarks that I'm not ready to declare victory in a sense that the very positive trends in onboard revenue higher than they've ever been before, will continue indefinitely and then you can put it in the permanent column because it's just too early. 
Is the reason why people are spending so much because of the pent-up demand. Is it because of cabin mix. We're at least in the third quarter, and you'll see it in the fourth quarter as well, slightly elevated percentage of our cabinets that have sold are in the upper categories, the suites, the balcony cabins. And one of the truisms of this business is those who pay more to get on board, pay or spend more once on board. But it also goes to the fundamental strength of our industry-leading bundling strategy. We believe in the bundling strategy. We're doing more and more bundling across the 3 brands and that gives people a very fresh wallet because the combination of them booking further out means they have even more time to refill that wallet and make it even fresher, if you will. 
And so all these factors are contributing to the higher onboard spend. I hope it continues. We'll do everything possible to fuel that continuation. But I just wanted to throw a little bit of caution to the win that I'm not ready to chalk it up as a permanent shift, if you will, or a permanent source of revenue above and beyond what we've always led the industry on."

There are some who have not yet recovered to their pre-great recession yields, a decade later. More than a decade later. So we're fixated on maintaining pricing. We'll sacrifice short-term load factors in order to preserve long-term pricing. 
And long-term pricing at the end of the day was going to drive margins, along with the fact that we're going to be introducing 4 vessels that our premium -- including the Norwegian new Prima vessels, more balcony cabins. We're increasing our percentage of the -- of our premium accommodations to 65%. 
And so all those factors, including the fact that we're getting -- we have gone a lot smarter during the pandemic about how we market to our customers using technologies. The so-called Zoom world, marketing is becoming more efficient. And we'll see whether the general inflation pressures that are being called transitory are transitory or not. 
But as Mark mentioned, we are primarily a fixed cost business. And during inflationary times, we come out ahead. And we're seeing it that we have pricing power. Pricing power is the pretty word of inflation. Yes, we have inflation pressures on some line items, as Mark mentioned, fuel, commodities, food, but we've got that pricing power that is translating into high yield.

And while we want to continue offering consumers that great value, which is why our ships are always full, the industry ships are always full, hotel chains can't say that their hotel rooms are always full, but we can because of the value proposition, the way we market, and therefore, that's where the opportunity is.

The children's vaccination for 5 to 11-year-olds were just announced yesterday. My understanding is that likely sometime in Q1, the same vaccination approval be given for up to 4 year olds. So I do believe that the target market that cruises is more likely than general population to, number one, be vaccinated. We see time and time again where a cruiser, a pass cruiser or one who intends to cruise is significantly more vaccinated than those who don't intend to cruise. 
So it's a bit of a self-selection situation. I believe that will translate also into children. But we're not going to sacrifice the health and safety of anyone for the sake of adding a point or 2 or 3 or whatever the number is to load.

And so I'm praying and hoping that they do come back in full force. But at the end of the day, we have to fill our vessels in any way we can. And we do offer consumers multiple choices of how to engage with us. We prefer the travel agency channel. It is our biggest channel. It is coming back. We've seen improvement sequentially quarter-by-quarter in terms of the percentage of our business that is being booked by travel agents. 
And I do believe that once our fleet is back in operation along with that of our peers, that they will come back. But if not, we have adapted. We are prepared. We have the technology. We have the wherewithal to take the bookings"

But we're seeing steady progress throughout the ecosystem, the Norwegian brand customer coming back and booking as they normally would book, except that for second half of '22 and in all of '23, that booking volume is better than ever. And so we're very pleased with that, that the demand is such that consumers want a cruise. And as I said earlier, everything else being equal, they feel more confident being able to cruise in Q3 of next year than in Q1, for example, because of the ever present threat of the -- of COVID. 
And as COVID starts to fade into the background, all the experts have said, COVID is not going to go away 1 day. It will pivot from being a pandemic to an epidemic and we'll all have to learn to live with it. We may have to take COVID-booster shots every year like the flu. But I do -- I am encouraged to see how in different parts of the world, and I traveled internationally for the first time in the last few weeks, went to Italy, went to the U.K., went to New York for the first time in almost 2 years, how people have adapted. And like I said earlier, the cruising population, the target cruiser is a better burst individual in the average population. 
They can afford to crews. They're better vaccinated. And so all those points, I'm encouraged that, again, the pandemic is not going to go away or the COVID is never going to disappear, but we will want to live with it."

And so yes, itineraries are a big deal.

It's going to take some time to do that, but we're focused on it. We've done it before. We know how to do it this management team. 
So we're confident we can get there. We have the ability in the business. In terms of the $1 billion commitment, look, I think as we look forward, I stated in my remarks that we're now going into a more offensive approach -- offensive approach around our balance sheet management. So what this does is this really is -- we look at it as a very low cost, but yet effective backstop rather than us having to necessarily go out and commit to permanent debt and/or permanent further dilution. So it is an extremely low cost measure to have on the books, which will allow us independently of that, to start taking some balance sheet action and not have to worry about the broader picture. 
So again, we do not intend to draw on it. Our intention is not to draw on it. We have the facility there, as part of our larger game plan. But in the event we need to draw on it or something in that nature, most likely or more than likely, we would go out to the public markets and go after some paper that is much more cost effective. So again, in balancing all of our needs, we think this provides a backstop without committing us for any long-term additional debt and/or dilution. 
And look, 1 additional thought is that we've seen what Delta does, and we want to make sure we're always in a position to be ahead of some of the unknown. So again, this is more of us going to an offensive approach in terms of our balance sheet on a go-forward basis."

And as always, I hope that all of you as well as your loved ones remain healthy and safe. 
Today, we will discuss commentary on 3 areas: first, the progress we have made on our great cruise come back; second, our recent booking and demand trends, which have shown particular strength for sailings operating in the second half of '22 and for all of 2023, when our fleet is expected to be back in full operation and at normalized occupancy levels. And finally, on our exciting pipeline of new vessels, which we expect to contribute outsized EBITDA growth and other important financial metric improvements. 
Slide 4 outlines how far we have come on our return to service plan. When we last spoke in early August, we had just relaunched the first vessel in our fleet, Norwegian Jade in Greece, and we're on the verge of resuming cruising in the U.S. with Norwegian Encore, making her West Coast debut, sailing to Alaska from Seattle.  
Since then, we have successfully relaunched 11 of our 28 vessels with all 3 of our award-winning brands resuming operations. We couldn't be more pleased with the performance of our relaunch ships. First, our crew has not missed a beat since returning, seamlessly adapting to our new health and safety protocols and going above and beyond to deliver the exceptional vacation experiences our brands are known for. This commitment to service has resulted in record high guest satisfaction scores with each month sequentially better than the month before. And second, we are seeing the power of our industry-leading bundling strategy pay off as guests are boarding our vessels with fresh wallets, which coupled with robust pent-up demands for all kinds of experiences is translating to remarkably strong onboard revenue generation.  
In fact, onboard revenue has exceeded our baseline expectations by over 20% with broad-based strength across all ships, region and revenue streams. While I would caution though, against extrapolating these figures as permanent, or indicative of steady-state future performance just yet. As there are several transitory factors that may be contributing to the elevated current levels, including pent-up demand, cabin and guest mix, it is nonetheless an encouraging and positive signal of the healthy consumer demand we are experiencing.  
Lastly and most importantly, these relaunch ships have already contributed positive cash flow in the third quarter, even with our self-imposed occupancy level caps. Despite of return to service coinciding with the unfortunate summer surge as a Delta variant, I'm happy to say there are robust multilayered SailSAFE health and safety protocols work as designed to mitigate the introduction and transmission of COVID-19 aboard our vessels. The prevalence of cases we identified in preboarding testing, mid cruise and then in [indiscernible] were inconsequential and well below what we all saw in the general population during this time.  
In short, we were able to fairly evaluate and fine-tune our rigorous protocols during one of the heights of the pandemic and the stellar results speak for themselves. Today, all ships in our fleet continue operating with a strict 100% vaccination requirement, coupled with universal pre-embarkation testing and multiple layers of additional protection once on board, including upgraded air filtration systems and well resourced medical centers.  
We will continue to follow the science and evaluate and modify our protocols as needed with guidance from our team of experts led by former FDA Commissioner  Dr. Scott Gottlieb and from applicable public health authorities. As I have said time and time again, our commitment to health and safety is far and away the most important principle that guides how our company operates at all levels.  
And not just now but pre- and post-pandemic as well, and we are willing to go to great lengths to protect our guests, crew and the communities we visit. Just last week, we were pleased to receive positive news from the CDC with a temporary extension of the framework for conditional sailing order through January 15, 2022, at which point the order will revert to a voluntary program.  
We view this as a positive step forward for our company and the industry at large, and we were encouraged to see positive recognition by the CDC of the successful resumption of cruising and the length we have all taken to enhance our already stringent health and safety protocols and respond to COVID-19, which continue to be much more rigorous and much more comprehensive than those implemented by any other travel, leisure or hospitality sector.  
With the progress society has made with vaccinations, therapeutics and adapting to living in the ongoing pandemic environment, the worst is seemingly behind us. Each day, we become increasingly confident in our ability to flawlessly execute on our phased voyage resumption, which is detailed by brand and by vessel on Slide 5. We continue to expect our full fleet to be back in operation by April 1, 2022. And with the steady and improving trajectory, we are well positioned for a projected return to pre-pandemic occupancy levels across our fleet no later than the beginning of the third quarter of 2022 and in time to capture peak summer season demand and pricing. While we expect to continue seeing some fits and starts as we ramp up our relaunch, we are keeping a close watch on port availability, travel restrictions and any other changes to the global public health environment, which could affect our return to service plans as we are ready to adapt accordingly.  
Turning to Slide 6. We shift today's discussion to our booking and demand trends. I am pleased to report that we continue to see robust future demand for cruising, particularly for sailings operating in the second half of 2022 and all of 2023 as evidenced by our record cumulative book position during these periods. You'll recall at the beginning of our third quarter, our book position for full year 2022 was meaningfully and significantly ahead of 2019's record levels and at higher pricing.  
However, and consistent with the pullback seen by the broader economy and in particular, the travel and leisure sector, the summer Delta variance surge resulted in a marked slowdown in our net booking volumes. The impact was heavily weighted to closer in sailings, particularly for fourth quarter 2021 and first quarter 2022, with the impact lessening sequentially throughout 2022 and beyond.  
Rather than chase scarce demand during the Delta surge by dropping prices and/or spending marketing funds in a less than optimal manner, we strategically chose to wait for consumer sentiment to rebound as we have seen direct ebbs and flows in our booking patterns throughout the pandemic, coinciding with the changes in the public health environment.  
Throughout this difficult 10-week period, we remain disciplined and continue to hold or even raise pricing and the outcome is that today, we see both record load and record pricing for the second half of 2022 and for all of 2023. We are intently focused on the long-term brand positioning and profitability of the company and are simply not willing to sacrifice pricing in order to increase load factors in the upcoming transitional quarters.  
As has happened in past surges and as the COVID-19 situation recently improved, we have experienced a rebound in bookings with net booking volumes improving sequentially over the past 6 weeks. We believe this improvement will accelerate moving forward as first, our brands begin to ramp up their demand-generating marketing investments in mid-November, coinciding with Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotion; and second, the much anticipated and expected recovery in the travel agent channel space.  
And lastly, the approval of vaccines for children ages 5 to 11, which came just last night and will allow for an expanded group of 100% vaccinated guests, especially families to sale on our brand. 
Our go-to-market and full vaccination strategy has paid off and drove. And today, our full year 2022 load factor remains in line with 2019 record levels and at higher pricing even when including the dilutive impact of future cruise credits. In addition, we are meaningfully better booked for second half of '22 and full year '23 sailings and at better pricing than at any similar point in time in the past. Our primary focus continues to be on these periods when our fleet is expected to be in full operation and at normalized occupancy levels. And as I mentioned before, just in time to capture the all-important third quarter peak summer season, which traditionally is the most profitable quarter for the industry. Now breaking down our book position for full year 2022 further, more than 55% of bookings are from loyal repeat cruises to our brand.  
In addition, approximately 75% is comprised of new cash bookings with the remainder comprised of future cruise credits. So far, approximately 60% of the total value of our outstanding FCCs have been redeemed. As a reminder, the value-added 125% future cruise credits will issue -- that we issued at the beginning of the pandemic can only be applied to sailings through year-end 2022, resulting in zero yield dilution when we look to 2023 and beyond.  
And while still early, booking trends for 2023 as I hinted thus far, are also off to an impressive start. Our booking windows continue to be elongated versus historical levels with guests booking further into the future, particularly for the Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brand, case in point, in August, Regent set a record for the largest booking day in its 29-year history with the launch of its 2023, 2024 Voyage Collection. Reservation surpassed its previous record by approximately 15%.  
And while all itineraries were popular, notable destinations of interest were Africa, Asia and the Baltics, demonstrating our guests continued appetite for long and exotic itineraries. And in September, the sales launch of just a single ship, Oceania Cruise's new 1,200 passenger Vista, which doesn't debut until April of '23, set an all-time single-day booking record for that brand that surpassed the most recent record set in March of 2021 by nearly 60%. Half of the available inventory for Vista's inaugural season was sold in a single day, with 30% of bookings coming from new-to-brand guests.  
These incredible record-breaking milestones are further proof of the exceptional demand we continue to experience for our brand's unique product offerings from both new and loyal guests alike. Strong future demand in both load, factor and pricing is also empirically evident in our advanced ticket sales build. Our advanced ticket sales increased approximately $500 million on a gross basis in the quarter, equating to an approximately 65% increase versus the prior quarter's build.  
In addition, and more importantly, our cash advance ticket sales for sailings beginning in the second quarter of 2022 and beyond, are approximately 45% higher than at the same time for the record year 2019. As we move forward with phasing in the rest of our fleet, we expect this tremendous momentum to continue sequentially. Looking to the future, 2022 will also mark an exciting new chapter for our company as we welcome the first ship in the next class of vessels for Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Prima in summer of 2022.  
I just returned from the shipyard in Italy a few weeks ago, while I was able to witness firsthand what an evolution Prima is for the Norwegian brand and for the industry at large, which you can see on Slide 7. Everything about her was impressive. As she has been meticulously designed to elevate the guest experience.  
Last month, we unveiled Prima's entertainment lineup, including its interactive headline show, the Tony Award nominated musical summer, the Donna Summer Musical. Norwegian Prima will also showcase numerous cruise industry first and new-to-brand experiences, including the world's first transforming venue that converts a 3-story theater into a Vegas-style nightclub, exhilarating freefall drop-dry slide and a tri-level 1,200-foot long racetrack, the largest at see.  
The Prima speedway will be the first-ever 3-level racetrack and is over 20% larger than that on Norwegian Encore, featuring 14 turns where drivers can reach speeds of nearly 40 miles per hour. Prima's advanced sales continue to impress even after her record-shattering sales debut in May, which set a single best booking day and best initial booking week record, doubling the previous record set by Norwegian Bliss in 2018. 
And despite her introduction being 6 weeks later than Norwegian Bliss, her booking volumes are trending in line with that of Bliss, the previous fastest selling new builds for the line and at materially higher prices. As you can see on Slide 8, Norwegian Prima is just the first ship to look forward to in our industry-leading growth profile of 9 world-class ships coming online through 2027.  
These new builds will grow our berth count by approximately 40%, adding 24,000 additional berths across our 3 brands. In 2023, when our fleet is back in full force, we expect our berth capacity to be approximately 20% higher than 2019's pre-endemic levels. The addition of these new cutting-edge ships will also favorably change our cabin mix, as illustrated on Slide 9, with premium cabins increasing to approximately 65% of total berths, versus approximately 60% today.  
In addition to the premium mix of real estate on board, our new ships have all the bells and whistles, additional streams for onboard revenue generation with new and innovative experiences and the latest technology to improve efficiency versus our existing fleet. Excitement around new ship is also a significant demand driver and a powerful engine to fuel future yields, EBITDA, cash flow and ROIC growth. It brings new guests to our brand, and it brings back repeat guests as well, helping us to appeal to every segment that we are targeting. And given our base of only 28 ships in our fleet, we are ready and eager to easily and profitably absorb this new capacity as it will allow us to further diversify our product offerings and penetrate numerous attractive and high potential unserved and underserved markets globally.  
The strategic addition of the Prima and Prima Plus Class, for example, which are smaller but more upscale than our previous Breakaway and Breakaway Plus Class at approximately 3,200 berths for the first 2 Prima Class ships and increasing to nearly 3,600 berths for the next 4 Prima Plus Class ships will give us additional bandwidth and flexibility to optimize the deployments that are most profitable and allow the line to continue commanding premium pricing with the right size shift in the right place and at the right time.  
And as Slide 10 shows we have historically demonstrated, our success in not only absorbing capacity, but translating this capacity growth into outsized revenue, outside adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow growth that significantly outpaces the growth in absolute capacity. We fully expect to continue this trend and drive meaningful growth to the top and bottom line with the addition of these exciting new ships. I'll be back here to provide an update on our ESG efforts as well as provide closing remarks. But for now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark?"

We reached a significant financial milestone in the third quarter with our first voyages resuming sailing after a previously unimaginable 500-plus days with zero revenue-generating operations. Our return to service has been very successful, and we remain on track to execute on our phased voyage resumption plan. By the end of the third quarter, we had started 37 voyages, completed 29 and had 8 ships in service, representing approximately 40% of our berth capacity.  
Occupancy in the third quarter was approximately 57%, in line with our expectations and reflecting our self-imposed occupancy limits. As we have outlined previously, we have taken a conservative approach to occupancy with our voyage resumption, which proved to be prudent with the rise of the Delta variant to ensure that health and safety remains our #1 priority. Increasing our occupancy is not a race, and we are focused on being diligent and thoughtful in ramping up of occupancy levels to protect not just our guests and crew, but also our long-term brand equity. Despite the reduced occupancy levels in the quarter, I am extremely happy to report that the fleet that operated in the period was cash flow positive.  
Looking ahead, by year-end, we expect to have 17 ships representing approximately 75% of capacity back in service with the full fleet operating as we enter the second quarter 2022. Turning to liquidity and cash burn on Slide 11. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents. In addition, earlier this week, we further enhanced our liquidity profile by entering into a $1 billion commitment through mid-August 2022. This liquidity backstop enhances our financial flexibility and provides immediate and additional liquidity should the need arise.  
If drawn, the commitment would convert into an unsecured note, maturing in April 2024. For sake of clarity, we have not drawn on this facility and do not intend to do so given our current projected recovery at this time. As for cash burn for the third quarter, our average monthly cash burn rate was approximately $275 million, lower than prior guidance of $285 million. For the fourth quarter, we expect our average monthly cash burn to increase to approximately $350 million as we continue to ramp up restart expenses and as this additional vessels reenter service. During the quarter, we are expecting a ramp-up of demand-generating marketing investments as we head into the holidays with Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Wave season.  
It is important to note that this cash burn estimate does not include our expected cash inflows from both new and existing bookings or the contribution from ships that have reentered service, both of which we expect to accelerate as we move forward. On a net basis, based on our current resumption plan, we continue to expect to reach a crucial inflection point with operating cash flow turning positive towards the tail end of the first quarter of 2022.  
In addition, based on our current trajectory and market conditions, we are on a solid path to return to profitability for the second half of 2022. Turning to Slide 12. Our cash balance in the third quarter decreased to $1.9 billion of cash and equivalents, driven by approximately $825 million of operating cash burn, including OpEx expenses, SG&A, interest and CapEx, customer cash refunds of approximately $115 million and net working capital and other inflows of approximately $125 million, which is net of health and safety investments and cash collections from current and future voyages. With 2022 now just around the corner, we have provided some additional guidance to assist with modeling for certain metrics on Slide 17, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, fuel consumption and capital expenditures.  
In addition, we have provided detail on our annual capacity growth expectations on Slide 18. As we gear up to deliver on our impressive growth profile through 2027, which we expect to be meaningfully accretive to both earnings and cash flow generation. Lastly, with much of the focus in the market on inflationary pressure, I wanted to touch quickly on what we are experiencing. We are still fine-tuning our 2022 plans and related projections, and we'll provide more color on our cost outlook on our next earnings call.  
However, similar to almost all other industries, we are seeing pockets of pressures in areas such as fuel, food and other commodities. Our supply chain group continues to work diligently to mitigate these costs, and we are fortunate that the timing of our ramp-up in operations is relieving some of the transitory cost pressures. The good news is that we are a primarily fixed cost business, which is beneficial in an inflationary environment. On the labor front, we have a high degree of visibility on our costs as the vast majority of our crew, which comprises the bulk of our employee base are covered under multiyear agreements. On the flip side, we are also seeing very strong pricing power, which is helping to offset inflationary pressure.  
Even with the pricing power we are seeing, cruise vacations continue to offer an incredibly compelling value proposition versus a land-based vacation alternative. We have said in the past that a cruise vacation typically offers at least 20% to 30% better value than a similar land-based alternative. With the current inflationary backdrop, and on a relative scale, we believe our offering and value proposition is even more compelling now than ever before.  
Without the same labor market pressures that many of our land-based peers are experiencing, we can provide a consistent and exceptional level of service for our guests, which is evidenced by our record high guest satisfaction scores since resuming sailing. These factors combined will continue to allow us to further increase our prices on our multiyear strategy to achieving pricing parity to that of land-based vacation offerings.  
Before handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate that while the global public health environment remains fluid, and we are not yet completely out of the woods, we are increasingly optimistic as we continue on our road to recovery.  
We are now in a position to pivot to a more offensive approach and shift our attention to executing on our medium- and long-term financial recovery plan, which is outlined on Slide 13. As part of this plan, we will remain focused on rebuilding our strong track record of financial performance, optimizing our balance sheet and delivering on our attractive and disciplined growth profile. I look forward to updating you on our progress in our next call. But for now, I'll hand the call back over to Frank to provide closing commentary. Frank?"

Before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail and Sustain on Slide 14. We are committed to driving a positive impact on society and the environment through the advancement of this program. On the environmental front, in addition to ongoing initiatives to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions rate, during the quarter, we made the first purchase under our new carbon offset program. As a reminder, over the summer, we announced that we have committed to purchasing high-quality, verified carbon credits to offset the equivalent of 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over a 3-year period.  
This is a measurable step in near-term emissions reductions, which will help bridge the gap in our decarbonization efforts until new technologies become feasible. Our 3 million-ton commitment is sizable, and we plan to increase offset purchases in future years to help us reach our goal of carbon neutrality. We also strive to maintain a supportive and empowering workplace for our team members across the globe who are without doubt our most valuable asset.  
As such, we recently announced that we have been definitely moved to a 4/1 flexible work model for our shoreside team members globally, which requires employees to work in office Monday through Thursday and remotely on Friday. This new work model allows us to provide additional flexibility for our team members while also supporting our business goals, maintaining productivity and fostering the in-person collaboration and workplace culture that we are so proud of. We are honored that this commitment to our team was recognized with our naming to the Forbes World's Best Employers list. This recognition came after also being named to the Forbes' America's Best Employers list earlier this year in which we ranked among the top 75 companies in the overall large employer category and among the top 10 companies in the travel and leisure sector.  
And while we are pleased with the progress we have made to date on our ESG efforts, we have no plans to stop here. We are committed to continuing to drive positive change and make a lasting impact on the world as responsible corporate citizens. In addition, we remain focused on enhancing disclosures around our ESG efforts to ensure transparency and accountability around this critical topic for our key stakeholders. And I look forward to sharing additional details with you as we continue on our ESG journey.  
Turning to Slide 15. I'd like to leave you with a few final key takeaways. First, our return to service is on track and initial voyages have been successful on all fronts. Our health and safety protocols are working as intended, and we are seeing strong onboard revenue and high guest satisfaction scores. We are increasingly confident in our ability to execute on our phased voyage resumption plan with a target to have our full fleet in operation by April 1 of next year. Despite headwinds in the third quarter related to the Delta variant, we continue to experience strong future demand for cruising with positive booking and pricing trends, particularly for the back half of 2022 and throughout 2023.  
And lastly, we believe we are nearing an inflection point with the worst of the pandemic now appearing to be behind us. Our future is bright, and we look forward to the next chapter in our company's storied history as we deliver on our industry-leading growth profile, which we expect will provide a meaningful boost to our financial results and shareholder value in the coming years. And with that, Laurie, let's open up for questions."

And so I don't see major changes in how we deploy our vessels in '22 and beyond, assuming even if the world reopens. Today, the world is in the process of reopening. As you know, Asia is still primarily closed.  
But we believe that by the time our next Asia season begins, which would be about this time in '22, that it will be open. We do have new vessels coming online, like I said, for over the next 2 years, and we're eager to take possession of those vessels. We said time and time again, we have many unserved and underserved markets because we only have a fleet of 28 vessels. So we're anxiously awaiting the receipt of those vessels, which we believe will be accretive to the yields and certainly EBITDA and ROIC and all the financial metrics. 
Turning to 2022. We have to start looking at '22 not as a year, not as a block but sequentially, certainly, the back half of '22 today is looking much better than the first half, partly because of the effects of the Delta variant and on booking trends and consumer behavior will affect Q1 more than Q2 and Q2 more than Q3.  
But sequentially, 2022 is ramping up very, very nicely. We said in our prepared remarks, the back half of '22 today is meaningfully and significantly better booked than we were at this time for 2019 or any year. So we're way ahead in load and that gives us confidence to continue with the price discipline because today, not only do we have that meaningful load, but we're ahead in pricing.  
So I feel very, very good about 2022, and I can make the same identical remarks about '23. Ahead in load, meaningfully, and ahead in pricing. Q2 is a -- what I would really call the pivot quarter. We see our demand coming back strongly for '22. But as you know, we're -- we still have -- by the end of the year, we'll have 17 ships in the water. That means that we're going to introduce 11 vessels between January 1 and April 1, and those will be ramping up. And so second quarter will be a transition year -- a transitioning quarter where all the vessels will be in operation. But we look -- we feel very, very good about Q2 as well. So look, I'm feeling better than I have in nearly 2 years. Advanced bookings are strong.  
One of the wonderful things about this industry is that we have incredible visibility into the future. And because consumers are booking earlier than ever as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have visibility into -- further into the future than we ever have, and that visibility is a very positive one."

And as we continue in the first quarter, we'll have almost our entire fleet operational effectively by the end of the first quarter.  
So rather than look at occupancy, I think a better metric is looking at the number of passengers that we're carrying. I think in the third quarter, we had about 60,000 roughly passengers carried. That's going to increase to roughly 150,000, 175,000 in Q4. 250,000 or to 300,000 in Q1 and then you're up back into the 0.5 million. So our occupancy is ramping up in line with our fleet rollout.  
Pricing discipline is important to us. We've said time and time and again, we want to protect that. We want to protect the long-term brand equity. So we're going to do it in a thoughtful and rational manner rather than chasing that cheap customer just to gain that point of occupancy."

All I can tell you is the empirical evidence that we have based on bookings people are booking out -- booking further out than ever before. That's the combination of the fact that we have introduced iConcierge earlier than ever. So they're available for sale. But people's -- the psyche of the consumer, they want to cruise, they want to travel, maybe they don't want to travel this quarter or maybe even next quarter and they're pushing it out further and further, hoping that the COVID situation improves drastically. So I do believe that we're going to continue having greater visibility than we've had in the past then that will continue for some time. 
In terms of onboard revenue, look, we see the consumer spending across lots of different sectors are up and it's no different onboard our vessels. As you know, we lead the industry by a very wide margin in onboard yield, onboard revenue yield and that continues. I cautioned in my prepared remarks that I'm not ready to declare victory in a sense that the very positive trends in onboard revenue higher than they've ever been before, will continue indefinitely and then you can put it in the permanent column because it's just too early. 
Is the reason why people are spending so much because of the pent-up demand. Is it because of cabin mix. We're at least in the third quarter, and you'll see it in the fourth quarter as well, slightly elevated percentage of our cabins that have sold are in the upper categories, the suites, the balcony cabins. And one of the truisms of this business is those who pay more to get on board, pay or spend more once on board. 
But it also goes to the fundamental strength of our industry-leading bundling strategy. We believe in the bundling strategy. We're doing more and more bundling across the 3 brands and that gives people a very fresh wallet because the combination of them booking further out means they have even more time to refill that wallet and make it even fresher, if you will. 
And so all these factors are contributing to the higher onboard spend. I hope it continues. We'll do everything possible to fuel that continuation. But I just wanted to throw a little bit of caution to the win that I'm not ready to chalk it up as a permanent shift, if you will, or a permanent source of revenue above and beyond what we've always led the industry on."

There are some who have not yet recovered to their pre-great recession yields, a decade later, or more than a decade later. So we're fixated on maintaining pricing. We'll sacrifice short-term load factors in order to preserve long-term pricing. 
And long-term pricing at the end of the day is what's going to drive margins, along with the fact that we're going to be introducing 4 vessels that our premium -- including the Norwegian new Prima vessels, more balcony cabins. We're increasing our percentage of the -- of our premium accommodations to 65%. 
And so all those factors, including the fact that we're getting -- we have gone a lot smarter during the pandemic about how we market to our customers using technologies. The so-called Zoom world, marketing is becoming more efficient. And we'll see whether the general inflation pressures that are being called transitory are transitory or not. 
But as Mark mentioned, we are primarily a fixed cost business. And during inflationary times, we come out ahead. And we're seeing it that we have pricing power. Pricing power is the pretty word of inflation. Yes, we have inflation pressures on some line items, as Mark mentioned, fuel, commodities, food, but we've got that pricing power that is translating into high yield.

I'm just wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit more. It seems like the most debatable vaccine demographic, so to speak, is obviously around kids, meaning that it seems a lot of parents are not going to get their kids vaccinated. So I guess the actual question here is once this CSO is eventually relaxed in January, do you see yourself starting to potentially relax that vaccine mandate for kids in order to get your load factors back to normal? Or that just won't be the case? And if that's not the case, maybe help us bridge that gap."

The children's vaccination, for 5- to 11-year-olds were just announced yesterday. My understanding is that likely sometime in Q1, the same vaccination approval be given for up to 4 year olds. So I do believe that the target market that cruise is, is more likely than general population to, number one, be vaccinated. We see time and time again where a cruiser, a past cruiser or one who intends to cruise is significantly more vaccinated than those who don't intend to cruise. 
So it's a bit of a self-selection situation. I believe that will translate also into children. But we're not going to sacrifice the health and safety of anyone for the sake of adding a point or 2 or 3 or whatever the number is to load. So we will continue mandating 100% vaccination as long as the science dictates that, that's what we ought to do."

But we're seeing steady progress throughout the ecosystem, the Norwegian brand customer coming back and booking as they normally would book, except that for second half of '22 and in all of '23, that booking volume is better than ever. And so we're very pleased with that, that the demand is such that consumers want to cruise. And as I said earlier, everything else being equal, they feel more confident being able to cruise in Q3 of next year than in Q1, for example, because of the ever present threat of the -- of COVID. 
And as COVID starts to fade into the background, all the experts have said, COVID is not going to go away in 1 day. It will pivot from being a pandemic to an epidemic and we'll all have to learn to live with it. We may have to take COVID-booster shots every year like the flu. But I do -- I am encouraged to see how in different parts of the world, and I traveled internationally for the first time in the last few weeks, went to Italy, went to the U.K., went to New York for the first time in almost 2 years, how people have adapted. 
And like I said earlier, the cruising population, the target cruiser is a better versed individual than the average population. They can afford to cruise. They're better vaccinated. And so all those points, I'm encouraged that, again, the pandemic is not going to go away or the COVID is never going to disappear, but we will learn to live with it."

And so yes, itineraries are a big deal.

It's going to take some time to do that, but we're focused on it. We've done it before. We know how to do it, this management team. So we're confident we can get there. We have the ability and the business. 
In terms of the $1 billion commitment, look, I think as we look forward, I stated in my remarks that we're now going into a more offensive approach -- offensive approach around our balance sheet management. So what this does is this really is -- we look at it as a very low cost, but yet effective backstop rather than us having to necessarily go out and commit to permanent debt and/or permanent further dilution. So it is an extremely low cost measure to have on the books, which will allow us independently of that, to start taking some balance sheet action and not have to worry about the broader picture. 
So again, we do not intend to draw on it. Our intention is not to draw on it. We have the facility there, as part of our larger game plan. But in the event we need to draw on it or something in that nature, most likely or more than likely, we would go out to the public markets and go after some paper that is much more cost effective. So again, in balancing all of our needs, we think this provides a backstop without committing us for any long-term additional debt and/or dilution. 
And look, one additional thought is that we've seen what Delta does, and we want to make sure we're always in a position to be ahead of some of the unknown. So again, this is more of us going to an offensive approach in terms of our balance sheet on a go-forward basis."

And as always, I hope that all of you as well as your loved ones remain healthy and safe. 
Today, we will discuss commentary on 3 areas: first, the progress we have made on our great cruise come back; second, our recent booking and demand trends, which have shown particular strength for sailings operating in the second half of '22 and for all of 2023, when our fleet is expected to be back in full operation and at normalized occupancy levels. And finally, on our exciting pipeline of new vessels, which we expect to contribute outsized EBITDA growth and other important financial metric improvements. 
Slide 4 outlines how far we have come on our return to service plan. When we last spoke in early August, we had just relaunched the first vessel in our fleet, Norwegian Jade in Greece, and we're on the verge of resuming cruising in the U.S. with Norwegian Encore, making her West Coast debut, sailing to Alaska from Seattle.  
Since then, we have successfully relaunched 11 of our 28 vessels with all 3 of our award-winning brands resuming operations. We couldn't be more pleased with the performance of our relaunch ships. First, our crew has not missed a beat since returning, seamlessly adapting to our new health and safety protocols and going above and beyond to deliver the exceptional vacation experiences our brands are known for. This commitment to service has resulted in record high guest satisfaction scores with each month sequentially better than the month before. And second, we are seeing the power of our industry-leading bundling strategy pay off as guests are boarding our vessels with fresh wallets, which coupled with robust pent-up demands for all kinds of experiences is translating to remarkably strong onboard revenue generation.  
In fact, onboard revenue has exceeded our baseline expectations by over 20% with broad-based strength across all ships, region and revenue streams. While I would caution though, against extrapolating these figures as permanent, or indicative of steady-state future performance just yet. As there are several transitory factors that may be contributing to the elevated current levels, including pent-up demand, cabin and guest mix, it is nonetheless an encouraging and positive signal of the healthy consumer demand we are experiencing.  
Lastly and most importantly, these relaunch ships have already contributed positive cash flow in the third quarter, even with our self-imposed occupancy level caps. Despite of return to service coinciding with the unfortunate summer surge as a Delta variant, I'm happy to say there are robust multilayered SailSAFE health and safety protocols work as designed to mitigate the introduction and transmission of COVID-19 aboard our vessels. The prevalence of cases we identified in preboarding testing, mid cruise and then in [indiscernible] were inconsequential and well below what we all saw in the general population during this time.  
In short, we were able to fairly evaluate and fine-tune our rigorous protocols during one of the heights of the pandemic and the stellar results speak for themselves. Today, all ships in our fleet continue operating with a strict 100% vaccination requirement, coupled with universal pre-embarkation testing and multiple layers of additional protection once on board, including upgraded air filtration systems and well resourced medical centers.  
We will continue to follow the science and evaluate and modify our protocols as needed with guidance from our team of experts led by former FDA Commissioner  Dr. Scott Gottlieb and from applicable public health authorities. As I have said time and time again, our commitment to health and safety is far and away the most important principle that guides how our company operates at all levels.  
And not just now but pre- and post-pandemic as well, and we are willing to go to great lengths to protect our guests, crew and the communities we visit. Just last week, we were pleased to receive positive news from the CDC with a temporary extension of the framework for conditional sailing order through January 15, 2022, at which point the order will revert to a voluntary program.  
We view this as a positive step forward for our company and the industry at large, and we were encouraged to see positive recognition by the CDC of the successful resumption of cruising and the length we have all taken to enhance our already stringent health and safety protocols and respond to COVID-19, which continue to be much more rigorous and much more comprehensive than those implemented by any other travel, leisure or hospitality sector.  
With the progress society has made with vaccinations, therapeutics and adapting to living in the ongoing pandemic environment, the worst is seemingly behind us. Each day, we become increasingly confident in our ability to flawlessly execute on our phased voyage resumption, which is detailed by brand and by vessel on Slide 5. We continue to expect our full fleet to be back in operation by April 1, 2022. And with the steady and improving trajectory, we are well positioned for a projected return to pre-pandemic occupancy levels across our fleet no later than the beginning of the third quarter of 2022 and in time to capture peak summer season demand and pricing. While we expect to continue seeing some fits and starts as we ramp up our relaunch, we are keeping a close watch on port availability, travel restrictions and any other changes to the global public health environment, which could affect our return to service plans as we are ready to adapt accordingly.  
Turning to Slide 6. We shift today's discussion to our booking and demand trends. I am pleased to report that we continue to see robust future demand for cruising, particularly for sailings operating in the second half of 2022 and all of 2023 as evidenced by our record cumulative book position during these periods. You'll recall at the beginning of our third quarter, our book position for full year 2022 was meaningfully and significantly ahead of 2019's record levels and at higher pricing.  
However, and consistent with the pullback seen by the broader economy and in particular, the travel and leisure sector, the summer Delta variance surge resulted in a marked slowdown in our net booking volumes. The impact was heavily weighted to closer in sailings, particularly for fourth quarter 2021 and first quarter 2022, with the impact lessening sequentially throughout 2022 and beyond.  
Rather than chase scarce demand during the Delta surge by dropping prices and/or spending marketing funds in a less than optimal manner, we strategically chose to wait for consumer sentiment to rebound as we have seen direct ebbs and flows in our booking patterns throughout the pandemic, coinciding with the changes in the public health environment.  
Throughout this difficult 10-week period, we remain disciplined and continue to hold or even raise pricing and the outcome is that today, we see both record load and record pricing for the second half of 2022 and for all of 2023. We are intently focused on the long-term brand positioning and profitability of the company and are simply not willing to sacrifice pricing in order to increase load factors in the upcoming transitional quarters.  
As has happened in past surges and as the COVID-19 situation recently improved, we have experienced a rebound in bookings with net booking volumes improving sequentially over the past 6 weeks. We believe this improvement will accelerate moving forward as first, our brands begin to ramp up their demand-generating marketing investments in mid-November, coinciding with Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotion; and second, the much anticipated and expected recovery in the travel agent channel space.  
And lastly, the approval of vaccines for children ages 5 to 11, which came just last night and will allow for an expanded group of 100% vaccinated guests, especially families to sale on our brand. 
Our go-to-market and full vaccination strategy has paid off and drove. And today, our full year 2022 load factor remains in line with 2019 record levels and at higher pricing even when including the dilutive impact of future cruise credits. In addition, we are meaningfully better booked for second half of '22 and full year '23 sailings and at better pricing than at any similar point in time in the past. Our primary focus continues to be on these periods when our fleet is expected to be in full operation and at normalized occupancy levels. And as I mentioned before, just in time to capture the all-important third quarter peak summer season, which traditionally is the most profitable quarter for the industry. Now breaking down our book position for full year 2022 further, more than 55% of bookings are from loyal repeat cruises to our brand.  
In addition, approximately 75% is comprised of new cash bookings with the remainder comprised of future cruise credits. So far, approximately 60% of the total value of our outstanding FCCs have been redeemed. As a reminder, the value-added 125% future cruise credits will issue -- that we issued at the beginning of the pandemic can only be applied to sailings through year-end 2022, resulting in zero yield dilution when we look to 2023 and beyond.  
And while still early, booking trends for 2023 as I hinted thus far, are also off to an impressive start. Our booking windows continue to be elongated versus historical levels with guests booking further into the future, particularly for the Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brand, case in point, in August, Regent set a record for the largest booking day in its 29-year history with the launch of its 2023, 2024 Voyage Collection. Reservation surpassed its previous record by approximately 15%.  
And while all itineraries were popular, notable destinations of interest were Africa, Asia and the Baltics, demonstrating our guests continued appetite for long and exotic itineraries. And in September, the sales launch of just a single ship, Oceania Cruise's new 1,200 passenger Vista, which doesn't debut until April of '23, set an all-time single-day booking record for that brand that surpassed the most recent record set in March of 2021 by nearly 60%. Half of the available inventory for Vista's inaugural season was sold in a single day, with 30% of bookings coming from new-to-brand guests.  
These incredible record-breaking milestones are further proof of the exceptional demand we continue to experience for our brand's unique product offerings from both new and loyal guests alike. Strong future demand in both load, factor and pricing is also empirically evident in our advanced ticket sales build. Our advanced ticket sales increased approximately $500 million on a gross basis in the quarter, equating to an approximately 65% increase versus the prior quarter's build.  
In addition, and more importantly, our cash advance ticket sales for sailings beginning in the second quarter of 2022 and beyond, are approximately 45% higher than at the same time for the record year 2019. As we move forward with phasing in the rest of our fleet, we expect this tremendous momentum to continue sequentially. Looking to the future, 2022 will also mark an exciting new chapter for our company as we welcome the first ship in the next class of vessels for Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Prima in summer of 2022.  
I just returned from the shipyard in Italy a few weeks ago, while I was able to witness firsthand what an evolution Prima is for the Norwegian brand and for the industry at large, which you can see on Slide 7. Everything about her was impressive. As she has been meticulously designed to elevate the guest experience.  
Last month, we unveiled Prima's entertainment lineup, including its interactive headline show, the Tony Award nominated musical summer, the Donna Summer Musical. Norwegian Prima will also showcase numerous cruise industry first and new-to-brand experiences, including the world's first transforming venue that converts a 3-story theater into a Vegas-style nightclub, exhilarating freefall drop-dry slide and a tri-level 1,200-foot long racetrack, the largest at see.  
The Prima speedway will be the first-ever 3-level racetrack and is over 20% larger than that on Norwegian Encore, featuring 14 turns where drivers can reach speeds of nearly 40 miles per hour. Prima's advanced sales continue to impress even after her record-shattering sales debut in May, which set a single best booking day and best initial booking week record, doubling the previous record set by Norwegian Bliss in 2018. 
And despite her introduction being 6 weeks later than Norwegian Bliss, her booking volumes are trending in line with that of Bliss, the previous fastest selling new builds for the line and at materially higher prices. As you can see on Slide 8, Norwegian Prima is just the first ship to look forward to in our industry-leading growth profile of 9 world-class ships coming online through 2027.  
These new builds will grow our berth count by approximately 40%, adding 24,000 additional berths across our 3 brands. In 2023, when our fleet is back in full force, we expect our berth capacity to be approximately 20% higher than 2019's pre-endemic levels. The addition of these new cutting-edge ships will also favorably change our cabin mix, as illustrated on Slide 9, with premium cabins increasing to approximately 65% of total berths, versus approximately 60% today.  
In addition to the premium mix of real estate on board, our new ships have all the bells and whistles, additional streams for onboard revenue generation with new and innovative experiences and the latest technology to improve efficiency versus our existing fleet. Excitement around new ship is also a significant demand driver and a powerful engine to fuel future yields, EBITDA, cash flow and ROIC growth. It brings new guests to our brand, and it brings back repeat guests as well, helping us to appeal to every segment that we are targeting. And given our base of only 28 ships in our fleet, we are ready and eager to easily and profitably absorb this new capacity as it will allow us to further diversify our product offerings and penetrate numerous attractive and high potential unserved and underserved markets globally.  
The strategic addition of the Prima and Prima Plus Class, for example, which are smaller but more upscale than our previous Breakaway and Breakaway Plus Class at approximately 3,200 berths for the first 2 Prima Class ships and increasing to nearly 3,600 berths for the next 4 Prima Plus Class ships will give us additional bandwidth and flexibility to optimize the deployments that are most profitable and allow the line to continue commanding premium pricing with the right size shift in the right place and at the right time.  
And as Slide 10 shows we have historically demonstrated, our success in not only absorbing capacity, but translating this capacity growth into outsized revenue, outside adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow growth that significantly outpaces the growth in absolute capacity. We fully expect to continue this trend and drive meaningful growth to the top and bottom line with the addition of these exciting new ships. I'll be back here to provide an update on our ESG efforts as well as provide closing remarks. But for now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark?"
4180463,1686209724,3214280,"Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Frank. We reached a significant financial milestone in the third quarter with our first voyages resuming sailing after a previously unimaginable 500-plus days with zero revenue-generating operations. Our return to service has been very successf",1106,"Thank you, Frank. We reached a significant financial milestone in the third quarter with our first voyages resuming sailing after a previously unimaginable 500-plus days with zero revenue-generating operations. Our return to service has been very successful, and we remain on track to execute on our phased voyage resumption plan. By the end of the third quarter, we had started 37 voyages, completed 29 and had 8 ships in service, representing approximately 40% of our berth capacity.  
Occupancy in the third quarter was approximately 57%, in line with our expectations and reflecting our self-imposed occupancy limits. As we have outlined previously, we have taken a conservative approach to occupancy with our voyage resumption, which proved to be prudent with the rise of the Delta variant to ensure that health and safety remains our #1 priority. Increasing our occupancy is not a race, and we are focused on being diligent and thoughtful in ramping up of occupancy levels to protect not just our guests and crew, but also our long-term brand equity. Despite the reduced occupancy levels in the quarter, I am extremely happy to report that the fleet that operated in the period was cash flow positive.  
Looking ahead, by year-end, we expect to have 17 ships representing approximately 75% of capacity back in service with the full fleet operating as we enter the second quarter 2022. Turning to liquidity and cash burn on Slide 11. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents. In addition, earlier this week, we further enhanced our liquidity profile by entering into a $1 billion commitment through mid-August 2022. This liquidity backstop enhances our financial flexibility and provides immediate and additional liquidity should the need arise.  
If drawn, the commitment would convert into an unsecured note, maturing in April 2024. For sake of clarity, we have not drawn on this facility and do not intend to do so given our current projected recovery at this time. As for cash burn for the third quarter, our average monthly cash burn rate was approximately $275 million, lower than prior guidance of $285 million. For the fourth quarter, we expect our average monthly cash burn to increase to approximately $350 million as we continue to ramp up restart expenses and as this additional vessels reenter service. During the quarter, we are expecting a ramp-up of demand-generating marketing investments as we head into the holidays with Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Wave season.  
It is important to note that this cash burn estimate does not include our expected cash inflows from both new and existing bookings or the contribution from ships that have reentered service, both of which we expect to accelerate as we move forward. On a net basis, based on our current resumption plan, we continue to expect to reach a crucial inflection point with operating cash flow turning positive towards the tail end of the first quarter of 2022.  
In addition, based on our current trajectory and market conditions, we are on a solid path to return to profitability for the second half of 2022. Turning to Slide 12. Our cash balance in the third quarter decreased to $1.9 billion of cash and equivalents, driven by approximately $825 million of operating cash burn, including OpEx expenses, SG&A, interest and CapEx, customer cash refunds of approximately $115 million and net working capital and other inflows of approximately $125 million, which is net of health and safety investments and cash collections from current and future voyages. With 2022 now just around the corner, we have provided some additional guidance to assist with modeling for certain metrics on Slide 17, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, fuel consumption and capital expenditures.  
In addition, we have provided detail on our annual capacity growth expectations on Slide 18. As we gear up to deliver on our impressive growth profile through 2027, which we expect to be meaningfully accretive to both earnings and cash flow generation. Lastly, with much of the focus in the market on inflationary pressure, I wanted to touch quickly on what we are experiencing. We are still fine-tuning our 2022 plans and related projections, and we'll provide more color on our cost outlook on our next earnings call.  
However, similar to almost all other industries, we are seeing pockets of pressures in areas such as fuel, food and other commodities. Our supply chain group continues to work diligently to mitigate these costs, and we are fortunate that the timing of our ramp-up in operations is relieving some of the transitory cost pressures. The good news is that we are a primarily fixed cost business, which is beneficial in an inflationary environment. On the labor front, we have a high degree of visibility on our costs as the vast majority of our crew, which comprises the bulk of our employee base are covered under multiyear agreements. On the flip side, we are also seeing very strong pricing power, which is helping to offset inflationary pressure.  
Even with the pricing power we are seeing, cruise vacations continue to offer an incredibly compelling value proposition versus a land-based vacation alternative. We have said in the past that a cruise vacation typically offers at least 20% to 30% better value than a similar land-based alternative. With the current inflationary backdrop, and on a relative scale, we believe our offering and value proposition is even more compelling now than ever before.  
Without the same labor market pressures that many of our land-based peers are experiencing, we can provide a consistent and exceptional level of service for our guests, which is evidenced by our record high guest satisfaction scores since resuming sailing. These factors combined will continue to allow us to further increase our prices on our multiyear strategy to achieving pricing parity to that of land-based vacation offerings.  
Before handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate that while the global public health environment remains fluid, and we are not yet completely out of the woods, we are increasingly optimistic as we continue on our road to recovery.  
We are now in a position to pivot to a more offensive approach and shift our attention to executing on our medium- and long-term financial recovery plan, which is outlined on Slide 13. As part of this plan, we will remain focused on rebuilding our strong track record of financial performance, optimizing our balance sheet and delivering on our attractive and disciplined growth profile. I look forward to updating you on our progress in our next call. But for now, I'll hand the call back over to Frank to provide closing commentary. Frank?"

Before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail and Sustain on Slide 14. We are committed to driving a positive impact on society and the environment through the advancement of this program. On the environmental front, in addition to ongoing initiatives to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions rate, during the quarter, we made the first purchase under our new carbon offset program. As a reminder, over the summer, we announced that we have committed to purchasing high-quality, verified carbon credits to offset the equivalent of 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over a 3-year period.  
This is a measurable step in near-term emissions reductions, which will help bridge the gap in our decarbonization efforts until new technologies become feasible. Our 3 million-ton commitment is sizable, and we plan to increase offset purchases in future years to help us reach our goal of carbon neutrality. We also strive to maintain a supportive and empowering workplace for our team members across the globe who are without doubt our most valuable asset.  
As such, we recently announced that we have been definitely moved to a 4/1 flexible work model for our shoreside team members globally, which requires employees to work in office Monday through Thursday and remotely on Friday. This new work model allows us to provide additional flexibility for our team members while also supporting our business goals, maintaining productivity and fostering the in-person collaboration and workplace culture that we are so proud of. We are honored that this commitment to our team was recognized with our naming to the Forbes World's Best Employers list. This recognition came after also being named to the Forbes' America's Best Employers list earlier this year in which we ranked among the top 75 companies in the overall large employer category and among the top 10 companies in the travel and leisure sector.  
And while we are pleased with the progress we have made to date on our ESG efforts, we have no plans to stop here. We are committed to continuing to drive positive change and make a lasting impact on the world as responsible corporate citizens. In addition, we remain focused on enhancing disclosures around our ESG efforts to ensure transparency and accountability around this critical topic for our key stakeholders. And I look forward to sharing additional details with you as we continue on our ESG journey.  
Turning to Slide 15. I'd like to leave you with a few final key takeaways. First, our return to service is on track and initial voyages have been successful on all fronts. Our health and safety protocols are working as intended, and we are seeing strong onboard revenue and high guest satisfaction scores. We are increasingly confident in our ability to execute on our phased voyage resumption plan with a target to have our full fleet in operation by April 1 of next year. Despite headwinds in the third quarter related to the Delta variant, we continue to experience strong future demand for cruising with positive booking and pricing trends, particularly for the back half of 2022 and throughout 2023.  
And lastly, we believe we are nearing an inflection point with the worst of the pandemic now appearing to be behind us. Our future is bright, and we look forward to the next chapter in our company's storied history as we deliver on our industry-leading growth profile, which we expect will provide a meaningful boost to our financial results and shareholder value in the coming years. And with that, Laurie, let's open up for questions."

And so I don't see major changes in how we deploy our vessels in '22 and beyond, assuming even if the world reopens. Today, the world is in the process of reopening. As you know, Asia is still primarily closed.  
But we believe that by the time our next Asia season begins, which would be about this time in '22, that it will be open. We do have new vessels coming online, like I said, for over the next 2 years, and we're eager to take possession of those vessels. We said time and time again, we have many unserved and underserved markets because we only have a fleet of 28 vessels. So we're anxiously awaiting the receipt of those vessels, which we believe will be accretive to the yields and certainly EBITDA and ROIC and all the financial metrics. 
Turning to 2022. We have to start looking at '22 not as a year, not as a block but sequentially, certainly, the back half of '22 today is looking much better than the first half, partly because of the effects of the Delta variant and on booking trends and consumer behavior will affect Q1 more than Q2 and Q2 more than Q3.  
But sequentially, 2022 is ramping up very, very nicely. We said in our prepared remarks, the back half of '22 today is meaningfully and significantly better booked than we were at this time for 2019 or any year. So we're way ahead in load and that gives us confidence to continue with the price discipline because today, not only do we have that meaningful load, but we're ahead in pricing.  
So I feel very, very good about 2022, and I can make the same identical remarks about '23. Ahead in load, meaningfully, and ahead in pricing. Q2 is a -- what I would really call the pivot quarter. We see our demand coming back strongly for '22. But as you know, we're -- we still have -- by the end of the year, we'll have 17 ships in the water. That means that we're going to introduce 11 vessels between January 1 and April 1, and those will be ramping up. And so second quarter will be a transition year -- a transitioning quarter where all the vessels will be in operation. But we look -- we feel very, very good about Q2 as well. So look, I'm feeling better than I have in nearly 2 years. Advanced bookings are strong.  
One of the wonderful things about this industry is that we have incredible visibility into the future. And because consumers are booking earlier than ever as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have visibility into -- further into the future than we ever have, and that visibility is a very positive one."

And as we continue in the first quarter, we'll have almost our entire fleet operational effectively by the end of the first quarter.  
So rather than look at occupancy, I think a better metric is looking at the number of passengers that we're carrying. I think in the third quarter, we had about 60,000 roughly passengers carried. That's going to increase to roughly 150,000, 175,000 in Q4. 250,000 or to 300,000 in Q1 and then you're up back into the 0.5 million. So our occupancy is ramping up in line with our fleet rollout.  
Pricing discipline is important to us. We've said time and time and again, we want to protect that. We want to protect the long-term brand equity. So we're going to do it in a thoughtful and rational manner rather than chasing that cheap customer just to gain that point of occupancy."

All I can tell you is the empirical evidence that we have based on bookings people are booking out -- booking further out than ever before. That's the combination of the fact that we have introduced iConcierge earlier than ever. So they're available for sale. But people's -- the psyche of the consumer, they want to cruise, they want to travel, maybe they don't want to travel this quarter or maybe even next quarter and they're pushing it out further and further, hoping that the COVID situation improves drastically. So I do believe that we're going to continue having greater visibility than we've had in the past then that will continue for some time. 
In terms of onboard revenue, look, we see the consumer spending across lots of different sectors are up and it's no different onboard our vessels. As you know, we lead the industry by a very wide margin in onboard yield, onboard revenue yield and that continues. I cautioned in my prepared remarks that I'm not ready to declare victory in a sense that the very positive trends in onboard revenue higher than they've ever been before, will continue indefinitely and then you can put it in the permanent column because it's just too early. 
Is the reason why people are spending so much because of the pent-up demand. Is it because of cabin mix. We're at least in the third quarter, and you'll see it in the fourth quarter as well, slightly elevated percentage of our cabins that have sold are in the upper categories, the suites, the balcony cabins. And one of the truisms of this business is those who pay more to get on board, pay or spend more once on board. 
But it also goes to the fundamental strength of our industry-leading bundling strategy. We believe in the bundling strategy. We're doing more and more bundling across the 3 brands and that gives people a very fresh wallet because the combination of them booking further out means they have even more time to refill that wallet and make it even fresher, if you will. 
And so all these factors are contributing to the higher onboard spend. I hope it continues. We'll do everything possible to fuel that continuation. But I just wanted to throw a little bit of caution to the win that I'm not ready to chalk it up as a permanent shift, if you will, or a permanent source of revenue above and beyond what we've always led the industry on."

There are some who have not yet recovered to their pre-great recession yields, a decade later, or more than a decade later. So we're fixated on maintaining pricing. We'll sacrifice short-term load factors in order to preserve long-term pricing. 
And long-term pricing at the end of the day is what's going to drive margins, along with the fact that we're going to be introducing 4 vessels that our premium -- including the Norwegian new Prima vessels, more balcony cabins. We're increasing our percentage of the -- of our premium accommodations to 65%. 
And so all those factors, including the fact that we're getting -- we have gone a lot smarter during the pandemic about how we market to our customers using technologies. The so-called Zoom world, marketing is becoming more efficient. And we'll see whether the general inflation pressures that are being called transitory are transitory or not. 
But as Mark mentioned, we are primarily a fixed cost business. And during inflationary times, we come out ahead. And we're seeing it that we have pricing power. Pricing power is the pretty word of inflation. Yes, we have inflation pressures on some line items, as Mark mentioned, fuel, commodities, food, but we've got that pricing power that is translating into high yield.

But I can tell you that all the internal analysis that we do, when you combine the cost -- the total cost of a vacation, transportation, accommodations, your meals, your drinks, entertainment in any location, a cruise vacation's value is just off the charts. And while we want to continue offering consumers that great value, which is why our ships are always full, the industry ships are always full, hotel chains can't say that their hotel rooms are always full, but we can because of the value proposition, the way we market, and therefore, that's where the opportunity is. The opportunity is to claw back some of that value that we're giving away and still provide consumers with a very attractive vacation experience."

I'm just wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit more. It seems like the most debatable vaccine demographic, so to speak, is obviously around kids, meaning that it seems a lot of parents are not going to get their kids vaccinated. So I guess the actual question here is once this CSO is eventually relaxed in January, do you see yourself starting to potentially relax that vaccine mandate for kids in order to get your load factors back to normal? Or that just won't be the case? And if that's not the case, maybe help us bridge that gap."

I think that today, that continues to be a competitive advantage to our 3 brands, I think that our 3 brands emerge from this COVID crisis in a much better standing in the consumer's eyes because of our strong early stands on health and safety, vaccinations, et cetera, and it's something we want to build on. 
The children's vaccination, for 5- to 11-year-olds were just announced yesterday. My understanding is that likely sometime in Q1, the same vaccination approval be given for up to 4 year olds. So I do believe that the target market that cruise is, is more likely than general population to, number one, be vaccinated. We see time and time again where a cruiser, a past cruiser or one who intends to cruise is significantly more vaccinated than those who don't intend to cruise. 
So it's a bit of a self-selection situation. I believe that will translate also into children. But we're not going to sacrifice the health and safety of anyone for the sake of adding a point or 2 or 3 or whatever the number is to load. So we will continue mandating 100% vaccination as long as the science dictates that, that's what we ought to do."

But at the end of the day, we have to fill our vessels in any way we can. And we do offer consumers multiple choices of how to engage with us. We prefer the travel agency channel. It is our biggest channel. It is coming back. We've seen improvement sequentially quarter-by-quarter in terms of the percentage of our business that is being booked by travel agents.

And so we do have more visibility into -- especially into 2023 on the Oceania and the Regent brands than we do in Norwegian. 
But we're seeing steady progress throughout the ecosystem, the Norwegian brand customer coming back and booking as they normally would book, except that for second half of '22 and in all of '23, that booking volume is better than ever. And so we're very pleased with that, that the demand is such that consumers want to cruise. And as I said earlier, everything else being equal, they feel more confident being able to cruise in Q3 of next year than in Q1, for example, because of the ever present threat of the -- of COVID. 
And as COVID starts to fade into the background, all the experts have said, COVID is not going to go away in 1 day. It will pivot from being a pandemic to an epidemic and we'll all have to learn to live with it. We may have to take COVID-booster shots every year like the flu. But I do -- I am encouraged to see how in different parts of the world, and I traveled internationally for the first time in the last few weeks, went to Italy, went to the U.K., went to New York for the first time in almost 2 years, how people have adapted. 
And like I said earlier, the cruising population, the target cruiser is a better versed individual than the average population. They can afford to cruise. They're better vaccinated. And so all those points, I'm encouraged that, again, the pandemic is not going to go away or the COVID is never going to disappear, but we will learn to live with it."

By the time we get to Q4 of '22 and you start sailing to exotic places throughout Asia, South America. We believe that by then, the closures that we are seeing today will abate. And so yes, itineraries are a big deal. It's one of the secret sauce ingredients that make our company the highest yielding company because we go to high-yielding itineraries with wonderful vessels that have a lot of cabins that are with balconies and Suites which, as I said many times, is the second driver of yield after itineraries.

It's going to take some time to do that, but we're focused on it. We've done it before. We know how to do it, this management team. So we're confident we can get there. We have the ability and the business. 
In terms of the $1 billion commitment, look, I think as we look forward, I stated in my remarks that we're now going into a more offensive approach -- offensive approach around our balance sheet management. So what this does is this really is -- we look at it as a very low cost, but yet effective backstop rather than us having to necessarily go out and commit to permanent debt and/or permanent further dilution. So it is an extremely low cost measure to have on the books, which will allow us independently of that, to start taking some balance sheet action and not have to worry about the broader picture. 
So again, we do not intend to draw on it. Our intention is not to draw on it. We have the facility there, as part of our larger game plan. But in the event we need to draw on it or something in that nature, most likely or more than likely, we would go out to the public markets and go after some paper that is much more cost effective. So again, in balancing all of our needs, we think this provides a backstop without committing us for any long-term additional debt and/or dilution. 
And look, one additional thought is that we've seen what Delta does, and we want to make sure we're always in a position to be ahead of some of the unknown. So again, this is more of us going to an offensive approach in terms of our balance sheet on a go-forward basis."
