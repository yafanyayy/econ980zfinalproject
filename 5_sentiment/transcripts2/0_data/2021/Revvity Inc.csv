A year ago, I started my prepared remarks talking about how 2019 was a seminal year for PerkinElmer. And I had no doubt that the positive changes we had completed would become increasingly apparent to external stakeholders in the quarters and years ahead. 
Looking back now, it is hard to believe how much has changed in such a short period of time. From where we stand today, looking back on 2020, we are a more collaborative and cohesive organization. We've reduced red tape, promoted cross-functional collaboration and struck a cord with employees that has resulted in our launching of several breakthrough innovations. 
The energy and purpose that pervaded throughout 2020 was inspirational. Our collective mission to improve lives propelled us as we rallied together to respond to the call to action to help. All while making sure that we did not lose sight of our 4 guiding principles that we highlighted at the onset of the pandemic; keeping our employees and company safe, utilizing our expansive capabilities to join in the fight against COVID-19, serving our customers with excellence during this difficult period and emerging from this crisis a stronger company. 
I could spend the next hour highlighting the countless examples of employees who went above and beyond in 2020. However, instead, I will take a moment to thank them and their families personally. Many did not receive the spotlight they duly deserved, but their tremendous sacrifices did not go unnoticed by us nor our customers. They each personify our mission and I could not be prouder to be working alongside them and the rest of our 14,000 colleagues on a daily basis. Their efforts in 2020 embolden PerkinElmer's place in the world. PerkinElmer has been and continues to be a fundamental player in the fight against the global COVID-19 pandemic. 
However, as I have said before, we do what we do because we are passionate about helping people. It's personal. Our COVID-19 response is just 1 example of the power of our company. We are a multifaceted and multitalented organization. As we look ahead, one thing for certain, we will emerge as a stronger organization. We are a leading global diagnostics brand. We are an exemplary global citizen, a thought leader, a strategic partner, which does what right and puts the worthy cause of achieving breakthroughs in health care and science first. Most of all, we have learned a lot over the past year, honed our collective skills and develop capabilities that we, as an organization, didn't have a year ago. That's why even when the pandemic subsides and we are operating in the new normal, things will never be the same. We have earned a seat at the table by clearly demonstrating we are leaders in the fight for making the world better and safer. And I truly hope that, that is what you take away from today's call. 
In terms of the fourth quarter and full year financials, Jamie will detail our results in a few minutes. But at a high level, I'm very proud of our performance throughout 2020. Fourth quarter results far surpass the guidance we communicated on the third quarter earnings call. We delivered the best quarter of organic growth and profitability since the creation of the modern day PerkinElmer in 1999. And from a cash standpoint, we generated more cash in the quarter than all of 2019. 
For the full year, the team delivered 29% organic growth including over $1 billion in COVID revenue, adjusted operating margin expansion of over 1,100 basis points, greater than 100% adjusted EPS growth and in excess of $800 million in free cash flow generation. That being said, while the headline financial performance is certainly impressive, it is important to also not lose sight of the fact that we aided more than 1,000 new diagnostics customers in their efforts to combat the pandemic. We shipped more than 25 million COVID-19 PCR tests, expanded our schematic installed base 3x to over 1,600 instruments worldwide and launched best-in-class solutions, such as our Explorer workstation, which boasts unparalleled sample throughput and set up flexibility. 
We also invested back into the company. We spent an incremental $25 million in people and digital capabilities and invested more than $200 million in R&D to ensure that we continue to build a robust pipeline of new products across a full suite of technologies. Inorganically, we are deploying approximately $800 million in capital, adding new and exciting assets to the PerkinElmer family, including Horizon Discovery, which uniquely positions us to propel cell and gene research forward through our combined screening and genomics solution and also Oxford Immunotec. And we gave back. As a thank you for their incredible efforts, we gave a year-end organization-wide bonus to our employees, and we ceded our PerkinElmer Foundation to serve as a charitable matching vehicle for future donations that are near and dear to our employees' hearts. 
While the fourth quarter and full year financial results are certainly impressive, we have many accomplishments beyond the headline financial numbers to be proud of. Most of all, we have always and will continue to do what is right and lead with science. This is what our customers trust us to do, and this is what we expect of ourselves. As we transition to 2021, you can expect that we will continue to lead with science and deliver on our 4 strategic priorities while executing against the value creation framework we outlined during our December virtual life sciences deep dive as well as during our recent presentation at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in January. 
In terms of our strategic priorities, our goals remain the same in 2021 on the customer front. We aim to go above and beyond for them while owning their trust as a true strategic partner. I mentioned earlier that we had made significant headway in enhancing the customer experience last year and we seek to further build on that momentum this year. To that end, we launched our new global commercial function last month which will support all 3 regions in a strategic and agile way. 
Miriam Victor was recently appointed Chief Commercial Officer to manage our global commercial organization. She has done a phenomenal job as the General Manager of our EMEA region over the past 2 years. By centralizing our commercial efforts, we hope to further qualify our go-to-market strategy across all segments and geographies as well as promote collaboration and democratize best practices across the organization. On talent and culture, we plan to accelerate our employee engagement and brand advocacy efforts in 2021. While we are proud to have one of the lowest voluntary turnover rates in the industry, there is certainly more we can do to improve our most valuable resource, our people. In 2021, we plan to elicit feedback on our recent efforts through employee satisfaction service to ensure that we have the right programs in place to be certain that our employees are happy and fulfilled professionally. 
On the transformational innovation front, while 2020 was an extremely successful year in terms of new product development, there were a lot of behind the scenes learning as well as we push the R&D organization harder than ever to respond to the rapidly evolving needs of our customers. In 2021, our aim is to build on the NPI introduction successes of 2020, while also democratizing prior learnings and institutionalizing process improvements, so that we can continue to optimize our R&D engine for the years ahead. 
Within operational excellence, as we continue to scale our company, every function increasingly plays a role in making PerkinElmer more efficient and agile. Operational excellence is a muscle that all PerkinElmer employees need to hone. Whether it be R&D, manufacturing, operations of cash collection, we are constantly looking across the organization at ways to improve our operational ligor. And given we're in the early innings of this effort, there's lots we can do. 
In 2021, expect that we will continue to march ahead, focusing heavily on quality, quote to delivery and cash collection. And from the perspective of leading with science, we will continue in 2021 to listen to our customers, keenly track scientific advancements and challenge our teams to think about ways we can uniquely tackle the scientific challenges of today and tomorrow. For example, think back to a year ago, there wasn't as much focus on the diagnostic nuances between humoral and cell-mediated immune response. In a post COVID world, we are firm believers that there will be an increased research and clinical focus on developing diagnostics for infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, or cancer that look at the patient's humoral and cell-mediated response to disease. 
EUROIMMUN recognized the importance early on in 2020 and invested in their own T cell assays. However, as it became more apparent to us that this is where science is likely headed, we, as an organization, proactively quoted Oxford Immunotec to enhance our expertise and accelerate our capabilities on this front. This is just 1 example, but I think it is an informative 1 in that it touches on both our focus to be at the tip of the spear of science as well as our agility in being able to respond quickly to evolving market dynamics as we see them play out. 
Before I make some closing comments, I wanted to thank and congratulate Bryan. As you know, one of our strategic priorities is talent and culture. Bryan Kipp is an exceptional talent that joined PerkinElmer 2 years ago, and I'm proud of the work he has done in reshaping our Investor Relations function over this time. He recently accepted a new internal role that will result in him transitioning out of his current Investor Relations responsibilities. I could not be more excited for him and I have no doubt he will do a phenomenal job in his next chapter at PerkinElmer. 
In closing, I'll end where I started. It is astounding to think about PerkinElmer's progress over the past year. We truly are a different organization. Though our guiding mission remains our North Star, innovating for a healthier world. We have earned the right to lead in key areas with the greatest impact on health and science and have built the internal momentum in esteem with our customers and partners to continue to do so. I'm inspired and humbled by our team, and I couldn't be more excited for the opportunities that lie ahead. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jamie."

To start I echo Prahlad's remarks. And as I've reiterated throughout 2020, I could not be prouder of our team and how they collectively responded to address the needs of our customers and society during these unprecedented times. 
I have no doubt our shared learnings position the organization well as we aim to tackle the challenges of tomorrow. Before turning to the financial results, I want to remind everyone that our fourth quarter earnings call presentation has been posted on the Investors section of our website under financial information. 
I will begin my prepared remarks by highlighting the fourth quarter. Then I'll provide some additional color on our served end markets and financial metrics, and I will end with a quick look back on our 2020 results and our 2021 guidance. At a high level, we are extremely pleased with our record fourth quarter and full year results. The organization executed remarkably well throughout 2020 despite an extremely difficult macroeconomic backdrop. And as we look ahead, the continued sequential improvement in our customer engagement and business activity during the fourth quarter positions us well as we turn the fiscal calendar to 2021. 
During the fourth quarter, adjusted revenue grew 68% to $1.36 billion, compared to last year and included a 3% foreign exchange and negligible acquisition tailwind. Organic revenue grew 65%, 2 percentage points better than what we previously communicated. Overall, COVID related products and services contributed $549 million in the quarter, propelled primarily by our PCR tests and RNA extraction solutions, as well as our turnkey lab and lab testing solutions in the state of California and the United Kingdom. In total, excluding the impact of our labs, our PCR and RNA extraction products contributed over $300 million of COVID revenue during the fourth quarter. 
By business, diagnostics, representing 63% of total sales increased 172% organically. Strength in our immunodiagnostics and applied genomics businesses more than offset the improving but ongoing modest declines in our reproductive health franchise. Discovery and analytical solutions, representing 37% of total sales, declined 2% organically, as strength in our life science business was offset by more muted demand conditions in food and applied end markets. 
On a geographic basis, Americas grew strong double digits, Europe grew triple digits, and Asia Pacific grew low single digits. China remained in negative territories, though improved sequentially. Early signs point to a healthy rebound in our China business as we advance into 2021. Operationally, we are extremely pleased with our performance this quarter. Adjusted operating margins expanded approximately 1,800 basis points to 42%, led by volume leverage, business mix and productivity programs. 
Adjusted earnings per share of $3.96 in the fourth quarter nearly tripled versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Looking further into key drivers within our segments, let's start with our diagnostics business. As mentioned in my earlier remarks, organic revenue increased 172% as robust growth in Europe and the Americas drove the momentum. Our applied genomics business led the way, posting over 420% growth on broad-based momentum across all geographies, with strength in our nucleic acid extraction, liquid handling and sample prep product lines. Nucleic acid extraction and automated liquid handling grew over 12x and 7x, respectively, versus the fourth quarter of 2019. And as Prahlad recently mentioned, we installed over 1,000 systems and 600 Genius liquid handlers in 2020. Both platforms have gained share and positioned our applied genomics business well as we eventually transition to a post COVID world. 
Meanwhile, immunodiagnostics growth increased over 250%, with growing over 20%. Demand for our portfolio of RT-PCR assays remain particularly strong across the globe and serology demand was consistent on a sequential basis. Reproductive health declined low single digits organically, driven by lower newborn and prenatal testing in Asia Pacific and Europe. Americas newborn increased mid-single digits, while Europe and Asia Pacific declined high single and double digits, respectively. Birthrate pressures globally remain a headwind. However, early signs point to improved underlying demand trends. 
Turning to Discovery and Analytical Solutions. Organic revenue declined 2% in the fourth quarter versus the same period last year. By end market, we experienced mid single-digit organic revenue growth in life science. Pharma biotech was up mid-single digits, driven by strength in enterprise, up double digits and discovery up high single digits. Academic and government increased double digits, driven by nearly 20% growth in our discovery franchise. Applied markets declined approximately 10%, with Americas down over 20%. Normalizing for the tough cannabis comparison in the quarter, applied declined mid-single digits, which we think is a more useful data point when evaluating the underlying demand trend across our applied franchise. 
Food declined over 20% in the quarter. However, excluding cannabis, food declined 12% with dynamics consistent across all 3 major geographic regions. Meizheng, Solus and Bioo all improved sequentially, which is an encouraging sign that food safety testing momentum is improving across the globe. Meanwhile, industrial and environmental safety declined mid-single digits, continuing the trend of improved sequential momentum since demand trough during the second quarter. 
Another positive sign for the applied franchise as we look ahead, is that our year-end applied backlog increased double digits year-over-year. Shifting to below the line items. Adjusted net interest and other expense for the fourth quarter was approximately $11 million, and our adjusted tax rate was 20%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $2 billion of debt and $400 million of cash. Adjusted free cash flow was $471 million in the quarter, which resulted in an adjusted free cash flow conversion rate of 105%. Finally, we exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 1.2x, down over a turn and a half since the beginning of the year. 
Closing the books in 2020, we are extremely pleased with our overall performance, including 29% organic growth, 102% adjusted earnings per share growth and 159% adjusted free cash flow growth all compared to 2019. Adjusted free cash flow conversion was 89%, up from 70% the prior year. The DSO reduction has been a function of process improvements, as well as improved monthly linearity in terms due to COVID demand. We remain encouraged by our free cash flow progress and are confident that we are well positioned to deliver consistent adjusted free cash flow conversion of at least 85% for the foreseeable future. 
Turning to guidance. While the pandemic continues to create uncertainty, we thought it would be helpful to provide a baseline for how we are planning our business in 2021. In total, we anticipate revenue of at least $4.08 billion. Embedded in this guidance, we assume COVID revenues will be at least flat with 2020, and we expect underlying dynamics to improve for our non-COVID portfolio as we progress through the year, translating to full year non-COVID organic growth of approximately 5% to 7%. These assumptions do not account for any incremental lockdowns and/or any COVID related disruptions as well as any potential catch-ups related to pent-up demand. 
Additionally, we are anticipating 2% benefit from both foreign exchange and acquisitions for the full year. In total, this baseline implies an organic growth range of 3% to 5%. And on the bottom line, we anticipate adjusted earnings per share of at least $8.50, which assumes approximately $40 million in adjusted interest and other expenses, a tax rate of 20% to 21%, and our average diluted share count to be in the range of $112 million to $113 million. 
For the first quarter, we are forecasting reported revenue of approximately $1.19 billion, representing 77% organic revenue growth and including a 3% benefit from foreign exchange and 3% from acquisitions. Embedded in this guidance is $500 million of COVID related revenue and organic growth of 1% to 3% for our non-COVID product lines. There are 2 additional factors to keep in mind for top line modeling purposes. First, the extra week during 2020 fell during the first quarter. As a reminder, we estimated that the extra week contributed $11 million of revenue. So that headwind is embedded in our 1% to 3% non-COVID growth guidance. And second, we generated approximately $12 million in COVID revenue in 1Q '20. So one needs to adjust for that amount in the prior year baseline when forecasting the incremental dollar growth for the non-COVID portfolio. 
In terms of adjusted earnings per share guidance for the quarter, we are forecasting at least $3, which assumes approximately $11 million of interest and other expenses, a 22% tax rate and a diluted share count of $112 million to $113 million. All of this is detailed in the second to last page of our fourth quarter earnings presentation. 
In closing, 2020 was one of the most important years in PerkinElmer's long and storied history. I have no doubt, we are better positioned as an organization exiting 2020. We are excited for what is ahead, how we will better serve our customers and perform for all of our stakeholders. 
Before I hand it over to the operator, I also want to thank Bryan. For all his work leading and guiding our Investor Relations efforts over the past 2 years, he was instrumental in our strategic evolution, and a stage proponent of increased transparency for all of our stakeholders. I'm excited for him as he transitions to a new role with us in the coming weeks, and I'm glad he remains a part of the PerkinElmer family. 
Operator, at this time, we would like to open the call to questions."

The COVID diagnostics, at least flat, given that you guys are doing 500 in Q1. So I'm curious with the U.K. and California contracts, does it make sense for a pretty steep drop off from our Q1 levels.

So I'll start with COVID as it pertains to the guide. Obviously, we said at least flat year-over-year. And I'd say, predicting the course of COVID has not been easy nor do we anticipate it to be easy over the next 12 months. There are certainly some variables that could make it more than this. But let me talk about it in a couple of ways. One is the sequence through the year, which gets to your question, about $500 million in the first quarter. And then the labs versus kind of the rest of the COVID revenue piece. So in terms of the sequence, obviously, we have much better visibility, certainly to the first quarter and the first half. And our assumption in this guidance is that the vaccine kicks in and that the second half revenue and testing comes down substantially. And you can see that by evidence that almost 50% of the revenue is here in the first quarter. So we feel like that's a conservative assumption, but one that we are confident in. As it pertains to the split between core versus labs in 2020, core made up approximately 80% of the revenue, and we're predicting that, that will make up approximately 60% of the revenue. And conversely, the labs, which made up about 20% of the revenue in 2020, will step up and be a greater contributor in 2021 to be about 40%. And so I think we're assuming that starting in the first quarter here we're expecting the testing levels on the core to come back down in the level of instruments that we sell, et cetera, to kind of match what we saw probably in the third quarter. And then as it pertains to the labs, we've got a couple of variables at play. First is in the U.K., our contract only is valid through the end of March. So we're not yet sure whether it will be extended beyond March. We haven't been told yet. We're obviously talking to them about that now. So this guidance assumes that the U.K. finishes at the end of the first quarter, and there is no revenue assumed in the second quarter and beyond. And then California, as you've seen, is a slow and steady ramp. So it's public information. We've ramped from almost no testing at the beginning of November. And now we're probably about 20,000 tests per week, but there's numerous sites throughout the state of California that they're trying to bring into the program and so -- but those are slow and steady. So we expect California to ramp up here, but it's not nearly as fast as we think. And so therefore, we've taken a pretty conservative assumption in the first half year as well and then tailors back down in the second half as well. So overall, a lot of variables in play, Vijay, we're trying to set a floor here that says we think we can be at least flat. It's very much front-end loaded here, and there's certainly some potential for upside here, and our supply chain can certainly deal with it as we have done since in 2020."

So on the non COVID side, the first quarter, I think the comp is at minus 3%, not a minus 7%. The rest of China was the one that was impacted the most. I think China was down over 30% in the first quarter last year. The rest of Europe and Americas was quite strong in the first quarter, which blended to down 3%. And so if you look at our 1% to 3% guidance here in the first quarter, that embeds the extra week, which is the equivalent of probably 2 percentage points. So it's more like a 3% to 5% guide. And we've seen a slow and steady uptick here. So second quarter of last year was where we troughed. We had, I think, minus 14% on the core book. Third quarter, we had minus 6%. This past quarter, we had minus 3% with a couple of difficult comps in there. So we continue to see this trend up. As it pertains to the 5% to 7% overall for the year, obviously, we'll probably see the largest growth from an organic growth rate perspective in the second quarter due to the comp, and then it will start to normalize in the back half of the year."

Overall, obviously, we're guiding at least $8.50, which is up $0.20. The COVID overall revenue is flat, as we mentioned, and then the core growth kicks in. So we probably get about $0.60 of increase due to the volume and then we're reinvesting that back into OpEx. I'll talk to overall gross margin. So gross margin, we're expecting to be flat year-over-year. That has some assumptions that the COVID pricing and margin starts to dilute a little bit. And then our core book as we work on our productivity programs as well as have more volume leverage kicks in, and that keeps gross margin overall flat. And then we will continue to reinvest into OpEx here. So we started that towards the second half of last year. We're going to continue to do that. I would say we have a very flexible, variable cost -- overall cost base. So we can toggle this on and off with the level of growth that we have. We want to continue to do so, and we'll make the investments that we always have been, both in our talent, R&D, digital, et cetera. 
In terms of progression through the year, obviously, with a more material COVID first half, the margin rates will be much more substantial. And then in the second half, it will be our assumption is that it comes down and we start to accrete off that 2019 platform. So you mentioned Tyco's conference, and we laid out a 2023 game plan to be 23% or better. We certainly have not lost sight that this business overall can be 25% plus. And we will start to grow margins here in the back half of this year from a productivity programs perspective and extra volumes. So I'd look at 2019 levels towards the back half of that year and add some productivity to it, and that's what we expect there."

And so -- but we've seen a steady, as I mentioned earlier, Dan, we've seen a steady increase quarter-over-quarter. So if you -- as I mentioned, we went up about 6 points each quarter and 3 points in the fourth quarter. But if you normalize some things, probably a little bit more. And so overall, we feel very confident that the 5 to 7 is an achievable number here. And we're -- could there be a scenario that this is better than that? Yes.

I think EUROIMMUN was slightly positive across the globe in the fourth quarter when you exclude their COVID sales. So it's not yet perfectly normalized here, and I think that's why we're showing kind of a slow and steady uptick here. But certainly, if it returns to norm and if it's faster and we have some pent-up demand, we'll see it, but it should be much -- it should be greater than 5% to 7%."

One of the clear goals that you've articulated since taking the helm as CEO has been to better integrate acquisitions, the sales force. And R&D organizations across the company. We've seen some clear progress on that front. I was curious if you could just provide a bit more detail on how you see Oxford and Horizon filling into the strategy -- or I should say, fitting into the strategy? And what are some examples of areas where you can leverage capabilities to accelerate growth for both of these deals?"

I think the way what we've done and the reason it has worked for us so far is we have always integrated our acquisitions right rather than heavy or light or appropriately. And I think maybe I can talk a lot more around horizon than on Oxford because we haven't closed on Oxford. But as you think through it, right, the give you 1 example. Horizon has a group of strategic account managers with pharma that are very well penetrated and a lot of the business flow through comes from them. So in this case, for us, it's more of a reverse integration. Just to give you an example. Where we can build on that core competency that horizon has around strategic account managers, specifically in pharma and biotech. And use them and add our assays and imaging and detection portfolio and discovery portfolio to that bag. So for us, what is more critical is to look at the opportunity that -- look at the target that we are integrating and see where there are opportunities. And most of our focus right now has gone around commercial synergies and technology synergies. And obviously, Jamie and I both have talked earlier about the whole aspect around how we bring in our automation expertise, for example, with Oxford. So that will play a role. That doesn't mean that we don't have the cost synergies or the corporate opportunity of -- the cost opportunities around corporate costs. But for us, the focus is primarily around commercial and technology synergies."

Food has been a more challenging market to understand here and see what will happen. We're assuming some kind of rebound here in 2021, but not gangbusters. So I would say it's up mid-single digits as well. And so that could be an area that provides additional growth versus our current guide."

And also, keep in mind that most of the team there was focused on ensuring that the California and the U.K. labs are get up and running. So our focus has shifted because they sort of were the nucleus of ensuring that these labs take off and we execute flawlessly. From a reproductive health perspective, our assumption, I think going into it is low single digits for the year. We continue to see -- we've seen continued pressure on both rates for the past few years. But again, as I've said earlier, that's not sustainable. So our assumption on that is probably flat to low single-digit decline on both rates, but compensating that with menu expansion and some of the new NPIs that we've talked about, ion is being one of them, I think, SMA and DMD, right? So that's sort of our thinking around reproductive."

So as this moves forward and as pooling starts to play a role around RT-PCR, we already have an EUA approved assay for symptomatically symptomatic. Outside of that, Dan, as you look at rapid antigen testing, our intent is to bring out a test there, which has a high level of sense and spec. Because the idea really is that you don't want to be in your low 80s or late 70s in terms of sense and spec when you want to release that test. And that's why we have not been the first one to the game, but I feel very confident that when we come out with one, the sensitivity and specificity of the test will be compelling enough for it to gain rapid traction.

A year ago, I started my prepared remarks talking about how 2019 was a seminal year for PerkinElmer, and I had no doubt that the positive changes we had completed would become increasingly apparent to external stakeholders in the quarters and years ahead.
Looking back now, it is hard to believe how much has changed in such a short period of time. From where we stand today, looking back on 2020, we are a more collaborative and cohesive organization. We've reduced red tape, promoted cross-functional collaboration and struck a chord with employees that has resulted in our launching of several breakthrough innovations.
The energy and purpose that pervaded throughout 2020 was inspirational. Our collective mission to improve lives propelled us as we rallied together to respond to the call to action to help, all while making sure that we did not lose sight of our 4 guiding principles that we highlighted at the onset of the pandemic: keeping our employees and company safe, utilizing our expansive capabilities to join in the fight against COVID-19, serving our customers with excellence during this difficult period and emerging from this crisis a stronger company.
I could spend the next hour highlighting the countless examples of employees who went above and beyond in 2020. However, instead, I will take a moment to thank them and their families personally. Many did not receive the spotlight they duly deserved, but their tremendous sacrifices did not go unnoticed by us nor our customers. They each personify our mission, and I could not be prouder to be working alongside them and the rest of our 14,000 colleagues on a daily basis. Their efforts in 2020 embolden PerkinElmer's place in the world.  
PerkinElmer has been and continues to be a fundamental player in the fight against the global COVID-19 pandemic. However, as I have said before, we do what we do because we are passionate about helping people. It's personal. Our COVID-19 response is just 1 example of the power of our company. We are a multifaceted and multitalented organization.
As we look ahead, one thing is for certain, we will emerge as a stronger organization. We are a leading global diagnostics brand. We are an exemplary global citizen, a thought leader, a strategic partner, which does what's right and puts the worthy cause of achieving breakthroughs in health care and science first.
Most of all, we have learned a lot over the past year, honed our collective skills and developed capabilities that we, as an organization, didn't have a year ago. That's why even when the pandemic subsides and we are operating in the new normal, things will never be the same. We have earned a seat at the table by clearly demonstrating we are leaders in the fight for making the world better and safer. And I truly hope that, that is what you take away from today's call.
In terms of the fourth quarter and full year financials, Jamey will detail our results in a few minutes. But at a high level, I'm very proud of our performance throughout 2020. Fourth quarter results far surpass the guidance we communicated on the third quarter earnings call. We delivered the best quarter of organic growth and profitability since the creation of the modern day PerkinElmer in 1999. And from a cash standpoint, we generated more cash in the quarter than all of 2019.
For the full year, the team delivered 29% organic growth including over $1 billion in COVID revenue, adjusted operating margin expansion of over 1,100 basis points, greater than 100% adjusted EPS growth and in excess of $800 million in free cash flow generation.
That being said, while the headline financial performance is certainly impressive, it is important to also not lose sight of the fact that we aided more than 1,000 new diagnostics customers in their efforts to combat the pandemic. We shipped more than 25 million COVID-19 PCR tests, expanded our chemagic installed base 3x to over 1,600 instruments worldwide and launched best-in-class solutions, such as our explorer workstation, which boasts unparalleled sample throughput and set up flexibility.
We also invested back into the company. We spent an incremental $25 million in people and digital capabilities, and invested more than $200 million in R&D to ensure that we continue to build a robust pipeline of new products across a full suite of technologies.
Inorganically, we are deploying approximately $800 million in capital, adding new and exciting assets to the PerkinElmer family, including Horizon Discovery, which uniquely positions us to propel cell and gene research forward through our combined screening and genomics solution and also Oxford Immunotec.
And we gave back. As a thank you for their incredible efforts, we gave a year-end organization-wide bonus to our employees, and we ceded our PerkinElmer Foundation to serve as a charitable matching vehicle for future donations that are near and dear to our employees' hearts.
While the fourth quarter and full year financial results are certainly impressive, we have many accomplishments beyond the headline financial numbers to be proud of. Most of all, we have always and will continue to do what is right and lead with science. This is what our customers trust us to do, and this is what we expect of ourselves. As we transition to 2021, you can expect that we will continue to lead with science and deliver on our 4 strategic priorities while executing against the value creation framework we outlined during our December virtual life sciences deep dive as well as during our recent presentation at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in January.
In terms of our strategic priorities, our goals remain the same in 2021 on the customer front. We aim to go above and beyond for them while owning their trust as a true strategic partner. I mentioned earlier that we had made significant headway in enhancing the customer experience last year and we seek to further build on that momentum this year. To that end, we launched our new global commercial function last month, which will support all 3 regions in a strategic and agile way.
Miriame Victor was recently appointed Chief Commercial Officer to manage our global commercial organization. She has done a phenomenal job as the General Manager of our EMEA region over the past 2 years. By centralizing our commercial efforts, we hope to further codify our go-to-market strategy across all segments and geographies as well as promote collaboration and democratize best practices across the organization.
On talent and culture, we plan to accelerate our employee engagement and brand advocacy efforts in 2021. While we are proud to have one of the lowest voluntary turnover rates in the industry, there is certainly more we can do to improve our most valuable resource, our people. In 2021, we plan to elicit feedback on our recent efforts through employee satisfaction service to ensure that we have the right programs in place to be certain that our employees are happy and fulfilled professionally.
On the transformational innovation front, while 2020 was an extremely successful year in terms of new product development, there were a lot of behind the scenes learning as well as we pushed the R&D organization harder than ever to respond to the rapidly evolving needs of our customers. In 2021, our aim is to build on the NPI introduction successes of 2020, while also democratizing prior learnings and institutionalizing process improvements, so that we can continue to optimize our R&D engine for the years ahead.
Within operational excellence, as we continue to scale our company, every function increasingly plays a role in making PerkinElmer more efficient and agile. Operational excellence is a muscle that all PerkinElmer employees need to hone. Whether it be R&D, manufacturing, operations or cash collection, we are constantly looking across the organization at ways to improve our operational rigor. And given we're in the early innings of this effort, there's lots we can do.
In 2021, expect that we will continue to march ahead, focusing heavily on quality, quote to delivery and cash collection. And from the perspective of leading with science, we will continue in 2021 to listen to our customers, keenly track scientific advancements and challenge our teams to think about ways we can uniquely tackle the scientific challenges of today and tomorrow.
For example, think back to a year ago, there wasn't as much focus on the diagnostic nuances between humoral and cell-mediated immune response. In a post-COVID world, we are firm believers that there will be an increased research and clinical focus on developing diagnostics for infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders or cancer that look at the patient's humoral and cell-mediated response to disease.
EUROIMMUN recognized the importance early on in 2020 and invested in their own T cell assays. However, as it became more apparent to us that this is where science is likely headed, we, as an organization, proactively quoted Oxford Immunotec to enhance our expertise and accelerate our capabilities on this front. This is just 1 example, but I think it is an informative one and that it touches on both our focus to be at the tip of the spear of science as well as our agility in being able to respond quickly to evolving market dynamics as we see them play out.
Before I make some closing comments, I wanted to thank and congratulate Bryan. As you know, one of our strategic priorities is talent and culture. Bryan Kipp is an exceptional talent that joined PerkinElmer 2 years ago, and I'm proud of the work he has done in reshaping our Investor Relations function over this time. He recently accepted a new internal role that will result in him transitioning out of his current Investor Relations responsibilities. I could not be more excited for him, and I have no doubt he will do a phenomenal job in his next chapter at PerkinElmer.
In closing, I'll end where I started. It is astounding to think about PerkinElmer's progress over the past year. We truly are a different organization, though our guiding mission remains our North Star, innovating for a healthier world. We have earned the right to lead in key areas with the greatest impact on health and science and have built the internal momentum and esteem with our customers and partners to continue to do so. I'm inspired and humbled by our team, and I couldn't be more excited for the opportunities that lie ahead.
I'll now turn the call over to Jamey."

I have no doubt our shared learnings position the organization well as we aim to tackle the challenges of tomorrow.
Before turning to the financial results, I want to remind everyone that our fourth quarter earnings call presentation has been posted on the Investors section of our website under financial information.
I will begin my prepared remarks by highlighting the fourth quarter, then I'll provide some additional color on our served end markets and financial metrics, and I will end with a quick look back on our 2020 results and our 2021 guidance.
At a high level, we are extremely pleased with our record fourth quarter and full year results. The organization executed remarkably well throughout 2020 despite an extremely difficult macroeconomic backdrop. And as we look ahead, the continued sequential improvement in our customer engagement and business activity during the fourth quarter positions us well as we turn the fiscal calendar to 2021.
During the fourth quarter, adjusted revenue grew 68% to $1.36 billion compared to last year and included a 3% foreign exchange and negligible acquisition tailwind. Organic revenue grew 65%, 2 percentage points better than what we previously communicated. Overall, COVID-related products and services contributed $549 million in the quarter, propelled primarily by our PCR tests and RNA extraction solutions as well as our turnkey Lab-In-A-Lab testing solutions in the state of California and the United Kingdom. In total, excluding the impact of our labs, our PCR and RNA extraction products contributed over $300 million of COVID revenue during the fourth quarter.
By business, diagnostics, representing 63% of total sales, increased 172% organically. Strength in our immunodiagnostics and applied genomics businesses more than offset the improving but ongoing modest declines in our reproductive health franchise. Discovery and analytical solutions, representing 37% of total sales, declined 2% organically, as strength in our life science business was offset by more muted demand conditions in food and applied end markets.
On a geographic basis, Americas grew strong double digits, Europe grew triple digits, and Asia Pacific grew low single digits. China remained in negative territory, though improved sequentially. Early signs point to a healthy rebound in our China business as we advance into 2021.
Operationally, we are extremely pleased with our performance this quarter. Adjusted operating margins expanded approximately 1,800 basis points to 42%, led by volume leverage, business mix and productivity programs. Adjusted earnings per share of $3.96 in the fourth quarter nearly tripled versus the fourth quarter of 2019.
Looking further into key drivers within our segments, let's start with our diagnostics business. As mentioned in my earlier remarks, organic revenue increased 172% as robust growth in Europe and the Americas drove the momentum. Our applied genomics business led the way, posting over 420% growth on broad-based momentum across all geographies, with strength in our nucleic acid extraction, liquid handling and sample prep product lines. Nucleic acid extraction and automated liquid handling grew over 12x and 7x, respectively, versus the fourth quarter of 2019. And as Prahlad recently mentioned, we installed over 1,000 chemagic systems and 600 GNS liquid handlers in 2020. Both platforms have gained share and positioned our applied genomics business well as we eventually transition to a post-COVID world.
Meanwhile, immunodiagnostics growth increased over 250%, with EUROIMMUN growing over 20%. Demand for our portfolio of RT-PCR assays remain particularly strong across the globe and serology demand was consistent on a sequential basis. Reproductive health declined low single digits organically, driven by lower newborn and prenatal testing in Asia Pacific and Europe. Americas newborn increased mid-single digits, while Europe and Asia Pacific declined high single and double digits, respectively. Birthrate pressures globally remain a headwind. However, early signs point to improved underlying demand trends.
Turning to Discovery & Analytical Solutions. Organic revenue declined 2% in the fourth quarter versus the same period last year. By end market, we experienced mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in life science. Pharma/biotech was up mid-single digits, driven by strength in enterprise, up double digits and discovery up high single digits. Academic and government increased double digits, driven by nearly 20% growth in our discovery franchise.
Applied markets declined approximately 10%, with Americas down over 20%. Normalizing for the tough cannabis comparison in the quarter, applied declined mid-single digits, which we think is a more useful data point when evaluating the underlying demand trend across our applied franchise.
Food declined over 20% in the quarter. However, excluding cannabis, food declined 12% with dynamics consistent across all 3 major geographic regions. Meizheng, Solus and Bioo all improved sequentially, which is an encouraging sign that food safety testing momentum is improving across the globe. Meanwhile, industrial and environmental safety declined mid-single digits, continuing the trend of improved sequential momentum since demand trough during the second quarter. Another positive sign for the applied franchise, as we look ahead, is that our year-end applied backlog increased double digits year-over-year.
Shifting to below the line items. Adjusted net interest and other expense for the fourth quarter was approximately $11 million, and our adjusted tax rate was 20%.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $2 billion of debt and $400 million of cash. Adjusted free cash flow was $471 million in the quarter, which resulted in an adjusted free cash flow conversion rate of 105%. Finally, we exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 1.2x, down over a turn and a half since the beginning of the year.
Closing the books on 2020, we are extremely pleased with our overall performance, including 29% organic growth, 102% adjusted earnings per share growth and 159% adjusted free cash flow growth, all compared to 2019. Adjusted free cash flow conversion was 89%, up from 70% the prior year. The DSO reduction has been a function of process improvements as well as improved monthly linearity in terms due to COVID demand. We remain encouraged by our free cash flow progress and are confident that we are well positioned to deliver consistent adjusted free cash flow conversion of at least 85% for the foreseeable future.
Turning to guidance. While the pandemic continues to create uncertainty, we thought it would be helpful to provide a baseline for how we are planning our business in 2021. In total, we anticipate revenue of at least $4.08 billion. Embedded in this guidance, we assume COVID revenues will be at least flat with 2020, and we expect underlying dynamics to improve for our non-COVID portfolio as we progress through the year, translating to full year non-COVID organic growth of approximately 5% to 7%. These assumptions do not account for any incremental lockdowns and/or any COVID-related disruptions as well as any potential catch-ups related to pent-up demand.
Additionally, we are anticipating 2% benefit from both foreign exchange and acquisitions for the full year. In total, this baseline implies an organic growth range of 3% to 5%. And on the bottom line, we anticipate adjusted earnings per share of at least $8.50, which assumes approximately $40 million in adjusted interest and other expenses, a tax rate of 20% to 21% and our average diluted share count to be in the range of 112 million to 113 million.
For the first quarter, we are forecasting reported revenue of approximately $1.19 billion, representing 77% organic revenue growth and including a 3% benefit from foreign exchange and 3% from acquisitions. Embedded in this guidance is $500 million of COVID-related revenue and organic growth of 1% to 3% for our non-COVID product lines. There are 2 additional factors to keep in mind for top line modeling purposes. First, the extra week during 2020 fell during the first quarter. As a reminder, we estimated that the extra week contributed $11 million of revenue. So that headwind is embedded in our 1% to 3% non-COVID growth guidance. And second, we generated approximately $12 million in COVID revenue in 1Q '20. So one needs to adjust for that amount in the prior year baseline when forecasting the incremental dollar growth for the non-COVID portfolio.
In terms of adjusted earnings per share guidance for the quarter, we are forecasting at least $3, which assumes approximately $11 million of interest and other expenses, a 22% tax rate and a diluted share count of 112 million to 113 million. All of this is detailed in the second to last page of our fourth quarter earnings presentation.
In closing, 2020 was one of the most important years in PerkinElmer's long and storied history. I have no doubt we are better positioned as an organization exiting 2020. We are excited for what is ahead, how we will better serve our customers and perform for all of our stakeholders.
Before I hand it over to the operator, I also want to thank Bryan for all of his work leading and guiding our Investor Relations efforts over the past 2 years. He was instrumental in our strategic evolution and a staunch proponent of increased transparency for all of our stakeholders. I'm excited for him as he transitions to a new role with us in the coming weeks, and I'm glad he remains a part of the PerkinElmer family.
Operator, at this time, we would like to open the call to questions."

All the best to you.
I guess, if I could just maybe ask one on the guidance here. The COVID diagnostics, at least flat, given that you guys are doing $500 million in Q1. So I'm curious with the U.K. and California contracts, does it make sense for a pretty steep drop-off from our Q1 levels. And when you look at the base business, I think the 5% to 7% core, but -- correct me if I'm wrong, your core -- the comp in 2020 was minus 7%. So that seems like a pretty easy comp. So maybe talk about the underlying in the COVID assumptions relative to the guide."

There's a few questions in there, and we're excited for Bryan as well. So I'll start with COVID as it pertains to the guide. Obviously, we said at least flat year-over-year.

So I'll start with COVID as it pertains to the guide. Obviously, we said at least flat year-over-year. And I'd say, predicting the course of COVID has not been easy nor do we anticipate it to be easy over the next 12 months.
There are certainly some variables that could make it more than this. But let me talk about it in a couple of ways. One is the sequence through the year, which gets to your question about $500 million in the first quarter, and then the labs versus kind of the rest of the COVID revenue piece. So in terms of the sequence, obviously, we have much better visibility, certainly to the first quarter and the first half. And our assumption in this guidance is that the vaccine kicks in and that the second half revenue and testing comes down substantially. And you can see that by evidence that almost 50% of the revenue is here in the first quarter, so we feel like that's a conservative assumption, but one that we are confident in.
As it pertains to the split between core versus labs in 2020, core made up approximately 80% of the revenue, and we're predicting that, that will make up approximately 60% of the revenue. And conversely, the labs, which made up about 20% of the revenue in 2020, will step up and be a greater contributor in 2021 to be about 40%.
So I think we're assuming that starting in the first quarter here, we're expecting the testing levels on the core to come back down in the level of instruments that we sell, et cetera, to kind of match what we saw probably in the third quarter. And then as it pertains to the labs, we've got a couple of variables at play. First is in the U.K., our contract only is valid through the end of March. So we're not yet sure whether it will be extended beyond March. We haven't been told yet. We're obviously talking to them about that now. So this guidance assumes that the U.K. finishes at the end of the first quarter, and there is no revenue assumed in the second quarter and beyond. And then California, as you've seen, is a slow and steady ramp. So it's public information. We've ramped from almost no testing at the beginning of November, and now we're probably about 20,000 tests per week. But there's numerous sites throughout the state of California that they're trying to bring into the program and so -- but those are slow and steady. So we expect California to ramp up here, but it's not nearly as fast as we think. And so therefore, we've taken a pretty conservative assumption in the first half here as well and then it tailors back down in the second half as well.
So overall, a lot of variables in play, Vijay. We're trying to set a floor here that says we think we can be at least flat. It's very much front-end loaded here, and there's certainly some potential for upside here, and our supply chain can certainly deal with it as we have done in 2020."

So on the non-COVID side, the first quarter, I think the comp is at minus 3%, not a minus 7%. The rest of China was the one that was impacted the most. I think China was down over 30% in the first quarter last year. The rest of Europe and Americas was quite strong in the first quarter, which blended to down 3%.
So if you look at our 1% to 3% guidance here in the first quarter, that embeds the extra week, which is the equivalent of probably 2 percentage points. So it's more like a 3% to 5% guide. And we've seen a slow and steady uptick here. So second quarter of last year was where we troughed. We had, I think, minus 14% on the core book. Third quarter, we had minus 6%. This past quarter, we had minus 3% with a couple of difficult comps in there. So we continue to see this trend up.
As it pertains to the 5% to 7% overall for the year, obviously, we'll probably see the largest growth from an organic growth rate perspective in the second quarter due to the comp, and then it will start to normalize in the back half of the year."

We probably should have made that clear. Horizon is the only one that we closed on. So Horizon is embedded in this overall guidance here.
So let me talk to the year, and then I'll talk to the sequence throughout the year. Overall, obviously, we're guiding at least $8.50, which is up $0.20. The COVID overall revenue is flat, as we mentioned, and then the core growth kicks in. So we probably get about $0.60 of increase due to the volume and then we're reinvesting that back into OpEx.
I'll talk to overall gross margin. So gross margin, we're expecting to be flat year-over-year. That has some assumptions that the COVID pricing and margin starts to dilute a little bit. And then our core book as we work on our productivity programs as well as have more volume leverage kicks in, and that keeps gross margin overall flat. And then we will continue to reinvest into OpEx here. So we started that towards the second half of last year. We're going to continue to do that. I would say we have a very flexible variable cost -- overall cost base. So we can toggle this on and off with the level of growth that we have. We want to continue to do so, and we'll make the investments that we have been, both in our talent, R&D, digital, et cetera.
In terms of progression through the year, obviously, with a more material COVID first half, the margin rates will be much more substantial. And then in the second half, it will be -- our assumption is that it comes down and we start to accrete off that 2019 platform. So you mentioned Tycho's conference, and we laid out a 2023 game plan to be 23% or better. We certainly have not lost sight that this business overall can be 25% plus, and we will start to grow margins here in the back half of this year from a productivity programs perspective and extra volumes. So I'd look at 2019 levels towards the back half of that year and add some productivity to it, and that's what we expect there."

I think EUROIMMUN was slightly positive across the globe in the fourth quarter when you exclude their COVID sales. So it's not yet perfectly normalized here, and I think that's why we're showing kind of a slow and steady uptick here.

On the second question around how do we -- on adding more menu to our installed base or incremental installed base we have put in. I think, again, there, we are going with a 3-pronged approach: one, organically what we develop through EUROIMMUN or through our Turku and Taichung labs; second, partnering with other companies that have got approved molecular assays that are out there; and third, obviously, is the M&A and acquisition targets.

I think the way what we've done and the reason it has worked for us so far is we have always integrated our acquisitions right rather than heavy or light or appropriately. And I think maybe I can talk a lot more around Horizon than on Oxford because we haven't closed on Oxford.
But as you think through it, right, the -- give you 1 example. Horizon has a group of strategic account managers with pharma that are very well penetrated and a lot of the business flow through comes from them. So in this case, for us, it's more of a reverse integration, just to give you an example, where we can build on that core competency that Horizon has around strategic account managers, specifically in pharma and biotech, and use them and add our assays and imaging and detection portfolio and discovery portfolio to that bag.
So for us, what is more critical is to look at the opportunity that -- look at the target that we are integrating and see where there are opportunities. And most of our focus right now has gone around commercial synergies and technology synergies. And obviously, Jamey and I both have talked earlier about the whole aspect around how we bring in our automation expertise, for example, with Oxford. So that will play a role. That doesn't mean that we don't have the cost synergies or the corporate opportunity of -- the cost opportunities around corporate costs.

From a reproductive health perspective, our assumption I think going into it is low single digits for the year. We continue to see -- we've seen continued pressure on birth rates for the past few years. But again, as I've said earlier, that's not sustainable. So our assumption on that is probably flat to low single-digit decline on birth rates, but compensating that with menu expansion and some of the new NPIs that we've talked about, Ion is being one of them, I think, SMA and DMD, right?

I would like to begin by welcoming Steve Willey as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. We are excited to have him join the team. He brings a wealth of industry knowledge, deep research and analyst experience. And as many of you know, Steve's industry surveys always seem to have a real-time finger on the pulse of market trends. We are looking forward to his insights and expertise as we continue to grow and transform PerkinElmer into a best-in-class life sciences and diagnostics organization. 
Stepping back, I know it is a cliche, but we are living in a new world compared to 12 months ago. 2020 was one of the most dynamic years in my career, and I suspect yours too. It felt like we were living in rolling 4-week periods. Success was a byproduct of teamwork and agility. And quite frankly, little has changed in that regard during the first 4 months of 2021. 
While our core markets are improving, COVID continues to keep us on our toes. Two things are for certain. Our team is tested and the first quarter performance reinforces the PerkinElmer top to bottom is emerging from COVID as a stronger organization. We've shown we can and will respond quickly to whatever challenges are thrown our way. And are rallying cry of putting the customer first and our mission of innovating for a healthier world resonates and impassions our team. 
We shine throughout 2020 and our resiliency, customer-first mindset and team-first culture will continue to differentiate us in 2021 and beyond. I've said it countless times over the past year. But I remain incredibly appreciative of and inspired by the entire PerkinElmer team for continuing to demonstrate the kind of dedication, agility, collaboration and genuine compassion for one another and the world around us that make PerkinElmer a world-class organization. 
Our recent commercial and financial success is really a byproduct of the team's commitment to driving our mission day in and out, and I could not be prouder. Turning to the first quarter results. PerkinElmer delivered an outstanding financial performance. Adjusted and organic revenue grew by 101% and 92%, respectively. Adjusted earnings per share increased 455% and we delivered 114% adjusted free cash flow conversion. Jamey will go into further detail around the broad-based momentum we experienced across the portfolio. 
But overall, it was a strong start to the year. And we are encouraged by the underlying recovery we are seeing across most of our core end markets. The new PerkinElmer that is emerging from the COVID pandemic is a direct byproduct of the conscious execution against our 4 strategic priorities: people, customers, innovation and operational excellence. 
I know in many ways, the playbook sounds simple, but going back to the basics has truly reinvigorated our organization. On the people front, we made progress in several areas over the course of the quarter. Magali was promoted to become our first Chief People and Culture Officer to accelerate the transformation of our culture and talent engagement efforts. 
Near term, Magali and her team will be laser-focused on reinforcing our foundation, instituting, carrying beyond work programs and bolstering PerkinElmer's profile as a destination of choice for top talent. 
Specific to learning and development, we recently launched the PerkinElmer Leadership Academy and invested in external tools and resources to better engage employees of all levels in their own professional growth. Additionally, we are increasingly holding managers accountable for employee engagement. Tracking and managing goals and objectives and maintaining close contact even in remote environments with teams and direct reports is pivotal to individual development as well as ensuring that we are empowering our next generation of leaders. 
On the diversity, equity and inclusion front, we recently established an inclusion Board and identified over 100 inclusion champions around the world. The immediate focus of the team has been to execute on both global and local DEI efforts. One great example was spearheading the creation of a moving video Montage to honor International Women's Day. 
Looking outward, we continue to reposition the portfolio and accelerate momentum through increased investments in innovation. On the COVID front, the Explorer workstation remains a differentiator for PerkinElmer. Customers love the seamless workflow and ability to rapidly toggle throughput based on real-time demand dynamics. The best-in-class nature of the platform is further reinforced by the fact that the competitive tender win rate has remained well north of 90% since the platform was launched last August. 
Additionally, We were proud to receive an EUA from the FDA during the quarter to test for asymptomatic individuals as we anticipate that coverage surveillance testing will remain important for the foreseeable future and largely target asymptomatic carriers as economies across the globe reopen. 
PerkinElmer continues to be uniquely positioned to help in the march towards normalization as we are one of the few suppliers to have an EUA for asymptomatic testing, maintain the most sensitive PCR and rapid tests on the market and have end-to-end capabilities to promote pool testing, which saves time and resources for diagnostic laboratories. 
Outside of COVID, a life sciences team introduced a groundbreaking cell painting kit as part of the new portfolio of Fino View cellular imaging reagents. Cell painting is a powerful high-content screening approach, which combines cell and computational biology to unravel cellular responses. With this new and novel workflow, researchers will be able to better understand diseases and develop more pinpointed therapies to treat them. 
Additionally, These reagents were recently approved for use by the jump cell painting consortium, which includes many of the top global pharmaceutical companies as well as the Broad Institute. Meanwhile, our recently acquired Horizon Discovery business had an exciting announcement of their own during the quarter. 
The team launched a new family of CRISPR modulation reagents for CRISPR interference or CRISPR I. CRISPR is crisper without the cut, which allows researchers to repress rather than completely knock out a gene, allowing for more nuanced research. Researchers will have the flexibility to repress genes in almost all cell lines over any length of time and at any scale from single-gene readouts to high-throughput studies. 
From a customer standpoint, we continue to execute on expanding existing partnerships as well as forging new relationships. During the first quarter, we were selected as the largest supplier in a sizable tender with the Hunan Province CDC to support environmental and food safety testing. In total,  70 PerkinElmer instruments will be distributed to 9 municipalities and 45 county-level technical centers to improve testing and early warning capabilities around hazardous ingredients. 
The win was a seminal event for our new LC 300 UPLC franchise as it is the largest order to date for the platform, which approximately is 20 systems. Vanadis is another great example of where we force new and exciting relationships. We added several new customers in both Europe and North America. And we established the first Vanadis lab in India. We will provide more substantive updates on Vanadis in due time. But with a strong funnel and growing pipeline, the platform is emerging from COVID in a great position to experience accelerating momentum over the next several quarters. 
As I said earlier in my prepared remarks, the new PerkinElmer that is emerging from COVID is on a much stronger footing than 2 years ago. The addition of Horizon Discovery, Omni and most recently, Oxford Immunotec further bolsters our position. While inorganic contributors during the first quarter, these 3 assets combined grew over 25% year-over-year. 
But more importantly, all 3 carve out new niches in high-growth areas where we see significant opportunity in the future. Specifically, the Horizon Discovery integration is proceeding very well. The team executed phenomenally during the quarter. Both commercial teams are actively engaged and driving some early commercial wins. And Horizon has already begun to leverage internal porcine automation capabilities to scale their automated screaming and cell line engineering efforts. 
Meanwhile, Omni International's homogenization products are highly complementary with PerkinElmer's applied genomics portfolio. Omni's Bill technology has been a critical component in PerkinElmer's differentiated COVID-19 saliva test workflow. And it also has the potential to enhance our end-to-end workflows in the food and cannabis markets. 
Lastly, while we are only a couple of months into the Oxford Immunotec integration efforts, visibility on both revenue and cost synergy opportunities continues to improve. The team has quickly executed on several small, early wins out of the gate. And the progress on the automation rollout is already having an impact on new account wins. 
In closing, I could not be more excited about the future for PerkinElmer. The organization is eager and energized to build on our recent momentum. We have fundamentally transformed ourselves, and we are undoubtedly better positioned to capture the opportunities of tomorrow. We are stronger in core markets where we have a right to win, successfully leveraging our scale to deliver novel solutions to the market and proactively investing to further augment our portfolio and expand into faster-growing markets. 
We are not going to take our foot off the gas. The second quarter is shaping up to be another outstanding quarter with 29% organic growth, and we are well positioned to grow faster on both our core and COVID businesses in 2021 than we guided a quarter ago. And to that point, I'm excited to announce that we plan to delve further into what has been going on behind the scenes at PerkinElmer during our upcoming Analyst Day on June 24.
 I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of our website after the call to preregister. Before I turn the call over to Jamey, I want to take a moment and comment on the devastating COVID-19 situation in India, which is taking the lives of thousands every day. Having been born in India and working for a company that employs over 2,000 locally in that country, the severity of the present situation truly hits home. 
At PerkinElmer, we feel that it is our role as a global citizen to do everything we can to help both our employees and the country. We have joined other U.S. companies and engaged government officials, both in the U.S. and India to provide virtal goods and services. Locally, our team in India is working around the clock to assist our employees in every possible way, including organizing vaccination drives, providing testing support, and seeking to facilitate meeting their urgent medical needs. 
While many people are eagerly looking to transition to a post-COVID world, countless others around the globe are still struggling daily with the pandemic and its deadly impact. My heart and prayers go out to everyone who are still acutely dealing with the pandemic daily. And I promise that at PerkinElmer, we will continue to tirelessly support afflicted regions and countries in their efforts to combat COVID-19 and flatten the curve. Jamey?"

To start, I echo with Prahlad in welcoming Steve Willoughby as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Steve has been a terrific research analyst over the past decade plus, but more importantly, he is a great person. And I've thoroughly enjoyed getting to know him over the last few years. I have no doubt that he will be an invaluable addition to the PerkinElmer family. 
Before turning to the financial results, I want to remind everyone that our first quarter earnings call presentation has been posted on the Investors section of our website under Financial Information. I will begin my prepared remarks by highlighting the first quarter. Then I'll provide some additional color on our served end markets and financial metrics, and I will end with our second quarter and updated full year 2021 guidance. 
At a high level, the team executed extremely well during the first quarter. As Prahlad mentioned, we are seeing signs of normalization in our core markets. Non-COVID product order growth exceeded reported revenue growth for the second quarter in a row, and service level activity continued to improve on a sequential basis. And as we look ahead, we are even more confident that we will be a faster-growing company in a post-COVID world. 
During the first quarter, adjusted revenue grew 101% compared to last year to $1.3 billion and included a 3% foreign exchange and a 5% acquisition tailwind. Organic revenue grew 92%, 2 percentage points better than what we previously communicated. Overall, COVID-related products and services contributed $550 million in the quarter, propelled primarily by our PCR tests and RNA extraction solutions as well as our turnkey lab and lab testing solutions in the State of California and the United Kingdom. 
In total, excluding the impact of our labs, our COVID solutions contributed approximately $250 million during the quarter. By business, Diagnostics, representing 65% of total sales, increased 227% organically. Strength in our immunodiagnostics and applied genomics businesses led the way. And our reproductive health franchise returned to growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2019. Discovery and Analytical Solutions, representing 35% of total sales, increased 6% organically led by broad-based growth across life sciences, food and applied. 
You will recall that during the first quarter of 2020, we benefited from an extra week. We estimate that the revenue impact of the extra week was approximately $11 million, with the vast majority of it benefiting the DAS business. Normalizing for the extra week, DAS grew 9% on a core basis year-over-year. 
On a geographic basis, Americas and Europe grew triple digits; Asia Pacific grew strong double digits; China grew over 50% year-over-year. Operationally, we are extremely pleased with our performance. Adjusted operating margins expanded approximately 2,600 basis points to 41%, led by volume leverage, business mix and productivity programs. Adjusted earnings per share of $3.72 in the first quarter increased 455% relative to the first quarter of 2020. 
Looking further into the key drivers within our segments, let's start with our Diagnostics business. As mentioned in my earlier remarks, organic revenue increased 227%, with all 3 major geographic regions growing triple digits. Our immunodiagnostics franchise led the way, posting 420% growth with the non-COVID portfolio increasing over 20% led by EUROIMMUN and Tulip. Demand for our portfolio of RT-PCR COVID assays remain strong and serology demand remained consistent with the past 2 quarters. 
Meanwhile, our applied genomics business grew 330% on broad-based momentum across all geographies with strength in our nucleic acid extraction, liquid handling and sample prep product lines. Automated liquid handling and nucleic acid extraction grew over 10x and 9x, respectively, versus the first quarter of 2020. And despite ongoing concerns around the impending centralization of testing, we experienced a mid-teens sequential growth in our automated liquid handling solutions, led by our molecular franchise. 
Customers continue to invest in expanded testing capabilities during the first quarter and the Janus brand continues to take market share. Reproductive health increased high single digits organically, driven by a rebound in clinical immunoassay and next-generation sequencing testing demand. Birth rates trends have yet to inflect. However, the easier comparisons limited the headwind on the overall reproductive health franchise. 
Excluding the clinical lab and sequencing businesses, the reproductive health business was flat year-over-year. Turning to Discovery & Analytical Solutions. Organic revenue increased 6% in the first quarter versus the same period last year. By end market, we experienced low single-digit organic revenue growth in Life Science. Pharma Biotech was up low single digits, excluding the extra week headwind, Pharma Biotech would have been up high single digits. 
Discovery and Informatics grew mid-teens and high single digits, respectively. Enterprise declined high single digits, adversely impacted by the extra week and our effort to improve the margin mix of this franchise. The academic and government end market was a bit noisy this quarter. U.S. and European customers have yet to fully normalize and APAC moderated sequentially. Overall, academic and government declined low single digits. 
Food increased high single digits led by demand in Europe and Asia Pacific. Food safety led the way with approximately 30% growth despite a tough double-digit comparison year-over-year. Our Meizheng business in China rebounded extremely well, growing over 70% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Applied market demand continues to improve as well, growing low double digits during the first quarter. Asia Pacific led the way with over 20% growth. 
Breaking down applied further. The environmental safety end market rebounded nicely with approximately 30% growth driven by European and Asia Pacific demand while industrial continued on its recovery trajectory, increasing high single digits. Shifting to below-the-line items. Adjusted net interest and other expense for the first quarter was approximately $12 million, our adjusted tax rate was 21%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.6 billion of debt and nearly $1 billion of cash. Adjusted free cash flow was $479 million in the quarter, which resulted in an adjusted free cash flow conversion rate of 114%. Finally, we exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 0.9x, down over 1/4 of a turn compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Turning to guidance. We now anticipate full year 2021 revenue of $4.37 billion. Embedded in this guidance, we assume COVID revenues increased 5% year-over-year compared to our prior guide of at least flat. And we expect the continuation of the non-COVID momentum we saw in the first quarter, translating to full year non-COVID organic growth of 11%. These assumptions do not account for any incremental walk downs and/or any COVID-related disruptions. 
Additionally, we are anticipating a 4% benefit from acquisitions and a 2% benefit from foreign exchange for the full year. And on the bottom line, we anticipate adjusted earnings per share of $9.40, which assumes approximately $60 million in adjusted interest and other expense. A tax rate of 20% and our average diluted share count to be in the range of 112 million to 113 million shares. 
For the second quarter, we are forecasting adjusted revenue of approximately $1.11 billion, representing 29% organic revenue growth, including 5% from acquisitions and 4% benefit from foreign exchange. Embedded in this guidance is $325 million of COVID-related revenue and organic growth of high teens for our non-COVID product lines. In terms of adjusted earnings per share guidance for the second quarter, we are forecasting $2.35, which assumes approximately $16 million of interest and other expenses, a 21% tax rate, a diluted share count of 112 million to 113 million shares. 
All of this is detailed in the second to last page of our first quarter earnings presentation. In closing, we delivered a very strong start to 2021. I have no doubt we are better positioned as an organization to drive more consistent and faster top line growth and improve shareholder returns compared to where we were a year ago. We remain extremely excited for what is ahead for PerkinElmer. I cannot be prouder of our team and the effort that they have put in over the past year plus to get us to this point.

I would say we pay out a lot of prior year accruals in this quarter, but the benefit that we're getting is you can see in the receivables line, we've got about $170 million free cash flow benefit there, even when sales were from a sequential standpoint, relatively flat. So we did collect on a lot of the past dues that were in the fourth quarter, and our DSO has improved substantially. But In terms of going forward, I mean, we remain very confident in the processes we put in place and the fact that we'll be above 85% moving forward, perhaps this year is going to be a little bit better. 
But There's a little bit from a couple of customers that we collected on, but overall, I think we've got fundamental improvements in place here."

The first quarter, we guided low single digits, came in at 10%. So that obviously contributes to some of it, but not all of it. So we are anticipating improved performance through 4Q. In terms of the end markets, I mean, like Prahlad mentioned, it is across the board. 
There is not an end market that didn't perform better than our expectations. So maybe I'll just give a little bit more color on that. When we originally guided, we thought DAS was going to be flattish to nominal growth. And we thought DX would kind of be in the mid-single digits, which kind of got us to our low singles. 
On DAS hitting 6% versus flattish Life Sciences, as I mentioned, just to Tycho's question, was significantly better than we kind of anticipated there in both food, particularly food safety, which I talked about as well as applied NPIs. Our Triple Quad has done extremely well. Our new IR has done extremely well. So all of those contributed to the beat in DAS. 
If you move to diagnostics, I would say, largely immunodiagnostics and applied genomics drove the beat here. So I mentioned in the prepared remarks that EUROIMMUN did great, particularly in China. So Day in China, we're now above 2019 levels. Tulip did extremely well in the quarter as well. Applied genomics continued. I'd say the brand increase with Janus as attributed to COVID has now started to filter off into non-COVID revenue as well. And then reproductive health was still a little bit better, largely in genomics testing, I would say.

Just obviously, there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty on how this will ultimately play out this year and next. But just any sense of how we think about the durability of your business as a pandemic slows. I apologize if this was raised earlier on the call, but I'm just trying to get a sense of beyond 2021, what kind of lasting benefit do you think PerkinElmer will play within COVID testing? And then I have a follow-up."

I mean we've talked about durability of COVID going forward just based on the installed base of what we had placed around chemagic and Janus last year. And we continue to see that trend in the first quarter. It hasn't slowed down. So we expect that to continue to further strengthen the assumptions that we have around got durability. Around the assumption for COVID for the year, we've got a very good line of sight for the second quarter. And we have been pretty prudent in our planning for the rest of the year. 
So we feel very good about the number, and that's why the raise that you see. Plus we have -- as Jamey talked about earlier, we have upside opportunities, whether it's from asymptomatic, from serology, from antigen testing. That continues to bolster our assumption and forecast around COVID."

So across the board, again, whether it's supply genomics, reproductive, applied genomics and immunodiagnostics, we've seen good strength. Reproductive health, I would say, is a slower coming back because of the pressure that it's seeing from both rates, but it has started showing signs.

I would like to begin by welcoming Steve Willoughby as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. We are excited to have him join the team. He brings a wealth of industry knowledge, deep research and analyst experience. And as many of you know, Steve's industry surveys always seem to have a real-time finger on the pulse of market trends. We are looking forward to his insights and expertise as we continue to grow and transform PerkinElmer into a best-in-class life sciences and diagnostics organization.
Stepping back, I know it is a cliche, but we are living in a new world compared to 12 months ago. 2020 was one of the most dynamic years in my career, and I suspect yours too. It felt like we were living in rolling 4-week periods. Success was a byproduct of teamwork and agility. And quite frankly, little has changed in that regard during the first 4 months of 2021.
While our core markets are improving, COVID continues to keep us on our toes. Two things are for certain. Our team is tested, and the first quarter performance reinforces that PerkinElmer top to bottom is emerging from COVID as a stronger organization. We've shown we can and will respond quickly to whatever challenges are thrown our way, and our rallying cry of putting the customer first and our mission of innovating for a healthier world resonates and impassions our team.
We shined throughout 2020 and our resiliency, customer-first mindset and team-first culture will continue to differentiate us in 2021 and beyond. I've said it countless times over the past year, but I remain incredibly appreciative of and inspired by the entire PerkinElmer team for continuing to demonstrate the kind of dedication, agility, collaboration and genuine compassion for one another and the world around us that make PerkinElmer a world-class organization. Our recent commercial and financial success is really a byproduct of the team's commitment to driving our mission day in and out, and I could not be prouder.
Turning to the first quarter results. PerkinElmer delivered an outstanding financial performance. Adjusted and organic revenue grew by 101% and 92%, respectively. Adjusted earnings per share increased 455%, and we delivered 114% adjusted free cash flow conversion. Jamey will go into further detail around the broad-based momentum we experienced across the portfolio. But overall, it was a strong start to the year. And we are encouraged by the underlying recovery we are seeing across most of our core end markets.
The new PerkinElmer that is emerging from the COVID pandemic is a direct byproduct of the conscious execution against our 4 strategic priorities: people, customers, innovation and operational excellence. I know in many ways, the playbook sounds simple, but going back to the basics has truly reinvigorated our organization.
On the people front, we made progress in several areas over the course of the quarter. Magali Four was promoted to become our first Chief People and Culture Officer to accelerate the transformation of our culture and talent engagement efforts. Near term, Magali and her team will be laser-focused on reinforcing our foundation, instituting, carrying beyond work programs and bolstering PerkinElmer's profile as a destination of choice for top talent.
Specific to learning and development, we recently launched the PerkinElmer Leadership Academy and invested in external tools and resources to better engage employees of all levels in their own professional growth. Additionally, we are increasingly holding managers accountable for employee engagement. Tracking and managing goals and objectives and maintaining close contact even in remote environments with teams and direct reports is pivotal to individual development as well as ensuring that we are empowering our next generation of leaders.
On the diversity, equity and inclusion front, we recently established an inclusion board and identified over 100 inclusion champions around the world. The immediate focus of the team has been to execute on both global and local DEI efforts. One great example was spearheading the creation of a moving video montage to honor International Women's Day. Looking outward, we continue to reposition the portfolio and accelerate momentum through increased investments in innovation.
On the COVID front, the explorer workstation remains a differentiator for PerkinElmer. Customers love the seamless workflow and ability to rapidly toggle throughput based on real-time demand dynamics. The best-in-class nature of the platform is further reinforced by the fact that the competitive tender win rate has remained well north of 90% since the platform was launched last August.
Additionally, we were proud to receive an EUA from the FDA during the quarter to test for asymptomatic individuals as we anticipate that COVID surveillance testing will remain important for the foreseeable future and largely target asymptomatic carriers as economies across the globe reopen.
PerkinElmer continues to be uniquely positioned to help in the march towards normalization as we are one of the few suppliers to have an EUA for asymptomatic testing, maintain the most sensitive PCR and rapid tests on the market and have end-to-end capabilities to promote pool testing, which saves time and resources for diagnostic laboratories.
Outside of COVID, our life sciences team reintroduced a groundbreaking cell painting kit as part of the new portfolio of PhenoVue, cellular imaging reagents. Cell painting is a powerful high-content screening approach, which combines cell and computational biology to unravel cellular responses. With this new and novel workflow, researchers will be able to better understand diseases and develop more pinpointed therapies to treat them.
Additionally, these reagents were recently approved for use by the JUMP-Cell Painting Consortium, which includes many of the top global pharmaceutical companies as well as the Broad Institute. Meanwhile, our recently acquired Horizon Discovery business had an exciting announcement of their own during the quarter. The team launched a new family of CRISPR modulation reagents for CRISPR interference or CRISPRi. CRISPRi is CRISPR without the cut, which allows researchers to repress rather than completely knock out a gene, allowing for more nuanced research. Researchers will have the flexibility to repress genes in almost all cell lines over any length of time and at any scale from single-gene readouts to high-throughput studies.
From a customer standpoint, we continue to execute on expanding existing partnerships as well as forging new relationships. During the first quarter, we were selected as the largest supplier in a sizable tender with the Yunnan Province CDC to support environmental and food safety testing. In total, 70 PerkinElmer instruments will be distributed to 9 municipalities and 45 county-level technical centers to improve testing and early warning capabilities around hazardous ingredients. The win was a seminal event for our new LC 300 UHPLC franchise as it is the largest order to date for the platform, which approximately is 20 systems.
Vanadis is another great example of where we force new and exciting relationships. We added several new customers in both Europe and North America. And we established the first Vanadis lab in India. We will provide more substantive updates on Vanadis in due time, but with a strong funnel and growing pipeline, the platform is emerging from COVID in a great position to experience accelerating momentum over the next several quarters.
As I said earlier in my prepared remarks, the new PerkinElmer that is emerging from COVID is on a much stronger footing than 2 years ago. The addition of Horizon Discovery, Omni and most recently, Oxford Immunotec further bolsters our position. While inorganic contributors during the first quarter, these 3 assets combined grew over 25% year-over-year. But more importantly, all 3 carve out new niches in high-growth areas where we see significant opportunity in the future.
Specifically, the Horizon Discovery integration is proceeding very well. The team executed phenomenally during the quarter. Both commercial teams are actively engaged and driving some early commercial wins. And Horizon has already begun to leverage internal PerkinElmer automation capabilities to scale their automated screening and cell line engineering efforts.
Meanwhile, Omni International's homogenization products are highly complementary with PerkinElmer's applied genomics portfolio. Omni's Bead Mills technology has been a critical component in PerkinElmer's differentiated COVID-19 saliva test workflow. And it also has the potential to enhance our end-to-end workflows in the food and cannabis markets.
Lastly, while we are only a couple of months into the Oxford Immunotec integration efforts, visibility on both revenue and cost synergy opportunities continues to improve. The team has quickly executed on several small, early wins out of the gate. And the progress on the automation rollout is already having an impact on new account wins.
In closing, I could not be more excited about the future for PerkinElmer. The organization is eager and energized to build on our recent momentum. We have fundamentally transformed ourselves, and we are undoubtedly better positioned to capture the opportunities of tomorrow. We are stronger in core markets where we have a right to win, successfully leveraging our scale to deliver novel solutions to the market and proactively investing to further augment our portfolio and expand into faster-growing markets.
We are not going to take our foot off the gas. The second quarter is shaping up to be another outstanding quarter with 29% organic growth, and we are well positioned to grow faster on both our core and COVID businesses in 2021 than we guided a quarter ago. And to that point, I'm excited to announce that we plan to delve further into what has been going on behind the scenes at PerkinElmer during our upcoming Analyst Day on June 24. I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of our website after the call to preregister.
Before I turn the call over to Jamey, I want to take a moment and comment on the devastating COVID-19 situation in India, which is taking the lives of thousands every day. Having been born in India and working for a company that employs over 2,000 locally in that country, the severity of the present situation truly hits home.
At PerkinElmer, we feel that it is our role as a global citizen to do everything we can to help both our employees and the country. We have joined other U.S. companies and engaged government officials, both in the U.S. and India to provide vital goods and services. Locally, our team in India is working around the clock to assist our employees in every possible way, including organizing vaccination drives, providing testing support, and seeking to facilitate meeting their urgent medical needs.
While many people are eagerly looking to transition to a post-COVID world, countless others around the globe are still struggling daily with the pandemic and its deadly impact. My heart and prayers go out to everyone who are still acutely dealing with the pandemic daily. And I promise that at PerkinElmer, we will continue to tirelessly support afflicted regions and countries in their efforts to combat COVID-19 and flatten the curve.
Jamey?"

To start, I echo Prahlad in welcoming Steve Willoughby as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Steve has been a terrific research analyst over the past decade plus, but more importantly, he is a great person. And I've thoroughly enjoyed getting to know him over the last few years. I have no doubt that he will be an invaluable addition to the PerkinElmer family.
Before turning to the financial results, I want to remind everyone that our first quarter earnings call presentation has been posted on the Investors section of our website under Financial Information. I will begin my prepared remarks by highlighting the first quarter. Then I'll provide some additional color on our served end markets and financial metrics, and I will end with our second quarter and updated full year 2021 guidance.
At a high level, the team executed extremely well during the first quarter. As Prahlad mentioned, we are seeing signs of normalization in our core markets. Non-COVID product order growth exceeded reported revenue growth for the second quarter in a row, and service level activity continued to improve on a sequential basis. And as we look ahead, we are even more confident that we will be a faster-growing company in a post-COVID world. 
During the first quarter, adjusted revenue grew 101% compared to last year to $1.3 billion and included a 3% foreign exchange and a 5% acquisition tailwind. Organic revenue grew 92%, 2 percentage points better than what we previously communicated. Overall, COVID-related products and services contributed $550 million in the quarter, propelled primarily by our PCR tests and RNA extraction solutions as well as our turnkey Lab-In-A-Lab testing solutions in the State of California and the United Kingdom.
In total, excluding the impact of our labs, our COVID solutions contributed approximately $250 million during the quarter. By business, Diagnostics, representing 65% of total sales, increased 227% organically. Strength in our immunodiagnostics and applied genomics businesses led the way. And our reproductive health franchise returned to growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2019. Discovery and Analytical Solutions, representing 35% of total sales, increased 6% organically led by broad-based growth across life sciences, food and applied.
You will recall that during the first quarter of 2020, we benefited from an extra week. We estimate that the revenue impact of the extra week was approximately $11 million, with the vast majority of it benefiting the DAS business. Normalizing for the extra week, DAS grew 9% on a core basis year-over-year.
On a geographic basis, Americas and Europe grew triple digits; Asia Pacific grew strong double digits; China grew over 50% year-over-year. Operationally, we are extremely pleased with our performance. Adjusted operating margins expanded approximately 2,600 basis points to 41%, led by volume leverage, business mix and productivity programs. Adjusted earnings per share of $3.72 in the first quarter increased 455% relative to the first quarter of 2020.
Looking further into the key drivers within our segments, let's start with our Diagnostics business. As mentioned in my earlier remarks, organic revenue increased 227%, with all 3 major geographic regions growing triple digits. Our immunodiagnostics franchise led the way, posting 420% growth with the non-COVID portfolio increasing over 20% led by EUROIMMUN and Tulip. Demand for our portfolio of RT-PCR COVID assays remained strong and serology demand remained consistent with the past 2 quarters.
Meanwhile, our applied genomics business grew 330% on broad-based momentum across all geographies with strength in our nucleic acid extraction, liquid handling and sample prep product lines. Automated liquid handling and nucleic acid extraction grew over 10x and 9x, respectively, versus the first quarter of 2020. And despite ongoing concerns around the impending centralization of testing, we experienced a mid-teens sequential growth in our automated liquid handling solutions, led by our molecular franchise. Customers continue to invest in expanded testing capabilities during the first quarter and the JANUS brand continues to take market share.
Reproductive health increased high single digits organically, driven by a rebound in clinical immunoassay and next-generation sequencing testing demand. Birth rates trends have yet to inflect. However, the easier comparisons limited the headwind on the overall reproductive health franchise. Excluding the clinical lab and sequencing businesses, the reproductive health business was flat year-over-year.
Turning to Discovery & Analytical Solutions. Organic revenue increased 6% in the first quarter versus the same period last year. By end market, we experienced low single-digit organic revenue growth in Life Science. Pharma/biotech was up low single digits. Excluding the extra week headwind, pharma/biotech would have been up high single digits.
Discovery and informatics grew mid-teens and high single digits, respectively. Enterprise declined high single digits, adversely impacted by the extra week, and our effort to improve the margin mix of this franchise. The academic and government end market was a bit noisy this quarter. U.S. and European customers have yet to fully normalize and APAC moderated sequentially. Overall, academic and government declined low single digits.
Food increased high single digits led by demand in Europe and Asia Pacific. Food safety led the way with approximately 30% growth despite a tough double-digit comparison year-over-year. Our Meizheng business in China rebounded extremely well, growing over 70% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Applied market demand continues to improve as well, growing low double digits during the first quarter. Asia Pacific led the way with over 20% growth.
Breaking down applied further. The environmental safety end market rebounded nicely with approximately 30% growth driven by European and Asia Pacific demand while industrial continued on its recovery trajectory, increasing high single digits.
Shifting to below-the-line items. Adjusted net interest and other expense for the first quarter was approximately $12 million, and our adjusted tax rate was 21%.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.6 billion of debt and nearly $1 billion of cash. Adjusted free cash flow was $479 million in the quarter, which resulted in an adjusted free cash flow conversion rate of 114%. Finally, we exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 0.9x, down over 1/4 of a turn compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Turning to guidance. We now anticipate full year 2021 revenue of $4.37 billion. Embedded in this guidance, we assume COVID revenues increase 5% year-over-year compared to our prior guide of at least flat. And we expect the continuation of the non-COVID momentum we saw in the first quarter, translating to full year non-COVID organic growth of 11%. These assumptions do not account for any incremental lockdowns and/or any COVID-related disruptions.
Additionally, we are anticipating a 4% benefit from acquisitions and a 2% benefit from foreign exchange for the full year. And on the bottom line, we anticipate adjusted earnings per share of $9.40, which assumes approximately $60 million in adjusted interest and other expense. A tax rate of 20% and our average diluted share count to be in the range of 112 million to 113 million shares.
For the second quarter, we are forecasting adjusted revenue of approximately $1.11 billion, representing 29% organic revenue growth, including 5% from acquisitions and 4% benefit from foreign exchange. Embedded in this guidance is $325 million of COVID-related revenue and organic growth of high teens for our non-COVID product lines. In terms of adjusted earnings per share guidance for the second quarter, we are forecasting $2.35, which assumes approximately $16 million of interest and other expenses, a 21% tax rate and a diluted share count of 112 million to 113 million shares. All of this is detailed in the second to last page of our first quarter earnings presentation.
In closing, we delivered a very strong start to 2021. I have no doubt we are better positioned as an organization to drive more consistent and faster top line growth and improve shareholder returns compared to where we were a year ago.

So we did collect on a lot of the past dues that were in the fourth quarter, and our DSO has improved substantially. But in terms of going forward, I mean, we remain very confident in the processes we put in place and the fact that we'll be above 85% moving forward, perhaps this year is going to be a little bit better.

So not just the first quarter beat. The first quarter, we guided low single digits, came in at 10%. So that o",325,"No. I'll take the second part, I mean, in general, raising overall 11% from a prior guide of 5% to 7% has all quarters kind of rising tides here. So not just the first quarter beat. The first quarter, we guided low single digits, came in at 10%. So that obviously contributes to some of it, but not all of it. So we are anticipating improved performance 2Q through 4Q.
In terms of the end markets, I mean, like Prahlad mentioned, it is across the board. There is not an end market that didn't perform better than our expectations. So maybe I'll just give a little bit more color on that. When we originally guided, we thought DAS was going to be flattish to nominal growth. And we thought DX would kind of be in the mid-single digits, which kind of got us to our low singles.
On DAS hitting 6% versus flattish Life Sciences, as I mentioned, just to Tycho's question, was significantly better than we kind of anticipated there in both food, but particularly food safety, which I talked about as well as applied NPIs. Our Triple Quad has done extremely well. Our new IR has done extremely well. So all of those contributed to the beat in DAS.
If you move to Diagnostics, I would say, largely immunodiagnostics and applied genomics drove the beat here. So I mentioned in the prepared remarks that EUROIMMUN did great, particularly in China. So I'd say in China, we're now above 2019 levels. Tulip did extremely well in the quarter as well. Applied genomics continued. I'd say the brand increase with Janus as attributed to COVID has now started to filter off into non-COVID revenue as well. And then reproductive health was still a little bit better, largely in genomics testing, I would say. So again, across all end markets, we saw a significant improvement versus our original expectation, and it should last throughout the year."

So therefore, if you kind of move forward here, those would be the 2 large shifts.
If you look at a recurring revenue basis outside of the 2 significant labs, I don't think there's any large shift. I think, in general, all of our customers are down ticking a little bit but continue to place a pretty consistent level of orders with us. But overall, that shift of less [indiscernible] and more California will impact the overall geographic revenue related to COVID."

I would like to begin by welcoming Steve Willoughby as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. We are excited to have him join the team. He brings a wealth of industry knowledge, deep research and analyst experience. And as many of you know, Steve's industry surveys always seem to have a real-time finger on the pulse of market trends. We are looking forward to his insights and expertise as we continue to grow and transform PerkinElmer into a best-in-class life sciences and diagnostics organization.
Stepping back, I know it is a cliche, but we are living in a new world compared to 12 months ago. 2020 was one of the most dynamic years in my career, and I suspect yours too. It felt like we were living in rolling 4-week periods. Success was a byproduct of teamwork and agility. And quite frankly, little has changed in that regard during the first 4 months of 2021.
While our core markets are improving, COVID continues to keep us on our toes. Two things are for certain. Our team is tested, and the first quarter performance reinforces that PerkinElmer top to bottom is emerging from COVID as a stronger organization. We've shown we can and will respond quickly to whatever challenges are thrown our way, and our rallying cry of putting the customer first and our mission of innovating for a healthier world resonates and impassions our team.
We shined throughout 2020 and our resiliency, customer-first mindset and team-first culture will continue to differentiate us in 2021 and beyond. I've said it countless times over the past year, but I remain incredibly appreciative of and inspired by the entire PerkinElmer team for continuing to demonstrate the kind of dedication, agility, collaboration and genuine compassion for one another and the world around us that make PerkinElmer a world-class organization. Our recent commercial and financial success is really a byproduct of the team's commitment to driving our mission day in and out, and I could not be prouder.
Turning to the first quarter results. PerkinElmer delivered an outstanding financial performance. Adjusted and organic revenue grew by 101% and 92%, respectively. Adjusted earnings per share increased 455%, and we delivered 114% adjusted free cash flow conversion. Jamey will go into further detail around the broad-based momentum we experienced across the portfolio. But overall, it was a strong start to the year. And we are encouraged by the underlying recovery we are seeing across most of our core end markets.
The new PerkinElmer that is emerging from the COVID pandemic is a direct byproduct of the conscious execution against our 4 strategic priorities: people, customers, innovation and operational excellence. I know in many ways, the playbook sounds simple, but going back to the basics has truly reinvigorated our organization.
On the people front, we made progress in several areas over the course of the quarter. Magali Four was promoted to become our first Chief People and Culture Officer to accelerate the transformation of our culture and talent engagement efforts. Near term, Magali and her team will be laser-focused on reinforcing our foundation, instituting, carrying beyond work programs and bolstering PerkinElmer's profile as a destination of choice for top talent.
Specific to learning and development, we recently launched the PerkinElmer Leadership Academy and invested in external tools and resources to better engage employees of all levels in their own professional growth. Additionally, we are increasingly holding managers accountable for employee engagement. Tracking and managing goals and objectives and maintaining close contact even in remote environments with teams and direct reports is pivotal to individual development as well as ensuring that we are empowering our next generation of leaders.
On the diversity, equity and inclusion front, we recently established an inclusion board and identified over 100 inclusion champions around the world. The immediate focus of the team has been to execute on both global and local DEI efforts. One great example was spearheading the creation of a moving video montage to honor International Women's Day. Looking outward, we continue to reposition the portfolio and accelerate momentum through increased investments in innovation.
On the COVID front, the explorer workstation remains a differentiator for PerkinElmer. Customers love the seamless workflow and ability to rapidly toggle throughput based on real-time demand dynamics. The best-in-class nature of the platform is further reinforced by the fact that the competitive tender win rate has remained well north of 90% since the platform was launched last August.
Additionally, we were proud to receive an EUA from the FDA during the quarter to test for asymptomatic individuals as we anticipate that COVID surveillance testing will remain important for the foreseeable future and largely target asymptomatic carriers as economies across the globe reopen.
PerkinElmer continues to be uniquely positioned to help in the march towards normalization as we are one of the few suppliers to have an EUA for asymptomatic testing, maintain the most sensitive PCR and rapid tests on the market and have end-to-end capabilities to promote pool testing, which saves time and resources for diagnostic laboratories.
Outside of COVID, our life sciences team reintroduced a groundbreaking cell painting kit as part of the new portfolio of PhenoVue, cellular imaging reagents. Cell painting is a powerful high-content screening approach, which combines cell and computational biology to unravel cellular responses. With this new and novel workflow, researchers will be able to better understand diseases and develop more pinpointed therapies to treat them.
Additionally, these reagents were recently approved for use by the JUMP-Cell Painting Consortium, which includes many of the top global pharmaceutical companies as well as the Broad Institute. Meanwhile, our recently acquired Horizon Discovery business had an exciting announcement of their own during the quarter. The team launched a new family of CRISPR modulation reagents for CRISPR interference or CRISPRi. CRISPRi is CRISPR without the cut, which allows researchers to repress rather than completely knock out a gene, allowing for more nuanced research. Researchers will have the flexibility to repress genes in almost all cell lines over any length of time and at any scale from single-gene readouts to high-throughput studies.
From a customer standpoint, we continue to execute on expanding existing partnerships as well as forging new relationships. During the first quarter, we were selected as the largest supplier in a sizable tender with the Yunnan Province CDC to support environmental and food safety testing. In total, 70 PerkinElmer instruments will be distributed to 9 municipalities and 45 county-level technical centers to improve testing and early warning capabilities around hazardous ingredients. The win was a seminal event for our new LC 300 UHPLC franchise as it is the largest order to date for the platform, which approximately is 20 systems.
Vanadis is another great example of where we force new and exciting relationships. We added several new customers in both Europe and North America. And we established the first Vanadis lab in India. We will provide more substantive updates on Vanadis in due time, but with a strong funnel and growing pipeline, the platform is emerging from COVID in a great position to experience accelerating momentum over the next several quarters.
As I said earlier in my prepared remarks, the new PerkinElmer that is emerging from COVID is on a much stronger footing than 2 years ago. The addition of Horizon Discovery, Omni and most recently, Oxford Immunotec further bolsters our position. While inorganic contributors during the first quarter, these 3 assets combined grew over 25% year-over-year. But more importantly, all 3 carve out new niches in high-growth areas where we see significant opportunity in the future.
Specifically, the Horizon Discovery integration is proceeding very well. The team executed phenomenally during the quarter. Both commercial teams are actively engaged and driving some early commercial wins. And Horizon has already begun to leverage internal PerkinElmer automation capabilities to scale their automated screening and cell line engineering efforts.
Meanwhile, Omni International's homogenization products are highly complementary with PerkinElmer's applied genomics portfolio. Omni's Bead Mills technology has been a critical component in PerkinElmer's differentiated COVID-19 saliva test workflow. And it also has the potential to enhance our end-to-end workflows in the food and cannabis markets.
Lastly, while we are only a couple of months into the Oxford Immunotec integration efforts, visibility on both revenue and cost synergy opportunities continues to improve. The team has quickly executed on several small, early wins out of the gate. And the progress on the automation rollout is already having an impact on new account wins.
In closing, I could not be more excited about the future for PerkinElmer. The organization is eager and energized to build on our recent momentum. We have fundamentally transformed ourselves, and we are undoubtedly better positioned to capture the opportunities of tomorrow. We are stronger in core markets where we have a right to win, successfully leveraging our scale to deliver novel solutions to the market and proactively investing to further augment our portfolio and expand into faster-growing markets.
We are not going to take our foot off the gas. The second quarter is shaping up to be another outstanding quarter with 29% organic growth, and we are well positioned to grow faster on both our core and COVID businesses in 2021 than we guided a quarter ago. And to that point, I'm excited to announce that we plan to delve further into what has been going on behind the scenes at PerkinElmer during our upcoming Analyst Day on June 24. I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of our website after the call to preregister.
Before I turn the call over to Jamey, I want to take a moment and comment on the devastating COVID-19 situation in India, which is taking the lives of thousands every day. Having been born in India and working for a company that employs over 2,000 locally in that country, the severity of the present situation truly hits home.
At PerkinElmer, we feel that it is our role as a global citizen to do everything we can to help both our employees and the country. We have joined other U.S. companies and engaged government officials, both in the U.S. and India to provide vital goods and services. Locally, our team in India is working around the clock to assist our employees in every possible way, including organizing vaccination drives, providing testing support, and seeking to facilitate meeting their urgent medical needs.
While many people are eagerly looking to transition to a post-COVID world, countless others around the globe are still struggling daily with the pandemic and its deadly impact. My heart and prayers go out to everyone who are still acutely dealing with the pandemic daily. And I promise that at PerkinElmer, we will continue to tirelessly support afflicted regions and countries in their efforts to combat COVID-19 and flatten the curve.

To start, I echo Prahlad in welcoming Steve Willoughby as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Steve has been a terrific research analyst over the past decade plus, but more importantly, he is a great person. And I've thoroughly enjoyed getting to know him over the last few years. I have no doubt that he will be an invaluable addition to the PerkinElmer family.
Before turning to the financial results, I want to remind everyone that our first quarter earnings call presentation has been posted on the Investors section of our website under Financial Information. I will begin my prepared remarks by highlighting the first quarter. Then I'll provide some additional color on our served end markets and financial metrics, and I will end with our second quarter and updated full year 2021 guidance.
At a high level, the team executed extremely well during the first quarter. As Prahlad mentioned, we are seeing signs of normalization in our core markets. Non-COVID product order growth exceeded reported revenue growth for the second quarter in a row, and service level activity continued to improve on a sequential basis. And as we look ahead, we are even more confident that we will be a faster-growing company in a post-COVID world. 
During the first quarter, adjusted revenue grew 101% compared to last year to $1.3 billion and included a 3% foreign exchange and a 5% acquisition tailwind. Organic revenue grew 92%, 2 percentage points better than what we previously communicated. Overall, COVID-related products and services contributed $550 million in the quarter, propelled primarily by our PCR tests and RNA extraction solutions as well as our turnkey Lab-In-A-Lab testing solutions in the State of California and the United Kingdom.
In total, excluding the impact of our labs, our COVID solutions contributed approximately $250 million during the quarter. By business, Diagnostics, representing 65% of total sales, increased 227% organically. Strength in our immunodiagnostics and applied genomics businesses led the way. And our reproductive health franchise returned to growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2019. Discovery and Analytical Solutions, representing 35% of total sales, increased 6% organically led by broad-based growth across life sciences, food and applied.
You will recall that during the first quarter of 2020, we benefited from an extra week. We estimate that the revenue impact of the extra week was approximately $11 million, with the vast majority of it benefiting the DAS business. Normalizing for the extra week, DAS grew 9% on a core basis year-over-year.
On a geographic basis, Americas and Europe grew triple digits; Asia Pacific grew strong double digits; China grew over 50% year-over-year. Operationally, we are extremely pleased with our performance. Adjusted operating margins expanded approximately 2,600 basis points to 41%, led by volume leverage, business mix and productivity programs. Adjusted earnings per share of $3.72 in the first quarter increased 455% relative to the first quarter of 2020.
Looking further into the key drivers within our segments, let's start with our Diagnostics business. As mentioned in my earlier remarks, organic revenue increased 227%, with all 3 major geographic regions growing triple digits. Our immunodiagnostics franchise led the way, posting 420% growth with the non-COVID portfolio increasing over 20% led by EUROIMMUN and Tulip. Demand for our portfolio of RT-PCR COVID assays remained strong and serology demand remained consistent with the past 2 quarters.
Meanwhile, our applied genomics business grew 330% on broad-based momentum across all geographies with strength in our nucleic acid extraction, liquid handling and sample prep product lines. Automated liquid handling and nucleic acid extraction grew over 10x and 9x, respectively, versus the first quarter of 2020. And despite ongoing concerns around the impending centralization of testing, we experienced a mid-teens sequential growth in our automated liquid handling solutions, led by our molecular franchise. Customers continue to invest in expanded testing capabilities during the first quarter and the JANUS brand continues to take market share.
Reproductive health increased high single digits organically, driven by a rebound in clinical immunoassay and next-generation sequencing testing demand. Birth rates trends have yet to inflect. However, the easier comparisons limited the headwind on the overall reproductive health franchise. Excluding the clinical lab and sequencing businesses, the reproductive health business was flat year-over-year.
Turning to Discovery & Analytical Solutions. Organic revenue increased 6% in the first quarter versus the same period last year. By end market, we experienced low single-digit organic revenue growth in Life Science. Pharma/biotech was up low single digits. Excluding the extra week headwind, pharma/biotech would have been up high single digits.
Discovery and informatics grew mid-teens and high single digits, respectively. Enterprise declined high single digits, adversely impacted by the extra week, and our effort to improve the margin mix of this franchise. The academic and government end market was a bit noisy this quarter. U.S. and European customers have yet to fully normalize and APAC moderated sequentially. Overall, academic and government declined low single digits.
Food increased high single digits led by demand in Europe and Asia Pacific. Food safety led the way with approximately 30% growth despite a tough double-digit comparison year-over-year. Our Meizheng business in China rebounded extremely well, growing over 70% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Applied market demand continues to improve as well, growing low double digits during the first quarter. Asia Pacific led the way with over 20% growth.
Breaking down applied further. The environmental safety end market rebounded nicely with approximately 30% growth driven by European and Asia Pacific demand while industrial continued on its recovery trajectory, increasing high single digits.
Shifting to below-the-line items. Adjusted net interest and other expense for the first quarter was approximately $12 million, and our adjusted tax rate was 21%.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.6 billion of debt and nearly $1 billion of cash. Adjusted free cash flow was $479 million in the quarter, which resulted in an adjusted free cash flow conversion rate of 114%. Finally, we exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 0.9x, down over 1/4 of a turn compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Turning to guidance. We now anticipate full year 2021 revenue of $4.37 billion. Embedded in this guidance, we assume COVID revenues increase 5% year-over-year compared to our prior guide of at least flat. And we expect the continuation of the non-COVID momentum we saw in the first quarter, translate into full year non-COVID organic growth of 11%. These assumptions do not account for any incremental lockdowns and/or any COVID-related disruptions.
Additionally, we are anticipating a 4% benefit from acquisitions and a 2% benefit from foreign exchange for the full year. And on the bottom line, we anticipate adjusted earnings per share of $9.40, which assumes approximately $60 million in adjusted interest and other expense. A tax rate of 20% and our average diluted share count to be in the range of 112 million to 113 million shares.
For the second quarter, we are forecasting adjusted revenue of approximately $1.11 billion, representing 29% organic revenue growth, including 5% from acquisitions and 4% benefit from foreign exchange. Embedded in this guidance is $325 million of COVID-related revenue and organic growth of high teens for our non-COVID product lines. In terms of adjusted earnings per share guidance for the second quarter, we are forecasting $2.35, which assumes approximately $16 million of interest and other expenses, a 21% tax rate and a diluted share count of 112 million to 113 million shares. All of this is detailed in the second to last page of our first quarter earnings presentation.
In closing, we delivered a very strong start to 2021. I have no doubt we are better positioned as an organization to drive more consistent and faster top line growth and improve shareholder returns compared to where we were a year ago. We remain extremely excited for what is ahead for PerkinElmer. I cannot be prouder of our team and the effort that they have put in over the past year plus to get us to this point.

I would say we pay out a lot of prior year accruals in this quarter, but the benefit that we're getting is you can see in the receivables line, we've got about $170 million free cash flow benefit there, even when sales were, from a sequential standpoint, relatively flat.
So we did collect on a lot of the past dues that were in the fourth quarter, and our DSO has improved substantially. But in terms of going forward, I mean, we remain very confident in the processes we put in place and the fact that we'll be above 85% moving forward, perhaps this year is going to be a little bit better.

So overall, I would say Life Sciences performed better than what we expected. So you can factor in the extra week, I mentioned that Discovery was up low double digits, Informatics was up high single digits. The extra week really affected our enterprise business. So we were quite pleased with the performance, and we're pretty bullish on the outlook in Life Sciences here."

The first quarter, we guided low single digits, came in at 10%. So that obviously contributes to some of it, but not all of it. So we are anticipating improved performance 2Q through 4Q.
In terms of the end markets, I mean, like Prahlad mentioned, it is across the board. There is not an end market that didn't perform better than our expectations. So maybe I'll just give a little bit more color on that. When we originally guided, we thought DAS was going to be flattish to nominal growth. And we thought DX would kind of be in the mid-single digits, which kind of got us to our low singles.
On DAS hitting 6% versus flattish Life Sciences, as I mentioned, just to Tycho's question, was significantly better than we kind of anticipated there in both food, but particularly food safety, which I talked about as well as applied NPIs. Our Triple Quad has done extremely well. Our new IR has done extremely well. So all of those contributed to the beat in DAS.
If you move to Diagnostics, I would say, largely immunodiagnostics and applied genomics drove the beat here. So I mentioned in the prepared remarks that EUROIMMUN did great, particularly in China. So I'd say in China, we're now above 2019 levels. Tulip did extremely well in the quarter as well. Applied genomics continued. I'd say the brand increase with JANUS as attributed to COVID has now started to filter off into non-COVID revenue as well. And then reproductive health was still a little bit better, largely in genomics testing, I would say. So again, across all end markets, we saw a significant improvement versus our original expectation, and it should last throughout the year."

Today represents another milestone in the transformation of the new PerkinElmer. The addition of BioLegend expands our presence in the attractive high-growth antibody and cytokine market, enhances our content development capabilities across all PerkinElmer detection technologies and transforms our e-commerce scale overnight. 
Personally, I couldn't be more thrilled to work with Gene and the team going forward. and I'm excited to see the impact the combined company can have on scientific innovation. Culturally, the combination is a natural fit with our mutual focus on customers, innovation and internal cross-functional collaboration. BioLegend is a global leader in innovative antibodies with leading positions in several attractive markets, including imaging, proteo genomics, multiplex assays and bioprocessing. 
The combination will enable us to create a global platform of research reagents which, as we'll share with you today will fundamentally change the trajectory for both organizations. Combining PerkinElmer and BioLegend will empower customers in preclinical discovery who are looking to identify, develop and optimize novel therapeutics and, in turn, support them in bringing the right therapeutics to market faster. 
Fundamentally, bringing BioLegend into the PerkinElmer family will further enhance our core right to win in biopharma and academia. And from a financial perspective, we expect this exciting combination to lead to faster growth, stronger margins and more rapid product -- new product innovation with a strategically aligned structure to ensure success. 
While Jamey will touch on it in more specifics, I wanted to provide you some perspective on what this deal means for the company overall. For the slightly more than $5 billion in total consideration, we are combining with a company that is expected to have nearly $400 million in revenue next year that we expect to grow in the mid-teens or more, excluding expected synergies. Not only will this accelerate our organic growth profile once it is in the base, but we expect its favorable margins to result in a several hundred basis point increase in the overall company's operating profit rate. 
Given these dynamics, we expect the deal will provide significant immediate accretion to our adjusted EPS, which we expect will compound in future years. We have a lot to discuss this morning. But before we dive in fully, I wanted to give Gene Lay, BioLegend's Founder and CEO, the opportunity to introduce himself and share his thoughts and excitement for this combination and the opportunities it brings from his perspective. Gene?"

I want to formally welcome you and your team to the PerkinElmer family. And as we've discussed over the last few months, as we've gotten to know each other, I'm so excited for what this means for both companies and what the combined business is going to be able to do together in the years to come. 
I'm now on Slide 4. Let me tell you some more about Bio legal. It's a world-class organization, propelled by a strong team, top to bottom. The company has achieved leading market positions in a number of attractive high-growth end markets such as antibody development, flow cytometry reagents, proteogenomics, magnetic cell separation, recombinant proteins, cytokines and growth factors. 
These represent a total addressable market of approximately $6 billion, with areas of expertise that span from upstream research and immunology, oncology, stem cell research, neuroscience and infectious disease to downstream bioprocessing. It's more than 700 employees across the U.S. and Asia Pacific, Europe serve over 10,000 customers in 130 countries. The company also has a stellar track record of new product introduction, launching over 1,000 NPIs annually in both new and existing markets. 
Moreover, all of its revenue is recurring in nature and its world-class manufacturing and distribution capabilities translate to its very attractive incremental margin profile. Finally, what you'll come to recognize is that both PerkinElmer and BioLegend share a fierce passion and commitment to focusing on the customer. BioLegend's mission is helping scientists accelerate research and discovery by providing the highest quality products at an outstanding value, along with superior customer service and technical support. 
But most said, the BioLegend team is passionate about making a mark on the world and being legendary in their own right at pushing the boundaries of biological understanding. 
Slide -- as you can see on Slide 5, Bioligen's headquarters reside at its beautiful new expansive state-of-the-art campus in San Diego, California, where we are today. This 4-building campus in San Diego will become the global center of excellence for PerkinElmer's reagent content development to serve our entire life science portfolio. Combining our company's expertise to create an even more nimble and powerful reagents innovation engine will enable us to accelerate the pace of new product introduction in existing markets as well as in new high-growth areas of focus for the company, such as cell and gene therapy and single-cell analysis. 
For example, we will be able to combine BioLegend's leading position in proteogenomics with PerkinElmer's well-recognized Cisbio kits to aid in the upstream discovery and identification of new peptides and then measure analytes downstream for drug target studies. We can support customers both from the low to high throughput testing as well as potentially at the single cell level with our Honeycomb high technology. 
We also believe that our Diagnostics business will benefit from faster new antibody-based assay development, with lower costs by having in-house access to not only an existing antibody library, but also now an expanded global team of new product development experts. As I'll touch on a bit more later, we expect this combined research reagent franchise to leverage PerkinElmer's global scale and each other's strong customer relationships to enable even greater commercial success. 
By leveraging each company's core strength, its people as well as the combined innovation engines PerkinElmer's geographic and channel breadth along with focused research reagent operational excellence, we will elevate the already strong franchises of both companies in the minds of customers, ultimately resulting in even faster growth than they would on their own. 
This is why we expect this combination to result in more than $100 million of annual synergy -- revenue synergies by year 5. On Slide 6, you'll see that with Bio Legends nearly $400 million in expected revenue next year. combined with our existing over $300 million of research reagent business. PerkinElmer will now have one of the largest antibody and research reagent businesses in the industry, with annual revenues of approximately $700 million. Through a healthy end market growth, share gains and new product innovation in emerging high-growth areas, we expect this combined business to grow at a low double-digit rate annually for the foreseeable future. 
I'd now like to ask Jamey to provide more detail on what this combination means for PerkinElmer from a financial perspective and share his perspective on the strategic alignment of the combined company. Jamey?"

It's been great to meet Gene and the team who are here with us today, and I'm equally excited about the impact we can have on improving outcomes for all stakeholders. The addition of BioLegend further accelerates the transformation of the new PerkinElmer, and it positions us to deliver even stronger financial performance top to bottom in the years ahead. 
As we most recently told you at our Investor Day last month, we outlined here again on Slide 7. We expect the existing PerkinElmer business to grow 5% to 7% organically per year through 2023 and in the mid-single to high single-digit range longer term as we deliver on our strategic imperatives. Given the size and expected growth of BioLegend, combined with the revenue synergies we expect to start contributing in year 1, we see the combined company growing at least 100 basis points faster annually than our previous outlook in both the near and long term. 
As you know, with an expected close by the end of this year, BioLegend won't start positively impacting our organic growth until 2023 when it's added to our base. And since BioLegend's revenue is entirely reagents and consumables, PerkinElmer will now have around 75% of its revenue by recurring in nature, up a few hundred basis points from pre-COVID levels. 
Given BioLegend's accretive margin profile, we now expect overall company operating margins to increase by approximately 300 basis points from current levels by 2023. We expect our previously communicated goal of 50 to 75 basis points of annual operating margin expansion to continue, with improvements in the existing PKI business to largely come at the gross margin line, from our operational excellence initiatives that we highlighted at our recent analyst meeting, while we expect BioLegend's rapid top line growth to provide some opportunities at the OpEx line, while continuing to reinvest heavily in R&D as the company has throughout its history. 
Today, more than 50% of BioLegend's business is through their e-commerce channels. We plan to leverage this with our Horizon and Cisbio platforms to further scale this ecosystem. With approximately $700 million in annualized life science research revenues, we have the opportunity to rapidly scale our go-to-market synergies across the portfolio. 
Finally, with nearly all of BioLegend's revenue coming from biopharma and academic end markets. And while we will continue to invest organically in our more cyclical businesses, we expect that in 2023, more than 80% of PerkinElmer's total revenue would come from our life science and diagnostic businesses. In terms of the structure of the deal, I think it's very advantageous from many angles. Let's walk through them here on Slide 8. 
First, while this is by far the largest deal in the history of PerkinElmer and is adding tremendous scale to our life science franchise, we are able to combine the businesses while managing our leverage and also closely aligning our interest with those of existing BioLegend's shareholders, who clearly see the potential over the coming years in the combined organization. 
And while we have fully underwritten bridge financing already in place and we'll seek to take out appropriate permanent debt in the coming months, it is exciting to see BioLegend's existing concentrated shareholder base will now make up slightly more than 10% of PerkinElmer's overall ownership. Along with Gene and the other BioLegend shareholders, we feel this structure provides near-term cash compensation for the great business that has been built over the nearly 2 decades, while maintaining a significant interest in seeing and participating in the future success of the combined business going forward, which we all agree is very bright. 
Following the completion of this deal, we expect our net leverage to go slightly over 4x in the first part of 2022 but we plan to delever to under 3x net debt to adjusted EBITDA within 18 to 24 months as we are committed and fully expect to maintain investment-grade ratings. In addition to the promising future, we believe the company holds from an innovation, customer and employee opportunity perspective, we expect the overall company's faster top line growth and enhanced margin profile should deliver an incremental $0.30 of adjusted EPS accretion in the first year post close and greater than $0.50 of accretion in the second year for our shareholders, with a high single-digit return on invested capital in year 6. 
As you can see, I think this combination hits all the right buttons from a strategic, cultural, financial and future innovation perspective, and I couldn't be more excited for the future of PerkinElmer. 
I'd now like to turn it back to Prahlad for some final comments on the combination."

As you get to better know BioLegend and its entrepreneur team, I think you will find that by joining with PerkinElmer, it is creating a true antibody and life science reagent powerhouse that will have the scale to be able to accelerate scientific advancement and new product innovation across the company and around the world. 
I believe this combination positions PerkinElmer as a best-in-class preclinical life sciences franchise that is uniquely positioned to empower our external partners to deliver truly legendary discoveries over the coming years as the power of both companies' employees and assets come together under one roof. I expect that this heightened pace of collaborative innovation, combined with our broad commercial reach will lead to faster overall growth for PerkinElmer while having an elevated margin profile with immediate significant EPS accretion. 
Even more importantly, BioLegend's joining forces with PerkinElmer complements the value from the other life science businesses that have joined our company over the last few years, such as Cisbio, Horizon Discovery and very recently, Nexolon Bioscience and Citan Biotech. I couldn't be more excited for where I see us going in the future. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Jamey to discuss our 2Q results and updated guidance for the remainder of the year.

268363,1671802660,2350905,"PerkinElmer, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2021",2021-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Revvity, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Prahlad. The team performed extremely well during the second quarter with all businesses and end markets returning to growth versus 2019 levels. Our non-COVID order growth again exceeded our strong non-COVID revenue growth for the third quarter",1657,"Thanks, Prahlad. 
The team performed extremely well during the second quarter with all businesses and end markets returning to growth versus 2019 levels. Our non-COVID order growth again exceeded our strong non-COVID revenue growth for the third quarter in a row, while our COVID revenue came in solidly above our previous expectation despite declining sequentially as expected. During the second quarter, adjusted revenue grew 51% compared to the last year to $1.2 billion and included a 5% foreign exchange and a 6% acquisition tailwind. 
Organic revenue grew 41%, 12 percentage points better than what we previously communicated as our non-COVID revenue grew 28% organically, well above the high teens rate we were expecting. Our COVID-related products and services contributed $365 million in the quarter, solidly above our previous $325 million expectation as demand for our PCR tests and RNA extraction solutions did not fall off to the degree we previously expected, especially in the areas that have lower vaccination rates and increased presence of variants such as in parts of Europe and Southeast Asia. 
Our turnkey lab and lab testing solutions in the State of California and the United Kingdom performed in line with expectations, resulting in our core COVID products generating approximately $165 million in revenue in the quarter. By business, Diagnostics, representing 58% of total sales, increased 59% organically with 40% organic growth in non-COVID products. Strength in our immunodiagnostics business led the way, driven by COVID and non-COVID sales with EUROIMMUN's non-COVID business continuing to rebound strongly. 
Our reproductive health business was able to offset continued birth rate pressures and post double-digit growth year-over-year and mid-single-digit growth on a 2-year average basis. Our applied genomics business saw a strong rebound in non-COVID-related demand, which doubled versus last year, offsetting expected declines in COVID-related products. 
Discovery & Analytical Solutions, representing 42% of total sales, increased 22% organically, with broad-based growth across life sciences, food and applied. From a geographic perspective, non-COVID organic growth was extremely well balanced with all 3 regions growing similarly, while China also grew in the high 20% range. Operationally, it was another strong quarter of leveraging the significant revenue growth we experienced as adjusted operating margins expanded 535 basis points to 33.5%. And driven by volume leverage, business mix and productivity programs. 
Adjusted earnings per share of $2.83 in the second quarter, increased 81% relative to the second quarter of 2020 and was $0.48 above our guidance. Looking further into the key drivers within our segments, let's start with the Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment, which grew 22% organically versus the same period last year. By end market, we experienced well balanced double-digit growth in each segment, with Life Sciences being up nearly 20% against a flat comp in the second quarter of 2020. This was driven by strong growth in both pharma biotech and academic government end markets. 
Discovery grew more than 30%, while Analytical grew more than 20% year-over-year. Late in the quarter, we also closed on our acquisition of Nexolon and are excited to add their team and innovative cell counting technologies to our life sciences platform. Food posted strong growth in the second quarter, which was aided by fairly easy year-ago comparisons. Our include food safety business in China continued to rebound, growing 60% compared to the second quarter of last year. Cannabis activity began to return and contribute to growth, and we expect this level of impact to continue to improve over the remainder of the year. 
Industrial and Environmental Safety grew in line with our overall DAS segment, with balanced performance from a geographic perspective with strength in both spectroscopy and chromatography and notable demand from semiconductor customers. Turning to Diagnostics. As I mentioned earlier, our organic growth increased 59% and with double-digit growth in Europe and Asia and triple-digit growth in the Americas due to our larger lab services business here now compared to a year ago. 
While COVID revenue was up year-over-year, our non-COVID diagnostic business still grew approximately 40% compared to the second quarter of last year and posted double-digit growth on a 2-year average basis. Our immunodiagnostics franchise led the way, posting over 100% year-over-year growth for the quarter as incremental COVID revenue was joined by nearly 50% growth in non-COVID revenue led by both EUROIMMUN and Tula. While RTPCR COVA demand did slow as testing has come down, COVID serology demand continues to remain consistent to the last few quarters, though down significantly from a year ago period when the initial rush of demand made its way into the market. 
Oxford Immunotec has also begun to see some nice COVID-related demand outside of the United States for T-SPOT Discovery SARS COV Kit, which measures T cell immune responses. Finally, shortly after the quarter ended, we closed on our acquisition of immunodiagnostic systems, and we can't wait to see what the collaboration it will have with our strong EUROIMMUN franchise in both the near term, but maybe even more importantly, the longer term. 
In our applied genomics business, organic revenue grew nearly 20% overall despite COVID-related demand dropping off meaningfully as non-COVID demand doubled compared to the year ago period. The strong non-COVID growth in Applied Genomics was broad-based and included key contributions from newer external partnerships and recent product introductions. We've also seen an uptick from non-COVID NGS customers who appear to be pivoting back to their former areas of focus as the pandemic moderates. 
From a COVID perspective, we've seen some nice wins recently in Asia, including supporting COVID testing capacity for this year's Olympics in Japan. We've also seen an uptick in next-generation sequencing demand related to COVID as additional variants continue to emerge around the world. Our reproductive health franchise grew high teens off a negative year ago comparison, while on a 2-year average basis, the business still grew in the mid-single digits. The growth was well balanced geographically in the quarter, with all regions posting double-digit growth versus the second quarter of last year. 
While birth rates appear to remain under pressure globally, our neonatal and prenatal businesses still posted solid growth due to continued geographic and menu expansions while our lab businesses grew strongly. In Asia, several new product introductions such as the Superflex, which is being used for preeclampsia screening is continuing to help offset birthrate related pressures. 
Moving to below-the-line items. Adjusted net interest and other expense for the second quarter was approximately $15 million, while our adjusted tax rate was 20%. Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.4 billion of debt and $600 million of cash. Adjusted free cash flow was $267 million in the quarter, which equates to an adjusted free cash flow conversion rate of 84%, including a large payment that we received a few days after, later than expected during the first week of the third quarter, our free cash flow conversion would have been again over 100% of adjusted net income. 
Finally, we exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 0.9x even with the first quarter of 2021. -- As it relates to guidance, we now anticipate full year 2021 adjusted revenue of $4.57 billion. This guidance assumes COVID revenues of approximately $1.14 billion compared to our prior guidance of $1.10 billion and the $1.05 billion we did last year. This update accounts for the 2Q outperformance while leaving our second half COVID expectations unchanged. We expect our non-COVID revenue to continue to remain strong over the remainder of the year, though we will not be facing quite as easy year-ago comparisons as we did this quarter. 
This translates into us now expecting non-COVID organic growth of 15% for the year, up from our 11% previous outlook. These assumptions do not account for any incremental lockdowns and/or any COVID-related disruptions. Additionally, we are anticipating a 6% benefit from acquisitions now that both Nexolon and IDS have closed and a 3% benefit from foreign exchange for the full year. 
We are not taking into account the Syrian acquisition, which is now expected to close at the end of August nor anything related to Bio Legends. On the bottom line, we are now expecting adjusted earnings per share of $9.88, which assumes approximately $58 million in adjusted interest and other expense, a tax rate of 21% and an average diluted share count in the range of 112 million to 113 million shares. 
For the third quarter, we are forecasting adjusted revenue of approximately $1 billion, representing a minus 5% year-over-year decline and our total company organic growth due to the expected year-over-year declines in COVID revenue and a 7% and 2% contribution from acquisitions and foreign exchange, respectively. Embedded in this guidance is $165 million of COVID-related revenue compared to $288 million a year ago and organic growth of 12% in our non-COVID product lines. 
In terms of adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter, we are forecasting $1.62, which assumes approximately $16 million of interest and other expenses, a 21% tax rate and a diluted share count of 112 million to 113 million shares. All of this guidance is detailed in the second to last page of today's presentation. 
In closing, the business continues to perform extremely well so far in 2021. With the foundational pillars we highlighted at our recent Analyst Day and now the exciting addition of BIoLeGend, I feel we are extremely well positioned for what lies ahead from a customer and scientific innovation perspective, the opportunities this company has to offer its employees and the strong financial profile we have for our shareholders. 
This perspective is purely a reflection of the tremendous efforts of my 14,000, soon to be more than 15,000 colleagues around the globe that have helped build the company into what it is today, and have laid the foundation for more significant growth in the future. I'd like to now turn it back over to the operator to begin Q&A."

I mentioned that every geography across the globe is up almost equivalently, every end market is up. It's almost difficult to find a spot that we are concerned about. 
So it's really everything we have. I can't really highlight one for you. Life sciences is strong, Applied is kicking back in, Food is strong, reproductive health is doing extremely well, immunodiagnostics, I mentioned EUROIMMUN being up strong double digits. And everybody is above the 2019 levels. And many of these end markets are now on an average 2-year stack comparison at least mid-single digit, if not double-digit growth comparing to 2019. So Life Sciences, as an example, is up 10% on average over the last 2 years."

I'm going to start by building off of Catherine's first question on synergies, but take a slightly different angle. It seems like there's a lot of synergies or at least some synergies to be had between BioLegend and some of the recently closed and pending acquisitions. 
I'm just wondering if I'm thinking about these right. And if so, with a more well-rounded portfolio, how are you feeling about what you have now in this category to essentially compete on level footing with some of the incumbents and essentially how much that plays into your overall synergy targets or potential for upside."

As you pointed out, historically, while we've had a strong portfolio of immunoassays to support drug discovery for both small molecule and biological approaches, our recent acquisitions they were aimed to broaden our offering along the whole workflow from basic research and target identification all the way to manufacturing in with a special focus around growth areas such as cell and gene therapy that I've pointed out earlier. 
The combined position positions us much better to deliver solutions, for example, to offer engineered cell lines with matched downstream assets or specific QC production cell lines. To give you a few examples, for example, with Horizon, BioLegend could use the engineered cell lines for reagent validation. And there are many tools that are complementary with BioLegend's content development efforts around antibodies, model systems, et cetera. 
Similarly, on Cisbio, the HTRF and alpha Liza assays, they are very synergistic. And we could go on down with Bayou Scientific or Exelon. The opportunities are there for each of these businesses. And once we start connecting the dots, we are able to bring total solutions into the marketplace. And that is why this is a really exciting opportunity for us."

And then we put in at least mid-teens plus is what we said, and that's before synergies. Back to Prahlad's point, there's -- I talked about geographic reach, Prahlad talked about all the complementary nature of all of our acquisitions. I mean antibodies are used in everything we do, all the life sciences reagents, everything in diagnostics. And our teams to the extent that we could started to understand the technology that PerkinElmer has and BioLegend has, that number from a synergy standpoint is more difficult to predict. 
The geographic reach is easier to quantify. So I think there should be upside to this $100 million, but the teams need to understand the products a little bit more. But the $380 million is 2022 and they've been historically growing 20% plus over the last years. Even during COVID, we grew 4%, 5%."

So food, it's nice to see. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, back quite nicely. The analytical business is coming back. 
Reproductive health, also, the utilization started to uptick last year, but we're coming off a little bit of an easier comp from a birth rate and testing perspective. So really all facets of the business are performing nicely. EUROIMMUN is doing extremely well. So I mentioned EUROIMMUN being up strong double digits. Much of that was led by China. So overall, probably a little bit better than we expected. And as you look to the second half, I don't think we see that slowing down at this point."

And we can provide better cross-selling opportunities in pharma.

I know you said $100 million. Obviously, that would imply a steep drop in 2022. I would assume expectations are more gradual there. Just thinking about in the context of while peers are bringing down collates numbers, but layering in things like back-to-school testing emerging variants and then obviously, the potential for this thing to pick back up seasonally.

It had everything to do with the utilization of the strong installed base that we put out there. So certainly, we're becoming increasingly confident that there's going to be some amount of testing that's here for the foreseeable future. 
I think we're already starting to see that in the third quarter, early part of the third quarter. I think some amount serology testing, PCR testing, antigen even is starting to get -- make a little bit of a inroads there variant testing T cells. So I'd say we're more confident leading into 2022 that there -- the $100 million of durable COVID revenue was safe, both from a utilization standpoint, but then I think testing will remain around for a while here and should provide upside to that number."

So that's encouraging the maxing business in food safety is growing nicely. -- our applied business. I think that's been a testimony to the NPIs and the organic investment we've made. So I mentioned the semiconductor business and our Nexeon 5000, which is extremely sensitive, it's terrific for smaller wafers and fabs. Our new IR product is going well.

If you have not yet received a copy of our earnings press release or slide presentation or BioLegend-related slide presentation or press release, you may find copies of them on the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com.
Please note, this call is being webcast and will be archived on PerkinElmer's website until August 9, 2021.

Statements or comments made on this call will be forward-looking statements, which may include, but are not necessarily limited to financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions.
These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested by any forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors which are discussed in detail in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements in the future, even if our estimates change.
So you should not rely on any of today's forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date after today. During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures we plan to use during this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available as an attachment to our earnings press release.

Building off our June 24 Analyst Day, today represents another milestone in the transformation of the new PerkinElmer. The addition of BioLegend expands our presence in the attractive high-growth antibody and cytokine market, enhances our content development capabilities across all PerkinElmer detection technologies and transforms our e-commerce scale overnight.
Personally, I couldn't be more thrilled to work with Gene and the team going forward, and I'm excited to see the impact the combined company can have on scientific innovation. Culturally, the combination is a natural fit with our mutual focus on customers, innovation and internal cross-functional collaboration. BioLegend is a global leader in innovative antibodies with leading positions in several attractive markets, including imaging, proteogenomics, multiplex assays and bioprocessing.
The combination will enable us to create a global platform of research reagents which, as we'll share with you today, will fundamentally change the trajectory for both organizations. Combining PerkinElmer and BioLegend will empower customers in preclinical discovery who are looking to identify, develop and optimize novel therapeutics and, in turn, support them in bringing the right therapeutics to market faster.
Fundamentally, bringing BioLegend into the PerkinElmer family will further enhance our core right to win in biopharma and academia. And from a financial perspective, we expect this exciting combination to lead to faster growth, stronger margins and more rapid product -- new product innovation with a strategically aligned structure to ensure success.
While Jamey will touch on it in more specifics, I wanted to provide you some perspective on what this deal means for the company overall. For the slightly more than $5 billion in total consideration, we are combining with a company that is expected to have nearly $400 million in revenue next year that we expect to grow in the mid-teens or more, excluding expected synergies. Not only will this accelerate our organic growth profile once it is in the base, but we expect its favorable margins to result in a several hundred basis point increase in the overall company's operating profit rate.
Given these dynamics, we expect the deal will provide significant immediate accretion to our adjusted EPS, which we expect will compound in future years. We have a lot to discuss this morning. But before we dive in fully, I wanted to give Gene Lay, BioLegend's Founder and CEO, the opportunity to introduce himself and share his thoughts and excitement for this combination and the opportunities it brings from his perspective.

I want to formally welcome you and your team to the PerkinElmer family. And as we've discussed over the last few months, as we've gotten to know each other, I'm so excited for what this means for both companies and what the combined business is going to be able to do together in the years to come.
I'm now on Slide 4. Let me tell you some more about BioLegend. It's a world-class organization, propelled by a strong team, top to bottom. The company has achieved leading market positions in a number of attractive high-growth end markets such as antibody development, flow cytometry reagents, proteogenomics, magnetic cell separation, recombinant proteins, cytokines and growth factors.
These represent a total addressable market of approximately $6 billion, with areas of expertise that span from upstream research and immunology, oncology, stem cell research, neuroscience and infectious disease to downstream bioprocessing. It's more than 700 employees across the U.S. and Asia Pacific, Europe serve over 10,000 customers in 130 countries. The company also has a stellar track record of new product introduction, launching over 1,000 NPIs annually in both new and existing markets.
Moreover, all of its revenue is recurring in nature and its world-class manufacturing and distribution capabilities translate to its very attractive incremental margin profile. Finally, what you'll come to recognize is that both PerkinElmer and BioLegend share a fierce passion and commitment to focusing on the customer. BioLegend's mission is helping scientists accelerate research and discovery by providing the highest quality products at an outstanding value, along with superior customer service and technical support. But more  succinctly said, the BioLegend team is passionate about making a mark on the world and being legendary in their own right at pushing the boundaries of biological understanding.
Slide -- as you can see on Slide 5, BioLegend's headquarters reside at its beautiful new expansive state-of-the-art campus in San Diego, California, where we are today. This 4-building campus in San Diego will become the global center of excellence for PerkinElmer's reagent content development to serve our entire life science portfolio. Combining our company's expertise to create an even more nimble and powerful reagents innovation engine will enable us to accelerate the pace of new product introduction in existing markets as well as in new high-growth areas of focus for the company, such as cell and gene therapy and single-cell analysis.
For example, we will be able to combine BioLegend's leading position in proteogenomics with PerkinElmer's well-recognized Cisbio kits to aid in the upstream discovery and identification of new peptides and then measure analytes downstream for drug target studies. We can support customers both from the low to high throughput testing as well as potentially at the single cell level with our Honeycomb high technology.
We also believe that our Diagnostics business will benefit from faster new antibody-based assay development, with lower costs by having in-house access to not only an existing antibody library, but also now an expanded global team of new product development experts. As I'll touch on a bit more later, we expect this combined research reagent franchise to leverage PerkinElmer's global scale and each other's strong customer relationships to enable even greater commercial success.
By leveraging each company's core strength, its people as well as the combined innovation engines PerkinElmer's geographic and channel breadth along with focused research reagent operational excellence, we will elevate the already strong franchises of both companies in the minds of customers, ultimately resulting in even faster growth than they would on their own. This is why we expect this combination to result in more than $100 million of annual synergy -- revenue synergies by year 5.
On Slide 6, you'll see that with BioLegend nearly $400 million in expected revenue next year, combined with our existing over $300 million of research reagent business, PerkinElmer will now have one of the largest antibody and research reagent businesses in the industry, with annual revenues of approximately $700 million. Through a healthy end market growth, share gains and new product innovation in emerging high-growth areas, we expect this combined business to grow at a low double-digit rate annually for the foreseeable future.
I'd now like to ask Jamey to provide more detail on what this combination means for PerkinElmer from a financial perspective and share his perspective on the strategic alignment of the combined company. Jamey?"

It's been great to meet Gene and the team who are here with us today, and I'm equally excited about the impact we can have on improving outcomes for all stakeholders. The addition of BioLegend further accelerates the transformation of the new PerkinElmer, and it positions us to deliver even stronger financial performance top to bottom in the years ahead. 
As we most recently told you at our Investor Day last month, we outlined here again on Slide 7, we expect the existing PerkinElmer business to grow 5% to 7% organically per year through 2023 and in the mid-single to high single-digit range longer term as we deliver on our strategic imperatives. Given the size and expected growth of BioLegend, combined with the revenue synergies we expect to start contributing in year 1, we see the combined company growing at least 100 basis points faster annually than our previous outlook in both the near and long term.
As you know, with an expected close by the end of this year, BioLegend won't start positively impacting our organic growth until 2023 when it's added to our base. And since BioLegend's revenue is entirely reagents and consumables, PerkinElmer will now have around 75% of its revenue by recurring in nature, up a few hundred basis points from pre-COVID levels.
Given BioLegend's accretive margin profile, we now expect overall company operating margins to increase by approximately 300 basis points from current levels by 2023. We expect our previously communicated goal of 50 to 75 basis points of annual operating margin expansion to continue, with improvements in the existing PKI business to largely come at the gross margin line, from our operational excellence initiatives that we highlighted at our recent analyst meeting, while we expect BioLegend's rapid top line growth to provide some opportunities at the OpEx line, while continuing to reinvest heavily in R&D as the company has throughout its history.
Today, more than 50% of BioLegend's business is through their e-commerce channels. We plan to leverage this with our Horizon and Cisbio platforms to further scale this ecosystem. With approximately $700 million in annualized life science research revenues, we have the opportunity to rapidly scale our go-to-market synergies across the portfolio.
Finally, with nearly all of BioLegend's revenue coming from biopharma and academic end markets and while we will continue to invest organically in our more cyclical businesses, we expect that in 2023 more than 80% of PerkinElmer's total revenue would come from our life science and diagnostic businesses.
In terms of the structure of the deal, I think it's very advantageous from many angles. Let's walk through them here on Slide 8. First, while this is by far the largest deal in the history of PerkinElmer and is adding tremendous scale to our life science franchise, we are able to combine the businesses while managing our leverage and also closely aligning our interest with those of existing BioLegend's shareholders, who clearly see the potential over the coming years in the combined organization.
And while we have fully underwritten bridge financing already in place and we'll seek to take out appropriate permanent debt in the coming months, it is exciting to see BioLegend's existing concentrated shareholder base will now make up slightly more than 10% of PerkinElmer's overall ownership. Along with Gene and the other BioLegend shareholders, we feel this structure provides near term cash compensation for the great business that has been built over the nearly 2 decades, while maintaining a significant interest in seeing and participating in the future success of the combined business going forward, which we all agree is very bright.
Following the completion of this deal, we expect our net leverage to go slightly over 4x in the first part of 2022 but we plan to delever to under 3x net debt to adjusted EBITDA within 18 to 24 months as we are committed and fully expect to maintain investment-grade ratings. In addition to the promising future, we believe the company holds from an innovation, customer and employee opportunity perspective, we expect the overall company's faster top line growth and enhanced margin profile should deliver an incremental $0.30 of adjusted EPS accretion in the first year post close and greater than $0.50 of accretion in the second year for our shareholders, with a high single-digit return on invested capital in year 6.
As you can see, I think this combination hits all the right buttons from a strategic, cultural, financial and future innovation perspective, and I couldn't be more excited for the future of PerkinElmer.
I'd now like to turn it back to Prahlad for some final comments on the combination."

As you get to better know BioLegend and its entrepreneur team, I think you will find that by joining with PerkinElmer, it is creating a true antibody and life science reagent powerhouse that will have the scale to be able to accelerate scientific advancement and new product innovation across the company and around the world.
I believe this combination positions PerkinElmer as a best-in-class preclinical life sciences franchise that is uniquely positioned to empower our external partners to deliver truly legendary discoveries over the coming years as the power of both companies' employees and assets come together under one roof. I expect that this heightened pace of collaborative innovation, combined with our broad commercial reach will lead to faster overall growth for PerkinElmer while having an elevated margin profile with immediate significant EPS accretion.
Even more importantly, BioLegend's joining forces with PerkinElmer complements the value from the other life science businesses that have joined our company over the last few years, such as Cisbio, Horizon Discovery and very recently, Nexcelom Bioscience and SIRION Biotech. I couldn't be more excited for where I see us going in the future. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Jamey to discuss our 2Q results and updated guidance for the remainder of the year.

268363,1671802660,2350945,"PerkinElmer, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2021",2021-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Revvity, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Prahlad.The team performed extremely well during the second quarter with all businesses and end markets returning to growth versus 2019 levels.

The team performed extremely well during the second quarter with all businesses and end markets returning to growth versus 2019 levels. Our non-COVID order growth again exceeded our strong non-COVID revenue growth for the third quarter in a row, while our COVID revenue came in solidly above our previous expectation despite declining sequentially as expected.
During the second quarter, adjusted revenue grew 51% compared to the last year to $1.2 billion and included a 5% foreign exchange and a 6% acquisition tailwind. Organic revenue grew 41%, 12 percentage points better than what we previously communicated as our non-COVID revenue grew 28% organically, well above the high teens rate we were expecting. Our COVID-related products and services contributed $365 million in the quarter, solidly above our previous $325 million expectation as demand for our PCR tests and RNA extraction solutions did not fall off to the degree we previously expected, especially in the areas that have lower vaccination rates and increased presence of variants such as in parts of Europe and Southeast Asia.
Our turnkey lab and lab testing solutions in the State of California and the United Kingdom performed in line with expectations, resulting in our core COVID products generating approximately $165 million in revenue in the quarter.
By business, Diagnostics, representing 58% of total sales, increased 59% organically with 40% organic growth in non-COVID products. Strength in our immunodiagnostics business led the way, driven by COVID and non-COVID sales with EUROIMMUN's non-COVID business continuing to rebound strongly.
Our reproductive health business was able to offset continued birth rate pressures and post double-digit growth year-over-year and mid-single-digit growth on a 2-year average basis. Our applied genomics business saw a strong rebound in non-COVID-related demand, which doubled versus last year, offsetting expected declines in COVID-related products.
Discovery & Analytical Solutions, representing 42% of total sales, increased 22% organically, with broad-based growth across life sciences, food and applied.
From a geographic perspective, non-COVID organic growth was extremely well balanced with all 3 regions growing similarly, while China also grew in the high 20% range. Operationally, it was another strong quarter of leveraging the significant revenue growth we experienced as adjusted operating margins expanded 535 basis points to 33.5% driven by volume leverage, business mix and productivity programs.
Adjusted earnings per share of $2.83 in the second quarter, increased 81% relative to the second quarter of 2020 and was $0.48 above our guidance.
Looking further into the key drivers within our segments, let's start with the Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment, which grew 22% organically versus the same period last year. By end market, we experienced well balanced double-digit growth in each segment, with Life Sciences being up nearly 20% against a flat comp in the second quarter of 2020. This was driven by strong growth in both pharma biotech and academic government end markets.
Discovery grew more than 30%, while Analytical grew more than 20% year-over-year. Late in the quarter, we also closed on our acquisition of Nexcelom and are excited to add their team and innovative cell counting technologies to our life sciences platform. Food posted strong growth in the second quarter, which was aided by fairly easy year-ago comparisons. Our Meizheng food safety business in China continued to rebound, growing 60% compared to the second quarter of last year. Cannabis activity began to return and contribute to growth, and we expect this level of impact to continue to improve over the remainder of the year.
Industrial and Environmental Safety grew in line with our overall DAS segment, with balanced performance from a geographic perspective with strength in both spectroscopy and chromatography and notable demand from semiconductor customers.
Turning to Diagnostics. As I mentioned earlier, our organic growth increased 59% with double-digit growth in Europe and Asia and triple-digit growth in the Americas due to our larger lab services business here now compared to a year ago.
While COVID revenue was up year-over-year, our non-COVID diagnostic business still grew approximately 40% compared to the second quarter of last year and posted double-digit growth on a 2-year average basis. Our immunodiagnostics franchise led the way, posting over 100% year-over-year growth for the quarter as incremental COVID revenue was joined by nearly 50% growth in non-COVID revenue led by both EUROIMMUN and Tulip. While RTPCR COVID demand did slow as testing has come down, COVID serology demand continues to remain consistent in the last few quarters, though down significantly from a year ago period when the initial rush of demand made its way into the market.
Oxford Immunotec has also begun to see some nice COVID-related demand outside of the United States for its T-SPOT Discovery SARS-CoV kit, which measures T cell immune responses.
Finally, shortly after the quarter ended, we closed on our acquisition of Immunodiagnostic Systems, and we can't wait to see what the collaboration it will have with our strong EUROIMMUN franchise in both the near term, but maybe even more importantly, the longer term.
In our Applied Genomics business, organic revenue grew nearly 20% overall despite COVID-related demand dropping off meaningfully as non-COVID demand doubled compared to the year ago period. The strong non-COVID growth in Applied Genomics was broad-based and included key contributions from newer external partnerships and recent product introductions. We've also seen an uptick from non-COVID NGS customers who appear to be pivoting back to their former areas of focus as the pandemic moderates.
From a COVID perspective, we've seen some nice wins recently in Asia, including supporting COVID testing capacity for this year's Olympics in Japan. We've also seen an uptick in next-generation sequencing demand related to COVID as additional variants continue to emerge around the world.
Our reproductive health franchise grew high teens off a negative year ago comparison, while on a 2-year average basis, the business still grew in the mid-single digits. The growth was well balanced geographically in the quarter, with all regions posting double-digit growth versus the second quarter of last year. While birth rates appear to remain under pressure globally, our neonatal and prenatal businesses still posted solid growth due to continued geographic and menu expansions while our lab businesses grew strongly. In Asia, several new product introductions such as the Superflex, which is being used for preeclampsia screening is continuing to help offset birthrate related pressures.
Moving to below-the-line items. Adjusted net interest and other expense for the second quarter was approximately $15 million, while our adjusted tax rate was 20%.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.4 billion of debt and $600 million of cash. Adjusted free cash flow was $267 million in the quarter, which equates to an adjusted free cash flow conversion rate of 84%, including a large payment that we received a few days after, later than expected during the first week of the third quarter, our free cash flow conversion would have been again over 100% of adjusted net income.
Finally, we exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 0.9x even with the first quarter of 2021. As it relates to guidance, we now anticipate full year 2021 adjusted revenue of $4.57 billion. This guidance assumes COVID revenues of approximately $1.14 billion compared to our prior guidance of $1.10 billion and the $1.05 billion we did last year. This update accounts for the 2Q outperformance while leaving our second half COVID expectations unchanged. We expect our non-COVID revenue to continue to remain strong over the remainder of the year, though we will not be facing quite as easy year-ago comparisons as we did this quarter.
This translates into us now expecting non-COVID organic growth of 15% for the year, up from our 11% previous outlook. These assumptions do not account for any incremental lockdowns and/or any COVID-related disruptions. Additionally, we are anticipating a 6% benefit from acquisitions now that both Nexcelom and IDS have closed and a 3% benefit from foreign exchange for the full year. We are not taking into account the SIRION acquisition, which is now expected to close at the end of August nor anything related to BioLegend.
On the bottom line, we are now expecting adjusted earnings per share of $9.88, which assumes approximately $58 million in adjusted interest and other expense, a tax rate of 21% and an average diluted share count in the range of 112 million to 113 million shares.
For the third quarter, we are forecasting adjusted revenue of approximately $1 billion, representing a minus 5% year-over-year decline and our total company organic growth due to the expected year-over-year declines in COVID revenue and a 7% and 2% contribution from acquisitions and foreign exchange, respectively. Embedded in this guidance is $165 million of COVID-related revenue compared to $288 million a year ago and organic growth of 12% in our non-COVID product lines.
In terms of adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter, we are forecasting $1.62, which assumes approximately $16 million of interest and other expenses, a 21% tax rate and a diluted share count of 112 million to 113 million shares. All of this guidance is detailed in the second to last page of today's presentation.
In closing, the business continues to perform extremely well so far in 2021. With the foundational pillars we highlighted at our recent Analyst Day and now the exciting addition of BioLegend, I feel we are extremely well positioned for what lies ahead from a customer and scientific innovation perspective, the opportunities this company has to offer its employees and the strong financial profile we have for our shareholders.
This perspective is purely a reflection of the tremendous efforts of my 14,000, soon to be more than 15,000 colleagues around the globe that have helped build the company into what it is today and have laid the foundation for more significant growth in the future.
I'd like to now turn it back over to the operator to begin Q&A."

I mean, as you pointed out, historically, while we've had a strong portfolio of immunoassays to support drug discovery for both small molecule and biological approaches, our recent acquisitions, they were aimed to broaden our offering along the whole workflow from basic research and target identification all the way to manufacturing and QC, with a special focus around growth areas such as cell and gene therapy that I've pointed out earlier.
The combined position positions us much better to deliver solutions, for example, to offer engineered cell lines with matched downstream assays or specific QC production cell lines. To give you a few examples, for example, with Horizon, BioLegend could use the engineered cell lines for reagent validation. And there are many tools that are complementary with BioLegend's content development efforts around antibodies, model systems, et cetera. Similarly, on Cisbio, the HTRF and AlphaLISA assays, they are very synergistic. And we could go on down with Bioo Scientific or Nexcelom. The opportunities are there for each of these businesses.

Back to Prahlad's point, there's -- I talked about geographic reach, Prahlad talked about all the complementary nature of all of our acquisitions. I mean antibodies are used in everything we do, all the life sciences reagents, everything in diagnostics. And our teams to the extent that we could started to understand the technology that PerkinElmer has and BioLegend has, that number from a synergy standpoint is more difficult to predict.
The geographic reach is easier to quantify. So I think there should be upside to this $100 million, but with the teams need to understand the products a little bit more.

It had everything to do with the utilization of the strong installed base that we put out there. So certainly, we're becoming increasingly confident that there's going to be some amount of testing that's here for the foreseeable future.
I think we're already starting to see that in the third quarter, early part of the third quarter. I think some of our serology testing, PCR testings, antigen even is starting to get -- make a little bit of a inroads there, variant, testing T cells. So I'd say we're more confident leading into 2022 that there -- the $100 million of durable COVID revenue was safe, both from a utilization standpoint, but then I think testing will remain around for a while here and should provide upside to that number."

If you look at the value drivers from an automation perspective, there's been a lot of progress in liquid handling and cell isolation and maybe even looking at cell counting moving forward here as well as utilization of some of our labs.
From a commercial perspective, I think we've helped each other win in certain markets. Some of the emerging markets of Brazil, some parts of the Middle East and across the globe, we've won some nice tenders. So exciting there. And it's a phenomenal team, extremely well-run business.

I think it will be relatively low cost at this point, and we're pretty excited about that, which provides a good amount of EPS accretion at this point.

Maybe from a comp perspective, it gets a little bit more difficult. But overall, I mentioned cannabis is starting to sell again. So that's encouraging the Meizheng business in food safety is growing nicely. Our Applied business, I think that's been a testimony to the NPIs and the organic investment we've made. So I mentioned the semiconductor business and our NexION 5000, which is extremely sensitive, it's terrific for smaller wafers and fabs. Our new IR product is going well. So I think if you remember and step back for the applied markets value creation story, it's much more of an organic investment belief.

Reflecting on the third quarter of 2021, I can confidently say that our efforts, our investments and our business performance together truly reflected the essence and impact of the new PerkinElmer, a concept",893,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Reflecting on the third quarter of 2021, I can confidently say that our efforts, our investments and our business performance together truly reflected the essence and impact of the new PerkinElmer, a concept we introduced at the Analyst Meeting back in June. 
The operational improvements, recent acquisitions in Life Sciences and Diagnostics, R&D investments in the food and applied markets, accelerated innovation across the Board and a ramped up focus on culture, employee engagement and technological innovation have collectively been bearing fruit. While there is still significantly more to come, I think between our very strong financial bulk and the additional color that Jamie, Peter and I will share with you today. We will further illustrate the immense incremental value we are delivering to all our stakeholders now and are positioned to do so well into the future. 
To stay on this idea for a moment, our ongoing portfolio transformation into higher-growth end markets continued during the third quarter as we closed on our previously announced acquisitions of SIRION Biotech and immunodiagnostic system. We also announced and were able to fairly quickly close on our largest acquisition to date, BioLegend 3 months ahead of schedule. I'll touch more on these great recent additions in a bit, but I'm thrilled to see the initial teamwork that is already occurring between these businesses and the rest of PerkinElmer. 
While collaborations are already underway, I expect there will only be expanded and turbocharged coming out of a company-wide Innovation Summit we are hosting in a couple of weeks. I'm very proud of how our now 15,000 employees around the world have continued to execute during the third quarter despite facing existing challenges and even starting to come across some new ones. While Jamie will provide more details in it, I'd like to highlight the 16% non-COVID organic growth we generated in the quarter, which was again solidly ahead of our guidance. 
Our COVID revenues came in close to twice our expectation as testing remained similar to the levels we experienced in the second quarter and our teams were again well supplied and ready to meet the incremental demand. This led to adjusted earnings per share in the quarter of $2.31, which was over 40% above our guidance despite the ongoing strong investments back in the business. Overall, we continued to see strong non-COVID demand trends across the business with double-digit growth in all major regions. 
So while we may be facing a few new headwinds, I feel the team is proactively responding and executing for our customers. Just as we have successfully done over the past few years, we're not against numerous other pressures across our business and the global economy. 
While I'm pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter and excited about all our recent acquisitions, I wanted to spend a little more time today sharing some insight into 2 of the newer additions as we haven't had the opportunity to discuss them in greater detail with investors up until this point. 
First, I'd like to touch on Oxford Immunotec, which we closed back in March. As Steve mentioned, Oxford's Founder and CEO, Peter Wrighton-Smith, has joined us on today's call. As many of you may know, from its days as a stand-alone publicly traded company, Oxford is currently the #2 player in the latent tuberculosis testing market globally. And I think with some of our core capabilities and broader regulatory, distribution and service offerings, the business is well positioned to gain share in the years ahead. 
In terms of what's been happening since Oxford joined the PerkinElmer family earlier this year, I'm extremely pleased to share that it is on pace to exceed its revenue targets for this year and has been making great progress on rolling out its automation workflows around the world with an anticipated approval for this new workflow in the U.S. next year. 
I thought it might be helpful to share just some of the ways that 2 companies have been already been collaborating within the first 6 months of being under the same roof. I hope it will give you a feel for the synergy potential we both believe exists. With the help of our integration transformation office, which was set up last year, Oxford and PerkinElmer are already averaging each other's capabilities in a number of ways, such as integrating our Janus liquid handlers into Oxford's medium throughput automation workflow that is currently seeking and receiving regulatory approvals around the world, or Oxford's utilizing Nexcelom's selegocell counting instruments in its new high throughput automation workflow. 
In addition, Oxford is also already starting to leverage PerkinElmer's existing field service force to assist with the installation of these automation offerings. Oxford is now beginning to transition from being a developer and manufacturer of diagnostic kits to now offering customers fully automated workflows for TB testing. While it is still early and we have many other plans in process that will play out over the longer term, those are just a few examples of the initial progress that we are quite excited about. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Peter to share some thoughts on the business since becoming part of the PerkinElmer family and maybe some perspective on where he sees the business going in the coming years. Peter?"

Our strategy for advancing in the attractive growing latent TB testing market is based on a number of key pillars: firstly, expanding our commercial presence to maximize our penetration of existing and new countries; secondly, dramatically improving our workflow through automating our assay and bringing that new automated workflow to all major jurisdictions worldwide and in a variety of throughputs to suit customers of different sizes; thirdly, improving the economics for our customers and us. This is about reducing our cost of goods to our customers and our advantage, but it's also about capturing more value from the product and service ecosystem created by automation. 
Being part of the wider PerkinElmer family is helping us to in all 3 of those areas. For example, we're already leveraging EUROIMMUN's presence and field forces to access new countries in South America and leveraging Tulip's presence and relationships in the Indian subcontinent. We are accelerating our automation journey, as Prahlad already mentioned, by adopting PerkinElmer's suite of automation both from core PerkinElmer in the form of Janus and by utilizing technology from acquired companies such as EUROIMMUN and Nexcelom. 
We're also able now to capture more of the value from automation as we have a pathway through PerkinElmer's OneSource business and its global supply chain capabilities to sell automation consumables and automation service contracts, both things that we were not equipped to do on our own. We're now also exploring a number of additional COGS reduction opportunities by in-sourcing key raw materials that we currently purchase from third parties. BioLegend in particular, has a number of antibodies and other immunological reagents that we're looking to incorporate into our own immunology-based technology. 
At the same time, we've been able to streamline our cost structure. Clearly, we're no longer supporting a public company infrastructure ourselves, but more generally, we've been able to reduce our G&A spend by leveraging PerkinElmer's capabilities in those areas. Putting all this together, even just 6 months since becoming part of the PerkinElmer family, we're seeing intensified revenue growth and improved profitability on the bottom line. 
We're also having growing success in deploying our T cell technology in SARS-CoV-2. Our testing service revenues continue to grow in support of the Phase II and Phase III licensure studies and in support of vaccine deployment decisions under the umbrella of the U.K. vaccine task force. 
On the kit side, we're also seeing growing and maturing demand as the important role of T cell come more widely recognized as a critical means of assessing vaccine efficacy, particularly in immunosuppressed and other high-risk populations. Supported by close to 15 peer-reviewed publications on our technology, T cell testing is now coming into the mainstream in several European countries. We believe this testing will last well into 2022 and probably beyond as we learn to live with SARS-CoV-2 as an endemic mutating global virus. 
We also see an opportunity to grow our immunology testing services in support of vaccine and pharma clients more broadly outside of SARS-CoV-2. Clearly, we have our own well-respected capabilities in T cell testing. But as part of PerkinElmer, we have 2 other distinct advantages. Firstly, we can leverage the infrastructure of PerkinElmer's network of specialty clinical laboratories to establish wider worldwide coverage, something of growing importance to vaccine and pharma clients that want to run trials all over the world. Secondly, we're now partnering with BioLegends as their world-leading portfolio of immunology research reagents gives us the expertise to rapidly expand our service offering beyond our own core technology. 
With that, I'd like to hand it back to Prahlad."

I look forward to seeing the traction we make over the coming quarters.

I look forward to seeing the traction we make over the coming quarters. I also wanted to share with you more about our recent position of immunodiagnostic systems, or IDS, which closed in early July and may have been a bit overshadowed by our analyst meeting and the announcement to acquire BioLegend. I want to make sure our shareholders know why we are so excited about IDS becoming part of PerkinElmer and what we believe it brings to the overall company. The addition of IDS is a great example of where we expect 1 plus 1 to equal at least 3 and hopefully more. 
Let me first tell you a bit more about the company. It's a developer and manufacturer of medium throughput chemiluminescence analyzers and assays that was previously publicly traded in the U.K. and have been going through an evolution of its [indiscernible] over the last several years. By adding IDS, we have significantly announced our in-house chemiluminescence assay development expertise. This expertise will provide even more resources to support the development and launch of EUROIMMUN's high-throughput, random access chemiluminescent system, Accentis which we expect to introduce next year. 
Furthermore, by adding IDS's existing mid-throughput RA10 chemiluminescence analyzer and its current installed base to the business. Upon the launch of the Accentis platform, we will then be able to offer a spectrum of chemiluminescence systems and assays to our customers. Also, in just the first few months since the acquisition closed, we have started to leverage each other's commercial and distribution strengths. 
For example, at the recent ACC meeting in Atlanta, PerkinElmer diagnostics, EUROIMMUN, IDS and Oxford Immunotec, all jointly exhibited and met with customers in person for the first time. And of course, the addition of BioLegend, which closed in mid-September and was the largest deal in our company's history has kept us busy to say the least. 
I'm happy that we were able to close the deal several months before the end of the year so that all teams and colleagues involved are ready to hit the ground running heading into next year. While BioLegend has been a part of PerkinElmer for only about 45 days, its financial performance has continued to remain extremely strong and hasn't missed a beat as part of this transition. This is a testament to the strong leadership throughout the BioLegend team who are doing a terrific job in running the business seamlessly for customers, while also working tirelessly to ensure a successful transition to the PerkinElmer family. 
However, I'm even more excited about the interactions and collaborations that are beginning to take place between the BioLegend team and the broader PerkinElmer organization. As I briefly mentioned earlier, I'm especially looking forward to our upcoming company-wide Innovation Summit that is planned for later this year at BioLegend's campus in San Diego. At this event, we'll bring together R&D, innovation, commercial and operational leaders and experts from across the company for several days to collaborate, strategize and just get to know 1 another. I can't wait to see all the impactful ideas and connections that come from this event. 
As it relates to innovation, in early October, we received U.S. FDA emergency use authorization for our PCAM respiratory SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay, which provides for the detection of flu, RSV and COVID in a single assay, which we and others expect will play a larger role in testing during the coming winter months in the Northern Hemisphere. 
Additionally, our EUROIMMUN business recently received FDA emergency use authorization for its quantitative COVID serology assay, which targets the S1 protein. These 2 new COVID assays add to our existing strong portfolio of serology, antigen and PCR assays, which are being used to -- in the ongoing fight against this pandemic. 
From a corporate responsibility standpoint, while the world of ESG is still an evolving place, I was enthused to see my colleagues effort at our recent company-wide Global Impact Day held last month, where it was great to see over 350 different group initiatives take place, all led by our colleagues around the world. As you may recall, we outlined our initial ESG-related targets at our Analyst Meeting in June. And I'm delighted to see efforts already underway to work towards achieving them. 
For instance, we recently completed a new company employee engagement survey, which we will use to ensure PerkinElmer continues to be a great place to work and a team, everyone is proud to be a part of. The initial results look very positive on all fronts of engagement, diversity and inclusion and health and well-being perspective. But I'm quite sure there is always room for improvement. 
Additionally, in our recently released corporate social responsibility report, we have begun reporting under SaaS B, which has quickly been considered the leading industry standards platform. With PerkinElmer now adhering to this framework, we are building on our historical reporting against the carbon disclosure project, which aligns with the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. I'm confident we have good plans and initial targets in place, and I'm happy to see the company more formally rally around these efforts. 
In closing, while there always seems to be various external pressures we must face, such as the current semiconductor shortage, logistics bottlenecks and potential global tax reform. I'm proud to see our team continue to proactively navigate these challenges with agility, innovation and a unique and dedicated focus on the customer with strong global teamwork. This corporate character has allowed us to successfully mitigate the impact of these various challenges and provide the opportunity for us to continue to achieve and even exceed our plans, like we did here again in the third quarter. 
The end of the year is always a busy time filled with commercial activities, strategic and operational planning and both professional and personal commitments and I expect it to be that way again this year, but I'm confident our teams are up for it. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Jamie to provide more detail and perspective on our third quarter results and color as it relates to our guidance for the fourth quarter. Jamie?"

Before turning to the financial results, I want to remind everyone that our third quarter earnings call presentation has been posted on the Investors section of our website under Financial Information. As Pra",1761,"Thanks, Prahlad, and good evening, everyone. Before turning to the financial results, I want to remind everyone that our third quarter earnings call presentation has been posted on the Investors section of our website under Financial Information. 
As Prahlad mentioned, it was quite a busy quarter for the company. I believe the team performed extremely well, and we continue to make great traction on executing the transformation of the business from both an organic and operational perspective, but also inorganically as well, which I'll touch on in a bit. Both our COVID and non-COVID revenue performance exceeded our expectations with double-digit growth in both our Discovery & Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics segments. Additionally, the recent additions to the PerkinElmer family remain on track. So we are set up well heading into the end of the year. 
During the third quarter, adjusted revenue grew 21% compared to last year to almost $1.2 billion and included a 1% foreign exchange tailwind and an 8% contribution from recent acquisitions. Organic revenue grew 12%, 17 percentage points better than our guidance as our non-COVID revenue grew 16% organically, ahead of our 12% assumption and our COVID revenue did not fall off to the degree that we had anticipated. 
As it relates to COVID, we generated approximately $300 million of revenue from our related products and services, which was close to double the $165 million we had projected and down only slightly from the $365 million we generated in the second quarter. Approximately $170 million of our COVID-related revenue in Q3 came from core products with the remainder coming from our COVID-related lab services. 
As also highlighted by others, we saw a noticeable uptick in demand for our PCR tests and RNA extraction kits in the latter half of the quarter, and some contribution from recently awarded testing contracts such as with the Department of Health and Human Services and Mount Sinai. 
As we have assumed in our guidance, we reduced capacity made available for the State of California in our Lab-In-A-Lab offering at the beginning of the quarter, which brought down its revenue contribution as compared to the first half of the year. However, we did see average daily volumes in the lab increased significantly as the quarter progressed with a number of days in late September, surpassing 40,000 tests per day. 
I'm extremely proud of what we've been able to accomplish at our lab in California over the last year from setting it up from scratch in under 70 days to immediately and appropriately addressing all workflow challenges that may come up when getting something like this off the ground in such a short period of time and in the middle of the pandemic to successfully meeting and delivering on varying levels of demand on a week-by-week and month-by-month basis. Given the successful contributions, I'm happy to report that our contract with the state for this COVID testing lab has been extended by another year through the end of October 2022.  
As it relates to our business segments, Diagnostics generated $654 million of revenue in the third quarter, which represented 56% of total revenue and was up 21% year-over-year. Organically, the business grew 13% and was up 25% organically on a non-COVID basis. Geographically, our diagnostics business was strong around the world, with strong double-digit non-COVID organic growth in all regions. 
As it relates to our immunodiagnostics franchise, total revenue was up more than 40% in the quarter, with strong growth in both COVID and non-COVID products and services. EUROIMMUN continued to grow robustly and was up more than 20% organically. This business is fantastic and 1 that we continue to invest in heavily as it is now on pace to do $500 million in revenue this year. 
As Prahlad mentioned, we closed on our acquisition of IDS in early July, and are excited to see the R&D and commercial synergies it can provide with our existing EUROIMMUN franchise. Our Applied Genomics business, which also falls within our broader Diagnostics segment, continues to take share on our improved brand recognition. While COVID-related sales in the business have fallen off as equipment-related capacity has been built out, we continue to see strong demand for NGS reagents related to COVID variant detection and our high-throughput real-time PCR workstation, the EXPLORER G3 continues to see strong uptake. 
Our non-COVID revenue was up more than 50% as core NGS and large molecule activities continues to bounce back after being initially hampered during the pandemic and funding continues to remain strong. When I think about all the ways the pandemic has impacted our business, I believe our Applied Genomics business in particular, is 1 that is going to permanently benefit over the longer term as customers now have so much more experience with our high-quality instruments and kits and our sales force is now even better connected with key opinion leaders in this space. 
In our Reproductive Health business, while we continue to face pressure globally from declining birth rates, particularly in China, we were again able to grow this business double digits overall in Q3 through a combination of [indiscernible] and geographic expansion, new product introductions, growth within our labs business and a modest benefit from easier year-ago comps, particularly in Asia. 
Turning to our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment. The business generated $513 million in revenue in the quarter, which represented 44% of total revenue and was up 21% year-over-year. Organically, the business grew 10%, led by continued strength in our Life Science business with double-digit growth from pharma customers and mid-single-digit growth from academic and government end markets. 
In our Discovery business, we are pleased to have closed on our acquisitions of both SIRION and BioLegend in the quarter and are excited to see their contributions to our growth in large molecule in the years to come. Sales into in industrial and applied markets grew in the low double digits, driven by strong growth in mass spec, while food was up mid-single digits. 
Looking at the company overall from a geographic basis, we saw double-digit non-COVID growth in all regions and greater than 20% non-COVID organic growth in China. This led to our total company non-COVID organic growth coming in at 16%, which was 400 basis points above our guidance. Operationally, we are extremely pleased with our performance in light of various macro pressures. 
Our adjusted operating margins of 31% remained strong, driven by volume leverage, favorable mix and productivity programs, slightly offset by continued investment in our talent and culture, research and development, improved e-commerce, network and security infrastructure, digital capabilities and strengthening our customer relationships, which we expect to help drive results in the years to come. Overall, adjusted earnings per share were $2.31, which is up 11% versus a year ago and 43% above our Q3 guidance. 
As it relates to the balance sheet, we had a lot of moving pieces this quarter with the closing of IDS and SIRION and the financing and closing of BioLegend. We finished the quarter with $5.1 billion of debt and approximately $500 million of cash. Free cash flow was extremely strong in the quarter and so far this year. We generated $324 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter, which equates to a 122% conversion of our net income. This brings our adjusted free cash flow so far this year through the first 9 months to over $1 billion with a conversion rate of over 100%. 
Given these strong cash flows and the better-than-expected earnings, our leverage at the end of the quarter stood at 2.2x net debt-to-EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis as we added $2.8 billion in new debt to fund the acquisition of BioLegend. It may be a little counterintuitive, but we expect our net leverage to increase over the next few quarters even as we begin to aggressively delever as we expected earnings-related tailwinds from our COVID revenues to come down. 
As it relates to guidance, we are expecting Q4 adjusted revenues of approximately $1.2 billion, which assumes 8% non-COVID organic growth, $200 million in COVID-related revenues and an 11% contribution from M&A and a neutral impact from foreign exchange. On the bottom line, we are now expecting adjusted earnings per share of $2.05, which assumes approximately $26 million of interest expense, a tax rate of 22% and $126 million to $127 million of diluted shares outstanding. 
Given our strong performance year-to-date and our confidence in our fourth quarter outlook, I'm happy to report we have raised full year revenue and earnings guidance for the third consecutive quarter this year. We now expect over $1.4 billion of COVID revenue and at least 15% non-COVID organic revenue growth for the full year. This brings our total adjusted revenue to just under $5 billion, including an 8% contribution from M&A and a 2% tailwind from foreign exchange. 
We are now bringing our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the year up nearly $1 to $10.81 per share, which equates to 30% year-over-year growth. All of this guidance is detailed on the second to last page of today's presentation as well. 
As it relates to BioLegend, we expect total year sales this year of approximately $320 million, which would be up 33% from 2020, included in our fourth quarter adjusted revenue guidance is approximately $80 million of contribution. Due to the faster-than-expected close of the deal, we are even more confident in the previously announced accretion of $0.30 and greater than $0.50 in 2022 and 2023, respectively, while there will be a modest dilutive impact in the fourth quarter as a result of the earlier closing. Importantly, Integration activities have commenced sooner than anticipated. And as Prahlad mentioned, we are excited about our upcoming company-wide Innovation Summit in a few weeks at the BioLegend headquarters. Additionally, we were able to close on our financing at rates slightly below our deal model and current interest rate levels. So overall, a fantastic outcome, and our teams are off and running. 
In closing, I'm encouraged as our team continues to perform at a high level. Our organic and inorganic investments are paying dividends now and set us up well looking forward and our transformation of the business to the new PerkinElmer is well underway. We are excited for a strong finish to the year and are well positioned heading into 2022 and the years ahead, not just financially, but also with our people and culture and most importantly, for our customers. 
With that, I'd now like to turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A."

So as you may know, if you read the contract, it stays out the ability to cancel within 45 days. So we really only have line of sight to the next 90 days at this point. 
We also restructured it to take down the capacity to 40,000 tests per day. We also restructured the variable fees. So for the most part, it's a pretty steady base in terms of revenue irregardless of whether it's 20,000 tests per day or 40,000 tests per day, the revenue remains relatively stagnant and the fourth quarter is probably to the tune of about $90 million baked into our estimate."

The more and more we get to know these companies and the more and more we get to know the technologies, it's easy for us to foresee that 1 plus 1 is definitely more equal -- more than 2. And then probably more cases, more than 3. 
Just a look at Horizon and how SIRION fits into the bill, right? The licensing technology that allows us to bring the cell and gene therapy markets together. Going to our customers, being able to look at small molecule and biologics now at the same time, synergies from a commercial perspective, technology perspective, it continues to help bolster the story that we have seen. 
On the diagnostic side, with the addition of IDS while EUROIMMUN was working on Accentis as a big automated platform, the ability to leverage their RA10 platform, and at the same time, the several assays which they have already qualified now being able to do that both on a smaller platform and a fully automated platform. It gives you a much more expansive menu than what we thought we could leverage. So these are just a couple of examples, and I'll sort of ask Peter to talk specifically around Oxford and BioLegend.

So from my perspective, as we have learn more and more about the different aspects of the PerkinElmer family, the opportunity set for us just continues to grow. And PerkinElmer is very unusual in having a huge amount of life science reagents, which a lot of diagnostics companies obviously consumes raw materials and production of their kits. But it goes goes far beyond that, we are starting to benefit from PerkinElmer's purchasing power as a combined entity. We also have the fact that PerkinElmer makes instruments and a lot of different kind of instruments, which is very helpful for us in our automation journey. And we also have the fact that PerkinElmer has a great service infrastructure. And all of those things mean that companies like us who joined the family then have to replicate and duplicate those capabilities. 
So from my perspective, I'm seeing ever-increasing opportunities to in-source either products, raw materials or services from the wider PerkinElmer family, and I'm seeing my synergy opportunities that grow as a consequence."

With the addition of Bio Legend and now having a $700 million reagent business sitting in DAS, in terms of Life Sciences, those normally come with pretty high profit margins. 
So I'd say mix going forward will be durable and probably the biggest driver. Certainly, there are programs that we've been putting in place that we've been talking about in terms of better procurement as we roll out NPIs, refreshing all the configurations and the number of configurations we have and the simplicity of them. We've been doing a little bit around sites, and we've been doing a lot with our service team to be more efficient from a road service perspective. So I think all durable, but I think the quickest biggest impact you get is from mix. And I think that's what you're seeing in DAS this quarter with Life Sciences growing double digits here."

And then anything that's going on around COVID lockdowns, particularly in APAC. So -- and we have seen pockets of it, particularly in our newborn screening business in places like the Philippines and Vietnam, where screening has just been reduced.

On the reagent side, it's been strong across all regions. We've had a nice cadence of NPIs, different application areas in terms of oncology and cell and gene therapy have been strong for us. So life sciences, those are a few of the areas. 
In the analytical and applied markets, Paul. So it's been more on the semiconductor side, I would say, chemicals and Energy was pretty strong for us. And so we launched our Triple Quad. And so our ITP and ITP AMS business has been extremely strong for us. But I think in general, the whole analytical technologies portfolio, we've had a better cadence of NPIs, which has been proving to benefit the DAS business. And so that's why I see continued strength there."

268363,1684979141,2422124,"PerkinElmer, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Revvity, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Reflecting on the third quarter of 2021, I can confidently say that our efforts, our investments and our business performance together truly reflected the essence and impact of the new PerkinElmer, a concept",895,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Reflecting on the third quarter of 2021, I can confidently say that our efforts, our investments and our business performance together truly reflected the essence and impact of the new PerkinElmer, a concept we introduced at our analyst meeting back in June.
The operational improvements, recent acquisitions in life sciences and diagnostics, R&D investments in the food and applied markets, accelerated innovation across the Board and a ramped up focus on culture, employee engagement and technological innovation have collectively been bearing fruit. While there is still significantly more to come, I think between our very strong financial results and the additional color that Jamey, Peter and I will share with you today, we will further illustrate the immense incremental value we are delivering to all our stakeholders now and are positioned to do so well into the future.
To stay on this idea for a moment, our ongoing portfolio transformation into higher-growth end markets continued during the third quarter as we closed on our previously announced acquisitions of SIRION Biotech and Immunodiagnostic Systems. We also announced and were able to fairly quickly close on our largest acquisition to date, BioLegend, 3 months ahead of schedule. I'll touch more on these great recent additions in a bit, but I'm thrilled to see the initial teamwork that is already occurring between these businesses and the rest of PerkinElmer. 
While collaborations are already underway, I expect there will only be expanded and turbocharged coming out of a company-wide innovation summit we are hosting in a couple of weeks. I'm very proud of how our now 15,000 employees around the world have continued to execute during the third quarter despite facing existing challenges and even starting to come across some new ones. While Jamey will provide more details in a bit, I'd like to highlight the 16% non-COVID organic growth we generated in the quarter, which was again solidly ahead of our guidance.
Our COVID revenues came in close to twice our expectation as testing remained similar to the levels we experienced in the second quarter and our teams were again well supplied and ready to meet the incremental demand. This led to adjusted earnings per share in the quarter of $2.31, which was over 40% above our guidance despite the ongoing strong investments back in the business. Overall, we continued to see strong non-COVID demand trends across the business with double-digit growth in all major regions.
So while we may be facing a few new headwinds, I feel the team is proactively responding and executing for our customers. Just as we have successfully done over the past few years, we're now up against numerous other pressures across our business and the global economy.
While I'm pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter and excited about all our recent acquisitions, I wanted to spend a little more time today sharing some insight into 2 of the newer additions as we haven't had the opportunity to discuss them in greater detail with investors up until this point. 
First, I'd like to touch on Oxford Immunotec, which we closed back in March. As Steve mentioned, Oxford's Founder and CEO, Peter Wrighton-Smith, has joined us on today's call. As many of you may know, from its days as a stand-alone publicly traded company, Oxford is currently the #2 player in the latent tuberculosis testing market globally. And I think with some of our core capabilities and broader regulatory, distribution and service offerings, the business is well positioned to gain share in the years ahead.
In terms of what's been happening since Oxford joined the PerkinElmer family earlier this year, I'm extremely pleased to share that it is on pace to exceed its revenue targets for this year and has been making great progress on rolling out its automation workflows around the world with an anticipated approval for this new workflow in the U.S. next year.
I thought it might be helpful to share just some of the ways that 2 companies have been already been collaborating within the first 6 months of being under the same roof. I hope it will give you a feel for the synergy potential we both believe exists. 
With the help of our integration transformation office, which was set up last year, Oxford and PerkinElmer are already leveraging each other's capabilities in a number of ways, such as integrating our JANUS liquid handlers into Oxford's medium throughput automation workflow that is currently seeking and receiving regulatory approvals around the world, or Oxford's utilizing Nexcelom's Celigo cell counting instruments in its new high throughput automation workflow.
In addition, Oxford is also already starting to leverage PerkinElmer's existing field service force to assist with the installation of these automation offerings. Oxford is now beginning to transition from being a developer and manufacturer of diagnostic kits to now offering customers fully automated workflows for TB testing. While it is still early and we have many other plans in process that will play out over the longer-term, those are just a few examples of the initial progress that we are quite excited about.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Peter to share some thoughts on the business since becoming part of the PerkinElmer family and maybe some perspective on where he sees the business going in the coming  years. Peter?"

Our strategy for advancing in the attractive growing latent TB testing market is based on a number of key pillars: firstly, expanding our commercial presence to maximize our penetration of existing and new countries; secondly, dramatically improving our workflow through automating our assay and bringing that new automated workflow to all major jurisdictions worldwide and in a variety of throughputs to suit customers of different sizes; thirdly, improving the economics for our customers and us. This is about reducing our cost of goods to our customers and our advantage, but it's also about capturing more value from the product and service ecosystem created by automation.
Being part of the wider PerkinElmer family is helping us to execute better in all 3 of those areas. For example, we're already leveraging EUROIMMUN's presence and field forces to access new countries in South America and leveraging Tulip's presence and relationships in the Indian subcontinent. We are accelerating our automation journey, as Prahlad already mentioned, by adopting PerkinElmer's suite of automation both from core PerkinElmer in the form of JANUS and by utilizing technology from acquired companies such as EUROIMMUN and Nexcelom.
We're also able now to capture more of the value from automation as we have a pathway through PerkinElmer's OneSource business and its global supply chain capabilities to sell automation consumables and automation service contracts, both things that we were not equipped to do on our own. 
We're now also exploring a number of additional COGS reduction opportunities by in-sourcing key raw materials that we currently purchase from third parties. BioLegend in particular, has a number of antibodies and other immunological reagents that we're looking to incorporate into our own immunology-based technology.
At the same time, we've been able to streamline our cost structure. Clearly, we're no longer supporting a public company infrastructure ourselves, but more generally, we've been able to reduce our G&A spend by leveraging PerkinElmer's capabilities in those areas. Putting all this together, even just 6 months since becoming part of the PerkinElmer family, we're seeing intensified revenue growth and improved profitability on the bottom line.
We're also having growing success in deploying our T cell technology in SARS-CoV-2. Our testing service revenues continue to grow in support of the Phase II and Phase III licensure studies and in support of vaccine deployment decisions under the umbrella of the U.K. vaccine's task force.
On the kit side, we're also seeing growing and maturing demand as the important role of T cells has become more widely recognized as a critical means of assessing vaccine efficacy, particularly in immunosuppressed and other high-risk populations. Supported by close to 15 peer-reviewed publications on our technology, T cell testing is now coming into the mainstream in several European countries. We believe this testing will last well into 2022 and probably beyond as we learn to live with SARS-CoV-2 as an endemic mutating global virus.
We also see an opportunity to grow our immunology testing services in support of vaccine and pharma clients more broadly outside of SARS-CoV-2. Clearly, we have our own well-respected capabilities in T cell testing. But as part of PerkinElmer, we have 2 other distinct advantages. 
Firstly, we can leverage the infrastructure of PerkinElmer's global network of specialty clinical laboratories to establish wider worldwide coverage, something of growing importance to vaccine and pharma clients that want to run trials all over the world. Secondly, we're now partnering with BioLegend as their world-leading portfolio of immunology research reagents gives us the expertise to rapidly expand our service offering beyond our own core technology.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to Prahlad."

I look forward to seeing the traction we make over the coming quarters. I also wanted to share with you more about our recent acquisition of Immunodiagnostic Systems, or IDS, which closed in early July and may have been a bit overshadowed by our analyst meeting and the announcement to acquire BioLegend. I want to make sure our shareholders know why we are so excited about IDS becoming part of PerkinElmer and what we believe it brings to the overall company. The addition of IDS is a great example of where we expect 1 plus 1 to equal at least 3 and hopefully more.
Let me first tell you a bit more about the company. It's a developer and manufacturer of medium throughput chemiluminescence analyzers and assays that was previously publicly traded in the U.K. and have been going through an evolution of its assay menu over the last several years. 
By adding IDS, we have significantly enhanced our in-house chemiluminescence assay development expertise. This expertise will provide even more resources to support the development and launch of EUROIMMUN's high-throughput, random access chemiluminescent system, Accentis which we expect to introduce next year.
Furthermore, by adding IDS's existing mid-throughput RA10 chemiluminescence analyzer and its current installed base to the business. Upon the launch of the Accentis platform, we will then be able to offer a spectrum of chemiluminescence systems and assays to our customers. Also, in just the first few months since the acquisition closed, we have started to leverage each other's commercial and distribution strengths.
For example, at the recent AACC meeting in Atlanta, PerkinElmer diagnostics, EUROIMMUN, IDS and Oxford Immunotec, all jointly exhibited and met with customers in-person for the first time. And of course, the addition of BioLegend, which closed in mid-September and was the largest deal in our company's history has kept us busy to say the least.  
I'm happy that we were able to close the deal several months before the end of the year so that all teams and colleagues involved are ready to hit the ground running heading into next year. While BioLegend has been a part of PerkinElmer for only about 45 days, its financial performance has continued to remain extremely strong and hasn't missed a beat as part of this transition. This is a testament to the strong leadership throughout the BioLegend team who are doing a terrific job in running the business seamlessly for customers, while also working tirelessly to ensure a successful transition to the PerkinElmer family.
However, I'm even more excited about the interactions and collaborations that are beginning to take place between the BioLegend team and the broader PerkinElmer organization. As I briefly mentioned earlier, I'm especially looking forward to our upcoming company-wide Innovation Summit that is planned for later this year at BioLegend's campus in San Diego. At this event, we'll bring together R&D, innovation, commercial and operational leaders and experts from across the company for several days to collaborate, strategize and just get to know one another. I can't wait to see all the impactful ideas and connections that come from this event.
As it relates to innovation, in early October, we received U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization for our PKamp respiratory SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay, which provides for the detection of flu, RSV and COVID in a single assay, which we and others expect will play a larger role in testing during the coming winter months in the Northern Hemisphere.
Additionally, our EUROIMMUN business recently received FDA Emergency Use Authorization for its quantitative COVID serology assay, which targets the S1 protein. These 2 new COVID assays add to our existing strong portfolio of serology, antigen and PCR assays, which are being used to -- in the ongoing fight against this pandemic.
From a corporate responsibility standpoint, while the world of ESG is still an evolving place, I was enthused to see my colleagues effort at our recent company-wide global impact day held last month, where it was great to see over 350 different group initiatives take place, all led by our colleagues around the world. As you may recall, we outlined our initial ESG-related targets at our analyst meeting in June. And I'm delighted to see efforts already underway to work towards achieving them.
For instance, we recently completed a new company-wide employee engagement survey, which we will use to ensure PerkinElmer continues to be a great place to work and a team, everyone is proud to be a part of. The initial results look very positive on all fronts of engagement, diversity and inclusion, and health and well-being perspective. But I'm quite sure there is always room for improvement.
Additionally, in our recently released corporate social responsibility report, we have begun reporting under SASB, which has quickly been considered the leading industry standards platform. With PerkinElmer now adhering to this framework, we are building on our historical reporting against the carbon disclosure project, which aligns with the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. I'm confident we have good plans and initial targets in place, and I'm happy to see the company more formally rally around these efforts.
In closing, while there always seems to be various external pressures we must face, such as the current semiconductor shortage, logistics bottlenecks and potential global tax reform, I'm proud to see our team continue to proactively navigate these challenges with agility, innovation and a unique and dedicated focus on the customer with strong global teamwork. This corporate character has allowed us to successfully mitigate the impact of these various challenges and provide the opportunity for us to continue to achieve and even exceed our plans, like we did here again in the third quarter.
The end of the year is always a busy time filled with commercial activities, strategic and operational planning and both professional and personal commitments, and I expect it to be that way again this year, but I'm confident our teams are up for it.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Jamey to provide more detail and perspective on our third quarter results and color as it relates to our guidance for the fourth quarter. Jamey?"

Before turning to the financial results, I want to remind everyone that our third quarter earnings call presentation has been posted on the Investors section of our website under Financial Information.  As Pr",1760,"Thanks, Prahlad, and good evening, everyone. Before turning to the financial results, I want to remind everyone that our third quarter earnings call presentation has been posted on the Investors section of our website under Financial Information.  
As Prahlad mentioned, it was quite a busy quarter for the company. I believe the team performed extremely well, and we continue to make great traction on executing the transformation of the business from both an organic and operational perspective, but also inorganically as well, which I'll touch on in a bit. Both our COVID and non-COVID revenue performance exceeded our expectations with double-digit growth in both our Discovery & Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics segments. 
Additionally, the recent additions to the PerkinElmer family remain on track. So we are set up well heading into the end of the year.
During the third quarter, adjusted revenue grew 21% compared to last year to almost $1.2 billion and included a 1% foreign exchange tailwind and an 8% contribution from recent acquisitions. Organic revenue grew 12%, 17 percentage points better than our guidance as our non-COVID revenue grew 16% organically, ahead of our 12% assumption, and our COVID revenue did not fall off to the degree that we had anticipated.
As it relates to COVID, we generated approximately $300 million of revenue from our related products and services, which was close to double the $165 million we had projected and down only slightly from the $365 million we generated in the second quarter. Approximately $170 million of our COVID-related revenue in Q3 came from core products with the remainder coming from our COVID-related lab services.
As also highlighted by others, we saw a noticeable uptick in demand for our PCR tests and RNA extraction kits in the latter half of the quarter, and some contribution from recently awarded testing contracts such as with the Department of Health and Human Services and Mount Sinai.  
As we have assumed in our guidance, we reduced capacity made available for the State of California in our Lab-In-A-Lab offering at the beginning of the quarter, which brought down its revenue contribution as compared to the first half of the year. However, we did see average daily volumes in the lab increased significantly as the quarter progressed with a number of days in late September, surpassing 40,000 tests per day.
I'm extremely proud of what we've been able to accomplish at our lab in California over the last year from setting it up from scratch in under 70 days to immediately and appropriately addressing all workflow challenges that may come up when getting something like this off the ground in such a short period of time and in the middle of a pandemic to successfully meeting and delivering on varying levels of demand on a week-by-week and month-by-month basis. Given the successful contributions, I'm happy to report that our contract with the state for this COVID testing lab has been extended by another year through the end of October 2022.
As it relates to our business segments, Diagnostics generated $654 million of revenue in the third quarter, which represented 56% of total revenue and was up 21% year-over-year. Organically, the business grew 13% and was up 25% organically on a non-COVID basis. Geographically, our Diagnostics business was strong around the world, with strong double-digit non-COVID organic growth in all regions.
As it relates to our immunodiagnostics franchise, total revenue was up more than 40% in the quarter, with strong growth in both COVID and non-COVID products and services. EUROIMMUN continued to grow robustly and was up more than 20% organically. This business is fantastic and one that we continue to invest in heavily as it is now on pace to do more than $500 million in revenue this year.
As Prahlad mentioned, we closed on our acquisition of IDS in early July, and are excited to see the R&D and commercial synergies it can provide with our existing EUROIMMUN franchise. 
Our applied genomics business, which also falls within our broader Diagnostics segment, continues to take share on our improved brand recognition. While COVID-related sales in the business have fallen off as equipment-related capacity has been built out, we continue to see strong demand for NGS reagents related to COVID variant detection and our high-throughput real-time PCR workstation, the explorer G3 continues to see strong uptick.
Our non-COVID revenue was up more than 50% as core NGS and large molecule activities continues to bounce back after being initially hampered during the pandemic and funding continues to remain strong. When I think about all the ways the pandemic has impacted our business, I believe our applied genomics business in particular, is one that is going to permanently benefit over the longer-term as customers now have so much more experience with our high-quality instruments and kits and our sales force is now even better connected with key opinion leaders in this space.
In our reproductive health business, while we continue to face pressure globally from declining birth rates, particularly in China, we were again able to grow this business double-digits overall in Q3 through a combination of menu and geographic expansion, new product introductions, growth within our labs business and a modest benefit from easier year-ago comps, particularly in Asia.
Turning to our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment. The business generated $513 million in revenue in the quarter, which represented 44% of total revenue and was up 21% year-over-year. Organically, the business grew 10%, led by continued strength in our life science business with double-digit growth from pharma customers and mid-single-digit growth from academic and government end markets.
In our discovery business, we are pleased to have closed on our acquisitions of both SIRION and BioLegend in the quarter and are excited to see their contributions to our growth in large molecule in the years to come. 
Sales into industrial and applied markets grew in the low double-digits, driven by strong growth in mass spec, while food was up mid-single digits.
Looking at the company overall from a geographic basis, we saw double-digit non-COVID growth in all regions and greater than 20% non-COVID organic growth in China. This led to our total company non-COVID organic growth coming in at 16%, which was 400 basis points above our guidance. Operationally, we are extremely pleased with our performance in light of various macro pressures.
Our adjusted operating margins of 31% remained strong, driven by volume leverage, favorable mix and productivity programs, slightly offset by continued investment in our talent and culture, research and development, improved e-commerce, network and security infrastructure, digital capabilities and strengthening our customer relationships, which we expect to help drive results in the years to come. Overall, adjusted earnings per share were $2.31, which is up 11% versus a year ago and 43% above our Q3 guidance.
As it relates to the balance sheet, we had a lot of moving pieces this quarter with the closing of IDS and SIRION and the financing and closing of BioLegend. We finished the quarter with $5.1 billion of debt and approximately $500 million of cash. 
Free cash flow was extremely strong in the quarter and so far this year. We generated $324 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter, which equates to a 122% conversion of our net income. This brings our adjusted free cash flow so far this year through the first 9 months to over $1 billion with a conversion rate of over 100%.
Given these strong cash flows and the better-than-expected earnings, our leverage at the end of the quarter stood at 2.2x net debt-to-EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis as we added $2.8 billion in new debt to fund the acquisition of BioLegend. It may be a little counterintuitive, but we expect our net leverage to increase over the next few quarters even as we begin to aggressively delever as we expected earnings-related tailwinds from our COVID revenues to come down.
As it relates to guidance, we are expecting Q4 adjusted revenues of approximately $1.2 billion, which assumes 8% non-COVID organic growth, $200 million in COVID-related revenues and an 11% contribution from M&A and a neutral impact from foreign exchange. 
On the bottom line, we are now expecting adjusted earnings per share of $2.05, which assumes approximately $26 million of interest expense, a tax rate of 22% and 126 million to 127 million of diluted shares outstanding. 
Given our strong performance year-to-date and our confidence in our fourth quarter outlook, I'm happy to report we are raising our full year revenue and earnings guidance for the third consecutive quarter this year. 
We now expect over $1.4 billion of COVID revenue and at least 15% non-COVID organic revenue growth for the full year. This brings our total adjusted revenue to just under $5 billion, including an 8% contribution from M&A and a 2% tailwind from foreign exchange.
We are now bringing our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the year up nearly $1 to $10.81 per share, which equates to 30% year-over-year growth. All of this guidance is detailed on the second to last page of today's presentation as well.
As it relates to BioLegend, we expect total year sales this year of approximately $320 million, which would be up 33% from 2020, included in our fourth quarter adjusted revenue guidance is approximately $80 million of contribution. Due to the faster-than-expected close of the deal, we are even more confident in the previously announced accretion of $0.30 and greater than $0.50 in 2022 and 2023, respectively, while there will be a modest dilutive impact in the fourth quarter as a result of the earlier closing. 
Importantly, integration activities have commenced sooner than anticipated. And as Prahlad mentioned, we are excited about our upcoming company-wide Innovation Summit in a few weeks at the BioLegend headquarters. Additionally, we were able to close on our financing at rates slightly below our deal model and current interest rate levels. So overall, a fantastic outcome, and our teams are off and running.
In closing, I'm encouraged as our team continues to perform at a high level. Our organic and inorganic investments are paying dividends now and set us up well looking forward and our transformation of the business to the new PerkinElmer is well underway.

The way I think about it is, while it's renewed for a year, really COVID is such a fluid environment, and we continue to work with the state that it's more like a quarter-by-quarter basis. So as you may know, if you read the contract, the state has the ability to cancel within 45 days. So we really only have line of sight to the next 90 days at this point. 
We also restructured it to take down the capacity to 40,000 tests per day. We also restructured the variable fees. So for the most part, it's a pretty steady base in terms of revenue irregardless of whether it's 20,000 tests per day or 40,000 tests per day, the revenue remains relatively stagnant and the fourth quarter is probably to the tune of about $90 million baked into our estimate."

And probably in more cases, more than 3. 
Just take a look at Horizon and how SIRION fits into the bill, right? The licensing technology that allows us to bring the cell and gene therapy markets together. Going to our customers, being able to look at small molecule and biologics now at the same time, synergies from a commercial perspective, technology perspective, it continues to help bolster the story that we have seen.
On the diagnostic side, with the addition of IDS while EUROIMMUN was working on Accentis as a big automated platform, the ability to leverage their RA10 platform, and at the same time, the several assays which they have already qualified now being able to do that both on a smaller platform and a fully automated platform. It gives you a much more expansive menu than what we thought we could leverage. So these are just a couple of examples, and I'll sort of ask Peter to talk specifically around Oxford and BioLegend.

And PerkinElmer is very unusual in having a huge amount of life science reagents, which a lot of Diagnostics companies, obviously, consumes raw materials in production of their kits. But it goes far beyond that, we are starting to benefit from PerkinElmer's purchasing power as a combined entity. We also have the fact that PerkinElmer makes instruments and a lot of different kind of instruments, which is very helpful for us in our automation journey. And we also have the fact that PerkinElmer has a great service infrastructure. And all of those things mean that companies like us who joined the family then have to replicate and duplicate those capabilities.

So I'd say mix going forward will be durable and probably the biggest driver.

So I think those are the 3 elements that I would point out to.
And just to give you an example, and I think Jamey or I mentioned during our prepared remarks, we are having an Innovation Summit at the BioLegend campus in a couple of weeks, where our approach is around 3 verticals or 3 pillars: cell and gene therapy, diagnostics and everything else around genomics, and what the opportunity is for us to leverage the synergies that we can see, primarily from a technology perspective.
So I think we'll continue. And then hopefully, over the next couple of months, we will be able to provide more detail around that. But Patrick, hopefully, that gives you a sense of how we are looking at this."

And I would say it's a little bit easier for us for mostly air versus any kind of water travels from a shipping standpoint. From a supply chain perspective, we've been all over. The team has done an amazing job. I think there was a very minor impact to the third quarter and our backlog obviously grew substantially as well.
Inflation, we started to see it. We're looking at what we're doing around price and putting some things into effect right now. But we also had some good things to do. As you might remember, we've been talking about a refreshed procurement process. So we've been able to mitigate some of this.
So it's certainly there, Patrick, and we're dealing with it. But we've got a happy medium here where we've got a good size from a scale perspective company, but also we operate very -- in a very agile fashion. So team has been doing a great job managing through it. We put a little bit of buffer into the fourth quarter here, as I mentioned, it will be a non-impact for us."

So with COVID being $300 million in the third quarter, going down to $200 million in the fourth quarter, you'll see that come down a little bit. And then the core comes up, so we always have a bigger volume quarter in the fourth quarter. So I would expect gross margins to tick down a little bit.
Tax rate for 2022, I think, is anybody's guess based on tax reform out there. So certainly, I think we guided to 21% this year versus a couple of years ago, I think we were 16% or something like that. And obviously, COVID has played a big role in that with greater income and higher tax jurisdictions. So I think our tax rate in 2022 is dependent upon 2 things: one, your view on COVID and how much revenue will be there from that because it comes typically with a higher tax rate; and two, what happens with tax reform. So today that has not been changed, but none of our assumptions have taken into account any kind of particular tax reform changes. So hopefully that helps, Brandon."

In the analytical and applied markets, Paul. So it's been more on the semiconductor side, I would say, chemicals and energy was pretty strong for us. And so we launched our Triple Quad.
