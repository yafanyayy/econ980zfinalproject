And thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent results for both the fourth quarter and the full year in spite of extraordinary challenges that we all faced in 2020.Q4 revenue was $846 million,",1459,"Thanks, Tom. And thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent results for both the fourth quarter and the full year in spite of extraordinary challenges that we all faced in 2020.
Q4 revenue was $846 million, up 10% over Q4 in 2019 and up 8% in constant currency. This strong result was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security business and continued high-traffic levels on our intelligent edge platform. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 30%, up 1 point over Q4 in 2019. And Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $1.33 per diluted share, up 8% year-over-year and up 6% in constant currency.
For the full year, we surpassed our expectations on the top of the lines, setting new reference for our business and positioning us well in the future. Full year 2020 revenue was $3.2 billion, up 11% over the prior year in constant currency and topping the $3 billion mark for the first time in our history.
We're especially pleased to report that we expanded non-GAAP operating margin to 31% in 2020, over achieving our target of 30%. This is up dramatically from 24% in 2017. I think it's worth noting that we achieved this expansion over the past 3 years, while also investing for future growth.
Non-GAAP EPS for 2020 was $5.22 per share, up 16% over 2019, and exceeding $5 per share for the first time. We also generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations last year, up 15% over 2019, and representing 38% of revenue.
Our security portfolio continued to be the fastest-growing part of our business in Q4, generating revenue of $296 million, up 23% year-over-year in constant currency. For the full year, security revenue exceeded $1 billion and grew 25% over 2019. This puts Akamai in rare company as new firms generate more than $1 billion in annual revenue from cybersecurity solutions and fewer still grew at 25% last year. Security represented 1/3 of our revenue last year, which is up 29 -- up from 29% in 2019 and 24% in 2018. Bookings were especially strong for our prolexic service in Q4 as we helped dozens of major enterprises defend against a huge wave of ransom DDoS attacks that began in Q3. DDoS production has been a mainstay of our portfolio for years and has never been more relevant for customers.
We also saw strong bookings for our Bot manager solution. OP manager helps defend against credential abuse attacks, which are about 4x greater in 2020 than the year before. 2020 was also a strong year for innovation with the release of Page Integrity Manager and Secure Web Gateway. Bookings for both are off to an excellent start as enterprises increasingly need to deal with malware and third-party software and applications. And the addition of Secure Web Gateway to our Enterprise Threat Protector service, better positions us to compete in the fast-growing enterprise security market.
We were also pleased to close our acquisition of Asavie in Q4, which helps advance our security capabilities for cellular devices and networks. New Asavie customers signed after the integration include a national health agency, which adopted Asavie to secure its COVID vaccination application, and digital promise, a nonprofit organization that works to close the digital learning gap for students who equitable access to technology.
Our Media and Carrier division also delivered a strong fourth quarter as a result of continued high levels of traffic for OTT video services and downloads of heat gaming software. On November 10, traffic on the Akamai platform reached an all-time high of 181 terabits per second, 50% greater than the peak in 2019. Nobody in the marketplace comes anywhere close to our capacity to serve customers at the edge on a global scale. In fact, we already exceeded last year's traffic needs just last week.
On the application performance side of the business, Q4 was a crucial quarter for e-commerce with major buying events such as Black Friday and Singles Day. The unmatched reliability, scale, global reach and security of our intelligent edge platform is a major reason why 40 of the world's top 50 retailers and 23 of the top 25 in the U.S. use Akamai to accelerate their commerce applications.
Overall, we're very pleased with our performance last year on both the top and bottom lines. And I want to thank our employees for enabling Akamai to achieve such strong results as they cope with the challenges of the pandemic. As we look to the future, we see substantial opportunity for enterprises to increase their use of the Optima Intelligent edge platform. We believe the edge is where new applications and new business models will come to life, where intelligence will be built into how data is collected and analyzed, where the promise of 5G and IoT will be realized, and where security will provide the online world's first and most important line of defense.
To better take advantage of these opportunities and to better serve our customers. We announced today that we'll be realigning our organization around 2 major groups of products, products that enable business online and products that protect business online. Both product groups will be supported with a single unified sales organization.
Products that enable business online will be the focus of our new edge technology group, which will be led by Adam Karon as COO and General Manager. This group will be responsible for our media delivery, web performance and edge computing solutions as well as the edge platform that underpins everything we do. These products generate about 2/3 of our total revenue today with strong margins and cash generation to fuel our innovation firepower.
The group's mission is twofold: first, to ensure that our edge platform remains the unparalleled market leader for scale, performance, reliability, ease of use, agility and cost; and second, to generate additional growth through the innovation of new products and services for emerging customer needs in areas such as IoT, 5G and serverless computing.
Products that protect business online will come together in a new security technology group to be led by Rick McConnell, as President and general leadership. This new group will be responsible for all our security solutions, including our market-leading web security products, such as Kona Site Defender, Bot Manager and Prolexic. Our enterprise security products, such as Enterprise Application Access and Enterprise Threat Protector. And our carrier security products, such as our D&S based secure business offering, and our new secure mobile service from Asavie.
In 2021, we'll go to market with a unified mobile sales organization to better serve our customers, deepen our channel relationships and provide our customers and partners with easier access to the full breadth of our portfolio. P.J. Joseph, who previously led our sales for media and carrier, will lead global sales reporting to me. As part of the new alignment, Bobby Blumont will become our Chief Technology Officer, the guide innovation is being Evangelos for our technology vision and leadership in the marketplace. Kim Salem Jackson, who has successfully led Akamai field marketing and Global Communications for the last 3 years, will become our new Chief Marketing Officer as part of a plan of transition. Kim will succeed Monit Bonner, who has done a fabulous job of transforming our marketing organization over the last 4.5 years. Mo will stay on with Akamai in the senior advisory role, which will allow her to devote more time to our family while still ensuring the success of key marketing initiatives currently underway. You can read more about our organizational announcement in the press release issued today, and you'll be able to hear directly from our leadership team at our Investor Summit on February 25. We will outline our strategy and plans to drive Akamai's next phase of growth.
Akamai made amazing contributions to the world in 2020, but we believe the best is yet to come. Looking ahead, we have the potential to greatly expand our business in enterprise and carrier security as we strive to further grow our leadership position in web security. We plan to grow the capacity of our unparalleled Intelligent Edge Platform by another order of magnitude as we continue to improve our market-leading performance and reliability. We seek to bring innovative new services to market to support emerging IoT and serverless computing applications. We want to help enable the world take advantage of the incredible potential of 5G. And we'll continue our efforts to build value for our shareholders with our world class talent, technology leadership ship, strong profitability and cash generation to fuel our future growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to Ed to provide further details on our 2020 results and the outlook for 2021. Ed?"
24522,701721439,2201024,"Akamai Technologies, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom.

We were very pleased to exceed the high end of our guidance range on revenue and earnings.Q4 revenue was $846 million, up 10% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency, d",1589,"Thank you, Tom. As Tom outlined, Akamai delivered another excellent quarter in Q4. We were very pleased to exceed the high end of our guidance range on revenue and earnings.
Q4 revenue was $846 million, up 10% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency, driven by another quarter of very strong security growth, higher-than-expected gaming traffic in the weaker U.S. dollar. Revenue from our web division was $438 million, up 5% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency. Revenue growth for this group of customers was again led by our security business. And while we saw stronger-than-expected seasonal traffic growth from some of our retail and commerce customers, other customers in this vertical and in our travel and hospitality vertical continued to be negatively impacted by the pandemic.
Revenue from our Media and Carrier division was $408 million, up 15% year-over-year or 14% in constant currency. As noted, we benefited from higher-than-expected gaming and video traffic, along with continued momentum in security. Revenue from the Internet platform customers was $58 million, up 11% from the prior year and above our expectations due to higher-than-expected traffic.
Security revenue for the fourth quarter was $296 million, up 24% year-over-year and 23% in constant currency. Driven by continued global demand across our web security product portfolio and higher-than-expected revenue from our recently closed Asavie acquisition.
Asavie contributed approximately $8 million in Q4, and driven by a combination of much better-than-expected strength in the educational vertical and a faster-than-expected revenue ramp from a recently added carrier in the U.S.
Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $6 million on a sequential basis and positive $9 million on a year-over-year basis. International revenue was $379 million, up 16% year-over-year or 13% in constant currency. Sales in our international markets represented 45% of total revenue in Q4, up 3 points from Q4 2019 and consistent with Q3 levels. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $467 million, up 5% year-over-year.
Moving now to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, in line with our expectations. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 64%. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $280 million, slightly above our guidance, in part due to higher sales commissions given the revenue outperformance we saw in Q4.
Moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $364 million, up $45 million or 14% from the same period in 2019. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 43%, up 2 points from Q4 2019. Non-GAAP operating income was $256 million, up $34 million or 15% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 30%, up 1 point from last year and in line with our guidance. Capital expenditures in Q4, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $195 million.
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $113 million or $0.68 of earnings per diluted share. It is worth noting that our Q4 GAAP results include 2 onetime items: a $27 million restructuring charge, primarily related to the company realignment that Tom mentioned; and a $20 million additional endowment to the Akamai Foundation.
Non-GAAP net income was $220 million or $1.33 of earnings per diluted share, up 8% year-over-year, up 6% in constant currency and $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range due to higher-than-expected revenues. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $39 million, based on a Q4 effective tax rate of approximately 15%.
Now I will discuss some balance sheet items. As of December 31, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.5 billion. After accounting for the $2.3 billion of combined principal amounts of our 2 convertible notes, net cash was approximately $197 million as of December 31.
Now I'll review our use of capital. During the fourth quarter, we spent $73 million to repurchase shares. Buying back approximately 700,000 shares. We ended Q4 with approximately $572 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Our long-term plan remains to leverage our share buyback program to offset dilution resulting from equity compensation over time.
I'm very proud of all of our employees who delivered these outstanding Q4 and 2020 results, especially during a very challenging year for us all. Now before I provide guidance, I thought it would be helpful to talk about how we see the year unfolding and highlight some key items you may want to consider as you build your models.
Our revenue outlook assumes that the pandemic related impacts to areas like work from home and travel will last at least for the first half of 2021. As a result, we expect to see continued challenges in our retail and travel verticals. From a traffic perspective, as life returns to a more normalized pre-pandemic state, we do not expect to see our traffic on our platform decrease. We believe the pandemic has accelerated consumer usage of the Internet in areas like OTT video, gaming and e-commerce. And we believe this usage pattern will likely persist going forward. However, we expect to see traffic continue to grow in 2021, but at a rate more in line with pre-2020 historical levels.
In addition to revenue, there are some other items we expect in 2021 that are worth calling out: First, in 2020, our travel and related expenses were much lower than normal. Our guidance assumes that these expenses begin to return to a more normalized level beginning in the second half of 2021; second, in light of the recent decline in interest rates, we expect our interest income to decline on a year-over-year basis. Specifically, we expect interest income to be about $8 million lower year-over-year, which will have a negative impact of about $0.05 on our non-GAAP earnings per share compared with 2020; third, I wanted to remind you of the typical seasonality that we experienced on the top and bottom lines. In the first quarter, we usually see a revenue step down sequentially from Q4, our strong seasonal quarter. Also in Q1, remember that our employee payroll taxes and 401(k) matching programs reset. These costs will decline throughout the year as employees begin to max out; finally, as Tom mentioned earlier, we are reorganizing the company around a product-driven group structure and moving away from the current vertically-aligned division structure.
In Q1, we will report revenue results under the new edge technology and security technology groups, as Tom outlined. The revenue splits will look familiar to you, as they align to our current CDN and other and cloud security revenue reporting that we have historically provided. To assist with the transition, we will continue to report web and Media and Carrier division results on our website for the balance of 2021. And finally, as a result of the reorganization, we expect to record an additional restructuring charge of approximately $7 million in Q1.
Looking ahead to full year, we expect revenue of $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion, which is up 4% to 6% year-over-year in constant currency. This outlook assumes that foreign exchange contributes about $45 million on a year-over-year basis. We expect security revenue growth in the range of 18% to 20% over 2020 levels. We also expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%. We expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.33 to $5.46. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 15% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares. And finally, full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 16% of revenue. This is down 7 points year-over-year as we expect to leverage the significant network capacity investment we made in 2019 and 2020.
Moving on to Q1 guidance. We are projecting Q1 revenue in the range of $822 million to $836 million, were up 5% to 7% in constant currency over Q1 2020. The current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive $4 million impact on Q1 revenue compared to Q4 levels and a positive $16 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $265 million to $270 million. We anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of approximately 44%.
And now moving on to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $111 million to $112 million. Factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30% for Q1.
Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $150 million to $155 million, excluding equity compensation in the first quarter. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.28 to $1.31. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of approximately $37 million to $38 million, based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 15%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares.
In summary, as you heard Tom highlight, we achieved several significant milestones in 2020, including: delivering 11% top line revenue growth with total revenue exceeding $3 billion for the first time company history; growing security revenue 25% and surpassing $1 billion; exceeding our 30% operating margin target; and generating non-GAAP EPS of more than $5 a share.
We are very pleased with our performance in 2020, and we believe we're well positioned for 2021. We look forward to providing you a deeper look into our business and our plans for the future at our upcoming Investor Summit on February 25.

So obviously, 2020 was an unusually high-traffic year for us. And the point I was trying to make there is that we're not seeing that decline. But what we're expecting going into this year is what I'd call more normal traffic year. So you start to get into some tougher compares as you get into Q2 and throughout the rest of the year. And you still have the normal dynamics in the media business, most of the traffic is coming from media, obviously. So there'll be a series of renewals and that sort of thing, which is pretty normal.
And then the second thing that we called out is that we are starting to see a bit more pressure in travel and hospitality and retail. The first wave was customers coming to us, asking us for extended payment terms, some credits or some help within a quarter. Now we're getting into a renewal cycle. So we're expecting to see some pressure from that area. And keep in mind, that's about 20% of our total business, about 40% of our web division, our prior web division business. So that's going to have a little bit of an impact on us as well."

When we created the current structure 5 years ago, we didn't really have a security business to speak of a few million dollars. Now it's over $1 billion, and we had the products there were split among 3 different groups: The Web Security group, which is most of it; Enterprise Security, which we've talked a lot about; and Carrier Security, which is very closely tied to Enterprise. And Enterprise and Carrier are getting to a real scale now that we can bring them out of incubation and bring all of our security teams together in a division that just focuses on security. And I think that will provide even stronger growth going forward. Also unifying sales makes sense now. Before, we had a media sales force that we're selling to customers who are buying media products. We had a web sales force selling to verticals that we're buying web products. So splitting made sense then. But now all of our customers buy security. In fact, some of the big media customers are our biggest buyers of security products. And so I think it makes sense to bring the field force together, and it's more efficient. So I think the end result is that we will operate more efficiently, we'll have stronger innovation and continued very strong growth in our security product group. And also on the CDN side of the house, as Ed talked about, we've got some tailwinds there, also some challenges in the commerce and travel vertical. But I think very interesting future growth with areas like IoT, 5G and serverless computing. And bringing those teams together, I think, again, will enable us to be more efficient moving forward."

Also in our platform, making it more of a programmable platform for our customers with projects such as edge workers and making it easier for customers to just deploy their code straight on to Akamai.
In terms of what the customer sees, they're going to see the same rep they saw before, by and large. When we had split the sales force before, it was by vertical. And so when we bring it together, it doesn't mean that there is an account breakage per se or that you're going to have a different rep. Now that said, it will be a more efficient management structure. We'll have a deeper focus on channels. It's especially important for our growing security products, particularly in the enterprise and carrier security products.

Enterprise Threat Protector with solar wins becomes more important than ever to know what employee devices and enterprise devices are talking to, are they trying to contact, command control outside the enterprise.

And for example, things like students that need to gain access for remote learning, to protect them to make sure that their environment is secure. There's been a lot of development, of course, with carriers there. They sell this product, and we're behind the scenes. But very strong pickup there to secure the enterprise cellular networks. And then you think about IoT in the future, all those devices have to be secured and probably all going to be connected with 5G, so I think a lot of potential upside there.

It's something the senior management team would discuss, at least on an annual basis. And in terms of the trigger now, our security business has reached $1 billion, and that's an important milestone. We're also seeing really strong growth for the enterprise and carrier security products, as I mentioned, and they were both in the incubation phase and in different parts of the company. We had the enterprise group, had the enterprise security products and for the carrier products, that was on the Media and Carrier division. And of course, most of security revenue was in the web division.
And increasingly, as the smaller product areas grew, you start to have overlap. For example, anybody that buys Asavie, we want to sell him Kona Site Defender. Makes perfect sense. Same thing for Enterprise Security. If you buy EAA, you want Kona. And so I think it really makes sense now they've reached critical mass to bring them together into 1 team, focused on security.
And as I mentioned, with the sales organization is something we have thought about over the last couple of years, certainly more efficient to have a single sales organization. And the advantage of having them be split had disappeared really once all our customers are buying really all our products, but certainly security.
So again, the time is right to do it. And you don't like doing something in the middle of the pandemic, but at the same time, you can't wait. At Akamai, we always have a sense of urgency. We want to get this done because I think it will help our growth going forward.
Now in terms of 11%, we're very pleased to see that this year, we definitely got some tailwinds for overall traffic levels. And so the Media and Carrier division did well. We also deployed a ton of capacity for, as Ed mentioned, increased growth this year and next year. Just the rate of growth, probably less this year, next year, more like normal traffic increases as opposed to twice that, that we experienced this year.
I think we got hurt in revenue and our web performance products, as Ed talked about. A big part of their revenue comes from commerce, which has gotten -- most commerce companies have really been pounded with COVID. There's a few big names that have done very well, probably picked up business. The amount of commerce going online has increased dramatically, but when the parent company is hurting, that creates a more difficult environment to negotiate a contract. And in many cases, as we've talked about, we've worked with the customer to give them some relief and on pricing as well. We've gone to 0 overage, so they can plan better. And that hurt, I think revenue this past Q4, don't get a lot of firsting. On the other hand, it preserves that business more for us long term. And we're in this for the long haul. And it means we aren't going to share that business with the many competitors out there would like to have just a tiny piece of our commerce business. And so it seems a little paradoxical that on the one hand, probably hurt us on revenue on the other, as we talked about, we serve 40 of the global 50 leaders in commerce and retail and 23 of 25 in the U.S. And we're working very hard to maintain that business over the long-term and grow it, particularly with our security products."

It was more of a tech tuck-in, similar others that we've done in the past. So there's no real contribution from that directly. As we integrate, it will help accelerate some of our other products. Asavie, probably about $30 million incremental. If you look kind of year-over-year, we had about $8 million this quarter, so somewhere in that range. So call it a little less than a point.
And then as far as the Internet platform customers, I'm not going to tip my cap to the team that's been working on those. They've done a fantastic job not only maintaining that business, but growing it. I haven't provided specific guidance, but I'd expect kind of a similar year where you're kind of maintain where you're at and maybe a little upside. Q4 was particularly strong, so maybe it's in that $50 million range, plus or minus a few million bucks depending on what's going on in the particular quarter."

And it highlights the need for products, for example, like our Enterprise Threat Protector. It's one thing to try to stop the malware from getting inside. That's hard. You look at an example like this. But once it's inside, it has to go out and contact command and control. And that's something that you can pick up and detect and block in many cases and then alert the CISO that they got a problem. And that's what our enterprise Threat protector product is meant to do and has done in many, many cases. So I think in the long run, it just heightens the need for products that we provide. And the need for Zero Trust, in general, stepping up the level. With third-party malware showing up everywhere, that's the same problem you have with page integrity and why our Page Integrity Manager service is so important. Because today, so many websites linked to third parties or use third-party or open source code that has malware. And what that means is when a client or one of their users goes to their website or uses their app, the client gets infected and their personal information is exposed. And it's just another example of a third-party malware that's become infected that the enterprise is using. A different particular use case. One is the website, the other is internal enterprise apps, same problem and same devastating result, and Akamai has solutions to help stop that."

As we mentioned before, I don't see a lot of account disruption, a lot of account breakage. You do worry whenever you change the go-to-market operation that you could have some disruption that way. I don't think that's likely here because, as we mentioned, a lot of the accounts have the same person they had before that they're dealing with. So I don't think that will be a problem for us.

And thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent results for both the fourth quarter and the full year in spite of extraordinary challenges that we all faced in 2020. Q4 revenue was $846 million,",1458,"Thanks, Tom. And thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent results for both the fourth quarter and the full year in spite of extraordinary challenges that we all faced in 2020. 
Q4 revenue was $846 million, up 10% over Q4 in 2019 and up 8% in constant currency. This strong result was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security business and continued high-traffic levels on our intelligent edge platform. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 30%, up 1 point over Q4 in 2019. And Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $1.33 per diluted share, up 8% year-over-year and up 6% in constant currency. 
For the full year, we surpassed our expectations on the top of the lines, setting new records for our business and positioning us well in the future. Full year 2020 revenue was $3.2 billion, up 11% over the prior year in constant currency and topping the $3 billion mark for the first time in our history. 
We're especially pleased to report that we expanded non-GAAP operating margin to 31% in 2020, over achieving our target of 30%. This is up dramatically from 24% in 2017. I think it's worth noting that we achieved this expansion over the past 3 years, while also investing for future growth. 
Non-GAAP EPS for 2020 was $5.22 per share, up 16% over 2019, and exceeding $5 per share for the first time. We also generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations last year, up 15% over 2019, and representing 38% of revenue. 
Our security portfolio continued to be the fastest-growing part of our business in Q4, generating revenue of $296 million, up 23% year-over-year in constant currency. For the full year, security revenue exceeded $1 billion and grew 25% over 2019. This puts Akamai in rare company as new firms generate more than $1 billion in annual revenue from cybersecurity solutions and fewer still grew at 25% last year. Security represented 1/3 of our revenue last year, which is up 29 -- up from 29% in 2019 and 24% in 2018. Bookings were especially strong for our Prolexic service in Q4 as we helped dozens of major enterprises defend against a huge wave of ransom DDoS attacks that began in Q3. DDoS production has been a mainstay of our portfolio for years and has never been more relevant for customers. 
We also saw strong bookings for our Bot Manager solution. OP manager helps defend against credential abuse attacks, which are about 4x greater in 2020 than the year before. 2020 was also a strong year for innovation, with the release of Page Integrity Manager and Secure Web Gateway. Bookings for both are off to an excellent start, as enterprises increasingly need to deal with malware, third-party software and applications. And the addition of Secure Web Gateway to our Enterprise Threat Protector service, better positions us to compete in the fast-growing enterprise security market. 
We were also pleased to close our acquisition of Asavie in Q4, which helps advance our security capabilities for cellular devices and networks. New Asavie customers signed after the integration include a national health agency, which adopted Asavie to secure its COVID vaccination application, and Digital Promise, a nonprofit organization that works to close the digital learning gap for students with equitable access to technology. 
Our Media and Carrier division also delivered a strong fourth quarter as a result of continued high levels of traffic for OTT video services and downloads of [indiscernible] gaming software. On November 10, traffic on the Akamai platform reached an all-time high of 181 terabits per second, 50% greater than the peak in 2019. Nobody in the marketplace comes anywhere close to our capacity to serve customers at the edge on a global scale. In fact, we already exceeded last year's traffic feat just last week. 
On the Application Performance side of the business, Q4 was a crucial quarter for e-commerce with major buying events such as Black Friday and Singles Day. The unmatched reliability, scale, global reach and security of our intelligent edge platform is a major reason why 40 of the world's top 50 retailers and 23 of the top 25 in the U.S. use Akamai to accelerate their commerce applications. 
Overall, we're very pleased with our performance last year on both the top and bottom lines. And I want to thank our employees for enabling Akamai to achieve such strong results as they cope with the challenges of the pandemic. As we look to the future, we see substantial opportunity for enterprises to increase their use of the Akamai intelligent edge platform. We believe the edge is where new applications and new business models will come to life, where intelligence will be built into how data is collected and analyzed, where the promise of 5G and IoT will be realized, and where security will provide the online world's first and most important line of defense. 
To better take advantage of these opportunities and to better serve our customers. We announced today that we'll be realigning our organization around 2 major groups of products, products that enable business online and products that protect business online. Both product groups will be supported with a single unified sales organization. 
Products that enable business online will be the focus of our new Edge Technology Group, which will be led by Adam Karon as COO and General Manager. This group will be responsible for our media delivery, web performance and edge computing solutions as well as the edge platform that underpins everything we do. These products generate about 2/3 of our total revenue today with strong margins and cash generation to fuel our innovation firepower. The group's mission is twofold: first, to ensure that our edge platform remains the unparalleled market leader for scale, performance, reliability, ease of use, agility and cost; and second, to generate additional growth through the innovation of new products and services for emerging customer needs in areas such as IoT, 5G and serverless computing. 
Products that protect business online will come together in a new security technology group to be led by Rick McConnell, as President and General Manager. This new group will be responsible for all our security solutions, including our market-leading web security products, such as Kona Site Defender, Bot Manager and Prolexic, our enterprise security products, such as Enterprise Application Access and Enterprise Threat Protector, and our carrier security products, such as our D&S based secure business offering, and our new secure mobile service from Asavie. 
In 2021, we'll go to market with a unified mobile sales organization to better serve our customers, deepen our channel relationships and provide our customers and partners with easier access to the full breadth of our portfolio. P.J. Joseph, who previously led our sales for media and carrier, will lead global sales, reporting to me. As part of the new alignment, Bobby Blumont will become our Chief Technology Officer, to guide innovation and be an evangelist for our technology vision and leadership in the marketplace. 
Kim Salem-Jackson, who has successfully led Akamai field marketing and Global Communications for the last 3 years, will become our new Chief Marketing Officer as part of a plan of transition. Kim will succeed Monique Bonner, who has done a fabulous job of transforming our marketing organization over the last 4.5 years. Mo will stay on with Akamai in a senior advisory role, which will allow her to devote more time to her family while still ensuring the success of key marketing initiatives currently underway. You can read more about our organizational announcement in the press release issued today, and you'll be able to hear directly from our leadership team at our Investor Summit on February 25, where we will outline our strategy and plans to drive Akamai's next phase of growth. 
Akamai made amazing contributions to the world in 2020, but we believe the best is yet to come. Looking ahead, we have the potential to greatly expand our business in enterprise and carrier security as we strive to further grow our leadership position in web security. We plan to grow the capacity of our unparalleled Intelligent Edge Platform by another order of magnitude as we continue to improve our market-leading performance reliability. We seek to bring innovative new services to market to support emerging IoT and serverless computing applications. We want to help enable the world to take advantage of the incredible potential of 5G. And we'll continue our efforts to build value for our shareholders with our world class talent, technology leadership, strong profitability and cash generation to fuel our future growth. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ed to provide further details on our 2020 results and the outlook for 2021. Ed?"

As Tom outlined, Akamai delivered another excellent quarter in Q4. We were very pleased to exceed the high end of our guidance range on revenue and earnings. Q4 revenue was $846 million, up 10% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency,",1589,"Thank you, Tom. As Tom outlined, Akamai delivered another excellent quarter in Q4. We were very pleased to exceed the high end of our guidance range on revenue and earnings. 
Q4 revenue was $846 million, up 10% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency, driven by another quarter of very strong security growth, higher-than-expected gaming traffic and the weaker U.S. dollar. Revenue from our web division was $438 million, up 5% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency. Revenue growth for this group of customers was again led by our security business. And while we saw stronger-than-expected seasonal traffic growth from some of our retail and commerce customers, other customers in this vertical and in our travel and hospitality vertical continued to be negatively impacted by the pandemic. 
Revenue from our Media and Carrier division was $408 million, up 15% year-over-year or 14% in constant currency. As noted, we benefited from higher-than-expected gaming and video traffic, along with continued momentum in security. Revenue from the Internet platform customers was $58 million, up 11% from the prior year and above our expectations due to higher-than-expected traffic. Security revenue for the fourth quarter was $296 million, up 24% year-over-year and 23% in constant currency. Driven by continued global demand across our web security product portfolio and higher-than-expected revenue from our recently closed Asavie acquisition. 
Asavie contributed approximately $8 million in Q4, driven by a combination of much better-than-expected strength in the educational vertical and a faster-than-expected revenue ramp from a recently added carrier in the U.S.
Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $6 million on a sequential basis and positive $9 million on a year-over-year basis. International revenue was $379 million, up 16% year-over-year or 13% in constant currency. Sales in our international markets represented 45% of total revenue in Q4, up 3 points from Q4 2019 and consistent with Q3 levels. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $467 million, up 5% year-over-year.
Moving now to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, in line with our expectations. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 64%. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $280 million, slightly above our guidance, in part due to higher sales commissions given the revenue outperformance we saw in Q4.
Moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $364 million, up $45 million or 14% from the same period in 2019. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 43%, up 2 points from Q4 2019. Non-GAAP operating income was $256 million, up $34 million or 15% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 30%, up 1 point from last year and in line with our guidance. Capital expenditures in Q4, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $195 million.
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $113 million or $0.68 of earnings per diluted share. It is worth noting that our Q4 GAAP results include 2 onetime items: a $27 million restructuring charge, primarily related to the company realignment that Tom mentioned; and a $20 million additional endowment to the Akamai Foundation.
Non-GAAP net income was $220 million or $1.33 of earnings per diluted share, up 8% year-over-year, up 6% in constant currency and $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range due to higher-than-expected revenues. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $39 million, based on a Q4 effective tax rate of approximately 15%.
Now I will discuss some balance sheet items. As of December 31, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.5 billion. After accounting for the $2.3 billion of combined principal amounts of our 2 convertible notes, net cash was approximately $197 million as of December 31.
Now I'll review our use of capital. During the fourth quarter, we spent $73 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 700,000 shares. We ended Q4 with approximately $572 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Our long-term plan remains to leverage our share buyback program to offset dilution resulting from equity compensation over time.
I'm very proud of all of our employees who delivered these outstanding Q4 and 2020 results, especially during a very challenging year for us all. Now before I provide guidance, I thought it would be helpful to talk about how we see the year unfolding and highlight some key items you may want to consider as you build your models.
Our revenue outlook assumes that the pandemic related impacts to areas like work from home and travel will last at least for the first half of 2021. As a result, we expect to see continued challenges in our retail and travel verticals. From a traffic perspective, as life returns to a more normalized pre-pandemic state, we do not expect to see our traffic on our platform decrease. We believe the pandemic has accelerated consumer usage of the Internet in areas like OTT video, gaming and e-commerce. And we believe this usage pattern will likely persist going forward. However, we expect to see traffic continue to grow in 2021, but at a rate more in line with pre-2020 historical levels.
In addition to revenue, there are some other items we expect in 2021 that are worth calling out: First, in 2020, our travel and related expenses were much lower than normal. Our guidance assumes that these expenses begin to return to a more normalized level beginning in the second half of 2021; second, in light of the recent decline in interest rates, we expect our interest income to decline on a year-over-year basis. Specifically, we expect interest income to be about $8 million lower year-over-year, which will have a negative impact of about $0.05 on our non-GAAP earnings per share compared with 2020; third, I wanted to remind you of the typical seasonality that we experienced on the top and bottom lines. In the first quarter, we usually see a revenue step down sequentially from Q4, our strong seasonal quarter. Also in Q1, remember that our employee payroll taxes and 401(k) matching programs reset. These costs will decline throughout the year as employees begin to max out; finally, as Tom mentioned earlier, we are reorganizing the company around a product-driven group structure and moving away from the current vertically-aligned division structure.
In Q1, we will report revenue results under the new edge technology and security technology groups, as Tom outlined. The revenue splits will look familiar to you, as they align to our current CDN and other and cloud security revenue reporting that we have historically provided. To assist with the transition, we will continue to report web and Media and Carrier division results on our website for the balance of 2021. And finally, as a result of the reorganization, we expect to record an additional restructuring charge of approximately $7 million in Q1.
Looking ahead to full year, we expect revenue of $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion, which is up 4% to 6% year-over-year in constant currency. This outlook assumes that foreign exchange contributes about $45 million on a year-over-year basis. We expect security revenue growth in the range of 18% to 20% over 2020 levels. We also expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%. We expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.33 to $5.46. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 15% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares. And finally, full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 16% of revenue. This is down 7 points year-over-year as we expect to leverage the significant network capacity investment we made in 2019 and 2020.
Moving on to Q1 guidance. We are projecting Q1 revenue in the range of $822 million to $836 million, were up 5% to 7% in constant currency over Q1 2020. The current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive $4 million impact on Q1 revenue compared to Q4 levels and a positive $16 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $265 million to $270 million. We anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of approximately 44%.
And now moving on to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $111 million to $112 million. Factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30% for Q1.
Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $150 million to $155 million, excluding equity compensation in the first quarter. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.28 to $1.31. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of approximately $37 million to $38 million, based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 15%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares.
In summary, as you heard Tom highlight, we achieved several significant milestones in 2020, including: delivering 11% top line revenue growth with total revenue exceeding $3 billion for the first time in company history; growing security revenue 25% and surpassing $1 billion; exceeding our 30% operating margin target; and generating non-GAAP EPS of more than $5 a share.
We are very pleased with our performance in 2020, and we believe we're well positioned for 2021. We look forward to providing you a deeper look into our business and our plans for the future at our upcoming Investor Summit on February 25.
Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

So obviously, 2020 was an unusually high-traffic year for us. And the point I was trying to make there is that we're not seeing that decline. But what we're expecting going into this year is what I'd call a more normal traffic year. So you start to get into some tougher compares as you get into Q2 and throughout the rest of the year. And you still have the normal dynamics in the media business, most of the traffic is coming from media, obviously. So there'll be a series of renewals and that sort of thing, which is pretty normal.
And then the second thing that we called out is that we are starting to see a bit more pressure in travel and hospitality and retail. The first wave was customers coming to us, asking us for extended payment terms, some credits or some help within a quarter. Now we're getting into a renewal cycle. So we're expecting to see some pressure from that area. And keep in mind, that's about 20% of our total business, about 40% of our web division, our prior web division business. So that's going to have a little bit of an impact on us as well."

When we created the current structure 5 years ago, we didn't really have a security business to speak of, a few million dollars. Now it's over $1 billion, and we had, the products there were split among 3 different groups: The Web Security group, which is most of it; Enterprise Security, which we've talked a lot about; and Carrier Security, which is very closely tied to Enterprise. And Enterprise and Carrier are getting to a real scale now that we can bring them out of incubation and bring all of our security teams together in a division that just focuses on security. And I think that will provide even stronger growth going forward. Also unifying sales makes sense now. Before, we had a media sales force that were selling to customers who are buying media products. We had a web sales force selling to verticals that were buying web products. 
So splitting made sense then. But now all of our customers buy security. In fact, some of the big media customers are our biggest buyers of security products. And so I think it makes sense to bring the field force together, and it's more efficient. So I think the end result is that we will operate more efficiently, we'll have stronger innovations and continued very strong growth in our security product group. And also on the CDN side of the house, as Ed talked about, we've got some tailwinds there, also some challenges in the commerce and travel vertical. But I think very interesting future growth with areas like IoT, 5G and serverless computing. And bringing those teams together, I think, again, will enable us to be more efficient moving forward."

So if you could talk us kind of through kind of where are you taking sort of investment away and where you're adding investment, that would be helpful.

In terms of investments, we added over 500 heads this year, investing in security R&D as a percentage. So I think we've done a really good job of cutting costs and scaling, but being able to invest back in the business. So this is really was about the cost savings initiative? It was more about better efficiency confinement. So we're keeping margins in that 30% to be investing a bit in the business moving forward as well. And as we've said in the past, we think 30% is a pretty good place to be running the business."

Net headcount went up quite a bit last year and will grow again this year despite the current reduction taking place. We're investing in innovation, new products, particularly in the security area. Also in our platform, making it more of a programmable platform for our customers, with projects such as edge workers and making it easier for customers to just deploy their code straight on to Akamai.
In terms of what the customer sees, they're going to see the same rep they saw before, by and large. When we had split the sales force before, it was by vertical. And so when we bring it together, it doesn't mean that there is an account breakage per se or that you're going to have a different rep. Now that said, it will be a more efficient management structure. We'll have a deeper focus on channels. It's especially important for our growing security products, particularly in the enterprise and carrier security products. And it will be easier, I think, for a rep to sell everything than maybe it was before. Now I think reps were, for example, in media, as I mentioned, selling security products, and they were versed in the whole product set, but I think that becomes even easier now."

We do have a lot of newer products that are ramping fast, but it just takes a while in a recurring revenue business. I think if you go back in the past, we've talked about last year, getting to $1 billion. We exceeded that. The year before that, mid-20s, we did high 20s. So there's always a possibility to overachieve, but I think that's a reasonable guide. 
The other question was on the intentions of what to talk about at the Analyst Day. As far as 2021 guidance, that's only in 2 weeks, so I'm not going to see any difference that I haven't seen yet. So I don't anticipate updating guidance from what we just talked about now. 
But what we will do is get into a lot more detail. You'll hear from all the leaders talking about what's the different groups and what they're going to be working on, some of the growth dynamics. We'll be exposing a lot more about what's going on within the security buckets. We'll be showing you different growth rates and different products. So I think there's a lot of good information that will come out of that. But in terms of updating guidance, there won't be any to do that, just given that it's 2 weeks from today."

Enterprise Application Access, really important because of all the malicious log in attempts. Enterprise Threat Protector, with SolarWinds, becomes more important than ever to know what employee devices and enterprise devices are talking to, are they trying to contact, command and control outside the enterprise. That's something that we can help catch and stop. 
Asavie has done incredibly well, much better than we'd expected post acquisition. And for example, things like students that need to gain access for remote learning, to protect them, to make sure that their environment is secure. There's been a lot of development, of course, with carriers there. They sell this product, and we're behind the scenes. But very strong pickup there to secure the enterprise cellular networks. 
And then you think about IoT in the future, all those devices have to be secured and probably all going to be connected with 5G, so I think a lot of potential upside there. And our secure business solution that's resold by major carriers under their brand for small and media business -- medium business, again, doing very well. So I would say, across the board, with the enterprise and carrier products, very strong growth, and we might have a good chance of doubling revenue this year and reaching $100 million."

And then secondly, very high level, when you look at the 11% annual growth, a lot of puts and takes as it relates to COVID. At least, the extent you can dial it in, what do you think growth would have been ex-COVID impacts? Obviously, pro and con, but any color there?"

It's something the senior management team would discuss, at least on an annual basis. And in terms of the trigger now, our security business has reached $1 billion, and that's an important milestone. We're also seeing really strong growth for the enterprise and carrier security products, as I mentioned, and they were both in the incubation phase and in different parts of the company. We had the enterprise group, had the enterprise security products and for the carrier products, that was on the Media and Carrier division. And of course, most of security revenue was in the web division.
And increasingly, as the smaller product areas grew, you start to have overlap. For example, anybody that buys Asavie, we want to sell him Kona Site Defender. Makes perfect sense. Same thing for enterprise security. If you buy EAA, you want Kona. And so I think it really makes sense now they've reached critical mass to bring them together into 1 team, focused on security.
And as I mentioned, with the sales organization is something we have thought about, over the last couple of years, certainly more efficient to have a single sales organization. And the advantage of having them be split had disappeared really once all our customers are buying really all our products, but certainly security.
So again, the time is right to do it. And you don't like doing something in the middle of the pandemic, but at the same time, you can't wait. At Akamai, we always have a sense of urgency. We want to get this done, because I think it will help our growth going forward.
Now in terms of 11%, we're very pleased to see that this year, we definitely got some tailwinds for overall traffic levels. And so the Media and Carrier division did well. We also deployed a ton of capacity for, as Ed mentioned, increased growth this year and next year. Just the rate of growth, probably less this year, next year, more like normal traffic increases as opposed to twice that, that we experienced this year.
I think we got hurt in revenue and our web performance products, as Ed talked about. A big part of their revenue comes from commerce, which has gotten -- most commerce companies have really been pounded with COVID. There's a few big names that have done very well, probably picked up business. The amount of commerce going online has increased dramatically, but when the parent company is hurting, that creates a more difficult environment to negotiate a contract. 
And in many cases, as we've talked about, we've worked with the customer to give them some relief and on pricing as well. We've gone to 0 overage, so they can plan better. And that hurt, I think revenue this past Q4, don't get a lot of firsting. On the other hand, it preserves that business more for us long term. And we're in this for the long haul. And it means we aren't going to share that business with the many competitors out there would like to have just a tiny piece of our commerce business. 
And so it seems a little paradoxical that on the one hand, it probably hurt us on revenue, on the other, as we talked about, we serve 40 of the global 50 leaders in commerce and retail and 23 of 25 in the U.S. And we're working very hard to maintain that business over the long-term and grow it, particularly with our security products."

Asavie, probably about $30 million incremental. If you look kind of year-over-year, we had about $8 million this quarter, so somewhere in that range. So call it a little less than a point.
And then as far as the Internet platform customers, I'm going to tip my cap to the team that's been working on those. They've done a fantastic job not only maintaining that business, but growing it. I haven't provided specific guidance, but I'd expect kind of a similar year where you're kind of, maintain where you're at and maybe a little upside.

And it highlights the need for products, for example, like our Enterprise Threat Protector. It's one thing to try to stop the malware from getting inside. That's hard. You look at an example like this. But once it's inside, it has to go out and contact command and control. And that's something that you can pick up and detect and block in many cases, and then alert the CISO that they got a problem. And that's what our Enterprise Threat Protector product is meant to do and has done in many, many cases. 
So I think in the long run, it just heightens the need for products that we provide. And the need for Zero Trust, in general, stepping up a level. With third-party malware showing up everywhere, that's the same problem you have with Page Integrity and why our Page Integrity Manager service is so important. Because today, so many websites link to third parties or use third-party or open source code that has malware. And what that means is when a client or one of our users goes to their website or uses their app, the client gets infected and their personal information's exposed. 
And it's just another example of a third-party malware that's become infected that the enterprise is using. A different particular use case. One's the website, the other's internal enterprise apps, same problem and same devastating result, and Akamai has solutions to help stop that."

I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent results in the first quarter. Q1 revenue was $843 million, up 10% year-over-year and up 8% in constant currency. This strong result was driven by",1441,"Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. 
I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent results in the first quarter. Q1 revenue was $843 million, up 10% year-over-year and up 8% in constant currency. This strong result was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security business, accelerated growth in our edge applications business and continued high-traffic levels on our intelligent edge platform. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 31% and Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $1.38 per diluted share, up 15% year-over-year and up 11% in constant currency. With a strong start to 2021, we're proud that Akamai has continued to enable and to protect remote work, home schooling, e-commerce and online entertainment for billions of people around the world amidst very challenging circumstances. 
Our security solutions portfolio performed especially well in Q1, generating revenue of $310 million, up 29% year-over-year and up 27% in constant currency. The very strong growth was experienced across most of our security products, including our new Page Integrity Manager solution. Page Integrity Manager helps enterprises defend against malware and third-party software and applications. Customers that adopted Page Integrity Manager in Q1 included Maersk, the world's largest container shipping operator; and Groupon, the global e-commerce marketplace. 
Maersk uses more than 4,000 scripts, half of which are third-party scripts to drive millions of dollars of online business every hour. Managing this complex and dynamic environment had become an increasingly difficult security challenge for Maersk and so they now use Page Integrity Manager to improve visibility into security threats and to prevent the loss of critical data. 
Our Bot Manager solution also continued to perform very well in Q1. Bot Manager is designed to mitigate a wide variety of automated attacks, including account stuffing attacks where credentials stolen from one website are checked for validity at thousands of other websites. When valid credentials are found, a manual attack is then often used to extract value from the compromised accounts. Losses from account takeovers and new account fraud are estimated at over $10 billion annually in the U.S. In order to forge such manual attacks, we launched the beta for our new account protector solution in Q1. Account protector shields organizations from account takeover and other kinds of fraudulent human activity without increasing friction for legitimate customers. Account protector works by detecting in real-time whether a user logging into an application is the legitimate account owner or an impostor in possession of stolen credentials. 
One of our beta customers for this new solution is a well-known restaurant franchise. It was under attacked by cyber criminals who were compromising the loyalty accounts of their diners. The criminals were stealing loyalty reward points and then reselling them on the dark web. The digital theft outraged the diners whose points were stolen and angered restaurant owners who unknowingly provided meals to fraudsters. With help from Akamai, the franchise can now identify the situations where humans are impersonating valid diners and take action to stop the illicit transfer of loyalty points, thereby stopping the fraud and enabling the franchise to focus on accelerating sales. 
We're also excited about the success of Akamai's fastest-growing security segment, Access Control, which reached an annualized revenue run rate of $100 million in Q1, up more than 170% over Q1 of 2020 and up over 60% organically. Our Access Control segment provides secure connectivity for users, applications, workloads and IoT systems, regardless of their location. Products in this area include Enterprise Application Access, Enterprise Threat Protector and our new secure mobile and secure IoT solutions that we acquired from Asavie in October. Our secure mobile and secure IoT products provide security, visibility and control for mobile devices at the edge. These services deter malicious activity and support acceptable use policies without needing to install a client on the device. The solutions are sold to our carrier partners such as AT&T, where it forms the basis for their AccessMyLAN solution. These capabilities have been especially important in helping school districts secure student devices during the pandemic, so that students can learn from home safely. 
Our Security Solutions also continued to gain recognition from the leading analyst firms in Q1. Our market-leading web application firewall capabilities earned Gartner Peer Insights Customers' Choice distinction. And Forrester named Akamai as a leader in DDoS protection for the third time, saying large enterprise clients that want an experienced trusted vendor to make their DDoS problem go away should look to Akamai. 
Turning to our CDN portfolio. Q1 marked another quarter of very strong traffic growth for Akamai, led by OTT video services and downloads of e-gaming software. On March 16, traffic on the Akamai platform reached an all-time high of 200 terabits per second. This is 19% higher than the peak in Q1 of last year and 2.5x the traffic peak in Q1 of 2019. Daily peaks were also high in Q1, averaging 143 terabits per second. In fact, traffic on our platform exceeded 110 terabits per second, pretty much around the clock in Q1. Overall, our CDN products and services generated revenue of $532 million in Q1, up 2% year-over-year and flat in constant currency. 
The Edge Application segment generated $45 million in revenue last quarter, up more than 30% over Q1 of 2020. As you may recall from the discussion at our Investor Summit in February, this revenue amount includes edge computing solutions, such as edge workers, that we build discreetly, but does not include the wide array of services that use our computing capabilities at the edge. As we discussed during our recent Investor Summit, we believe that there is the potential for substantial future growth in the area of edge computing as we anticipate more enterprises moving their compute workloads to our edge platform for offload, improved performance, security and global scale. A timely example of such a shift is manifested in our new vaccine edge solution, which is enabling over 2 dozen public health agencies and pharmacy chains around the world to deliver and secure COVID vaccine registration sites in the face of extraordinary flash crowds. In multiple instances, Akamai was called in to rescue government agencies whose websites had crashed under load, resulting in frustrated citizens who waited for long times before getting kicked out without a reservation. In some cases, these websites have been using solutions provided by competitors that were not able to handle the load. 
We're pleased to partner on vaccine edge with salesforce.com, and we're proud that our edge worker solution has made a real difference to the many millions of citizens trying to get the vaccine as quickly as possible. 
Our customers are now using edge workers for a wide range of applications. For example, a leading theme park operator is using edge workers to help manage demand as they plan to reopen parks. A publicly traded sports and entertainment company has implemented geo fencing using our edge KB data store, together with edge workers to ensure that users access only relevant broadcast content for their location. A nationwide home improvement retailer and a global credit card company are using A/B testing logic at the edge to deliver fast and personalized user experiences. We're enabling DevOps workflows for our global sportswear brand by managing canary releases, where only a targeted group of users can see a new experience. And we're enabling a leading global manufacturer of devices to authenticate their users at the edge, which improves performance and reduces their cloud costs. 
We're also proud of the progress that we're making with our sustainability efforts. In the past year, we doubled our platform capacity with no increase at all in our platform's carbon footprint. And just 2 weeks ago, on Earth Day, we announced that by 2030, Akamai intends to power 100% of our global operations with renewable energy, improve the energy efficiency of our platform by an additional 50%, mitigate 100% of our platform emissions and continue to recycle 100% of our electronic waste. These goals reflect Akamai's commitment to be a responsible, efficient and forward-looking company. 
In summary, we're very excited about the innovative technology that we're developing, the strong demand from customers for our security and edge computing solutions and our Q1 financial performance on both the top and bottom lines. The growth strategy and goals that we outlined to you in our Investor Summit on February 25, set our direction for the future, and we believe that our strong Q1 results show that we've been executing according to plan. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ed to provide further details on our Q1 results and the outlook for next quarter and 2021. Ed?"

Before I provide additional details on our Q1 performance, I'd like to remind everyone that as a result of the reorganization we announced last quarter, we've refocused the company from a vertical-aligned divisional structure to a product-oriented lens. I will, therefore, be focusing my discussion today on our Security Technology Group and our Edge Technology Group. The Security Group, as you might imagine, encompasses all of our security solution. The Edge Group includes our media delivery and web performance CDN business, along with our edge compute solutions. We plan to provide additional revenue detail for the different product lines within our Security Technology Group and the Edge Technology Group on an annual basis. However, we might highlight specific subgroup details from time to time on our quarterly earnings calls if we feel it will help provide greater context on our results. Finally, as I mentioned on our last call, we will continue to report both Web Division and Media and Carrier division results, along with our Internet platform customer results on our website for the balance of 2021 to assist with this reporting transition. 
So with all that said, as Tom outlined, Akamai delivered another excellent quarter in Q1. We were very pleased to exceed the high end of our guidance range on both revenue and earnings. Q1 revenue was $843 million, up 10% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency, driven by continued strength across most major product areas in our security business, better-than-expected traffic from OTT video and gaming customers and very strong performance in our edge applications business. 
Revenue from our Security Technology Group was $310 million, up 29% year-over-year or 27% in constant currency, driven by broad-based strength across most of our security products. Revenue from our Edge Technology Group was $532 million, up 2% year-over-year or flat in constant currency. We benefited from strong traffic growth driven by OTT video and gaming as well as strong growth in our edge applications business, as Tom mentioned earlier. As expected, foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $3 million on a sequential basis and positive $16 million on a year-over-year basis. 
International revenue was $380 million, up 13% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency. Sales in our international markets represented 45% of total revenue in Q1, up 1 point from Q1 2020 and consistent with Q4 levels. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $463 million, up 8% year-over-year. 
Moving now to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, in line with our expectations. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 64%. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $267 million, in line with our expectations. 
Now moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $375 million, up $49 million or 15% from the same period in 2020. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 45%, up 2 points from Q1 2020. Non-GAAP operating income was $264 million, up $34 million or 15% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 31%, up 1 point from Q1 last year and above our guidance range due to leverage from our revenue outperformance. 
Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $150 million, consistent with our guidance range. We continue to expect Q1 CapEx to represent the high watermark for quarterly CapEx spending in 2021. GAAP net income for the first quarter was $156 million or $0.94 of earnings per diluted share. Our Q1 GAAP results include a $7 million restructuring charge related to the company realignment we announced last quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP net income was $228 million or $1.38 of earnings per diluted share, up 15% year-over-year, up 11% in constant currency and $0.07 above the high end of our guidance range due to our revenue outperformance. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $38 million, based on a Q1 effective tax rate of approximately 14%. 
Now I will discuss some balance sheet items. As of March 31, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.5 billion. After accounting for the $2.3 billion of combined principal amounts of our 2 convertible notes, net cash was approximately $154 million as of March 31. 
Now I will review our use of capital. During the first quarter, we spent $58 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 600,000 shares. We ended Q1 with approximately $514 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Our plan remains to leverage our share buyback program to offset dilution resulting from equity compensation over time. As a result, based on current market conditions, we expect to spend at least $350 million for the full year 2021. 
Moving on to Q2 guidance. We are projecting Q2 revenue in the range of $839 million to $853 million or up 6% to 7% as reported or 3% to 5% in constant currency over Q2 2020. There are 2 factors to consider as you think about year-over-year comparisons for Q2. First, in 2020, we saw a significant uptick in traffic on our network starting at the end of March and continuing through the remainder of the year as a result of global lockdowns. As our excellent Q1 results demonstrate, traffic has continued to grow on our network this year, but we don't expect to see the same traffic growth rates from a year ago going forward. This creates more challenging year-over-year comparisons for our edge delivery business starting in Q2 and continuing for the remainder of 2021. 
Second, the Q2 year-over-year growth comparison also reflects the continuing ban of some Chinese-based apps in India. As a reminder, these apps, which were banned in Q3 of last year, contributed revenue of approximately $15 million in Q2 2020. 
Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $3 million impact on Q2 revenue compared to Q1 levels and a positive $18 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $261 million to $266 million. We anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins of approximately 45%. 
Moving now to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $116 million to $117 million. Factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31% for Q2. 
Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $133 million to $138 million, excluding equity compensation in the second quarter. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.35 to $1.40. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $37 million to $39 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately $0.14 -- excuse me, 14%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares. 
Looking ahead to the full year, we are raising our guidance for both revenue and EPS. We now expect revenue of $3.4 billion to $3.435 billion, which is up 6% to 7% year-over-year as reported or up 5% to 6% in constant currency. We now expect security growth to be in the low 20s for the full year 2021. We are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30% to 31% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.45 to $5.52. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 14% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares. 
Moving on to CapEx. Full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 16% of revenue, unchanged from our prior outlook. 
We are very pleased to have delivered such strong results in Q1 and to be able to increase our outlook for the full year. Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

So I think overall, the dynamics there are pretty comparable to where they were last year. As you know, Akamai is always looking opportunities. We're also very disciplined in terms of actually what we end up buying. 
In terms of CDN market share, the very large media companies do compare the CDN vendors in terms of their traffic share. And if a vendor is doing better than others, they tend to get more share. And that's why Akamai has such a large share when it comes to delivery of media traffic. And if a vendor has outages or is performing poorly, which we see a fair amount out there among our competition, they can lose share. And so that's a very typical dynamic. Nothing new there. It's been that way for several years. And that's why Akamai put such an effort to have the world's best performance. And it's why we have so much of the traffic."

So we don't break out specific growth rates, but I can say that gaming, in particular, was one of the stronger verticals in terms of growth, very pleased with what we saw. The other thing is, I'd say, the names of the number of customers that we saw growing. It wasn't just your normal handful of gaming customers. So we saw some benefit from the continuation of the gaming console releases we saw in Q4. But we also saw a lot of publishers have some pretty significant releases during the quarter. So in general, it was a really good gaming quarter. We're off to a pretty good start here in Q2. And as you know, this -- the gaming release can be a bit seasonal, but so far, it's been a pretty good start to the year. And like I said, I'm pretty happy with the performance across many different customers. 
In terms of guidance, yes, we just start off having a great year. Traffic has been very strong. You saw the security performance. It's a little bit -- we got a lot of exposure on the FX side. So having one quarter down and having the first month of the second quarter down gives you a little bit more confidence going into the year. So we felt that we had enough visibility at this point to raise guidance. As you know, the second half of the year is always little bit more challenging, where Q3, you tend to see summer seasonality. We didn't see that last year because of the pandemic. We'll probably see a little bit of that on the media side. And then Q4, obviously, tends to be our strongest seasonal quarter where you have strong e-commerce and strong media. So we're feeling pretty confident at this point, so we thought it was appropriate to take the guidance up a touch."

So that's probably more of like a calendar '22 impact. But you did come in a little bit ahead on operating margins this quarter. And next quarter, we're looking for 31%. The expectation that you're going to try to sort of kick that up with increased investment in the business?

So we've got some planned investments in the back half of the year. But we took the guidance range up from what we said approximately 30 last time at 30 to 31. So running at 31 here be to touch under in Q3 as we go through our merit cycle. And then Q4 is always a little bit of a wildcard in terms of how strong the revenue performance is. But we want to make sure we're investing back in the business. We see really good growth in security, but also in our edge applications business as well."

Over time, I think as you get into, as we talked about in the Investor Relations Day, where you saw our security margins, gross margins are higher. You've got your media margins are lower. So it really is a mix. And while we're exceeding our plan so far on security, it's going to take a bit for that to really manifest itself in higher gross margins. You just need to get a bigger percentage of the business coming from security. And if you look at the part of the business and media that's growing, it's primarily the high volume, video, high-volume media. That tends to be where you have probably the most competition and pricing pressure. So you kind of balance those 2 to out and you kind of keep the margin -- gross margins flattish year for the year.

You think you've seen it all. And then next week, you read the next headline. The -- and the attackers are very powerful. You have nation states, large-scale organized crime, just -- and what they're doing is pretty scary. Now the great news for Akamai and our customers is that we have solutions that can protect enterprises for a large majority of those attacks. 
A great example is the recent exchange server hack, where many thousands of enterprises got hacked, lost their e-mails, which is really bad. Akamai, our IT department was running an exchange server, just like all those other companies. And the difference is we didn't get hacked because we use our own enterprise security solutions. And we had enterprise application access sitting in front of our exchange server. And that meant that the vulnerability couldn't be exploited because the employee doesn't just get to go contact the exchange server. If they did, then somebody can come in. And before you're authenticated by the exchange server, you can exploit the vulnerability. Instead, they got to get to -- they come to Akamai's Enterprise Application Access product, we authenticate them. And if it's a bad guy outside trying to do something, no way they get in. And not only that, they don't get directly to the exchange server because they have to pass through our securities. So if they're trying to do bad things, we'll stop it. And it's all about our approach to Zero Trust. And yes, we can protect enterprises from these sorts of things. 
And even in zero-day attacks, we didn't know about the exchange hat before other enterprises or Microsoft did, and yet we were protected at zero-day because of our solutions. So I think as the attacks increase, that does increase awareness, and that does help drive our security business. And I see no end to the attacks coming. There's more on the way. And we're in a great position to be able to help the leading enterprises stay safe against those attacks."

I talked about in the prepared remarks that FX sort of came in as expected. We got a little bit of a headwind here quarter-over-quarter, mostly weakness in the yen. But I would say just keep an eye on it though. You just -- if you kind of just step back and do the math, we get a little over $1 billion worth of non-U.S.-denominated revenue. So to the extent that you get a 1% swing, that can swing your $10 million on an annual basis. The major currencies for us are euro, yen, pound, and then it kind of drops off from there. And other currencies aren't as impactful, but those are the 3 to keep an eye on. 
And then working capital, I'd say, like any other year, you'll see nothing unusual in terms of working capital.

You see cash working capital pick up a touch to call out in terms of collections, they've actually been fantastic. Nothing on the payable side. It's unusual.

And I don't see anything that is unusual. And also, if there was anything in our top -- in our earnings -- Analyst Day, we called out our top 8 customers, anyone who's over 1% as a metric. And if there's anything in that group of customers worth calling out, I certainly do that and there's really nothing at this point to call out. And as far as renewals are going, we do a pretty good job of anticipating what to expect, and there hasn't been negative surprises so far."

And we're still, like I said on a few questions ago, we're not quite out of the woods there yet. We're starting to see some stability, but we're not seeing the type of growth yet there. So it's going to take a bit for that to recover. We're doing a nice job of dealing with certain pricing pressure in those verticals with opening up other shares of the wallet, whether it's additional security products or really starting to see a lot of interest in our edge computing and edge applications business as well. So we'll see dollars potentially shift delivery into to that category as we go through pricing negotiations, but that's pretty normal. And once we start to see probably a couple of quarters, hopefully, the travel and retail business get back to normal if these vaccines hold and life returns to normal, hopefully, start to see that segment of the business growing again."

So I first tip my hat to the team that's managing those accounts. They've done a nice job of finding areas for us to add value to incredibly innovative technology companies that have their own CDNs, and we found a nice spot to pick up business, whether it's adding security or delivering graphic for video and gaming for big scale events or for live video or even on-demand video. We're just finding a nice niche there. And that continues to grow. It's up about $1 million quarter-over-quarter. Very impressive growth rate. 
I'd say stability is probably a good way to think about that going through the year. There's always upside with these accounts. Teams identifying new areas of opportunity all the time. So very pleased with where we are with those customers and expect to see probably similar numbers what you're seeing now, down a little bit quarter-to-quarter, depending on certain things that are going on in those accounts."

I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent results in the first quarter. Q1 revenue was $843 million, up 10% year-over-year and up 8% in constant currency. This strong result was driven by",1434,"Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today.  
I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent results in the first quarter. Q1 revenue was $843 million, up 10% year-over-year and up 8% in constant currency. This strong result was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security business, accelerated growth in our edge applications business and continued high-traffic levels on our intelligent edge platform. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 31% and Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $1.38 per diluted share, up 15% year-over-year and up 11% in constant currency. With a strong start to 2021, we're proud that Akamai has continued to enable and to protect remote work, home schooling, e-commerce and online entertainment for billions of people around the world amidst very challenging circumstances.  
Our security solutions portfolio performed especially well in Q1, generating revenue of $310 million, up 29% year-over-year and up 27% in constant currency. The very strong growth was experienced across most of our security products, including our new Page Integrity Manager solution. Page Integrity Manager helps enterprises defend against malware and third-party software and applications. Customers that adopted Page Integrity Manager in Q1 included Maersk, the world's largest container shipping operator; and Groupon, the global e-commerce marketplace.  
Maersk uses more than 4,000 scripts, half of which are third-party scripts to drive millions of dollars of online business every hour. Managing this complex and dynamic environment had become an increasingly difficult security challenge for Maersk and so they now use Page Integrity Manager to improve visibility into security threats and to prevent the loss of critical data.  
Our Bot Manager solution also continued to perform very well in Q1. Bot Manager is designed to mitigate a wide variety of automated attacks, including account stuffing attacks where credentials stolen from one website are checked for validity at thousands of other websites. When valid credentials are found, a manual attack is then often used to extract value from the compromised accounts. Losses from account takeovers and new account fraud are estimated at over $10 billion annually in the U.S. In order to forge such manual attacks, we launched the beta for our new account protector solution in Q1. Account protector shields organizations from account takeover and other kinds of fraudulent human activity without increasing friction for legitimate customers. Account protector works by detecting in real-time whether a user logging into an application is the legitimate account owner or an impostor in possession of stolen credentials.  
One of our beta customers for this new solution is a well-known restaurant franchise. It was under attacked by cyber criminals who were compromising the loyalty accounts of their diners. The criminals were stealing loyalty reward points and then reselling them on the dark web. The digital theft outraged the diners whose points were stolen and angered restaurant owners who unknowingly provided meals to fraudsters. With help from Akamai, the franchise can now identify the situations where humans are impersonating valid diners and take action to stop the illicit transfer of loyalty points, thereby stopping the fraud and enabling the franchise to focus on accelerating sales.  
We're also excited about the success of Akamai's fastest-growing security segment, Access Control, which reached an annualized revenue run rate of $100 million in Q1, up more than 170% over Q1 of 2020 and up over 60% organically. Our Access Control segment provides secure connectivity for users, applications, workloads and IoT systems, regardless of their location. Products in this area include Enterprise Application Access, Enterprise Threat Protector and our new secure mobile and secure IoT solutions that we acquired from Asavie in October. Our secure mobile and secure IoT products provide security, visibility and control for mobile devices at the edge. These services deter malicious activity and support acceptable use policies without needing to install a client on the device. The solutions are sold to our carrier partners such as AT&T, where it forms the basis for their AccessMyLAN solution. These capabilities have been especially important in helping school districts secure student devices during the pandemic, so that students can learn from home safely.  
Our security solutions also continued to gain recognition from the leading analyst firms in Q1. Our market-leading web application firewall capabilities earned Gartner Peer Insights Customers' Choice distinction. And Forrester named Akamai as a leader in DDoS protection for the third time, saying large enterprise clients that want an experienced trusted vendor to make their DDoS problem go away should look to Akamai.  
Turning to our CDN portfolio. Q1 marked another quarter of very strong traffic growth for Akamai, led by OTT video services and downloads of e-gaming software. On March 16, traffic on the Akamai platform reached an all-time high of 200 terabits per second. This is 19% higher than the peak in Q1 of last year and 2.5x the traffic peak in Q1 of 2019. Daily peaks were also high in Q1, averaging 143 terabits per second. In fact, traffic on our platform exceeded 110 terabits per second, pretty much around the clock in Q1. Overall, our CDN products and services generated revenue of $532 million in Q1, up 2% year-over-year and flat in constant currency.  
The Edge Application segment generated $45 million in revenue last quarter, up more than 30% over Q1 of 2020. As you may recall from the discussion at our Investor Summit in February, this revenue amount includes edge computing solutions, such as EdgeWorkers, that we build discreetly, but does not include the wide array of services that use our computing capabilities at the edge. As we discussed during our recent Investor Summit, we believe that there is the potential for substantial future growth in the area of edge computing, as we anticipate more enterprises moving their compute workloads to our edge platform for offload, improved performance, security and global scale. 
A timely example of such a shift is manifested in our new Vaccine Edge solution, which is enabling over 2 dozen public health agencies and pharmacy chains around the world to deliver and secure COVID vaccine registration sites in the face of extraordinary flash crowds. In multiple instances, Akamai was called in to rescue government agencies whose websites had crashed under load, resulting in frustrated citizens who waited for long times before getting kicked out without a reservation. In some cases, these websites have been using solutions provided by competitors that were not able to handle the load.  
We're pleased to partner on Vaccine Edge with salesforce.com, and we're proud that our EdgeWorkers solution has made a real difference to the many millions of citizens trying to get the vaccine as quickly as possible.  
Our customers are now using EdgeWorkers for a wide range of applications. For example, a leading theme park operator is using EdgeWorkers to help manage demand as they plan to reopen parks. A publicly traded sports and entertainment company has implemented geofencing using our EdgeKV data store, together with EdgeWorkers, to ensure that users access only relevant broadcast content for their location. A nationwide home improvement retailer and a global credit card company are using A/B testing logic at the edge to deliver fast and personalized user experiences. We're enabling DevOps workflows for our global sportswear brand by managing canary releases, where only a targeted group of users can see a new experience. And we're enabling a leading global manufacturer of devices to authenticate their users at the edge, which improves performance and reduces their cloud costs.  
We're also proud of the progress that we're making with our sustainability efforts. In the past year, we doubled our platform capacity with no increase at all in our platform's carbon footprint. And just 2 weeks ago, on Earth Day, we announced that by 2030, Akamai intends to power 100% of our global operations with renewable energy, improve the energy efficiency of our platform by an additional 50%, mitigate 100% of our platform emissions and continue to recycle 100% of our electronic waste. These goals reflect Akamai's commitment to be a responsible, efficient and forward-looking company.  
In summary, we're very excited about the innovative technology that we're developing, the strong demand from customers for our security and edge computing solutions and our Q1 financial performance on both the top and bottom lines. The growth strategy and goals that we outlined to you in our Investor Summit on February 25, set our direction for the future, and we believe that our strong Q1 results show that we've been executing according to plan.  
Now I'll turn the call over to Ed to provide further details on our Q1 results and the outlook for next quarter and 2021. Ed?"

Before I provide additional details on our Q1 performance, I'd like to remind everyone that as a result of the reorganization we announced last quarter, we've refocused the company from a vertical-aligned divisional structure to a product-",1293,"Thank you, Tom. Before I provide additional details on our Q1 performance, I'd like to remind everyone that as a result of the reorganization we announced last quarter, we've refocused the company from a vertical-aligned divisional structure to a product-oriented lens. I will therefore be focusing my discussion today on our Security Technology Group and our Edge Technology Group. The Security Group, as you might imagine, encompasses all of our security solution. The Edge Group includes our media delivery and web performance CDN business, along with our edge compute solutions. We plan to provide additional revenue detail for the different product lines within our Security Technology Group and Edge Technology Group on an annual basis. 
However, we might highlight specific subgroup details from time to time on our quarterly earnings calls if we feel it will help provide greater context on our results. Finally, as I mentioned on our last call, we will continue to report both Web Division and Media and Carrier division results, along with our Internet platform customer results on our website for the balance of 2021 to assist with this reporting transition.  
So with all that said, as Tom outlined, Akamai delivered another excellent quarter in Q1. We were very pleased to exceed the high end of our guidance range on both revenue and earnings. Q1 revenue was $843 million, up 10% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency, driven by continued strength across most major product areas in our security business, better-than-expected traffic from OTT video and gaming customers and very strong performance in our edge applications business.  
Revenue from our Security Technology Group was $310 million, up 29% year-over-year or 27% in constant currency, driven by broad-based strength across most of our security products. Revenue from our Edge Technology Group was $532 million, up 2% year-over-year or flat in constant currency. We benefited from strong traffic growth driven by OTT video and gaming as well as strong growth in our edge applications business, as Tom mentioned earlier. As expected, foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $3 million on a sequential basis and positive $16 million on a year-over-year basis.  
International revenue was $380 million, up 13% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency. Sales in our international markets represented 45% of total revenue in Q1, up 1 point from Q1 2020 and consistent with Q4 levels. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $463 million, up 8% year-over-year.  
Moving now to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, in line with our expectations. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 64%. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $267 million, in line with our expectations.  
Now moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $375 million, up $49 million or 15% from the same period in 2020. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 45%, up 2 points from Q1 2020. Non-GAAP operating income was $264 million, up $34 million or 15% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 31%, up 1 point from Q1 last year and above our guidance range due to leverage from our revenue outperformance.  
Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $150 million, consistent with our guidance range. We continue to expect Q1 CapEx to represent the high watermark for quarterly CapEx spending in 2021. GAAP net income for the first quarter was $156 million or $0.94 of earnings per diluted share. Our Q1 GAAP results include a $7 million restructuring charge related to the company realignment we announced last quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP net income was $228 million or $1.38 of earnings per diluted share, up 15% year-over-year, up 11% in constant currency and $0.07 above the high end of our guidance range due to our revenue outperformance. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $38 million, based on a Q1 effective tax rate of approximately 14%.  
Now I will discuss some balance sheet items. As of March 31, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.5 billion. After accounting for the $2.3 billion of combined principal amounts of our 2 convertible notes, net cash was approximately $154 million as of March 31.  
Now I will review our use of capital. During the first quarter, we spent $58 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 600,000 shares. We ended Q1 with approximately $514 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Our plan remains to leverage our share buyback program to offset dilution resulting from equity compensation over time. As a result, based on current market conditions, we expect to spend at least $350 million for the full year 2021.
 
Moving on to Q2 guidance. We are projecting Q2 revenue in the range of $839 million to $853 million or up 6% to 7% as reported or 3% to 5% in constant currency over Q2 2020. There are 2 factors to consider as you think about year-over-year comparisons for Q2. First, in 2020, we saw a significant uptick in traffic on our network starting at the end of March and continuing through the remainder of the year as a result of global lockdowns. As our excellent Q1 results demonstrate, traffic has continued to grow on our network this year, but we don't expect to see the same traffic growth rates from a year ago going forward. This creates more challenging year-over-year comparisons for our edge delivery business starting in Q2 and continuing for the remainder of 2021. 
Second, the Q2 year-over-year growth comparison also reflects the continuing ban of some Chinese-based apps in India. As a reminder, these apps, which were banned in Q3 of last year, contributed revenue of approximately $15 million in Q2 2020. 
Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $3 million impact on Q2 revenue compared to Q1 levels and a positive $18 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $261 million to $266 million. We anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins of approximately 45%. 
Moving now to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $116 million to $117 million. Factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31% for Q2. 
Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $133 million to $138 million, excluding equity compensation in the second quarter. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.35 to $1.40. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $37 million to $39 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately $0.14 -- excuse me, 14%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares. 
Looking ahead to the full year, we are raising our guidance for both revenue and EPS. We now expect revenue of $3.4 billion to $3.435 billion, which is up 6% to 7% year-over-year as reported or up 5% to 6% in constant currency. We now expect security growth to be in the low 20s for the full year 2021. We are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30% to 31% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.45 to $5.52. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 14% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares. 
Moving on to CapEx. Full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 16% of revenue, unchanged from our prior outlook. 
We are very pleased to have delivered such strong results in Q1 and to be able to increase our outlook for the full year. Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

And the pricing for typical companies in the security area remains very high. And I think, in many cases, unrealistic. So I think overall, the dynamics there are pretty comparable to where they were last year. As you know, Akamai is always looking for opportunities. We're also very disciplined in terms of actually -- what we end up buying. 
In terms of CDN market share, the very large media companies do compare the CDN vendors in terms of their traffic share. And if a vendor is doing better than others, they tend to get more share. And that's why Akamai has such a large share when it comes to delivery of media traffic. And if a vendor has outages or is performing poorly, which we see a fair amount out there among our competition, they can lose share. And so that's a very typical dynamic. Nothing new there. It's been that way for several years. And that's why Akamai put such an effort to have the world's best performance. And it's why we have so much of the traffic."

So we don't break out specific growth rates, but I can say that gaming, in particular, was one of the stronger verticals in terms of growth, very pleased with what we saw. The other thing is, I'd say, the names of the number of customers that we saw growing. It wasn't just your normal handful of gaming customers. So we saw some benefit from the continuation of the gaming console releases we saw in Q4. But we also saw a lot of publishers have some pretty significant releases during the quarter. So in general, it was a really good gaming quarter. We're off to a pretty good start here in Q2. And as you know, this -- the gaming release can be a bit seasonal, but so far, it's been a pretty good start to the year. And like I said, I'm pretty happy with the performance across many different customers. 
In terms of guidance, yes, we just start off having a great year. Traffic has been very strong. You saw the security performance. It's a little bit -- we got a lot of exposure on the FX side. So having one quarter down and having the first month of the second quarter down gives you a little bit more confidence going into the year. So we felt that we had enough visibility at this point to raise guidance. As you know, the second half of the year is always little bit more challenging, where Q3, you tend to see summer seasonality. We didn't see that last year because of the pandemic. We'll probably see a little bit of that on the media side. And then Q4, obviously, tends to be our strongest seasonal quarter where you have strong e-commerce and strong media. So we're feeling pretty confident at this point, so we thought it was appropriate to take the guidance up a touch."

You think you've seen it all. And then next week, you read the next headline. The -- and the attackers are very powerful. You have nation states, large-scale organized crime, just -- and what they're doing is, well, pretty scary. Now the great news for Akamai and our customers is that we have solutions that can protect enterprises for a large majority of those attacks. 
A great example is the recent exchange server hack, where many thousands of enterprises got hacked, lost their e-mails, which is really bad. Akamai, our IT department was running an exchange server, just like all those other companies. And the difference is, we didn't get hacked because we use our own enterprise security solutions. And we had enterprise application access sitting in front of our exchange server. And that meant that the vulnerability couldn't be exploited, because the employee doesn't just get to go contact the exchange server. If they did, then somebody can come in. And before you're authenticated by the exchange server, you can exploit the vulnerability. 
Instead, they got to get to -- they come to Akamai's Enterprise Application Access product, we authenticate them, and if it's a bad guy outside trying to do something, no way they get in. And not only that, they don't get directly to the exchange server, because they have to pass through our security. So if they're trying to do bad things, we'll stop it. And it's all about our approach to Zero Trust. And yes, we can protect enterprises from these sorts of things. 
And even in zero-day attacks, we didn't know about the exchange hack before other enterprises or Microsoft did, and yet we were protected at zero day because of our solutions. So I think as the attacks increase, that does increase awareness, and that does help drive our security business. And I see no end to the attacks coming. There's more on the way. And we're in a great position to be able to help the leading enterprises stay safe against those attacks."

If you remember, go back in a year or so, a little over a year ago, we were kind of flattish and we started to turn things around there. A lot of it has to do with the strength that we're seeing in media, a lot of the companies are in the U.S. In terms of international, still having very strong growth internationally. We do come up against some tougher compares. There's pretty strong media business outside the U.S. So you'll see some tougher compares on the media delivery side.

In terms of FX, so the FX rates, what we do is at the beginning of the quarter, we sort of take a look at where the FX rates are, assume that's going to stay for the balance of the year. In terms of how it was relative to the beginning of the last quarter, we gave guidance, some currencies are up, some are down, but it's roughly somewhat in line. I talk about in the prepared remarks that FX sort of came in as expected. We got a little bit of a headwind here quarter-over-quarter, mostly weakness in the yen. But I would say just keep an eye on it though. You just -- if you kind of just step back and do the math, we get a little over $1 billion worth of non-U.S.-denominated revenue. So to the extent that you get a 1% swing, that can swing you $10 million on an annual basis. The major currencies for us are euro, yen, pound, and then it kind of drops off from there. And other currencies aren't as impactful, but those are the 3 to keep an eye on. 
And then working capital, I'd say, like any other year, you'll see nothing unusual in terms of working capital. This year, in Q1, you see us from a cash flow perspective, we pay out our bonuses early in Q1. You see cash flow, the working capital pick up a touch. To call out in terms of collections, they've actually been fantastic. Nothing on the payable side. It's unusual. And as we talked about, CapEx is already hit its high point.

And I don't see anything that is unusual. And also, if there was anything in our top -- in our earnings -- Analyst Day, we called out our top 8 customers, anyone who's over 1% as a metric. And if there's anything in that group of customers worth calling out, I'd certainly do that and there's really nothing at this point to call out.

We're doing a nice job of dealing with certain pricing pressure in those verticals with opening up other shares of the wallet, whether it's additional security products or really starting to see a lot of interest in our edge computing and edge applications business as well. So we'll see dollars potentially shift delivery into to that category as we go through pricing negotiations, but that's pretty normal.

We're just finding a nice niche there. And that continues to grow. It's up about $1 million quarter-over-quarter. Very impressive growth rate. 
I'd say stability is probably a good way to think about that going through the year. There's always upside with these accounts. Teams identifying new areas of opportunity all the time.

Cyberattacks generated headlines throughout the first half of the year, and our strong growth reflects the criticality of security to organizations in every sector and geography of the world.

It's also designed to prevent user data from being intentionally or inadvertently sent to third parties such as advertisers or social networks, which can result in a violation of privacy laws and steep fines. 
As an example, one of our customers is a leading furniture retailer. Page Integrity Manager detected that one of their partners, a major social media platform, was taking their shoppers' e-mail addresses in violation of their data privacy rules. Page Integrity Manager blocks such transfers of personal data and immediately notifies our customers so that appropriate business actions can be taken. 
In June, we entered beta with a related solution that we call Audience Hijacking Protection. Audience Hijacking Protection is designed to detect and block malicious or unwanted activity from client side plug-ins, browser extensions and malware. For example, it can quickly identify vulnerable resources, detect suspicious behavior and block unwanted ads, pop-ups, affiliate fraud and other malicious activities that attempt to hijack a retailer's audience. Initial customer interest in this new capability is very strong. 
Akamai Bot Manager also continued to perform very well in Q2, with revenue growing 40% year-over-year. Bot Manager now has nearly 800 customers with an annualized revenue run rate of nearly $200 million. Our customers use Bot Manager to fort a variety of unwanted activities and attacks such as price scraping, inventory manipulation, credential stuffing and account takeover. 
Recently, we enhanced our ability to defend against account takeover attempts with the beta launch of Akamai Account Protector.  It's designed to proactively identify and block human fraudulent activity using advanced machine learning, behavioral analytics and reputation heuristics. Account Protector intelligently evaluates every login request to determine if it's coming from a legitimate user or an impersonator. 
Q2 bookings were also strong for our Prolexic service, which helps organizations defend against the surge of ransom DDOS attacks that began in Q3 of last year. As an example, a leading financial analytics company recently adopted Prolexic to protect them from this growing threat. Prior to that, the company faced operational and technical challenges from needing to manage multiple security technologies from various niche vendors and cloud service providers. Since consolidating with Akamai, they have greatly benefited from reduced complexity, improved security and greater consistency for compliance and risk management across their many business units. 
As you all likely know, there have been widespread ransomware, data theft and other malware attacks against major enterprises this year. Included were well-publicized attacks on critical infrastructure at a major pipeline company, the world's largest meat packer and a freight operator that serves as the lifeline for 2 popular island destinations in New England. 
The need to stop these kinds of attacks is driving organizations to adopt new Zero Trust and Secure Access Service Edge, or SASE Solutions, such as those offered by Akamai. For example, when the exchange server attack hit thousands of organizations in March, Akamai's e-mail wasn't compromised because our IT department uses Akamai's Enterprise Application Access solution, which prevented unauthorized access to our exchange server. 
Our Access Control suite of products continue to be Akamai's fastest-growing Security segment in Q2 and with revenue up 161% year-over-year, including the acquisition of Asavie, and up 57% on an organic basis. 
As one example of a new customer, we closed a large security contract in Q2 with a company that helps maritime operators manage risk. This company has thousands of employees and hundreds of offices throughout the world. They adopted our Enterprise Application Access and Kona Site Defender solutions to secure the access to their applications and to protect their internal systems from malware and other threats. 
I'll now turn to our CDN portfolio, which generated revenue of $528 million in Q2, down 1% year-over-year and 4% in constant currency. This result was in line with our expectations and reflects the challenging comparison against last year's pandemic-related jump in traffic and the loss of revenue from Chinese applications that were banned from India in July of 2020. 
Traffic on our platform remained strong in Q2, with peaks exceeding 130 terabits per second every day throughout the quarter. This enormous amount of traffic provides strong evidence of how much customers were live on our platform's unparalleled scale and reach, which is enabled by more than 4,200 points of presence at the edge, in 135 countries around the world. 
Our tremendous global presence is especially important to the world's major broadcasters, who continue to look to Akamai to deliver the world's most significant events. For example, during the recent European football tournament, the peak traffic that we delivered globally for more than 30 broadcasters was 35 terabits per second, nearly 5x the peak observed in 2016. 
Our fast-growing Edge Applications segment delivered $47 million in Q2, up 35% year-over-year and up 32% in constant currency. This rapid growth rate reflects the shift of compute workloads from core data centers, on-prem or in the cloud to our edge platform for offload, improved performance, security and global scale. 
For example, each time a user accesses one of our retailer customer sites, the retailer's geo location code is executed on an Akamai edge server to identify the user's location and then deliver content tailored for that location. Overall, we're now supporting an average of 5 billion such edge computing instantiations per day on our platform. 
In summary, I'm pleased to report that we've executed according to the plan we outlined for investors during our February Analyst Day. In particular, we continued to achieve strong demand from customers for our security and edge computing solutions, diversification of our business across products, geographies and sales channels, and strong financial performance on both the top and bottom lines. 
Before turning the call over to Ed, I'd like to formally welcome Sharon Bowen to our Board of Directors. Sharon's had extensive experience in financial and securities transactions for large global companies and we're very much looking forward to benefiting from her engagement and counsel. In addition, as many of you know, our Board is now chaired by Dan Hesse, who succeeded Fred Salerno in June. Dan has held senior management positions in the telco industry for many years, including as CEO of Sprint. He's also recognized as a leader in ESG and is providing valuable advice and oversight to our senior management team. 
Of course, we all deeply appreciate Fred's many years of outstanding leadership and service to Akamai, and we wish him the very best in his future endeavors. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ed to provide further details on our Q2 results and our outlook for next quarter and the full year. Ed?"

As Tom outlined, Akamai delivered another excellent quarter. Q2 revenue was $853 million, at the high end of our guidance range and up 7% year-over-year or 5% in constant currency. Revenue growth was led by broad-based strength across our Security business globally. Revenue from our Security Technology Group was $325 million, up 25% year-over-year or 22% in constant currency. Security now accounts for 38% of our total revenue. 
We saw strong performance across our major security products, including BOT Manager, Prolexic and our Access Control product suite. Revenue from our Edge Technology Group was $528 million, down 1% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency. These results were in line with our internal expectations, which factored in challenging comparisons from our outstanding CDN results in Q2 a year ago. 
The tough year-over-year compares within our Edge delivery business offset the continued strong growth in our edge applications business. 
Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $2 million on a sequential basis and a positive $19 million on a year-over-year basis, largely in line with our expectations. International revenue was $403 million, up 15% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. Sales in our international markets represented 47% of total revenue in Q2, up 3 points from Q2 2020 and up 2 points from Q1 levels. 
As a reminder, our Q2 results last year included approximately $15 million of revenue from China-based apps that were banned in India from Q3 2020 onwards. Adjusting for this impact, international growth would have been approximately 20% year-over-year and 14% in constant currency. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $450 million, up 1% year-over-year. 
Moving now to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, in line with our expectations. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 62%. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $259 million, slightly below our guidance range due to lower-than-expected hiring during the quarter. 
Now moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $386 million. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 45%, in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income was $270 million, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, slightly favorable to our guidance due to lower operating expenses I just mentioned. 
Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $138 million, consistent with our guidance range. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $156 million or $0.94 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $233 million or $1.42 of earnings per diluted share, up 3% year-over-year, down 1% in constant currency and $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. 
Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $39 million, based on a Q2 effective tax rate of approximately 14.5%. 
Now I will discuss some balance sheet items. As of June 30, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.6 billion. After accounting for the $2.3 billion of combined principal amounts of our 2 convertible notes, net cash was approximately $281 million as of June 30. 
Now I will review our use of capital. During the second quarter, we spent approximately $96 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 900,000 shares. We ended Q2 with approximately $417 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Our plan remains to leverage our share buyback program to offset dilution resulting from equity compensation over time. 
Moving on to Q3 guidance. We are projecting Q3 revenue in the range of $845 million to $860 million or up 7% to 9% as reported or 6% to 8% in constant currency over Q3 2020. Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $3 million impact on Q3 revenue compared to Q2 levels and a positive $5 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $257 million to $262 million, and we anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins of approximately 45%. 
Moving now to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $120 million to $121 million. Factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31% for Q3. 
Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $135 million to $140 million excluding equity compensation in the third quarter. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.37 to $1.41. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $38 million to $39 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 14.5%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares. 
Looking ahead to the full year, we are raising our guidance for both revenue and EPS. We now expect revenue of $3.42 billion to $3.45 billion, which is up 7% to 8% year-over-year as reported, or up 6% to 7% in constant currency. We now expect Security revenue growth to be in the low to mid-20% range for the full year 2021. We are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31% and and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.54 to $5.65. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 14.5% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares. Finally, full year CapEx is anticipated to be approximately 16% of revenue, consistent with our prior guidance. 
We are very pleased with our excellent financial results in the first half, and we look forward to delivering a strong second half. Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

Not expecting a ton from the Olympics this year, it's a couple of million bucks that we have in the quarter. 
We did see in terms of seasonality in Q2, we did see a bit of a lighter gaming quarter in Q. We would expect to see that probably pick up a bit here in the back half of the year. And then obviously, in Q4, that's our most challenging quarter to call, which you've got really 2 seasons there. You've got the commerce season and then the -- we typically see a large media season as well. So we're expecting that in Q4. And we'll update you as we go and we'll get more information as the year goes on. And for the next call, we'll update you on what we're seeing for the Q4 seasonality. 
The margin question, yes, we had a better quarter from an operating margin perspective. Hiring was a little bit lighter than normal. Just a couple of things to keep in mind on the margin front. July is when we have our annual merit increase or our salary increases, so that comes into effect beginning in Q3. Then also, we do expect that we'll see some travel expenses and some costs related to offices reopening in the back half of the year as well. 
Tom and I have talked about, we plan on operating the business in the 30% range. This year, we'll do a little bit better, but we do want to continue to invest for the opportunities we see in front of of us in Security."

For our new solutions, you might see a start-up out there with something similar. Our normal competition doesn't have these capabilities. And it's a big advantage to be able to offer these capabilities with the existing platform because once you're on Akamai, for example, you're using our Web App Firewall, which is a market-leading solution, it's very easy to add Page Integrity Manager on top. We just take care of that. The customer says they want it and we turn it on. And the request -- the data flow is not changed. 
The same will be true with Audience Hijacking Protection, same thing, built right on top of the web app firewall, and our other solutions. So it really is very convenient for customers to buy from us. And there really isn't something that's comparable in the marketplace. And these are adding great value. 
In terms of the buyer, Audience Hijacking Protection, that could really go the range. Probably it ends up more towards the marketing side of the house because literally, their audience is being hijack today. Any retailer has a problem where -- because of malware that's on the user's browser or plug-ins or extensions they have, that malware and those plug-ins are looking for somebody about to do a transaction. 
And what they'll do is put some pop-up over at saying, wait a minute, go here instead. Or even worse, it will be some fraud where they'll change the refer header and claim credit for this buyer and our customer now has to pay more. So for products like that, it could be anywhere from the security side all the way through the website and through the marketing side of the house because it provides so much value, it reduces cost, increases revenue and provides greater security. Really, it's very nice to see that because it's a very good blend between our delivery and performance solutions and our security solutions all wrapped up in one package."

And in terms of the health of the customers, it really varies by vertical. We do see, I would say, pretty standard pricing discussions. This industry traditionally has had deflationary pricing when it comes to -- especially volumes, it's very -- it's being driven by volume. And I don't see any major change there. Really nothing to call out. 
I think it's still too early to call an end to the pandemic, obviously. So we've got some significant business with commerce and retailers, and that's still kind of playing itself out at this point.

Gaming is another example of the big -- our big gaming customers had interest there. They want to get local decisions made in terms of who's playing who, what master server maybe they go back to for the gaming instructions. 
Another great example is the COVID vaccine registration sites. In this case, was a third-party company unrelated to us, built a queuing application on top of our EdgeWorkers solution that is used today by, I think, dozens now governments and pharmaceutical companies to assist in getting vaccine registrations. And of course, in the early days in the U.S. and still in many countries, there's a lot more people that want to get a vaccine than you have capacity for and so you want to be fair. So if somebody comes into the website, they get into the queue, and they know how long the queue is and that whole process is managed. And again, that's an ideal application to run with our edge computing service. 
And also handles all the excess load and the flash crowd around the site when you announced, okay, we got a lot of vaccines available in a certain period of time. A lot of people come at once. So maybe they know when that's going to happen. And so we provide the the overflow capacity for that. 
But really, anything you could imagine that involves locality, the need to rapidly scale would be a suitable use for our EdgeWorkers solutions. IoT applications, I think, in the future, is a big driver of demand there. And I think that gets enabled by 5G as that gets deployed, and you get a lot more devices connected. 
But there, you've got a lot of devices with a lot of communication back and forth, very chatty protocols, data being sent in and you need to aggregate that and make decisions quickly locally on the fly, edge computing, edge applications is a good example for that. Tailoring the content based on the device type and the local connectivity is another example. We do that with our image and video manager applications, where if you're on a, say, a cellular device, you don't have a big screen and maybe you don't have great connectivity, we will automatically, at the edge with the edge computing, put in a a smaller -- a lower resolution version of the image. And on your device, it will look the same. So there's no real reduction in quality, but the less traffic needed to convey the image means you get better performance for the end user. So there's just all sorts of applications that people are using. And now we're doing those kinds of things 5 billion times a day on our edge platform using Edge Java."

I would say we're really focused though on stopping malware, stopping these ransom DDoS, ransomware attacks, stopping data exfiltration. And that puts us in the direction of a focus on access to make sure that we do the access control of the application layer, not as it's traditionally done at the network layer, and that makes a huge difference in terms of the malware getting inside in the first place. 
Also, we have Secure Web Gateway capabilities, probably market-leading DNS capabilities, which makes a big difference in terms of data exfiltration. And we do have some DLP capabilities today with our newest version of Enterprise Threat Protector. CASB, less capabilities there today, potentially of interest, but not the primary mission in terms of stopping the data exfiltration, the ransomware attacks, the malware attacks on enterprises. 
And of course, ransom DDoS, which our Prolexic solution helps a lot with -- along with Kona. So good traction there. As you see the growth on the access side of the house now, well over 50% organically. And of course, if you account the Asavie acquisition, over 160% year-over-year. We plan to continue investing there organically, also through potentially M&A, we're always looking there. And I think that has a lot of future potential for us."

So not any financial impact per se. That said, we care a lot about reliability at Akamai. It is core to everything we want to do. And we've put a ton of effort into making our solutions be reliable over the last 10-plus years. 
In fact, you have to go back to 2004 to find anything comparable in terms of what's happened on our platform. In 2004, we actually took the entire platform down for about an hour, which was disastrous. That didn't happen in this case, but we did hurt hundreds of our customers, and we deeply regret that. We impacted them and their users, and that's unacceptable. 
In both cases, there was an update that caused a problem. And we have invested a lot in infrastructure to make sure that updates are done safely. In this case, the updates were totally different and totally different systems at Akamai. But as a result of this, we are taking a fresh look at how we release updates to make sure that something like this won't happen again. And meanwhile, we've locked down all update channels as we do a thorough investigation of each one. 
People don't often realize it, but we are constantly doing updates. We have a platform with dozens of services. We have many, many thousands of customers. Any given customers maybe wanted to make an update to their site on an hourly basis or more. And so it's just thousands and thousands a day of updates that are taking place in the platform. And because of the really very intense work that we've done over the last decade, we have had an excellent track record of keeping any problem with an update from spreading. 
Humans making updates will make mistakes. And our goal is to prevent -- to catch them early and prevent them from spreading. And in this case, there were 2 different channels where that didn't happen the way we want it to. And so we are putting in a lot of effort to look at every possible channel and make sure it is working the way we want to. And not only do we not want to have any more incidents this year, we don't want to be having this happen in the next 10 years. And so there's a lot of effort going into making sure that's the case."

And when I say edge, I really mean edge, and that's a big difference with the competition, none of whom really have an edge platform. Of course, for the last couple of years, everybody says they have edge everything. It's just -- it's not true. We're in over 4,000 locations, in about 1,000 cities and 135 countries, and nobody is anywhere, anywhere close to that. 
And we offer native Javascript support now, which a lot of the folks that talk about edge computing don't. And we spin up our apps in a few milliseconds, and that's a factor of 1,000 better than some of the folks that talk a lot about edge computing out there. So I think we stack up very well against the competition there. 
And I think you see that reflected in our very strong growth. That segment now well over 30% growth year-over-year. We think we can maintain that. And on a reasonable size number, last year, $150 million, we're now almost up to a $200 million annual revenue run rate for our edge applications business. So I think very strong future potential. And as you grow in your 30% a year on a number that's about $200 million now, after a few years, that starts really being meaningful. And I think that drives accelerated growth for the CDN business. And remind me again of the security question you had."

And if you go back 5 or 6 years, pretty much everybody bought a device and managed it in their data set. And today, there's still a few enterprises that do that. But pretty much all the major B2C companies on large -- majority of them are now using Akamai for that as a cloud service. And we're the market leader by far in application firewall. 
You look at DDoS. And again, go back 5-plus years, that was managed either in the data center or with a single carrier. And that just doesn't work anymore. You can't handle the volume. And so now Akamai is the market leader by far with a cloud service there. 
I think you will see the same thing happen with enterprise security. Today, it is done, you get your VPN and you get your boxes and you manage them in your data center. That is not a good way to do it. That's why you have all these breaches. When you're providing network layer access, it's a disaster. You look at the big pipeline company that had a problem. It's just one of many thousands of enterprises. 
Credentials to the BPM are stolen, put on the dark web, somebody gets them. And that just gives them access to the entire network. And you can't do it that way. And that's why our solutions are so important with application layer access. Now sure you can steal somebody's credentials, but of course, you want multifactor authentication. And then you only get access to the app. And if you're using Akamai, you don't even get access to the app directly. You got to come through us, and we'll make sure there's no malware going to that app or you're not exploiting vulnerabilities, and then you don't have those kind of situations. 
So I think if you look at the exchange server situation, which I talked about a few minutes ago. Again, by having Akamai in front with our Enterprise Application Access, our e-mail wasn't stolen, even though we had the vulnerable software like everybody else did. So it will take some time. We're at the beginnings of, I'd say, Zero Trust approach and moving to the cloud, in particular to the edge -- My Edge platform for enterprise security, but I do think there's a tremendous future there because we're in a position to really stop those breaches."

And that makes it harder to do acquisitions that make sense because we're not going to do something that's crazy. 
Now when you're looking at acquisition, we look at it over the long term. And so that we want it to be accretive, certainly over the long term. In addition to the purchase price, we also worry about the hit margins, especially when you do an acquisition, often as you know, the first year, you have revenue recognition issues where you don't get to recognize all the revenue right away. And so in the first year, you can take a hit to your margins. 
And if we find the right acquisition that is really helpful to us in growth over the long term and it will be accretive to margins over the long term, there may be a situation where we would take a short-term hit to margins, and then we would improve them from there."

Again, I told you not a ton there, a few million bucks for the Olympics. 
But security growth is also not necessarily impacted by traffic. So we could see if we do see lockdowns, you could see traffic accelerate a bit.

Bot Manager detects whether it's a human being that's trying to, for example, to log into an account. And as you probably know, there's a ton of account stuffing going on. We see every day now about 1 billion illegitimate attempts to log into an account of some kind, a bank account, gaming account, a commerce account. And the vast, vast majority of that is bot traffic. Credentials have been stolen somewhere and a bot network is used to check out those credentials against a lot of websites to see if you get a hit. 
Now the adversaries have evolved, the attackers have evolved. And now I will use humans to attempt to log in and steal accounts. Now you can't do that at the same scale as you can with a bot army. But you use things that you think may well get in and now the human will do it. And so we need to decide, well, okay, it's human, but is it the right human? 
And that's what Account Protector is all about. And it will use information about the human that's been using that account before with a variety of inputs and trust scores and then using machine learning to the side on the fly based on everything we can see here, is this the right human for this account? And we give a score that is used to decide, are we going to provide access directly? Do you go to some other security mechanism like you get asked questions or a capture test of some kind? Or do you just block? 
And that's what Account Protector does. So it is one-step deeper analysis that will now deal with human-based fraud and then specifically around the log-in function.

I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent financial results in the second quarter, coming in at or above the high end of our guidance range for both revenue and EPS. Q2 revenue was $853 mi",1370,"Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. 
I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent financial results in the second quarter, coming in at or above the high end of our guidance range for both revenue and EPS. Q2 revenue was $853 million, up 7% year-over-year and up 5% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 32%, which reflects our continued focus on operational efficiency, even as we've continued to invest for future growth. 
Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $1.42 per diluted share, up 3% year-over-year. Akamai Security Solutions continued to perform especially well in Q2, generating revenue of $325 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 22% in constant currency. 
Cyberattacks generated headlines throughout the first half of the year, and our strong growth reflects the criticality of security to organizations in every sector and geography of the world. Akamai is increasingly recognized as a security leader that offers not just innovative and market-leading solutions, but also insights into an enormous amount of Internet data and threat intelligence, a massive distributed platform at the edge of the Internet where most attacks originate. And the technical expertise of one of the industry's largest and most experienced teams of security professionals. 
The strong growth of our security portfolio was driven by several product lines, including our market-leading solutions for web app firewall, bot management, DDOS prevention and Access Control. 
Our recently released Akamai Page Integrity Manager continued to have rapid adoption in Q2. Page Integrity Manager helps businesses protect their users from having credit card data or other personal information stolen by malware embedded in third-party content. It's also designed to prevent user data from being intentionally or inadvertently sent to third parties such as advertisers or social networks, which can result in a violation of privacy laws and steep fines. 
As an example, one of our customers is a leading furniture retailer. Page Integrity Manager detected that one of their partners, a major social media platform, was taking their shoppers' e-mail addresses in violation of their data privacy rules. Page Integrity Manager blocks such transfers of personal data and immediately notifies our customers so that appropriate business actions can be taken. 
In June, we entered beta with a related solution that we call Audience Hijacking Protection. Audience Hijacking Protection is designed to detect and block malicious or unwanted activity from client side plug-ins, browser extensions and malware. For example, it can quickly identify vulnerable resources, detect suspicious behavior and block unwanted ads, pop-ups, affiliate fraud and other malicious activities that attempt to hijack a retailer's audience. Initial customer interest in this new capability is very strong. 
Akamai Bot Manager also continued to perform very well in Q2, with revenue growing 40% year-over-year. Bot Manager now has nearly 800 customers with an annualized revenue run rate of nearly $200 million. Our customers use Bot Manager to thwart a variety of unwanted activities and attacks such as price scraping, inventory manipulation, credential stuffing and account takeover. 
Recently, we enhanced our ability to defend against account takeover attempts with the beta launch of Akamai Account Protector. It's designed to proactively identify and block human fraudulent activity using advanced machine learning, behavioral analytics and reputation heuristics. Account Protector intelligently evaluates every login request to determine if it's coming from a legitimate user or an impersonator. 
Q2 bookings were also strong for our Prolexic service, which helps organizations defend against the surge of ransom DDOS attacks that began in Q3 of last year. As an example, a leading financial analytics company recently adopted Prolexic to protect them from this growing threat. Prior to that, the company faced operational and technical challenges from needing to manage multiple security technologies from various niche vendors and cloud service providers. Since consolidating with Akamai, they have greatly benefited from reduced complexity, improved security and greater consistency for compliance and risk management across their many business units. 
As you all likely know, there have been widespread ransomware, data theft and other malware attacks against major enterprises this year. Included were well-publicized attacks on critical infrastructure at a major pipeline company, the world's largest meat packer and a freight operator that serves as the lifeline for 2 popular island destinations in New England. 
The need to stop these kinds of attacks is driving organizations to adopt new Zero Trust and Secure Access Service Edge, or SASE Solutions, such as those offered by Akamai. For example, when the exchange server attack hit thousands of organizations in March, Akamai's e-mail wasn't compromised because our IT department uses Akamai's Enterprise Application Access solution, which prevented unauthorized access to our exchange server. 
Our Access Control suite of products continue to be Akamai's fastest-growing Security segment in Q2 and with revenue up 161% year-over-year, including the acquisition of Asavie, and up 57% on an organic basis. 
As one example of a new customer, we closed a large security contract in Q2 with a company that helps maritime operators manage risk. This company has thousands of employees and hundreds of offices throughout the world. They adopted our Enterprise Application Access and Kona Site Defender solutions to secure the access to their applications and to protect their internal systems from malware and other threats. 
I'll now turn to our CDN portfolio, which generated revenue of $528 million in Q2, down 1% year-over-year and 4% in constant currency. This result was in line with our expectations and reflects the challenging comparison against last year's pandemic-related jump in traffic and the loss of revenue from Chinese applications that were banned from India in July of 2020. 
Traffic on our platform remained strong in Q2, with peaks exceeding 130 terabits per second every day throughout the quarter. This enormous amount of traffic provides strong evidence of how much customers were live on our platform's unparalleled scale and reach, which is enabled by more than 4,200 points of presence at the edge, in 135 countries around the world. 
Our tremendous global presence is especially important to the world's major broadcasters, who continue to look to Akamai to deliver the world's most significant events. For example, during the recent European football tournament, the peak traffic that we delivered globally for more than 30 broadcasters was 35 terabits per second, nearly 5x the peak observed in 2016. 
Our fast-growing Edge Applications segment delivered $47 million in Q2, up 35% year-over-year and up 32% in constant currency. This rapid growth rate reflects the shift of compute workloads from core data centers, on-prem or in the cloud to our edge platform for offload, improved performance, security and global scale. 
For example, each time a user accesses one of our retailer customer sites, the retailer's geo location code is executed on an Akamai Edge server to identify the user's location and then deliver content tailored for that location. Overall, we're now supporting an average of 5 billion such edge computing instantiations per day on our platform. 
In summary, I'm pleased to report that we've executed according to the plan we outlined for investors during our February Analyst Day. In particular, we continued to achieve strong demand from customers for our security and edge computing solutions, diversification of our business across products, geographies and sales channels, and strong financial performance on both the top and bottom lines. 
Before turning the call over to Ed, I'd like to formally welcome Sharon Bowen to our Board of Directors. Sharon's had extensive experience in financial and securities transactions for large global companies and we're very much looking forward to benefiting from her engagement and counsel. In addition, as many of you know, our Board is now chaired by Dan Hesse, who succeeded Fred Salerno in June. Dan has held senior management positions in the telco industry for many years, including as CEO of Sprint. He's also recognized as a leader in ESG and is providing valuable advice and oversight to our senior management team. 
Of course, we all deeply appreciate Fred's many years of outstanding leadership and service to Akamai, and we wish him the very best in his future endeavors. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ed to provide further details on our Q2 results and our outlook for next quarter and the full year. Ed?"

As Tom outlined, Akamai delivered another excellent quarter. Q2 revenue was $853 million, at the high end of our guidance range and up 7% year-over-year or 5% in constant currency. Revenue growth was led by broad-based strength across our Security business globally. Revenue from our Security Technology Group was $325 million, up 25% year-over-year or 22% in constant currency. Security now accounts for 38% of our total revenue. 
We saw strong performance across our major security products, including Bot Manager, Prolexic and our Access Control product suite. Revenue from our Edge Technology Group was $528 million, down 1% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency. These results were in line with our internal expectations, which factored in challenging comparisons from our outstanding CDN results in Q2 a year ago. 
The tough year-over-year compares within our Edge delivery business offset the continued strong growth in our edge applications business. 
Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $2 million on a sequential basis and a positive $19 million on a year-over-year basis, largely in line with our expectations. International revenue was $403 million, up 15% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. Sales in our international markets represented 47% of total revenue in Q2, up 3 points from Q2 2020 and up 2 points from Q1 levels. 
As a reminder, our Q2 results last year included approximately $15 million of revenue from China-based apps that were banned in India from Q3 2020 onwards. Adjusting for this impact, international growth would have been approximately 20% year-over-year and 14% in constant currency. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $450 million, up 1% year-over-year. 
Moving now to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, in line with our expectations. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 62%. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $259 million, slightly below our guidance range due to lower-than-expected hiring during the quarter. 
Now moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $386 million. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 45%, in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income was $270 million, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, slightly favorable to our guidance due to lower operating expenses I just mentioned. 
Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $138 million, consistent with our guidance range. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $156 million or $0.94 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $233 million or $1.42 of earnings per diluted share, up 3% year-over-year, down 1% in constant currency and $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. 
Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $39 million, based on a Q2 effective tax rate of approximately 14.5%. 
Now I will discuss some balance sheet items. As of June 30, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.6 billion. After accounting for the $2.3 billion of combined principal amounts of our 2 convertible notes, net cash was approximately $281 million as of June 30. 
Now I will review our use of capital. During the second quarter, we spent approximately $96 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 900,000 shares. We ended Q2 with approximately $417 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Our plan remains to leverage our share buyback program to offset dilution resulting from equity compensation over time. 
Moving on to Q3 guidance. We are projecting Q3 revenue in the range of $845 million to $860 million or up 7% to 9% as reported or 6% to 8% in constant currency over Q3 2020. Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $3 million impact on Q3 revenue compared to Q2 levels and a positive $5 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $257 million to $262 million, and we anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins of approximately 45%. 
Moving now to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $120 million to $121 million. Factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31% for Q3. 
Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $135 million to $140 million excluding equity compensation in the third quarter. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.37 to $1.41. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $38 million to $39 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 14.5%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares. 
Looking ahead to the full year, we are raising our guidance for both revenue and EPS. We now expect revenue of $3.42 billion to $3.45 billion, which is up 7% to 8% year-over-year as reported, or up 6% to 7% in constant currency. We now expect Security revenue growth to be in the low to mid-20% range for the full year 2021. We are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.54 to $5.65. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 14.5% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares. Finally, full year CapEx is anticipated to be approximately 16% of revenue, consistent with our prior guidance. 
We are very pleased with our excellent financial results in the first half, and we look forward to delivering a strong second half. Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

Not expecting a ton from the Olympics this year, it's a couple of million bucks that we have in the quarter. 
We did see in terms of seasonality in Q2, we did see a bit of a lighter gaming quarter in Q2. We would expect to see that probably pick up a bit here in the back half of the year. And then obviously, in Q4, that's our most challenging quarter to call, with you've got really 2 seasons there. You've got the commerce season and then the -- we typically see a large media season as well. So we're expecting that in Q4. And we'll update you as we go and we'll get more information as the year goes on. And for the next call, we'll update you on what we're seeing for the Q4 seasonality. 
The margin question, yes, we had a better quarter from an operating margin perspective. Hiring was a little bit lighter than normal. Just a couple of things to keep in mind on the margin front. July is when we have our annual merit increase or our salary increases, so that comes into effect beginning in Q3. Then also, we do expect that we'll see some travel expenses and some costs related to offices reopening in the back half of the year as well.

For our new solutions, you might see a start-up out there with something similar. Our normal competition doesn't have these capabilities. And it's a big advantage to be able to offer these capabilities with the existing platform because once you're on Akamai, for example, you're using our Web App Firewall, which is a market-leading solution, it's very easy to add Page Integrity Manager on top. We just take care of that. The customer says they want it and we turn it on. And the request -- the data flow is not changed. 
The same will be true with Audience Hijacking Protection, same thing, built right on top of the Web App Firewall, and our other solutions. So it really is very convenient for customers to buy from us. And there really isn't something that's comparable in the marketplace. And these are adding great value. 
In terms of the buyer, Audience Hijacking Protection, that could really go the range. Probably it ends up more towards the marketing side of the house because literally, their audience is being hijacked today. Any retailer has a problem where -- because of malware that's on the user's browser or plug-ins or extensions they have, that malware and those plug-ins are looking for somebody about to do a transaction. 
And what they'll do is put some pop-up over it saying, ""Wait a minute, go here instead."" Or even worse, it will be some fraud where they'll change the refer header and claim credit for this buyer and our customer now has to pay more. So for products like that, it could be anywhere from the security side all the way through the website and through the marketing side of the house because it provides so much value. It reduces cost, increases revenue and provides greater security. Really, it's very nice to see that because it's a very good blend between our delivery and performance solutions and our security solutions all wrapped up in one package."

But just keep in mind that our customer base has grown over the last year, it's up probably by 5% or 6% over the last year. So we're doing a pretty good job of getting penetration into the base. But the base is also growing. 
If I go back a year ago, Q2 of 2020, that number for folks that have acquired a security product was around 59%. So we're seeing really healthy growth in terms of the overall number of customers both from penetration of the base, but also just the size of the customer base is growing as well."

Gaming is another example of the big -- our big gaming customers had interest there. They want to get local decisions made in terms of who's playing who, what master server maybe they go back to for the gaming instructions. 
Another great example is the COVID vaccine registration sites. In this case, was a third-party company unrelated to us, built a queuing application on top of our EdgeWorkers solution that is used today by, I think, dozens now, governments and pharmaceutical companies to assist in getting the vaccine registrations. And of course, in the early days in the U.S. and still in many countries, there's a lot more people that want to get a vaccine than you have capacity for and so you want to be fair. So if somebody comes into the website, they get into the queue, and they know how long the queue is and that whole process is managed. And again, that's an ideal application to run with our edge computing service. 
And also handles all the excess load and the flash crowd around the site when you announce, ""Okay, we got a lot of vaccines available in a certain period of time."" A lot of people come at once where maybe they know when that's going to happen. And so we provide the overflow capacity for that. 
But really, anything you could imagine that involves locality, the need to rapidly scale would be a suitable use for our EdgeWorkers solutions. IoT applications, I think, in the future, is a big driver of demand there. And I think that gets enabled by 5G as that gets deployed, and you get a lot more devices connected. 
But there, you've got a lot of devices with a lot of communication back and forth, very chatty protocols, data being sent in and you need to aggregate that and make decisions quickly locally on the fly, edge computing, edge applications is a good example for that. Tailoring the content based on the device type and the local connectivity is another example. We do that with our image and video manager applications, where if you're on a, say, a cellular device, you don't have a big screen and maybe you don't have great connectivity, we will automatically, at the edge with the edge computing, put in a smaller -- a lower resolution version of the image. And on your device, it will look the same. So there's no real reduction in quality, but the less traffic needed to convey the image means you get better performance for the end user. So there's just all sorts of applications that people are using. And now we're doing those kinds of things 5 billion times a day on our edge platform using Edge Java."

Also, we have Secure Web Gateway capabilities, probably market-leading DNS capabilities, which makes a big difference in terms of data exfiltration. And we do have some DLP capabilities today with our newest version of Enterprise Threat Protector. CASB, less capabilities there today, potentially of interest, but not the primary mission in terms of stopping the data exfiltration, the ransomware attacks, the malware attacks on enterprises. 
And of course, ransom DDoS, which our Prolexic solution helps a lot with -- along with Kona. So good traction there. As you see the growth on the access side of the house now, well over 50% organically. And of course, if you account the Asavie acquisition, over 160% year-over-year.

So not any financial impact per se. That said, we care a lot about reliability at Akamai. It is core to everything we want to do. And we've put a ton of effort into making our solutions be reliable over the last 10-plus years. 
In fact, you have to go back to 2004 to find anything comparable in terms of what's happened on our platform. In 2004, we actually took the entire platform down for about an hour, which was disastrous. That didn't happen in this case, but we did hurt hundreds of our customers, and we deeply regret that. We impacted them and their users, and that's unacceptable. 
In both cases, there was an update that caused a problem. And we have invested a lot in infrastructure to make sure that updates are done safely. In this case, the updates were totally different and totally different systems at Akamai. But as a result of this, we are taking a fresh look at how we release updates to make sure that something like this won't happen again. And meanwhile, we've locked down all update channels as we do a thorough investigation of each one. 
People don't often realize it, but we are constantly doing updates. We have a platform with dozens of services. We have many, many thousands of customers. Any given customers maybe wanted to make an update to their site on an hourly basis or more. And so it's just thousands and thousands a day of updates that are taking place in the platform. And because of the really very intense work that we've done over the last decade, we have had an excellent track record of keeping any problem with an update from spreading. 
Humans making updates will make mistakes. And our goal is to prevent -- to catch them early and prevent them from spreading. And in this case, there were 2 different channels where that didn't happen the way we want it to. And so we are putting in a lot of effort to look at every possible channel and make sure it is working the way we want to. And not only do we not want to have any more incidents this year, we don't want to be having this happen in the next 10 years. And so there's a lot of effort going into making sure that's the case."

And when I say edge, I really mean edge, and that's a big difference with the competition, none of whom really have an edge platform. Of course, for the last couple of years, everybody says they have edge everything. It's just -- it's not true. We're in over 4,000 locations, in about 1,000 cities and 135 countries, and nobody is anywhere, anywhere close to that. 
And we offer native Javascript support now, which a lot of the folks that talk about edge computing don't. And we spin up our apps in a few milliseconds, and that's a factor of 1,000 better than some of the folks that talk a lot about edge computing out there. So I think we stack up very well against the competition there. 
And I think you see that reflected in our very strong growth. That segment now, well over 30% growth year-over-year. We think we can maintain that. And on a reasonable sized number, last year, $150 million, we're now almost up to a $200 million annual revenue run rate for our edge applications business. So I think very strong future potential. And as you grow in your 30% a year on a number that's about $200 million now, after a few years, that starts really being meaningful. And I think that drives accelerated growth for the CDN business.

And if you go back 5 or 6 years, pretty much everybody bought a device and managed it in their data set. And today, there's still a few enterprises that do that. But pretty much all the major B2C companies on large -- majority of them are now using Akamai for that as a cloud service. And we're the market leader by far in application firewall. 
You look at DDoS. And again, go back 5-plus years, that was managed either in the data center or with a single carrier. And that just doesn't work anymore. You can't handle the volume. And so now Akamai is the market leader by far with a cloud service there. 
I think you will see the same thing happen with enterprise security. Today, it is done, you get your VPN and you get your boxes and you manage them in your data center. That is not a good way to do it. That's why you have all these breaches. When you're providing network layer access, it's a disaster. You look at the big pipeline company that had a problem. It's just one of many thousands of enterprises. 
Credentials to the VPN are stolen, put on the dark web, somebody gets them. And that just gives them access to the entire network. And you can't do it that way. And that's why our solutions are so important with application layer access. Now sure you can steal somebody's credentials, but of course, you want multifactor authentication. And then you only get access to the app. And if you're using Akamai, you don't even get access to the app directly. You got to come through us, and we'll make sure there's no malware going to that app or you're not exploiting vulnerabilities, and then you don't have those kind of situations. 
So I think if you look at the Exchange Server situation, which I talked about a few minutes ago. Again, by having Akamai in front with our Enterprise Application Access, our e-mail wasn't stolen, even though we had the vulnerable software like everybody else did. So it will take some time. We're at the beginnings of, I'd say, Zero Trust approach and moving to the cloud, in particular to the edge -- Akamai Edge platform for enterprise security, but I do think there's a tremendous future there because we're in a position to really stop those breaches."

And that makes it harder to do acquisitions that make sense because we're not going to do something that's crazy. 
Now when you're looking at an acquisition, we look at it over the long term. And so that we want it to be accretive, certainly over the long term. In addition to the purchase price, we also worry about the hit margins, especially when you do an acquisition, often as you know, the first year, you have revenue recognition issues where you don't get to recognize all the revenue right away. And so in the first year, you can take a hit to your margins. 
And if we find the right acquisition that is really helpful to us in growth over the long term and it will be accretive to margins over the long term, there may be a situation where we would take a short-term hit to margins, and then we would improve them from there."

So what we've assumed here is that there really isn't going to be a major step-up in demand like we saw last year. So not anticipating major lockdowns or anything like that. So then, obviously, if something like that were to happen, it could increase our traffic in the quarter. We do see typical seasonality in the summer months, typically August, typically Europe, in particular, tends to be lighter than expected. So we're anticipating that. It's offset a little bit by the Olympics. Again, I told you not a ton there, a few million bucks for the Olympics. 
But security growth is also not necessarily impacted by traffic. So we could see -- if we do see lockdowns, you could see traffic accelerate a bit. And we're not really anticipating that, it's not in our guide at this point. We are expecting to see a strong seasonal Q4. And like I said a couple of times now, we'll update when we talk to you again, when we get more visibility. 
But traffic has got back to what I would call more normal growth rates. Obviously, we went through a 1.5 years of accelerated traffic growth with the launch of some major OTT platforms, along with the pandemic. So we're modeling in what I would consider to be sort of a more normal CDN outlook."

Bot Manager detects whether it's a human being that's trying to, for example, to log into an account. And as you probably know, there's a ton of account stuffing going on. We see every day now about 1 billion illegitimate attempts to log into an account of some kind, a bank account, gaming account, a commerce account. And the vast, vast majority of that is bot traffic. Credentials have been stolen somewhere and a bot network is used to check out those credentials against a lot of websites to see if you get a hit. 
Now the adversaries have evolved, the attackers have evolved. And now I will use humans to attempt to log in and steal accounts. Now you can't do that at the same scale as you can with a bot army. But you use things that you think may well get in and now the human will do it. And so we need to decide, well, okay, it's human, but is it the right human? 
And that's what Account Protector is all about. And it will use information about the human that's been using that account before with a variety of inputs and trust scores and then using machine learning to decide on the fly based on everything we can see here, is this the right human for this account? And we give a score that is used to decide, are we going to provide access directly? Do you go to some other security mechanism like you get asked questions or a capture test of some kind? Or do you just block? 
And that's what Account Protector does. So it is one-step deeper analysis that will now deal with human-based fraud and in specifically around the log-in function. Now of course, Bot Manager covers a lot of other things, too, like price scraping, inventory stealing, inventory -- reserving all the seats in a hotel or an airline by a competitor, that kind of thing. So this is really focused on fraud and log-in that's being done by humans."

I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent financial results in the third quarter, coming in at or above the high end of our guidance ranges for revenue, operating margin and earnings per sha",1371,"Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent financial results in the third quarter, coming in at or above the high end of our guidance ranges for revenue, operating margin and earnings per share. Q3 revenue was $860 million, up 9% year-over-year and up 8% in constant currency.
Non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 32%, which reflects our continued focus on operational efficiency, even as we've continued to invest for future growth. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $1.45 per diluted share, up 11% year-over-year.
Akamai's strong performance in Q3 was largely driven by our security business, which is now one of the leading cloud security businesses in the world. With an annualized revenue run rate of more than $1.3 billion, up 26% year-over-year and up 25% in constant currency. Over the last several years, we've grown our security portfolio from point solutions into a comprehensive platform that provides defense in depth to address our customers' biggest threats. The unique breadth of our defenses is important to our customers who want more security capabilities from fewer vendors.
Our security solutions are highly differentiated and recognized as best-in-class by our customers. who see us as a leading provider of services that protect their most critical assets, including enterprise websites, applications, data and access. We routinely earn top rankings in multiple categories from major industry analysts.
For example, Akamai disrupted the web app security market when we launched Kona Site Defender in 2012. Since then, we've continued to extend our leadership position in the web app firewall sector with Gartner recently naming Akamai as a market leader for the fifth year in a row. Akamai has been the market leader in DDoS protection since we acquired Prolexic in 2014.
Forrester recently said, ""large enterprise clients that want an experienced trusted vendor to make their DDoS problem go away, should look to Akamai."" As new threat vectors have emerged, we've extended our platform to defend against them. For example, we created the first comprehensive bot management solution to protect our customers from sophisticated bot operators who try to steal content, disrupt operations or penetrate user accounts. According to Forrester, Akamai is best for companies wanting to fort bots at the edge.
Bloomberg Business Week, even quoted a hacker, calling Akamai Bot Defense, ""the hardest to crack."" More recently, we released Akamai Page Integrity Manager to identify malicious code in third-party scripts and websites that's designed to steal end user data. Page Integrity Manager helps to address a major threat that's been costing businesses, hundreds of millions of dollars and fines as well as serious reputation damage.
We plan to extend our web app protections further in the coming months with the release of account protector and audience highjacking prevention. Account Protector is designed to reduce fraud by making sure that the entity logging into an account is the true owner of that account. Audience hijacking prevention can help businesses protect sales by fording malware that diverts a customer just before the completion of a transaction.
Since founding Akamai over 20 years ago, our vision has always been to help our customers solve their toughest Internet challenges. And today, that includes stopping ransomware. Ransomware is a huge problem for enterprises around the world with a new attack striking every 11 seconds. The damage resulting from ransomware is expected to amount to over $20 billion this year alone. Guardicore is critical to stopping the spread of ransomware, and that's a key reason why we acquired the company.
Akamai is already selling solutions, such as Enterprise Application Access, that help prevent attackers from gaining access to enterprise infrastructure and applications. But to be secure in today's world, you also need a second layer of defense to block the spread of malware that has gained a foothold in the enterprise. And that's where Guardicore comes in.
Guardicore helps detect when a breach has occurred by identifying anomalous data flows within enterprise networks. Guardicore also helps prevent the malware from spreading through a capability known as micro-segmentation. Guardicore's micro-segmentation solution limits access within the enterprise to only those applications that are authorized to communicate with one another.
Denying communication as the default greatly limits the spread of malware and protects the flow of enterprise data across the network. And that's the key to stopping ransomware. We believe Guardicore's best-in-class micro-segmentation solution is the perfect addition to our Zero Trust portfolio, enabling Akamai to offer customers a comprehensive solution to stop the damage being caused by ransomware and malware.
During the call we held on September 29, we spoke about the parallels between our acquisition of Guardicore with our acquisition of Prolexic in 2014. Just as the acquisition of Prolexic propelled us to a leadership position in helping to stop DDoS attacks -- We believe that the acquisition of Guardicore will establish Akamai as a leader in helping to stop the damage caused by ransomware as well as other forms of malware.
Customers see Akamai as a strategic partner in security, not only because of the strength and breadth of our solutions, but also because of the depth of our security expertise and threat intelligence and the scale of our platform. The same platform that underpins our world-leading CDN.
Akamai CDN handles over 5 trillion requests every day. In addition, we resolved more than 3 trillion DNS queries each day. This gives us unmatched real-time insight into the world's Internet traffic, which we analyze to provide best-in-class threat intelligence, protection and support. We also have 1 of the industry's largest and most experienced teams of security professionals with thousands of engineers and consultants working on security for our customers.
Our security solutions are tightly integrated into the world's largest and most distributed edge platform, and that provides unmatched global scale to defend customers against not only the largest DDoS attacks, but also against the vast spot armies that are waging attacks from the edge. The integration of our security solutions with our CDM solutions also provides benefits to our customers in terms of improved performance and ease of use.
With Akamai, security and performance go hand in hand. You can buy them together as a single protect and perform package, which makes purchasing and integration easy for the customer. And when you buy security from Akamai, your performance has automatically improved. That's because we apply the security layer as we are delivering the content from the world's True Edge platform. This means that the processing needed for security stays close to the end user, which makes for much better performance.
Akamai's unique combination of security and delivery provides a powerful offering in the market. which is one reason by we're the market leaders in both security and CDN. Our CDN business also generates substantial cash that we can use to invest in future growth, as we've recently done with the Guardicore acquisition. For example, our CDN business generated revenue of $526 million in Q3 and contributed substantially to our overall free cash flow of $273 million, enough to cover almost half of what we spent to acquire Guardicore.
We believe that having the world's largest and most distributed edge network also provides a great foundation for the growth of our Edge applications business. As 5G rolls out as IoT applications proliferate and as more data is created and processed at the edge, Akamai's edge compute platform is very well suited to support the high throughput and low latency applications that are not well served by traditional cloud providers today.
From delivery and performance to compute and security, the world's leading brands want our help. That's because the Internet is getting more complicated, with more traffic, higher user expectations and more cyber threats every day. And the world's leading enterprises know that Akamai can help keep their digital experiences close to their end users and the threats farther away. They know that what we do makes life better for billions of people, billions of times a day and that nobody powers and protects life online like Akamai.

Q3 revenue was $860 million, up 9% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency. Revenue was again driven by very strong results in our Security business. Revenue from our Security Technology Group was $335 million, up 26% year-over-year or 25% in constant currency. Security now accounts for 39% of our total revenue.
Revenue from our Edge technology group was $526 million, flat year-over-year and down 1% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $5 million on a sequential basis and positive $4 million on a year-over-year basis. International revenue was $412 million, up 16% year-over-year or 15% in constant currency. Sales in our international markets represented 48% of total revenue in Q3 and up 3 points from Q3 2020 and up 1 point from Q2 levels. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $449 million, up 3% year-over-year.
Moving now to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, in line with our expectations. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 63%. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $261 million.
Now moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $396 million. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46%. Non-GAAP operating income was $277 million, and non-GAAP operating margin was 32%. Capital expenditures in Q3, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $129 million. This was below our guidance range, primarily due to continued progress on network CapEx efficiency projects.
GAAP net income for the third quarter was $179 million or $1.08 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $239 million or $1.45 of earnings per diluted share, up 11% year-over-year, up 10% in constant currency and $0.04 above the high end of our guidance range. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $39 million, based on a Q3 effective tax rate of approximately 14%.
Moving now to cash and our use of capital. As of September 30, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.8 billion. After accounting for the $2.3 billion of combined principal amounts of our 2 convertible notes, net cash was approximately $452 million as of September 30.
During the third quarter, we spent approximately $97 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 800,000 shares. We ended Q3 with approximately $321 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization, which runs through the end of this year. As noted in today's press release, our Board authorized a new buyback program of up to $1.8 billion, beginning January 1, 2022, and running through the end of 2024.
As we previously discussed, our primary intention is to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time. However, our repurchase authorizations also allow us to opportunistically deploy capital if or when we believe there is a valuation disconnect in the market based on business or market conditions. Combining the 2 authorizations, we currently have more than $2 billion available for share repurchases through the end of 2024.
We believe our strong balance sheet and significant free cash flow generation, which totaled $273 million or 32% of total revenue in Q3, also provides us with significant financial flexibility to pursue a balanced capital deployment strategy. As such, we plan to continue to invest organically in R&D and product development, expand our capabilities through M&A, as you saw with our most recent acquisition of Guardicore and return capital to shareholders via share repurchases.
Moving on to Q4 guidance. There are 2 factors to consider as you update your models for the fourth quarter. First, we closed the acquisition of Guardicore on October 20. Our guidance assumes Guardicore will contribute approximately $6 million to $7 million of revenue in Q4. It also assumes that Guardicore will be approximately $0.05 dilutive to our total non-GAAP earnings per share in Q4.
Second, as in prior years, seasonality plays a large role in determining our fourth quarter financial performance. We typically see higher than normal traffic for our large media customers and from seasonal online retail activity for our e-commerce customers, which are both difficult to predict. With that in mind, we are projecting Q4 revenue in the range of $88 million to $908 million or up 4% to 7%, as reported, or 5% to 8% in constant currency over Q4 2020.
Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $3 million impact on Q4 revenue compared to Q3 levels and a negative $6 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $290 million to $201 million.
We anticipate Q4 EBITDA margins of approximately 43% to 44%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $120 million to $121 million. Factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30% for Q4.
Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $128 million to $133 million, excluding equity compensation in the fourth quarter. This represents less than 15% of anticipated total revenue. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.37 to $1.44. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $38 million to $39 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 14.5%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares.
Looking ahead to the full year, we are raising our guidance. We now expect revenue of 3.439 million to $3.44 billion, which is up 8% year-over-year as reported or up 7% in constant currency. We now expect security revenue growth to be in the mid-20% range for the full year 2021. We are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.63 to $5.69. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 14.5% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares.
Finally, full year CapEx is anticipated to be approximately 16% of revenue, consistent with our prior guidance. We are very pleased to deliver another quarter of excellent financial results, and we look forward to closing out a strong 2021.

As we talked about, Page Integrity Manager released in the last year, a very exciting technology. Going forward, we have account protector. There's a lot of customer interest there. And then early next year, audience hijacking protection. I think that's -- a lot of customers have asked for that, and that stops malware or plug-ins from stealing or hijacking their audience right before the point of sale or the transaction is executed. Obviously, in the access segment, I think that's a huge area of future growth. Really excited about the Guardicore acquisition. That combines very nicely with our Zero Trust solutions. It combines with Enterprise Application Access to give you the full combination of North, Southeast, West, I think will be compelling in the market. So we're continuing to invest across the board.

So it doesn't have a huge impact in terms of what we're seeing as far as an improvement. But it's good to see that, that's starting to pick up a little bit.
Commerce, I would say, is pretty mixed. We're seeing good strength in security, still seeing some pressure, especially in the U.S. commerce vertical, that's a much bigger vertical that's around 15% of total revenue. So we're not quite out of the woods yet with commerce, again, especially in the U.S., that's the area that we're probably seeing the most weakness and that's still persisting from the pandemic."

I thought it had more to do historically with sort of platform customers in the U.S. underperforming. But now the platform customers are actually doing really well and growing pretty well. So I kind of lost the thread on why the U.S. is still underperforming international regions.
And then a second question on sort of the operating margin side of the equation. Any kind of guidelines you could give us and how we should think about calendar year '22? Are there kind of -- a lot of companies are talking to us about reiteration, if you will, maybe more spending on travel and people come back to the office and marketing events ramping back up.
On the flip side of the equation, you've been kind of underspending on CapEx versus the original target and then that's coming down as a percentage of revenue. So perhaps there's some gross margin benefit that you could see in calendar '22 could offset that. So any kind of sense you could give us on how to start thinking about calendar year '22 margins?"

I mean next year, we'll be expecting that we should start traveling again. So there'll be a little bit more OpEx there. You're right to call out CapEx as -- I think the team's doing a fantastic job on a lot of CapEx efficiency projects that we've got going with both software and hardware, being able to drive that down. We would expect that CapEx to be back to those normal levels that we've seen, maybe even a touch lower. So that impacts your depreciation, but it takes a while for that to flow through the model. So you won't get a ton of benefit of that right away, but certainly, down the road, you will.
I'd given some prior guidance when we had the Guardicore call about operating in the 29% to 30% range for next year, and then hopefully getting back or we will get back to over 30% in '23. Obviously, we'll update you. I had mentioned earlier to Sterling that Guardicore's contribution will probably be a bit better than what we said earlier on. I don't have a number to call out yet, so that will obviously help out the operating margins a touch there. And then you asked about U.S. and international and the disparity between the 2. I'd sort of flip it around and say that it's not so much the U.S. being weak, but really just strong international growth. I mean, U.S. is kind of low single digit.
I mentioned on the previous question, that's where we're having the most trouble with our U.S. commerce vertical, which is a pretty significant vertical in the U.S. And then we also have a lot of large media customers that are in the U.S., and that's where you tend to see more of the splitting of traffic and pricing pressure. So those things combined sort of put a little bit of pressure in terms of the growth rate in the U.S., but really, the strength outside the U.S. is something that I think is a significant advantage for us.
We made a lot of investments both in the network and the sales teams, et cetera, and we've been able to drive pretty significant growth. Very happy with what I'm seeing in terms of participation as far as strong growth in countries like Korea, Spain, Brazil, Mexico, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, I mean, across the board, we're seeing very strong growth. Latin America, in particular, has been very strong. We made an acquisition there a couple of years ago, starting to get some good scale out of that. So a little bit of a mixed picture in the U.S. with some challenges in commerce. But really, I look at it as just very strong international presence and growth."

Of course, the attackers are always in abating with new forms of attack. But I am very excited about the Guardicore acquisition. And I think it really does fill out and complete our access story, our ability to stop ransomware and malware. As I mentioned, we already have capabilities that prevent the malware from getting in. enterprise application access in particular, governs what employees can touch and access. And even then it has to come through Akamai's application firewall. So we're making sure that malware doesn't come in. We also have multifactor authentication, which make sure that the employee is who they say they are.
And now with Guardicore, we stop the spread of the malware, if it does get in. And there are a lot of ways into the enterprise today. It is really -- despite all the defenses you try to put in place, somebody, for example, in the capital pipeline case, a password or potential gets out there.
Now we still have ways of catching that somebody is using a stolen credential. But malware does get in still. And so the real key there is stopping the spread, and that's what Guardicore does. And so now I think it's really nice because you stopped the ransomware with Guardicore, but we've got the whole package and whole solution now.

I think it's obviously a tougher quarter to call here with some supply chain disruptions and things like that. Does that drive more or less Internet traffic and what does that holiday season look like.
Typically, a very strong media quarter where you see new devices and games coming online -- sorry, devices, consoles, et cetera, coming online. And then you also have a lot of sporting events in Q4, back-to-school, you've got lots of game releases. So it can be a pretty robust season for us, obviously challenging to call. I kind of looked at the events calendar, it's pretty full. So we provided we can see some good traffic. You can see good upside we delivered that in the last couple of years. In terms of security, it's not as seasonal. Certainly, there are some bundles we have where there is traffic can impact that a bit. But I think to take our security guidance, we've been pretty conservative in the way that we've approached security, and we've been over delivering every quarter. I think -- we've had, obviously, Guardicore is off to a good start. So I wouldn't imply that as a seasonal downtick or anything like that in our security growth."

But also, I mentioned there's a number of CapEx efficiencies that Adam and his team are working on, not only just software but network design, deployment optimization, looking at different hardware improvements and just any way to drive a big focus on lowering our need for CapEx.
And also keep in mind, we have great relationships with the networks and ISPs. So in terms of doing optimizations inside of their networks, we're able to do that as well. So I'd say it's really a great execution on the team's part and CapEx has come down pretty significantly. You see that in our free cash flow results."

First, I wanted to go a little bit deeper on the supply chain issues. I appreciate you've obviously overinvested capacity with the OTT launches and the pandemic last year. You seem pretty well insulated from the rising cost. But at what point that this continues dragging out? Does it begin to become a worry and you might have to overspend in order to keep capacity and not have to turn away business?
And maybe related to that, as we think about the environment heading into Q4, how do we expect that to shake out, especially given Q4 is such a traditionally such a strong commerce season? A lot of companies are telling us, they're not going to be able to meet demand, especially when it comes to electronic goods. So is that a worry that you have? And maybe how are you thinking about embedding that in your guidance?"

I just mentioned on the last question that it's hard to predict what the commerce season looks like. And obviously, when you're in the business of delivering Internet traffic, one model could suggest that while shells are not stock, people are doing more surfing to find things. Another model would suggest that there's not as much shopping and people are giving cash and gift cards. So hard to tell, but we did put out a pretty big range there.
Also keep in mind that a lot of our commerce customers, about half of our commerce customers have taken, we call our 0 overage. So you've kind of flattened out that bursting. So the burst thing for commerce is not as big of an impact, Q4 still has an impact. In terms of the device cycle, that's an interesting one. We do expect and we've seen over the last several years, especially in the last couple of weeks of of the year as new devices come online, there's a lot of firmware updates and things like that. I still expect to see that.
But there's other things that are not as dependent on that, for example, gaming releases, new video content that comes out if you don't have a new machine, you're watching it on your old machines. So I still think that we'll have a pretty big immediate quarter for sure. But that's why I've given a pretty wide range to try to take those things into consideration.
And then on your supply chain question, you had asked about when does this become a problem. It's funny, I asked the same questions to my team as we go through our CapEx build-out. We've done a nice job of building out several quarters' worth of inventory here. And we've diversified our supply chain, and the team has done a good job of ensuring that we're not seeing any significant increase in pricing or anything like that. A little bit on the freight side, but it's not really material, and I think that should start to work itself out. But if we do see another massive growth in traffic, maybe we start to run into some problems. But so far, so good. And like I said, the team did a really good job preparing not expecting this type of a disruption in the supply chain, but expecting that the result from the pandemic would last a lot longer. So we did some scenario planning. So we're in pretty good shape at the moment."

We still feel pretty comfortable with our 20% growth rate, as we talked about, as a matter of fact, coming out of this year, we're doing a bit better than that. So I think if you're taking the super low end of the range, maybe you could come up with that formula, but we're expecting pretty solid growth here with security in Q4."

Let me just add, our strategy in security is to combine organic development with intelligent and timely acquisitions, and we'll continue to do that. And of course, when you buy a company after a year, its growth becomes organic. And it's no longer counted as an acquisition growth per se. And I think we've had a really great track record of doing that in security. Going back all the way to the Prolexic acquisition in 2014.
And as I mentioned, I think Guardicore fundamentally like that in terms of really transforming our enterprise security business just like Prolexic transformed our DDoS business, which, of course, today is very, very successful. We're the market leader by far. And our goal is to do that on the enterprise security side for things like stopping ransomware and stopping malware.
And as Ed said, as we continue to want to grow our security business over the longer term at 20-plus percent, that will include acquisitions. And I think acquisitions are a good thing. It gives you a jump start on technology in an important area. Guardicore has been working for a long time to develop their micro segmentation approach. I believe it is a market being in what they do, they're the best folks out there.
And now we have the benefit of all of the users of effort that they put into that at a perfect time because a lot of companies are rightly worried about stopping ransomware, and now Akamai is in a position to help them do that. And of course, it fits with a lot of our organic development on technology around EA is an ideal combination. So we'll continue to do both and working hard to continue our security growth at 20-plus percent."

I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent financial results in the third quarter, coming in at or above the high end of our guidance ranges for revenue, operating margin and earnings per sha",1370,"Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent financial results in the third quarter, coming in at or above the high end of our guidance ranges for revenue, operating margin and earnings per share. Q3 revenue was $860 million, up 9% year-over-year and up 8% in constant currency.
Non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 32%, which reflects our continued focus on operational efficiency, even as we've continued to invest for future growth. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $1.45 per diluted share, up 11% year-over-year.
Akamai's strong performance in Q3 was largely driven by our security business, which is now one of the leading cloud security businesses in the world, with an annualized revenue run rate of more than $1.3 billion, up 26% year-over-year and up 25% in constant currency. Over the last several years, we've grown our security portfolio from point solutions into a comprehensive platform that provides defense in depth to address our customers' biggest threats. The unique breadth of our defenses is important to our customers who want more security capabilities from fewer vendors.
Our security solutions are highly differentiated and recognized as best-in-class by our customers, who see us as a leading provider of services that protect their most critical assets, including enterprise websites, applications, data and access. We routinely earn top rankings in multiple categories from major industry analysts.
For example, Akamai disrupted the web app security market when we launched Kona Site Defender in 2012. Since then, we've continued to extend our leadership position in the web app firewall sector, with Gartner recently naming Akamai as a market leader for the fifth year in a row. Akamai has been the market leader in DDoS protection since we acquired Prolexic in 2014.
Forrester recently said, ""Large enterprise clients that want an experienced, trusted vendor to make their DDoS problem go away should look to Akamai."" As new threat vectors have emerged, we've extended our platform to defend against them. For example, we created the first comprehensive bot management solution to protect our customers from sophisticated bot operators who try to steal content, disrupt operations or penetrate user accounts. According to Forrester, Akamai is best for companies wanting to thwart bots at the edge.
Bloomberg Business Week, even quoted a hacker, calling Akamai's bot defense, ""the hardest to crack."" More recently, we released Akamai Page Integrity Manager to identify malicious code in third-party scripts and websites that's designed to steal end user data. Page Integrity Manager helps to address a major threat that's been costing businesses hundreds of millions of dollars in fines as well as serious reputation damage.
We plan to extend our web app protections further in the coming months with the release of account protector and audience highjacking prevention. Account Protector is designed to reduce fraud by making sure that the entity logging into an account is the true owner of that account. Audience hijacking prevention can help businesses protect sales by fording malware that diverts a customer just before the completion of a transaction.
Since founding Akamai over 20 years ago, our vision has always been to help our customers solve their toughest Internet challenges. And today, that includes stopping ransomware. Ransomware is a huge problem for enterprises around the world, with a new attack striking every 11 seconds. The damage resulting from ransomware is expected to amount to over $20 billion this year alone. Guardicore is critical to stopping the spread of ransomware, and that's a key reason why we acquired the company.
Akamai is already selling solutions, such as Enterprise Application Access, that help prevent attackers from gaining access to enterprise infrastructure and applications. But to be secure in today's world, you also need a second layer of defense to block the spread of malware that has gained a foothold in the enterprise. And that's where Guardicore comes in.
Guardicore helps detect when a breach has occurred by identifying anomalous data flows within enterprise networks. Guardicore also helps prevent the malware from spreading through a capability known as micro-segmentation. Guardicore's micro-segmentation solution limits access within the enterprise to only those applications that are authorized to communicate with one another.
Denying communication as the default greatly limits the spread of malware and protects the flow of enterprise data across the network. And that's the key to stopping ransomware. We believe Guardicore's best-in-class micro-segmentation solution is the perfect addition to our Zero Trust portfolio, enabling Akamai to offer customers a comprehensive solution to stop the damage being caused by ransomware and malware.
During the call we held on September 29, we spoke about the parallels between our acquisition of Guardicore with our acquisition of Prolexic in 2014. Just as the acquisition of Prolexic propelled us to a leadership position in helping to stop DDoS attacks, we believe that the acquisition of Guardicore will establish Akamai as a leader in helping to stop the damage caused by ransomware as well as other forms of malware.
Customers see Akamai as a strategic partner in security not only because of the strength and breadth of our solutions, but also because of the depth of our security expertise and threat intelligence and the scale of our platform, the same platform that underpins our world-leading CDN. Akamai CDN handles over 5 trillion requests every day. In addition, we resolve more than 3 trillion DNS queries each day. This gives us unmatched real-time insight into the world's Internet traffic, which we analyze to provide best-in-class threat intelligence, protection and support. 
We also have one of the industry's largest and most experienced teams of security professionals, with thousands of engineers and consultants working on security for our customers. Our security solutions are tightly integrated into the world's largest and most distributed edge platform, and that provides unmatched global scale to defend customers against not only the largest DDoS attacks, but also against the vast bot armies that are waging attacks from the edge. The integration of our security solutions with our CDN solutions also provides benefits to our customers in terms of improved performance and ease of use.
With Akamai, security and performance go hand in hand. You can buy them together as a single protect and perform package, which makes purchasing and integration easy for the customer. And when you buy security from Akamai, your performance has automatically improved. That's because we apply the security layer as we are delivering the content from the world's true edge platform. This means that the processing needed for security stays close to the end user, which makes for much better performance.
Akamai's unique combination of security and delivery provides a powerful offering in the market, which is one reason why we're the market leaders in both security and CDN. Our CDN business also generates substantial cash that we can use to invest in future growth, as we've recently done with the Guardicore acquisition. For example, our CDN business generated revenue of $526 million in Q3 and contributed substantially to our overall free cash flow of $273 million, enough to cover almost half of what we spent to acquire Guardicore.
We believe that having the world's largest and most distributed edge network also provides a great foundation for the growth of our edge applications business. As 5G rolls out, as IoT applications proliferate and as more data is created and processed at the edge, Akamai's edge compute platform is very well suited to support the high throughput and low latency applications that are not well served by traditional cloud providers today.
From delivery and performance to compute and security, the world's leading brands want our help. That's because the Internet is getting more complicated, with more traffic, higher user expectations and more cyber threats every day. And the world's leading enterprises know that Akamai can help keep their digital experiences close to their end users and the threats farther away. They know that what we do makes life better for billions of people, billions of times a day, and that nobody powers and protects life online like Akamai.
I'll now turn the call over to Ed to provide further details on our Q3 results and our outlook for the rest of the year. Ed?"

Moving now to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, in line with our expectations. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 63%. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $261 million.
Now moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $396 million. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46%. Non-GAAP operating income was $277 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 32%. Capital expenditures in Q3, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $129 million. This was below our guidance range, primarily due to continued progress on network CapEx efficiency projects.
GAAP net income for the third quarter was $179 million or $1.08 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $239 million or $1.45 of earnings per diluted share, up 11% year-over-year, up 10% in constant currency and $0.04 above the high end of our guidance range. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $39 million, based on a Q3 effective tax rate of approximately 14%.
Moving now to cash and our use of capital. As of September 30, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.8 billion. After accounting for the $2.3 billion of combined principal amounts of our 2 convertible notes, net cash was approximately $452 million as of September 30.
During the third quarter, we spent approximately $97 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 800,000 shares. We ended Q3 with approximately $321 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization, which runs through the end of this year. As noted in today's press release, our Board authorized a new buyback program of up to $1.8 billion, beginning January 1, 2022, and running through the end of 2024.
As we've previously discussed, our primary intention is to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time. However, our repurchase authorizations also allow us to opportunistically deploy capital if or when we believe there is a valuation disconnect in the market based on business or market conditions. Combining the 2 authorizations, we currently have more than $2 billion available for share repurchases through the end of 2024.
We believe our strong balance sheet and significant free cash flow generation, which totaled $273 million or 32% of total revenue in Q3, also provides us with significant financial flexibility to pursue a balanced capital deployment strategy. As such, we plan to continue to invest organically in R&D and product development, expand our capabilities through M&A, as you saw with our most recent acquisition of Guardicore, and return capital to shareholders via share repurchases.
Moving on to Q4 guidance. There are 2 factors to consider as you update your models for the fourth quarter. First, we closed the acquisition of Guardicore on October 20. Our guidance assumes Guardicore will contribute approximately $6 million to $7 million of revenue in Q4. It also assumes that Guardicore will be approximately $0.05 dilutive to our total non-GAAP earnings per share in Q4.
Second, as in prior years, seasonality plays a large role in determining our fourth quarter financial performance. We typically see higher than normal traffic for our large media customers and from seasonal online retail activity for our e-commerce customers, which are both difficult to predict. With that in mind, we are projecting Q4 revenue in the range of $883 million to $908 million or up 4% to 7%, as reported, or 5% to 8% in constant currency over Q4 2020.
Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $3 million impact on Q4 revenue compared to Q3 levels and a negative $6 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $290 million to $297 million.  
We anticipate Q4 EBITDA margins of approximately 43% to 44%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $120 million to $121 million. Factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30% for Q4.
Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $128 million to $133 million, excluding equity compensation in the fourth quarter. This represents less than 15% of anticipated total revenue. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.37 to $1.44. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $38 million to $39 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 14.5%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares.
Looking ahead to the full year, we are raising our guidance. We now expect revenue of $3.439 billion to $3.464 billion, which is up 8% year-over-year as reported or up 7% in constant currency. We now expect security revenue growth to be in the mid-20% range for the full year 2021. We are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.63 to $5.69. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 14.5% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares.
Finally, full year CapEx is anticipated to be approximately 16% of revenue, consistent with our prior guidance. We are very pleased to deliver another quarter of excellent financial results, and we look forward to closing out a strong 2021.

As we talked about, Page Integrity Manager released in the last year, a very exciting technology. Going forward, we have account protector. There's a lot of customer interest there. And then early next year, audience hijacking protection. I think that's -- a lot of customers have asked for that, and that stops malware or plug-ins from stealing or hijacking their audience right before the point of sale or the transaction is executed. Obviously, in the access segment, I think that's a huge area of future growth. 
Really excited about the Guardicore acquisition. That combines very nicely with our Zero Trust solutions. It combines with Enterprise Application Access to give you the full combination of North, Southeast, West, I think will be compelling in the market. So we're continuing to invest across the board.

So it doesn't have a huge impact in terms of what we're seeing as far as an improvement. But it's good to see that, that's starting to pick up a little bit.
Commerce, I would say, is pretty mixed. We're seeing good strength in security, still seeing some pressure, especially in the U.S. commerce vertical, that's a much bigger vertical. That's around 15% of total revenue. So we're not quite out of the woods yet with commerce, again, especially in the U.S.  That's the area that we're probably seeing the most weakness, and that's still persisting from the pandemic."

I thought it had more to do historically with sort of platform customers in the U.S. underperforming. But now the platform customers are actually doing really well and growing pretty well. So I kind of lost the thread on why the U.S. is still underperforming international regions.
And then a second question on sort of the operating margin side of the equation. Any kind of guidelines you could give us and how we should think about calendar year '22? Are there kind of -- a lot of companies are talking to us about reiteration, if you will, maybe more spending on travel and people come back to the office and marketing events ramping back up.
On the flip side of the equation, you've been kind of underspending on CapEx versus the original target, and then that's coming down as a percentage of revenue. So perhaps there's some gross margin benefit that you could see in calendar '22 could offset that. So any kind of sense you could give us on how to start thinking about calendar year '22 margins?"

So I'll start with the second part on margins. So yes, you're correct. I mean next year, we'll be expecting that we should start traveling again. So there'll be a little bit more OpEx there. You're right to call out CapEx as -- I think the team's do",475,"Sure. So I'll start with the second part on margins. So yes, you're correct. I mean next year, we'll be expecting that we should start traveling again. So there'll be a little bit more OpEx there. You're right to call out CapEx as -- I think the team's doing a fantastic job on a lot of CapEx efficiency projects that we've got going with both software and hardware, being able to drive that down. We would expect that CapEx to be back to those normal levels that we've seen, maybe even a touch lower. So that impacts your depreciation, but it takes a while for that to flow through the model. So you won't get a ton of benefit of that right away, but certainly, down the road, you will.
I've given some prior guidance when we had the Guardicore call about operating in the 29% to 30% range for next year, and then hopefully getting back or we will get back to over 30% in '23. Obviously, we'll update you. I had mentioned earlier to Sterling that Guardicore's contribution will probably be a bit better than what we said earlier on. I don't have a number to call out yet, so that will obviously help out the operating margins a touch there. And then you asked about U.S. and international and the disparity between the 2. I'd sort of flip it around and say that it's not so much the U.S. being weak, but really just strong international growth. I mean U.S. is kind of low single digit.
I mentioned on the previous question, that's where we're having the most trouble with our U.S. commerce vertical, which is a pretty significant vertical in the U.S. And then we also have a lot of large media customers that are in the U.S., and that's where you tend to see more of the splitting of traffic and pricing pressure. So those things combined sort of put a little bit of pressure in terms of the growth rate in the U.S., but really, the strength outside the U.S. is something that I think is a significant advantage for us.
We made a lot of investments both in the network and the sales teams, et cetera, and we've been able to drive pretty significant growth. Very happy with what I'm seeing in terms of participation as far as strong growth in countries like Korea, Spain, Brazil, Mexico, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan. I mean, across the board, we're seeing very strong growth. Latin America, in particular, has been very strong. We made an acquisition there a couple of years ago, starting to get some good scale out of that. So a little bit of a mixed picture in the U.S. with some challenges in commerce. But really, I look at it as just very strong international presence and growth."

But I think in the 60s, low 60s is probably a decent place to peg it."

Of course, the attackers are always innovating with new forms of attack. But I am very excited about the Guardicore acquisition. And I think it really does fill out and complete our access story, our ability to stop ransomware and malware. As I mentioned, we already have capabilities that prevent the malware from getting in. Enterprise application access, in particular, governs what employees can touch and access. And even then it has to come through Akamai's application firewall. So we're making sure that malware doesn't come in. We also have multifactor authentication, which make sure that the employee is who they say they are.
And now with Guardicore, we stop the spread of the malware, if it does get in. And there are a lot of ways into the enterprise today. It is really -- despite all the defenses you try to put in place, somebody, for example, in the capital pipeline case, a password or credential gets out there.
Now we still have ways of catching that somebody is using a stolen credential. But malware does get in still. And so the real key there is stopping the spread, and that's what Guardicore does. And so now I think it's really nice because you stopped the ransomware with Guardicore, but we've got the whole package and whole solution now. And I think that's really unique in the marketplace and very exciting."

I think it's obviously a tougher quarter to call here with some supply chain disruptions and things like that. Does that drive more or less Internet traffic and what does that holiday season look like.
Typically, a very strong media quarter where you see new devices and games coming online -- sorry, devices, consoles, et cetera, coming online. And then you also have a lot of sporting events in Q4, back-to-school, you've got lots of game releases. So it can be a pretty robust season for us, obviously challenging to call. I kind of looked at the events calendar, it's pretty full. So we provided we can see some good traffic. You can see good upside. We delivered that in the last couple of years. In terms of security, it's not as seasonal. Certainly, there are some bundles we have where there is -- traffic can impact that a bit. But I think to take our security guidance, we've been pretty conservative in the way that we've approached security, and we've been overdelivering every quarter. I think -- we've had, obviously, Guardicore is off to a good start. So I wouldn't imply that as a seasonal downtick or anything like that in our security growth."

So we leaned in. We built up our inventory a bit. We bought a lot of small equipment.
So that we're not concerned right now anyway with the supply chain. So I'd say that's part of what's driving it is we built out ahead of demand. We're pretty smart in the way we did that. But also, I mentioned there's a number of CapEx efficiencies that Adam and his team are working on, not only just software but network design, deployment optimization, looking at different hardware improvements and just any way to drive a big focus on lowering our need for CapEx.
And also keep in mind, we have great relationships with the networks and ISPs. So in terms of doing optimizations inside of their networks, we're able to do that as well. So I'd say it's really a great execution on the team's part, and CapEx has come down pretty significantly. You see that in our free cash flow results."

First, I wanted to go a little bit deeper on the supply chain issues. I appreciate you've obviously overinvested capacity with the OTT launches and the pandemic last year. You seem pretty well-insulated from the rising cost. But at what point that this continues dragging out? Does it begin to become a worry and you might have to overspend in order to keep capacity and not have to turn away business?
And maybe related to that, as we think about the environment heading into Q4, how do we expect that to shake out, especially given Q4 is such -- traditionally such a strong commerce season? A lot of companies are telling us, they're not going to be able to meet demand, especially when it comes to electronic goods. So is that a worry that you have? And maybe how are you thinking about embedding that in your guidance?"

I just mentioned on the last question that it's hard to predict what the commerce season looks like. And obviously, when you're in the business of delivering Internet traffic, one model could suggest that while shells are not stock, people are doing more surfing to find things. Another model would suggest that there's not as much shopping and people are giving cash and gift cards. So hard to tell, but we did put out a pretty big range there.
Also keep in mind that a lot of our commerce customers, about half of our commerce customers have taken, we call our 0 overage. So you've kind of flattened out that bursting. So the burst thing for commerce is not as big of an impact, Q4 still has an impact. In terms of the device cycle, that's an interesting one. We do expect and we've seen over the last several years, especially in the last couple of weeks of the year, as new devices come online, there's a lot of firmware updates and things like that. I still expect to see that.
But there's other things that are not as dependent on that, for example, gaming releases, new video content that comes out if you don't have a new machine, you're watching it on your old machines. So I still think that we'll have a pretty big immediate quarter, for sure. But that's why I've given a pretty wide range to try to take those things into consideration.
And then on your supply chain question, you had asked about when does this become a problem. It's funny, I asked the same questions to my team as we go through our CapEx build-out. We've done a nice job of building out several quarters' worth of inventory here. And we've diversified our supply chain, and the team has done a good job of ensuring that we're not seeing any significant increase in pricing or anything like that. A little bit on the freight side, but it's not really material, and I think that should start to work itself out. But if we do see another massive growth in traffic, maybe we start to run into some problems. But so far, so good. And like I said, the team did a really good job preparing, not expecting this type of a disruption in the supply chain, but expecting that the result from the pandemic would last a lot longer so we did some scenario planning. So we're in pretty good shape at the moment."

We obviously did much better this year than we expected going into the year. Security has overperformed every single quarter. We still feel pretty comfortable with our 20% growth rate, as we talked about. As a matter of fact, coming out of this year, we're doing a bit better than that.

Let me just add, our strategy in security is to combine organic development with intelligent and timely acquisitions, and we'll continue to do that. And of course, when you buy a company after a year, its growth becomes organic and it's no longer counted as an acquisition growth per se. And I think we've had a really great track record of doing that in security, going back all the way to the Prolexic acquisition in 2014.
And as I mentioned, I think, Guardicore is fundamentally like that in terms of really transforming our enterprise security business just like Prolexic transformed our DDoS business, which, of course, today is very, very successful. We're the market leader by far. And our goal is to do that on the enterprise security side for things like stopping ransomware and stopping malware.
And as Ed said, as we continue to want to grow our security business over the longer term at 20-plus percent, that will include acquisitions. And I think acquisitions are a good thing. It gives you a jump start on technology in an important area. Guardicore has been working for a long time to develop their micro segmentation approach. I believe it is a market getting what they do. They're the best folks out there.
And now we have the benefit of all of the years of effort that they put into that at a perfect time because a lot of companies are rightly worried about stopping ransomware, and now Akamai is in a position to help them do that. And of course, it fits with a lot of our organic development on technology around EAA. It's an ideal combination. So we'll continue to do both and working hard to continue our security growth at 20-plus percent."

Security is really a great impairment for us. We're the market leader by far in the core areas of defending and protecting websites, applications and APIs, the leader by far in DDoS prevention. And those are areas that have a lot of attacks taking place. And now sort of the new category for us, where we will encounter new competition because we're moving into that space in a big way would be enterprise security.
