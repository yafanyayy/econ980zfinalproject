I hope you and your families are healthy and safe amid all that we've endured over the past 12 months. Here in Advance, we're incredibly grateful for the way our entire team persevere. When the reality of COVID-19 descended on our communities in March of 2020, we found ways across AAP to meet new, unfamiliar challenges with innovation and agility. I'd like to thank all of our team members as well as our independent partners for their commitment to safely serve our customers. As an essential business, their efforts have been critical to keep America moving during a time of great need. 
As you've heard from us throughout this pandemic, we remain focused on 3 overarching priorities: first, protect the health, safety and well-being of our team members and customers; second, preserve cash and protect the P&L during the crisis; and third, prepare to be even stronger following the crisis. Our results in Q4 and for the full year demonstrate that our unwavering focus on these priorities has enabled meaningful progress towards our long-term goals. From the beginning, we've invested in compensation for our frontline and distribution center team members, enhanced benefits, cleaning, personal protective equipment and innovative ways to serve our customers. This helped ensure that our team members and customers feel safe coming into work and to shop. Our store and distribution center team members continuously stepped up throughout the year, and they are the true heros for us. In spite of many obstacles for our team, we saw significant improvements in organizational health and increased engagement scores throughout the year. 
Fundamentally, we are building trust in the Advance brand at an enduring time for the world and one that our team members and customers will always remember. We're confident our COVID-19-related investments, which we believe will subside over time, are strengthening our employment brand, our customer brand and our corporate reputation for the long term. 
In Q4, we delivered comparable store sales growth of 4.7% and margin expansion of 17 basis points. This includes an 82 basis point headwind related to COVID-19, adjusted diluted EPS improvement of 14% to $1.87, including a $0.22 headwind related to COVID-19. For the full year, we delivered top line growth, resulting in record net sales of $10.1 billion; adjusted operating income improvement of 4.1% to $827.3 million, including a $60 million headwind related to COVID-19; record adjusted diluted EPS of $8.51, including a $0.66 headwind related to COVID-19; and we also returned $515 million to shareholders through share repurchases and our continued quarterly cash dividend. 
Jeff will cover more of the details of our financials shortly. But first, let's review our operational performance. COVID-19-related factors continued to affect channel performance in Q4 across our industry. DIY Omnichannel led the way as it has since Q2. It's well documented that consumers are spending more of their time at home, likely contributing to the shift in discretionary spending from services to goods. Given economic uncertainty and elevated unemployment, many consumers are choosing lower-cost options for vehicle repairs and maintenance, benefiting our DIY Omnichannel business. 
Our Professional business continued to recover with positive comp sales in both Q3 and Q4. Miles driven remain below prior year, in particular, for higher-income workers working remotely, who generally take their cars to Pro shops. This has limited growth in certain professional sales channels and in key categories like brakes. 
Geographically, all of our 8 regions posted positive comps in the quarter, led by our southernmost regions, including both the Southeast and Southwest. Meanwhile, our Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions remained below our reported growth rate. 
As previously discussed, large urban markets in these regions have been more impacted by COVID-19 with the most significant decline in miles driven. The good news is that while there remains a gap between our highest- and lowest-performing regions, that spread continues to narrow. We're cautiously optimistic this will further narrow in Q1 based on improving trends and more favorable winter weather early in the year. 
As we highlighted in our earnings release this morning, through the first 4 weeks of Q1, our comp sales were trending in the low double-digit range with strength across both DIY and Professional. With respect to categories, DieHard is driving record battery sales and led our growth in Q4. In addition, appearance chemicals remain strong, a trend that began with the stay-of-home orders last April. Across our Professional business, our team continues to leverage our industry-leading assortment of national brands, OE parts and owned brands. For Pro customers, there's nothing more important than having the right part in the right place at the right time. To enable this, we continue to strengthen our dynamic assortment tool, which is now live in all our corporate stores and more than 700 independent locations that have opted in. This machine learning platform has enabled significant improvements in product availability, helping to drive over a 60 basis point improvement in Q4 earnings. 
In addition, we continue to make enhancements to our online portal MyAdvance. The ease of access and wide array of resources available now includes features like virtual training, which has been essential during the pandemic. The resources we provide through our Carquest and Worldpac Technical Institutes allow our Pro customers, including all technicians within their shop, to attend interactive virtual training. 
Additionally, we continue to update our comprehensive catalog of technical service bulletins through our MotoLogic platform. We believe Pro customers are recognizing and appreciating our investments to improve parts quality, product availability, delivery speed and the digital experience, resulting in higher enterprise Pro online sales and share of wallet. 
These actions have also enabled growth of our TechNet customer base with approximately 1,400 new TechNets added in 2020. Finally, we continued increasing our Carquest independent locations in 2020, welcoming 50 new stores. Our independents remain a valuable component of our overall strategy, and our team remains focused on further expansion. 
Moving on to DIY Omnichannel. We've gained share in every region and across most categories in both Q4 and for the full year based on the syndicated data available to us. We believe our share gains are the result of our focus in 4 areas: first, the launch of DieHard; second, building awareness in regard of Advance through differentiation; third, improving customer loyalty through SPEED Perks; and fourth, improving store execution. 
Starting with DieHard. Despite the challenges of the pandemic, our team successfully launched DieHard as planned and executed a marketing plan unlike anything we've ever done before at AAP. Our #DieHardisBack campaign, featuring Bruce Willis, let consumers know that the iconic DieHard brand was back, and they could now buy DieHard at Advance and Carquest. This campaign is already improving top-of-mind and unaided awareness for DieHard. 
Our SPEED Perks program is pivotal to drive customer loyalty. Our team continues to invest in personalization for SPEED Perks members, driving higher engagement, long-term loyalty and increased share of wallet. In 2020, we grew our VIP members, those with an annual spend of $250 to $500, by nearly 15%. And our elite members, those with annual spend of more than $500, by more than 20%. 
To wrap up the discussion on DIY Omnichannel, we continue to see improvement from our initiatives, including our Net Promoter Scores. This gives us confidence that we're on the right track to sustain sales and share momentum in 2021. 
Moving on to an update of our 4 pillars of margin expansion. I'll begin with sales and profit per store. As a reminder, following 3 consecutive years of declining sales per store, we finished 2017 at approximately $1.5 million per store. Over the last 3 years, we've been optimizing our footprint, including the closure of 273 under-earning stores. Our sales per store have now grown for 3 consecutive years, and we finished 2020 at nearly $1.7 million per store. 
We're also executing a focused agenda to leverage payroll while reducing shrink, returns and defectives to drive [4-wall] profit per store improvement. In addition, the ongoing focus on team members is enabling us to attract the very best parts people and to reduce turnover. Our team members are a differentiator for Advance. And 4 years ago, we made a commitment to dramatically improve retention. 
Continued investment in our unique Fuel the Frontline program with more than 22,000 stock grants awarded since inception is creating an ownership culture. In the current environment with an increased competition for talent, we're reducing store turnover and enhancing our employment brand. 
We now have 3 straight years of comp sales growth and the closure of underperforming stores behind us. We're excited to announce that we plan to expand our store base and geographic footprint this year and expect to open 50 to 100 new stores. 
Our second margin expansion pillar is supply chain. While we paused our cross-banner replenishment and warehouse management system initiatives early in 2020, our team found ways to innovate and make progress on this productivity opportunity later in the year. The expansion of cross-banner replenishment is on track with the timing we communicated in November as we finished the year with just over 40% of the originally planned stores completed. We are on track to complete the originally planned stores and DCs by the end of Q3 2021, and the full run rate of savings will come beginning in Q4 2021. 
In addition, the implementation of our new warehouse management system, or WMS, continued in Q4. We converted our fourth DC by year-end as planned, and we're on track to complete our largest buildings this year. We believe we can capture roughly 75% of the savings from this initiative in 2022. 
Moving on to category management. The expansion of our own brand is a key component. This includes an increase of Carquest-branded assortment in engine management and undercar. Carquest has an excellent reputation with installers, and new products have been very well received by both Pro customers and Carquest independents. In 2020, we also launched our strategic pricing initiative to enhance our capabilities while incorporating customer decision journey insights into price and discount decision-making. 
Finally, our fourth pillar of margin expansion involves reducing and better and leveraging SG&A. The successful execution of our field restructure, back office consolidations and safety initiatives benefited SG&A in the quarter and will enable further improved margin expansion going forward. As we called out in November, SG&A was elevated in Q4 primarily due to COVID-19-related expenses and other factors that Jeff will detail for us. 
To summarize, we're now in execution mode on our key growth and margin expansion initiatives. Our mission is passion for customers, passion for yes with the goal of serving them with care and speed. We've made many necessary changes at AAP in recent years. But one thing that has not changed is the content knowledge, the passion and the commitment of our team members and independent partners. Our actions have strengthened Advance, enabling us to compete more vigorously. 
Finally, we're very excited to share our third sustainability and social responsibility report next month. And we'll be providing a strategic update of our long-term plans on April 20. 
With that, I'll pass the call to Jeff to discuss our financial results in greater detail as well as our 2021 guidance."
24333,702928012,2212132,"Advance Auto Parts, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2021",2021-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning. I, too, would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to all our team members for the extraordinary focus and effort throughout 2020 despite the unprecedented times.

I, too, would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to all our team members for the extraordinary focus and effort throughout 2020 despite the unprecedented times. Our entire team adjusted, adapted and continued to execute our priorities. In Q4, our net sales of $2.4 billion increased 12%. Adjusted gross profit margin expanded 192 basis points to 45.9%, driven primarily by inventory-related items, cost and price improvements as well as supply chain leverage. As our primary focus throughout the year was on the health and safety of our team members and customers, we temporarily paused our physical inventory counts earlier this year. When we resumed these in Q4, our actual shrink rates were far better than we had anticipated. This resulted in a benefit in inventory-related costs due to a reduction in the reserve to reflect the positive result. 
LIFO-related impacts were a tailwind this quarter versus prior year. This will be the last quarter we include the LIFO impacts in our adjusted financial results as we will begin reporting in Q1 2021, excluding any benefits or expenses from LIFO in our adjusted financial measures. We believe this adjustment creates a more accurate picture of our operational results and is more in line with industry practices. 
Our Q4 adjusted SG&A expense was $913.5 million. On a rate basis, this represented 38.6% of net sales compared to 36.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The single biggest driver of this increase was $19 million in COVID-related costs directly attributable to the unanticipated spike in case rates. We also incurred higher Q4 medical claims as a result of lower claims during the prior quarters. In addition, our short-term incentive compensation for both field and corporate team members was higher than prior year. 
Separately, we invested behind the launch of the #DieHardisBack campaign. We also incurred lease termination costs related to the ongoing optimization of our real estate footprint. We believe these expected investments in DieHard and lease optimization will result in top and bottom line improvements. 
Despite higher SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income increased 14.6% in Q4 to $171.8 million. On a rate basis, our adjusted OI margin expanded by 17 basis points. Finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.87, up 14% from prior year despite a $0.22 impact in the quarter from COVID expenses. 
For the full year, which includes an additional week versus 2019, we delivered record net sales of $10.1 billion, which increased 4.1%. The 53rd week added approximately $158 million to sales. Our adjusted gross profit increased 5% year-over-year, and adjusted gross profit margin expanded 38 basis points. 
Adjusted SG&A expense for full year 2020 increased 5.2% from 2019 results. This is primarily the result of COVID-related expenses discussed earlier as well as the 53rd week. We estimate the additional week resulted in a headwind of approximately 1.5% to our SG&A costs in the year. 
Our adjusted operating income increased 4.1% to $827.3 million. And our OI margin was 8.2%, flat compared to the prior year. Adjusting for the $60 million in COVID costs, our adjusted operating income margin expanded 59 basis points. Our full year 2020 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $8.51, which is a new record for advance and includes the headwind of $0.66 related to COVID costs. We estimate the impact of the 53rd week with a tailwind of approximately $20 million to our adjusted operating income and a benefit of approximately $0.23 to our reported adjusted EPS for the year. 
Our capital expenditures in Q4 were $75 million for a total investment of $268 million for the year and in line with our previously stated expectations. As we've noted, some of the critical transformation investments we expected to make in 2020 were paused for a portion of the year. As a result, we expect our capital spending will increase this year compared to 2020. 
Our free cash flow for the year was a record $702 million compared to $597 million in 2019. This increase was driven by several factors, including efforts we have made to improve working capital. We made meaningful progress on our AC ratio in 2020, delivering 300 basis points of improvement and ended the year at 80.2%. This, in addition to a $76 million tailwind associated with the CARES Act, resulted in a significant improvement in our cash conversion cycle. 
Our strong cash flow generation allowed us to continue our share repurchase activity in Q4. For the year, we repurchased more than $458 million of Advance stock. And including our quarterly cash dividend, we returned $515 million to shareholders. 
Our team remained disciplined throughout 2020 to ensure adequate liquidity, protect the P&L during the pandemic and strengthen our balance sheet. This resulted in a meaningful improvement in our cash position, resulting in $835 million in cash on hand at year-end. Further demonstrating our confidence in the long-term strength of our business and commitment to return cash to shareholders in a balanced approach to utilizing both share repurchases and dividends, our Board recently approved the continued payment of our quarterly cash dividend. 
Turning to 2021. While uncertainty remains in the current environment, we believe that we can continue to carry the momentum we have seen in the back half of 2020 forward. As the economy continues to recover and with our planned new store openings, we expect to deliver increased net sales and additional margin expansion. Importantly, we expect miles driven to continue improving throughout 2021, which should enable year-over-year growth in our Pro business. 
We're encouraged by trends through the first 4 weeks of 2021. With strength across our DIY Omnichannel and Pro business, we delivered double-digit comparable sales growth to start the year. We recognize the importance of transparency. And based on what we know today, this morning, we introduced our 2021 outlook. Despite continued uncertainty, we're pleased to provide our 2021 guidance. Based on the assumptions we outlined in our earnings release, our 2021 guidance includes net sales in the range of $10.1 billion to $10.3 billion; comparable store sales growth of 1% to 3%; adjusted operating income margin rate of 8.7% to 8.9%, which includes margin expansion of 60 to 80 basis points as compared to the 2020 adjusted operating income margin, excluding the $20.1 million benefit from the 53rd week; income tax rate of 24% to 26%; capital expenditures of $275 million to $325 million; and a minimum of $600 million of free cash flow. 
Finally, as Tom mentioned, following several years of closing underperforming stores and focusing on the improvement of operations across our footprint, we're excited to begin actively growing our store base and expanding the existing and new geographies. For the first time in 4 years, we're guiding to new store openings of 50 to 100 locations. I once again would like to thank the tremendous efforts of our team members in meeting the challenges of COVID-19 while still executing our strategic plan. We look forward to sharing more on those plans in the investor presentation we'll publish in April.

We're pretty excited that we're going to share an update with you on our long-term plans on April 20. 2020 was our third consecutive year of comp sales and operating income growth. And we have said, as you highlighted, the 2021 and beyond is going to have a significant acceleration of margin expansion, and it's going to come from a number of areas that we've talked about before. So we're going to talk more about that on April 20. I mean I think the biggest factor in what you described is the COVID-related costs that we still have embedded in our annual guide this year. And, that remains an unknown at this point. We still have some uncertainty out there regarding COVID-related costs. And we saw that late in the year. It spiked significantly as infection rates across the country went up. And we remain very focused on accelerating margin expansion. Once that comes out, as we said, it's $60 million for the full year, that'll be a big number for us to expand our margins with."

Miles driven were down the most in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. The Southeast and Southwest were down the least. And then on the other hand, from a channel perspective, we know that DIY outperformed Pro. So both of those things, we start to lap in April and May. And we do expect the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic to come back strong. It's obviously, once again, a function of how quickly the economy returns to those markets, how quickly people start to return back to work. But there is an expectation that those markets will outperform and that Pro will outperform DIY this year. So we feel we're very, very well positioned in that regard. And we're going to watch it very closely. We've looked at the full year, the lapse for each geography and each channel. And we feel very good about how we're positioned to take advantage of that resurgence in demand in the Mid-Atlantic, the Northeast and our Professional business."

So as it relates to category management, for example, we saw improvements in both product costs as well as improvements in price.

So in addition to shrink and the LIFO, as you just called out, the channel mix was also positive. Although I will tell you that, that was offset by product mix, which is related to categories such as brakes, wipers and lighting, similar to what we saw in the third quarter. 
Now looking forward into the guidance into '21, it's a lot of those same initiatives. And those are the reasons that gross margin is going to be the driver for our margin growth when we look at '21 compared to '20. So the strategic pricing, we've got it in place. We're starting to implement that. We're already starting to see early results. And similar to the category management, we're changing over into private label.

So we've done a tremendous amount of work on this to try and understand what to expect for the year. Clearly, the first quarter will be very strong. We highlighted low double-digit growth quarter-to-date. And that's prior to the widespread shutdowns that happened late period 3 and into period 4. Period -- sorry, the second quarter, you'll recall the Professional business was still challenged, DIY surged. That, we're factoring in, et cetera. So think about looking at the 2-year numbers, I mean, that's what we're looking at closely. Obviously, the 2-year numbers to kind of factor out the volatility of last year. But even there, you've got to put some judgment against it. But we obviously expect to get off to a great start and build on the momentum.

That one is a little bit more difficult to predict. Certainly, we saw a surge here late in the year and then early into '21. But as we said, we are modeling less COVID costs in '21 as compared to '20. When that happens remains to be seen. And then we will be lapping some difficult dollars in SG&A in the second and third quarter around payroll. So we had -- we were taking hours out. We were reducing time. We were closing early.

The narrowing that we referenced, I mean, if you think back, the second quarter of last year, I think we called out roughly 2,000 basis points gap and then it narrowed to about 1,000. And it's continuing to narrow. So you're talking about meaningful differences in geographic performance, at least for us, and from everything we can see from syndicated data really for the entire industry. PRO versus DIY, you can look at the reported results of the many players and infer from that. So they're upside possibly. But it's February right now, there's still uncertainty out there. We're off to a terrific start. We've actually got a winter this year. I mean across the country, if you look and see what's going on, it's very different than it's been the last 2 years. So there are some things that would lead you to believe there could be upside there, but it's early in the year and we want to be thoughtful about the uncertainty that's there. We feel very confident in our guide at this point."

Fortunately, we have a loyalty platform, SPEED Perks. We mine that data. We're trying to continue to learn from the new customers that are coming in. And we've sort of outlined a number of reasons that have driven this, everything from people looking for more efficient ways, inexpensive ways to repair their and maintain their vehicles, the fact that people have time on their hands, the mass transportation version that's going on there, people are not necessarily going to larger boxes. There's a number of factors that are out there. And the question is how sticky are those factors. And what we're trying to do is engage very closely with our customer base. What we know is that the new customers that have come in are a little bit younger than our traditional customers. They spend more time online. They're a little more affluent. We've got a pretty good idea of how to engage those customers, and personalization and leveraging first-party data is very important for us. So our goal is to drive share of wallet. Again, pretty fragmented industry, lots of opportunity for us out there. If you look at the broader DIY market, we're only roughly about $4 billion in sales in a market that's close to $60 billion. So we do see lots of upside for us on DIY yet even though there was a surge last year and a pretty disruptive shift in consumer behavior."

Stimulus happened early in this year, so there was money that came into the market. From our vantage point, we see market share data, and we like our market share data in the first part of the year. We advertised very deliberately in the fourth quarter knowing that that's going to build into the early part of the year. And we're continuing to advertise DieHard this week. We had a pretty significant cold snap across the country, which should drive battery failure. So we're pretty confident that the DieHard advertising is resonating with our customers. It's bringing new customers into our stores. We know that. And that's going to help us drive market share and traffic beyond the first quarter.

National brands are very important to us. And we engage with our national brand suppliers routinely and we're working very collaboratively with them to help build their brands. So it's a balanced approach. Now there are some categories where we saw an opportunity for own brand penetration. Clearly, engine management was one of them. Suspension and ride control is another area of focus for us. And we're not going to give you the exact numbers, but there is a significant difference in the margin profile of those categories from a branded perspective versus own brand. And we continue to work with the suppliers. We'd obviously like to continue to sell the national brands. But where it's an obvious economic gap for us, potentially due to pricing across other channels, we're going to make those decisions. It's a gradual migration over time. This is not a light switch. You've got to gradually make these changes. But I think our merchandising team is doing an excellent job transitioning where we are making those changes across categories. And it's driving not just margin expansion, but unit growth because our customers voting with their clicks, and they're voting for Carquest. They love the Carquest brand. It's a great brand.

And we've been increasing -- our store traffic has been increasing since that point through the year. The online order piece is still a substantial part of our business, but it is largely pickup in store.

We did our best, David, to reach out to whatever industry sources we could to get a sense for this. And I'll caveat all of this with it's -- this is an estimate at this point, and there is a lot of uncertainty out there. But if you look at what happened last year, the year-to-date numbers at the kind of October, November time frame, which is based on the sources we have, are the most relevant or most accurate numbers that we can get. They would show the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic down the most, as I said, like high double digits in that case. And the Southeast and Southwest are down 13%, something like that. And then the aggregate number is kind of in between. So you start to lap that as you get into April, May, and we do believe that it edges back up. In other words, if you say the year is down double digits, it's not going to get back to the level it was in 2019, but it's going to be greater than it was in 2020. That's the fundamental assumption. How much comes back? We've got an estimate in there. We're not going to put that out there, but it's it is improvement over 2020 as people gradually start to return to work. We look at the return to office metrics, which are readily available out there, and you can see that people are gradually returning to office. Now many people are talking about hybrid approaches. People are talking about remote work, but there are more people coming back to the office now than there were at the height of the pandemic.

And in order to be competitive, we've had to keep up with, among other things, increased wages in the DC. So it would largely be in the stores. Obviously, there's a number of factors. We're assuming wage inflation anywhere from 2% to 5%. So we're going to continue to increase wages this year with or without a federal minimum wage. So the big factor, it really depends on a couple of things. First, obviously, it has to pass and then how that looks in terms of how it graduates over time. Is it is it $1 a year? What is it going to be to get to $15? So there's a number of variables there. It's clearly -- it's not in our guidance, but we're thinking about it. And we're continuing to make investments.

But the reason why we're planning on opening 50 to 100 stores is because of the reasons I said earlier, and we do believe DIY is going to have some legs in the near term for sure, and this is an opportunity for us. We've got DieHard, which is -- participates in the largest category for DIY. We're advertising this brand. So we're going to continue to drive it. And DIY is a great business. It's a very profitable business. It's a margin-accretive business and one that we're going to continue to stay focused on. 
Well, thanks again for joining us this morning. We're gaining a lot of confidence regarding our initiatives. Obviously, we're respecting the economic and operational landscape that we're competing in. And as increasing COVID-19 vaccinations happen throughout the year, we expect the stability to continue to improve. We're looking for continued recovery for critical factors such as miles driven and further increases in the average age of the car park. Operationally, we've narrowed and sharpened our focus on the most important initiatives to accelerate margin expansion and deliver increased value for our customers and for our shareholders. And we look forward to publishing our third sustainability and social responsibility report next month and sharing additional details on our strategic efforts at our upcoming investor event on April 20. Thanks for joining."

I hope you and your families are healthy and safe amid all that we've endured over the past 12 months. Here in Advance, we're incredibly grateful for the way our entire team persevere. When the reality of COVID-19 descended on our communities in March of 2020, we found ways across AAP to meet new, unfamiliar challenges with innovation and agility. I'd like to thank all of our team members as well as our independent partners for their commitment to safely serve our customers. As an essential business, their efforts have been critical to keep America moving during a time of great need.  
As you've heard from us throughout this pandemic, we remain focused on 3 overarching priorities: first, protect the health, safety and well-being of our team members and customers; second, preserve cash and protect the P&L during the crisis; and third, prepare to be even stronger following the crisis. Our results in Q4 and for the full year demonstrate that our unwavering focus on these priorities has enabled meaningful progress towards our long-term goals. 
From the beginning, we've invested in compensation for our frontline and distribution center team members, enhanced benefits, cleaning, personal protective equipment and innovative ways to serve our customers. This helped ensure that our team members and customers feel safe coming into work and to shop. Our store and distribution center team members continuously stepped up throughout the year, and they are the true heros for us. In spite of many obstacles for our team, we saw significant improvement in organizational health and increased engagement scores throughout the year.  
Fundamentally, we are building trust in the Advance brand at an enduring time for the world and one that our team members and customers will always remember. We're confident our COVID-19-related investments, which we believe will subside over time, are strengthening our employment brand, our customer brand and our corporate reputation for the long term.  
In Q4, we delivered comparable store sales growth of 4.7% and margin expansion of 17 basis points. This includes an 82 basis point headwind related to COVID-19. Adjusted diluted EPS improvement of 14% to $1.87, including a $0.22 headwind related to COVID-19. For the full year, we delivered top line growth, resulting in record net sales of $10.1 billion; adjusted operating income improvement of 4.1% to $827.3 million, including a $60 million headwind related to COVID-19; record adjusted diluted EPS of $8.51, including a $0.66 headwind related to COVID-19; and we also returned $515 million to shareholders through share repurchases and our continued quarterly cash dividend.  
Jeff will cover more of the details of our financials shortly. But first, let's review our operational performance. COVID-19-related factors continued to affect channel performance in Q4 across our industry. DIY omnichannel led the way as it has since Q2. It's well documented that consumers are spending more of their time at home, likely contributing to the shift in discretionary spending from services to goods.  Given economic uncertainty and elevated unemployment, many consumers are choosing lower-cost options for vehicle repairs and maintenance, benefiting our DIY omnichannel business.  
Our Professional business continued to recover, with positive comp sales in both Q3 and Q4. Miles driven remain below prior year, in particular, for higher-income workers working remotely, who generally take their cars to Pro shops. This has limited growth in certain Professional sales channels and in key categories like brakes.  
Geographically, all of our 8 regions posted positive comps in the quarter, led by our southernmost regions, including both the Southeast and Southwest. Meanwhile, our Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions remained below our reported growth rate.  As previously discussed, large urban markets in these regions have been more impacted by COVID-19, with the most significant decline in miles driven. The good news is that while there remains a gap between our highest- and lowest-performing regions, that spread continues to narrow. We're cautiously optimistic this will further narrow in Q1 based on improving trends and more favorable winter weather early in the year.  
As we highlighted in our earnings release this morning, through the first 4 weeks of Q1, our comp sales were trending in the low double-digit range, with strength across both DIY and Professional. With respect to categories, DieHard is driving record battery sales and led our growth in Q4. In addition, appearance chemicals remain strong, a trend that began with the stay- at-home orders last April. Across our Professional business, our team continues to leverage our industry-leading assortment of national brands, OE parts and owned brands. For Pro customers, there's nothing more important than having the right part in the right place at the right time. To enable this, we continue to strengthen our dynamic assortment tool, which is now live in all our corporate stores and more than 700 independent locations that have opted in. This machine learning platform has enabled significant improvements in product availability, helping to drive over a 60 basis point improvement in Q4 close rates.  
In addition, we continue to make enhancements to our online portal, MyAdvance. The ease of access and wide array of resources available now includes features like virtual training, which has been essential during the pandemic. The resources we provide through our Carquest and Worldpac technical institutes allow our Pro customers, including all technicians within their shop, to attend interactive virtual training.  
Additionally, we continue to update our comprehensive catalog of technical service bulletins through our MotoLogic platform. We believe Pro customers are recognizing and appreciating our investments to improve parts quality, product availability, delivery speed and the digital experience, resulting in higher enterprise Pro online sales and share of wallet.  
These actions have also enabled growth of our TechNet customer base, with approximately 1,400 new TechNets added in 2020. Finally, we continued increasing our Carquest independent locations in 2020, welcoming 50 new stores. Our independents remain a valuable component of our overall strategy, and our team remains focused on further expansion.  
Moving on to DIY omnichannel. We've gained share in every region and across most categories in both Q4 and for the full year based on the syndicated data available to us. We believe our share gains are the result of our focus in 4 areas: first, the launch of DieHard; second, building awareness in regard of Advance through differentiation; third, improving customer loyalty through Speed Perks; and fourth, improving store execution.  
Starting with DieHard. Despite the challenges of the pandemic, our team successfully launched DieHard as planned and executed a marketing plan unlike anything we've ever done before at AAP. Our #DieHardisBack campaign featuring Bruce Willis, let consumers know that the iconic DieHard brand was back, and they could now buy DieHard at Advance and Carquest. This campaign is already improving top-of-mind and unaided awareness for DieHard.  
Our Speed Perks program is an important tool to drive customer loyalty. Our team continues to invest in personalization for Speed Perks members, driving higher engagement, long-term loyalty and increased share of wallet. In 2020, we grew our VIP members, those with an annual spend of $250 to $500, by nearly 15%. And our elite members, those with annual spend of more than $500, by more than 20%.  
To wrap up the discussion on DIY omnichannel, we continue to see improvement from our initiatives, including our Net Promoter Scores. This gives us confidence that we're on the right track to sustain sales and share momentum in 2021.  
Moving on to an update of our 4 pillars of margin expansion. I'll begin with sales and profit per store. As a reminder, following 3 consecutive years of declining sales per store, we finished 2017 at approximately $1.5 million per store. Over the last 3 years, we've been optimizing our footprint, including the closure of 273 underperforming stores. Our sales per store have now grown for 3 consecutive years, and we finished 2020 at nearly $1.7 million per store.  
We're also executing a focused agenda to leverage payroll while reducing shrink, returns and defectives to drive 4-wall profit per store improvement. In addition, the ongoing focus on team members is enabling us to attract the very best parts people and to reduce turnover. Our team members are a differentiator for Advance. And 4 years ago, we made a commitment to dramatically improve retention.  
Continued investment in our unique Fuel the Frontline program with more than 22,000 stock grants awarded since inception is creating an ownership culture. In the current environment with an increased competition for talent, we're reducing store turnover and enhancing our employment brand.  We now have 3 straight years of comp sales growth and the closure of underperforming stores behind us. We're excited to announce that we plan to expand our store base and geographic footprint this year and expect to open 50 to 100 new stores.  
Our second margin expansion pillar is supply chain. While we paused our cross-banner replenishment and warehouse management system initiatives early in 2020, our team found ways to innovate and make progress on this productivity opportunity later in the year. The expansion of cross-banner replenishment is on track with the timing we communicated in November, as we finished the year with just over 40% of the originally planned stores completed. We are on track to complete the originally planned stores and DCs by the end of Q3 2021, and the full run rate of savings will come beginning in Q4 2021.  
In addition, the implementation of our new warehouse management system, or WMS, continued in Q4. We converted our fourth DC by year-end as planned, and we're on track to complete our largest buildings this year. We believe we can capture roughly 75% of the savings from this initiative in 2022.  
Moving on to category management. The expansion of our own brand assortment is a key component. This includes an increase of Carquest-branded assortment in engine management and undercar. Carquest has an excellent reputation with installers, and new products have been very well received by both Pro customers and Carquest Independents. In 2020, we also launched our strategic pricing initiative to enhance our capabilities while incorporating customer decision journey insights into price and discount decision-making.  
Finally, our fourth pillar of margin expansion involves reducing and better leveraging SG&A. The successful execution of our field restructure, back office consolidations and safety initiatives benefited SG&A in the quarter and will enable further improvement in margin expansion going forward. As we called out in November, SG&A was elevated in Q4 primarily due to COVID-19-related expenses and other factors that Jeff will detail shortly.
To summarize, we're now in execution mode on our key growth and margin expansion initiatives. Our mission is passion for customers, passion for yes, with the goal of serving them with care and speed. We've made many necessary changes at AAP in recent years. But one thing that has not changed is the content knowledge, the passion and the commitment of our team members and independent partners. Our actions have strengthened Advance, enabling us to compete more vigorously.  
Finally, we're very excited to share our third sustainability and social responsibility report next month. And we'll be providing a strategic update of our long-term plans on April 20. With that, I'll pass the call to Jeff to discuss our financial results in greater detail as well as our 2021 guidance."
24333,702928012,2212302,"Advance Auto Parts, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2021",2021-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning. I, too, would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to all our team members for the extraordinary focus and effort throughout 2020 despite the unprecedented times.

I, too, would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to all our team members for the extraordinary focus and effort throughout 2020 despite the unprecedented times. Our entire team adjusted, adapted and continued to execute our priorities. In Q4, our net sales of $2.4 billion increased 12%. Adjusted gross profit margin expanded 192 basis points to 45.9%, driven primarily by inventory-related items, cost and price improvements as well as supply chain leverage. As our primary focus throughout the year was on the health and safety of our team members and customers, we temporarily paused our physical inventory counts earlier this year. When we resumed these in Q4, our actual shrink rates were far better than we have anticipated. This resulted in a benefit in inventory-related costs due to a reduction in the reserve to reflect the positive result.  
LIFO-related impacts were a tailwind this quarter versus prior year. This will be the last quarter we include the LIFO impacts in our adjusted financial results as we will begin reporting in Q1 2021, excluding any benefits or expenses from LIFO in our adjusted financial measures. We believe this adjustment creates a more accurate picture of our operational results and is more in line with industry practices.  
Our Q4 adjusted SG&A expense was $913.5 million. On a rate basis, this represented 38.6% of net sales compared to 36.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The single biggest driver of this increase was $19 million in COVID-related costs directly attributable to the unanticipated spike in case rates. We also incurred higher Q4 medical claims as a result of lower claims during the prior quarters. In addition, our short-term incentive compensation for both field and corporate team members was higher than prior year.  
Separately, we invested behind the launch of the #DieHardisBack campaign. We also incurred lease termination costs related to the ongoing optimization of our real estate footprint. We believe these expected investments in DieHard and lease optimization will result in top and bottom line improvements.  
Despite higher SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income increased 14.6% in Q4 to $171.8 million. On a rate basis, our adjusted OI margin expanded by 17 basis points. Finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.87, up 14% from prior year despite a $0.22 impact in the quarter from COVID expenses.  
For the full year, which includes an additional week versus 2019, we delivered record net sales of $10.1 billion, which increased 4.1%. The 53rd week added approximately $158 million to sales. Our adjusted gross profit increased 5% year-over-year, and adjusted gross profit margin expanded 38 basis points.  
Adjusted SG&A expense for full year 2020 increased 5.2% from 2019 results. This is primarily the result of COVID-related expenses discussed earlier as well as the 53rd week. We estimate the additional week resulted in a headwind of approximately 1.5% to our SG&A costs in the year.  
Our adjusted operating income increased 4.1% to $827.3 million. And our OI margin was 8.2%, flat compared to prior year. Adjusting for the $60 million in COVID costs, our adjusted operating income margin expanded 59 basis points. Our full year 2020 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $8.51, which is a new record for Advance and includes a headwind of $0.66 related to COVID costs. We estimate the impact of the 53rd week with a tailwind of approximately $20 million to our adjusted operating income and a benefit of approximately $0.23 to our reported adjusted EPS for the year.  
Our capital expenditures in Q4 were $75 million for a total investment of $268 million for the year and in line with our previously stated expectations. As we've noted, some of the critical transformational investments we expected to make in 2020 were paused for a portion of the year. As a result, we expect our capital spending will increase this year compared to 2020.  
Our free cash flow for the year was a record $702 million compared to $597 million in 2019. This increase was driven by several factors, including efforts we have made to improve working capital. We made meaningful progress on our AP ratio in 2020, delivering 300 basis points of improvement and ended the year at 80.2%. This, in addition to a $76 million tailwind associated with the CARES Act, resulted in a significant improvement in our cash conversion cycle.  
Our strong cash flow generation allowed us to continue our share repurchase activity in Q4. For the year, we repurchased more than $458 million of Advance stock. And including our quarterly cash dividend, we returned $515 million to shareholders.  
Our team remained disciplined throughout 2020 to ensure adequate liquidity, protect the P&L during the pandemic and strengthen our balance sheet. This resulted in a meaningful improvement in our cash position, resulting in $835 million in cash on hand at year-end. Further demonstrating our confidence in the long-term strength of our business and commitment to return cash to shareholders in a balanced approach, utilizing both share repurchases and dividends, our Board recently approved the continued payment of our quarterly cash dividend.  
Turning to 2021. While uncertainty remains in the current environment, we believe that we can continue to carry the momentum we have seen in the back half of 2020 forward. As the economy continues to recover and with our planned new store openings, we expect to deliver increased net sales and additional margin expansion. Importantly, we expect miles driven to continue improving throughout 2021, which should enable year-over-year growth in our Pro business.  
We're encouraged by trends through the first 4 weeks of 2021. With strength across our DIY omnichannel and Pro businesses, we delivered double-digit comparable sales growth to start the year. We recognize the importance of transparency. And based on what we know today, this morning, we introduced our 2021 outlook. Despite continued uncertainty, we're pleased to provide our 2021 guidance. Based on the assumptions we outlined in our earnings release, our 2021 guidance includes net sales in the range of $10.1 billion to $10.3 billion; comparable store sales growth of 1% to 3%; adjusted operating income margin rate of 8.7% to 8.9%, which includes margin expansion of 60 to 80 basis points as compared to the 2020 adjusted operating income margin, excluding the $20.1 million benefit from the 53rd week; income tax rate of 24% to 26%; capital expenditures of $275 million to $325 million; and a minimum of $600 million of free cash flow.  
Finally, as Tom mentioned, following several years of closing underperforming stores and focusing on the improvement of operations across our footprint, we're excited to begin actively growing our store base and expanding existing and new geographies. For the first time in 4 years, we're guiding to new store openings of 50 to 100 locations. I once again would like to thank the tremendous efforts of our team members in meeting the challenges of COVID-19 while still executing our strategic plan. We look forward to sharing more on those plans in the investor presentation we'll publish in April.

So we're going to talk more about that on April 20. 
I mean I think the biggest factor in what you described is the COVID-related costs that we still have embedded in our annual guide this year. And that remains an unknown at this point. We still have some uncertainty out there regarding COVID-related costs. And we saw that late in the year. It spiked significantly as infection rates across the country went up. And we remain very focused on accelerating margin expansion. Once that comes out, as we said, it's $60 million for the full year, that'll be a big number for us to expand our margins with."

And we do expect the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic to come back strong. It's obviously, once again, a function of how quickly the economy returns to those markets, how quickly people start to return back to work. But there is an expectation that those markets will outperform and that Pro will outperform DIY this year. So we feel we're very, very well positioned in that regard, and we're going to watch it very closely. We've looked at the full year, the lapse for each geography and each channel. And we feel very good about how we're positioned to take advantage of that resurgence in demand in the Mid-Atlantic, the Northeast and our Professional business."

And sort of within that guidance we just talked about, what are you assuming for gross margin and sort of the phasing of the benefits related to supply chain and some of the other initiatives?"

So as it relates to category management, for example, we saw improvements in both product costs as well as improvements in price. And then we once again leveraged supply chain as the initiatives around cross-banner replenishment are continuing to remove costs, and we're taking advantage of that. So in addition to shrink and the LIFO, as you just called out, the channel mix was also positive. Although I will tell you that, that was offset by product mix, which is related to categories such as brakes, wipers and lighting, similar to what we saw in the third quarter.  
Now looking forward into the guidance into '21, it's a lot of those same initiatives. And those are the reasons that gross margin is going to be the driver for our margin growth when we look at '21 compared to '20. So the strategic pricing, we've got it in place. We're starting to implement that. We're already starting to see early results. And similar to the category management, we're changing over into private label. And we're going to start to see the impact of that early on and then throughout the year. So those initiatives that are in place, where we're taking the actions now and we're going to see that benefit going into '21, and those are going to be the drivers that lead our gross margin."

So we've done a tremendous amount of work on this to try and understand what to expect for the year. Clearly, the first quarter will be very strong. We highlighted low double-digit growth quarter-to-date. And that's prior to the widespread shutdowns that happened late period 3 and into period 4. 
Period -- sorry, the second quarter, you'll recall the Professional business was still challenged, DIY surged. That, we're factoring in, et cetera. So think about looking at the 2-year numbers, I mean, that's what we're looking at closely. Obviously, the 2-year numbers to kind of factor out the volatility of last year. But even there, you've got to put some judgment against it. But we obviously expect to get off to a great start and build on the momentum.

So we'll continue to see that improvement throughout the year. SG&A, again, that's a little bit more tricky, just with the COVID costs that almost all of them are in SG&A. That one is a little bit more difficult to predict. Certainly, we saw a surge here late in the year and then early into '21. But as we said, we are modeling less COVID costs in '21 as compared to '20. When that happens remains to be seen. And then we will be lapping some difficult dollars in SG&A in the second and third quarter around payroll. 
So we had -- we were taking hours out. We were reducing time. We were closing early and we're going to be returning to normal ideally. And we'll have full store hours, which requires the store labor, requires the training, it requires the normal replenishment and stocking and all the other types of things that we had to pause in the second and third quarter.

I think Tom mentioned in the prepared remarks that the spread -- I forget if it was between DIFM and DIY or the spread between markets that were more impacted by miles driven was starting to narrow. My question is on geographies and some of the assumptions that are embedded in your 1% to 3% comp outlook. Can you talk about that mix? And I know, Tom, you mentioned you'll start to face easier compares in period 4 or 5. But if you see a complete narrowing across markets and you see miles driven recovers in some of those more impacted regions, I'm trying to understand the conservatism in that 1% to 3%, if we can see a comp that's even better than that range."

I mean that's the short answer. But there's no question that we believe the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, which are huge geographies for us, very important geographies for us, we believe will accelerate in the second quarter and then balance of year. 
The narrowing that we referenced, I mean, if you think back, the second quarter of last year, I think we called out roughly 2,000 basis points gap and then it narrowed to about 1,000. And it's continuing to narrow. So you're talking about meaningful differences in geographic performance, at least for us, and from everything we can see from syndicated data really for the entire industry. Pro versus DIY, you can look at the reported results of the major players and infer from that. So is there upside? Possibly. But it's February right now, there's still uncertainty out there. We're off to a terrific start. We've actually got a winter this year. I mean across the country, if you look and see what's going on, it's very different than it's been the last 2 years. So there are some things that would lead you to believe there could be upside there, but it's early in the year and we want to be thoughtful about the uncertainty that's there.

Fortunately, we have a loyalty platform, Speed Perks. We mine that data. We're trying to continue to learn from the new customers that are coming in. And we've sort of outlined a number of reasons that have driven this, everything from people looking for more efficient ways, inexpensive ways to repair their -- and maintain their vehicles, the fact that people have time on their hands, the mass transportation version that's going on there, people are not necessarily going to larger boxes. There's a number of factors that are out there. And the question is how sticky are those factors? And what we're trying to do is engage very closely with our customer base. What we know is that the new customers that have come in are a little bit younger than our traditional customers. They spend more time online. They're a little more affluent. We've got a pretty good idea of how to engage those customers, and personalization and leveraging first-party data is very important for us. So our goal is to drive share of wallet. Again, pretty fragmented industry, lots of opportunity for us out there. If you look at the broader DIY market, we're only roughly about $4 billion in sales in a market that's close to $60 billion. So we do see lots of upside for us on DIY yet, even though there was a surge last year and a pretty disruptive shift in consumer behavior."

Stimulus happened early in this year, so there was money that came into the market. From our vantage point, we see market share data, and we like our market share data in the first part of the year. We advertised DieHard very deliberately in the fourth quarter knowing that that's going to build into the early part of the year. And we're continuing to advertise DieHard this week. We had a pretty significant cold snap across the country, which should drive battery failure. So we're pretty confident that the DieHard advertising is resonating with our customers. It's bringing new customers into our stores. We know that. And that's going to help us drive market share and traffic beyond the first quarter.

National brands are very important to us. And we engage with our national brand suppliers routinely and we're working very collaboratively with them to help build their brands. So it's a balanced approach. Now there are some categories where we saw an opportunity for owned brand penetration. Clearly, engine management was one of them. Suspension and ride control is another area of focus for us. And we're not going to give you the exact numbers, but there is a significant difference in the margin profile of those categories from a branded perspective versus owned brand. And we continue to work with the suppliers. We'd obviously like to continue to sell the national brands. But where it's an obvious economic gap for us, potentially due to pricing across other channels, we're going to make those decisions. It's a gradual migration over time. This is not a light switch. You've got to gradually make these changes. But I think our merchandising team is doing an excellent job transitioning where we are making those changes across categories. And it's driving not just margin expansion, but unit growth because our customers voting with their clicks, and they're voting for Carquest. They love the Carquest brand. It's a great brand.

We jumped on that. As you'll remember, we launched Advance Same Day suite of fulfillment services. We offered curbside pickup. We offered Same Day delivery. And that enabled a surge in our e-commerce business in that time frame. The good news is, as time went on, those customers started to migrate into our stores. And we've been increasing -- our store traffic has been increasing since that point through the year. The online order piece is still a substantial part of our business, but it is largely pickup in store.

We did our best, David, to reach out to whatever industry sources we could to get a sense for this. And I'll caveat all of this with it's -- this is an estimate at this point, and there is a lot of uncertainty out there. But if you look at what happened last year, the year-to-date numbers at the kind of October, November time frame, which is based on the sources we have, are the most relevant or most accurate numbers that we can get. They would show the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic down the most, as I said, like high double digits in that case. And the Southeast and Southwest are down 13%, something like that. And then the aggregate number is kind of in between. 
So you start to lap that as you get into April, May, and we do believe that it edges back up. In other words, if you say the year is down double digits, it's not going to get back to the level it was in 2019, but it's going to be greater than it was in 2020. That's the fundamental assumption. How much comes back? We've got an estimate in there. We're not going to put that out there, but it is improvement over 2020 as people gradually start to return to work. We look at the return-to-office metrics, which are readily available out there, and you can see that people are gradually returning to office. Now many people are talking about hybrid approaches. People are talking about remote work, but there are more people coming back to the office now than there were at the height of the pandemic.

We're assuming wage inflation anywhere from 2% to 5%. So we're going to continue to increase wages this year with or without a federal minimum wage. 
So the big factor, it really depends on a couple of things. First, obviously, it has to pass and then how that looks in terms of how it graduates over time. Is it $1 a year? What is it going to be to get to $15? So there's a number of variables there. It's clearly -- it's not in our guidance, but we're thinking about it and we're continuing to make investments.

So this is something that we've got to continue doing. Now over time, we do expect this to go away. We hope it goes to 0. It's just a question of when."

One more, and I hate to ask a bigger picture question at 9:10, but hopefully, it's not too long of an answer. But it does seem perhaps that this whole industry will shift a little bit more towards DIY because some of those trends you talked about, people being averse to public transportation. A lot of people think those will be with us for a while even when a vaccine rolls out. On the other hand, a lot of people will do hybrid or work from home for those higher end, those DIFM customers might just drive less permanently or at least for a number of years. So have you thought about that? And how does that impact any of your ongoing strategies or anything like that if the whole world does go a little bit more towards DIY versus DIFM versus pre COVID?"

So somewhere between what we saw last year and what we saw in 2019 is the answer to the question. But the reason why we're planning on opening 50 to 100 stores is because of the reasons I said earlier, and we do believe DIY is going to have some legs in the near term for sure, and this is an opportunity for us. We've got DieHard, which is -- participates in the largest category for DIY. We're advertising this brand, so we're going to continue to drive it. And DIY is a great business. It's a very profitable business. It's a margin-accretive business and one that we're going to continue to stay focused on. 
Well, thanks again for joining us this morning. We're gaining a lot of confidence regarding our initiatives. Obviously, we're respecting the economic and operational landscape that we're competing in. And as increasing COVID-19 vaccinations happen throughout the year, we expect the stability to continue to improve. We're looking for continued recovery for critical factors such as miles driven and further increases in the average age of the car part. Operationally, we've narrowed and sharpened our focus on the most important initiatives to accelerate margin expansion and deliver increased value for our customers and for our shareholders. And we look forward to publishing our third sustainability and social responsibility report next month and sharing additional details on our strategic efforts at our upcoming investor event on April 20.

First, I'd like to thank our independent partners and team members all over the world for their passion and commitment to serve our customers throughout the pandemic. We also hope that you and your families are healthy and safe. 
The health and safety of our team members and customers has been a top priority over the past year. As you saw earlier this morning, our final Q1 financial performance exceeded the estimated results we provided on April 20. 
With strength across all channels, we delivered comparable store sales growth of 24.7% and margin expansion of 478 basis points versus the prior year. On a 2-year stack, our comp sales growth was 15.4%. Adjusted diluted EPS of $3.34 represented an all-time quarterly high for AAP and improved more than 230% compared to Q1 2020. 
Free cash flow of $259 million was up significantly versus the prior year. And we returned over $203 million to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and our quarterly cash dividend. 
In addition, we recently announced an updated capital allocation framework, targeting top quartile total shareholder return, highlighted by operating income growth, share repurchases and an increase in our dividend. This further reinforces our confidence in future cash generation and our commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders. 
As outlined in April, we're building an ownership culture as well as a differentiated operating model at Advance. Over the past few years, we've made substantial investments in our brands, our digital and physical assets and our team. These investments, along with external factors, enabled us to post a strong start to 2021. Clearly, the federal stimulus package, along with our first real winter weather in 3 years, was a benefit to our industry. 
From a category perspective, net sales growth was led by batteries, appearance chemicals and wipers. Geographically, all 8 regions posted over 20% growth. Importantly, over the past year, the Northeast, our largest region, had been below our overall reported growth rate and well below that of our top-performing regions. In Q1, the gap narrowed. And in recent weeks, the Northeast has been leading our growth. This was in line with our expectations as mobility is increasing in large urban markets in the Northeast, which were disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 last year. 
Both DIY omnichannel and Professional performed well, delivering double-digit comp sales growth in the quarter. We saw strong increases versus year ago, with a double-digit increase in transactions and high single-digit increases in dollars per transaction in both channels. 
In terms of cadence, DIY led the way early in Q1. As the country began to reopen later in the quarter, Professional came on strong, resulting in Pro growth of over 20% in Q1, with continued momentum into Q2. The changes in channel performance highlights the importance of flexibility in our operating model as we adapt to rapid shifts in consumer behavior relative to 2020. 
Throughout AAP, our merchant, supply chain and store operations teams have been extremely agile in adjusting to this evolving environment to ensure we take care of our customers. 
Within the Pro sales channel, our overarching focus remains to get the right part in the right place at the right time. This enables us to compete on availability, customer service and speed of fulfillment, which are the primary drivers of choice for Pro garages. To achieve these goals, we continue to strengthen our value proposition through improved availability as well as our advanced Pro catalog featuring tools like MotoLogic and delivery estimates. 
As vaccinations roll out across the country, mobility is increasing across all income strata. As discussed in April, this is very good for AAP as our diverse set of assets within Pro is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this trend. 
Specifically, Worldpac led our professional growth in the quarter. With a customer base that serves higher-end installers and more premium vehicles, Worldpac gained momentum throughout Q1. This is because middle to high-income motorists are becoming increasingly mobile. And in some cases, they are now returning to a daily commuting. Stated simply, they're driving more than they did a year ago. 
Secondly, we're seeing benefits from the owned brand product offering expansion with the integration of Autopart International. 
Further, we believe our independent Carquest stores are also well positioned. They're leveraging our enterprise assortment and have excellent relationships with customers. These relationships have been strengthened over the past year given the support we provided to both independents and our Pro customers during a difficult time. 
We continue to grow our independent store base through a combination of greenfield locations and the conversion of existing independent locations. Today, we're extremely excited to announce that we're adding 29 new independent locations to the Pacific Northwest to the Carquest family, the single largest conversion in our history. Baxter Auto Parts announced that they will bring over 80 years of automotive aftermarket experience and strong customer relationships to the Carquest banner. This is a testament to the strength of the Carquest independent program, including product availability, differentiated brands, technology platforms and robust marketing plan. 
We also grew our TechNet program across all Pro channels. TechNet enables independent service shops to create their own national network. We now have over 13,000 North American members. And we'll continue to leverage TechNet to differentiate our Pro offering and build loyalty. 
In summary, we expect that as our Pro installers recover, our industry-leading assortment, customized Pro solutions and dedicated Pro banners will enable us to drive market share gains in a growing segment throughout the balance of the year. 
Meanwhile, our DIY Omnichannel business led our growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Stepping back, and as a reminder, there was a significant increase in DIY penetration across the industry beginning in Q2 2020. According to syndicated data, an estimated 4 million new DIY buyers were added. Spend per buyer for 2020 grew close to 9%, led by online spend per buyer. DIY growth was led by project, recreation and more discretionary categories as people worked on their vehicles or even learned how to work on their vehicles. These trends generally continued through Q1. And the industry is now beginning to lap the significant increase from prior year in Q2. 
From an Advance standpoint, we grew share of wallet and overall market share in Q1, led by DieHard batteries. DieHard continues to have strong momentum, and our advertising is clearly resonating with customers. We plan to continue to invest behind this powerful brand in 2021 to further build awareness and association with Advance. 
Our loyalty program remains focused on attracting, retaining and graduating speed for its members. Our loyalty program enables us to provide personalized offers and increased share of wallet as we leverage our customer data platform. In Q1, this helped drive growth in our VIP members by approximately 14% and our Elite members by 30%. 
Consistent with broader retail, during Q1, we began to see a shift back to store sales from e-commerce given the outsized growth of the online business during the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Our investments in digital and e-commerce have been another differentiator for our DIY business. We continue to strengthen our online experience on desktop, mobile, and with our app, which recently crossed nearly 1.3 million downloads. 
The integration of our digital and physical assets is communicated through our advanced same-day suite of services. This enables DIYers to find the right part from our industry-leading assortment, order it online, and either pick it up in one of our stores within 30 minutes or have it delivered in 3 hours or less. 
Finally, we're very excited about our footprint expansion and new store opening plans for the year. We're targeting between 100 to 150 new stores in 2021. This includes the Pep Boys leases we're executing in California. The opening of the California locations will ramp up during the back half of the year and finish in 2022. 
Now I'd like to transition to the unique opportunity we have to significantly expand our margins. 
As we outlined in our strategic update, there are 4 broad initiatives: leveraging category management; streamlining our supply chain; improving sales and profit per store; and reducing corporate SG&A. 
Our largest margin expansion initiative is leveraging category management to drive gross margin improvement. This involves 3 components: material cost optimization, own brand expansion and strategic pricing. 
Material cost optimization and strategic sourcing has been an ongoing effort for us and will continue to be a focus. Given the current inflationary environment, we are leveraging these capabilities to push back on cost increases to keep our price to the customer low. We'll continue to work collaboratively with our supplier partners on managing input costs. 
Own brand expansion as a percent of our mix is an important contributor to margin rate improvement. However, growing our DieHard and Carquest brand is not just about margin. It's also about differentiation. Our merchant team is building out capabilities and sourcing to develop high-quality products, leveraging our strong supplier relationships. 2 recent examples include our DieHard robust enhanced flooded batteries and our Carquest hub assemblies. Once equipped with a differentiated product, our marketing team is building the awareness and the reputation of our own brands, as evidenced by our DieHard is Back advertising campaign. 
Finally, we supplement innovative quality parts and breakthrough marketing with an improved online experience and extensive team member training. This includes enhanced part, product and brand training to ensure our store team members are well positioned to provide our customers with trusted advice and an excellent in-store experience. 
So we're not only on track with margin expansion behind owned brands, we're also leveraging these brands to enhance differentiation and improve store traffic. Our extensive research around customer journeys highlights the role that brands play in customer purchase decisions. When a customer's car won't start, we want them to think of DieHard first, such that this becomes a reason that they come to Advance. This is why collaborating with our supplier partners is so important to ensure high quality for our own brands. We're confident as we continue to invest in product quality, building our brands and training our team members to drive own brands as a percent of mix, we will further deliver growth across AAP. 
The final component of our category management initiatives is strategic pricing. By investing in new tools, we're now able to competitively price on a market-by-market basis, using detailed analytics to improve rate. We're also realizing success in reducing discounts online through a rapid test-and-learn approach, which is driving significant margin expansion in key categories. 
In total, our category management initiatives are currently on track to deliver up to 200 basis points of margin expansion through 2023. 
As we look beyond 2023, we plan to continue building out customer data and personalization platforms to further enhance the customer experience and expand margins. 
Staying with gross margin, we once again leveraged supply chain in Q1 versus both 2020 and 2019. Despite the current environment, We remain focused on executing our primary margin expansion initiatives, while working to mitigate the impact of global supply chain challenges. We expect to complete our warehouse management system implementation in 2022, with the majority of our largest buildings converted this year. 
In conjunction with WMS, we're also rolling out our labor management system, which allows us to implement common standard operating procedures across our DC network. This will also enable us to incentivize hourly team members based on their performance. 
In terms of cross-banner replenishment or CBR, we've converted over 70% of stores to date and expect to complete the remaining stores we originally planned by the end of Q3. CBR significantly reduces our miles driven, which is even more important today given rising fuel and labor costs. More importantly, CBR will complete the integration of the Advance and Carquest supply chain and enable us to service our approximately 4,800 corporate Advance stores and 1,300 independent Carquest stores from a single supply chain. 
We also continue to integrate the dedicated professional supply chain within Worldpac and Autopart International. In the quarter, we converted another 5 AI stores to the Worldpac system, and are on track to complete this integration by the end of Q1 2022. 
In April, we discussed 2 additional supply chain initiatives, building on what will soon be a more streamlined supply chain network. This includes tiering our supply chain and transforming in-market delivery and customer fulfillment. Our tiered supply chain pools the slowest moving SKUs into 4 strategically located regional DCs. This will allow us to make room for faster-moving SKUs and ultimately improve the availability of our higher turnover products. Our second new initiative is transforming in-market delivery and customer fulfillment to improve service and productivity. The new delivery management system will select for multiple modes of transportation to move and deliver parts at lower costs. Both of these initiatives are in their early stages. And we are targeting completion of these in 2023 and 2024, respectively. 
In terms of SG&A improvements, our store operations team is executing initiatives to increase sales and profit per store. We've now increased sales per store for 3 straight years. And we're on track to get to our target of 1.8 million average sales per store by 2023. 
In Q1, with strong top line growth and disciplined execution, we leveraged store payroll versus both 2019 and 2020. We've also made improvements in scheduling and task management to drive efficiency, which helps with our customer experience, as it enables us to schedule our most tenured and knowledgeable team members who may need them most. We continue to invest in our store team members in terms of training, technology and in compensation, including our unique Fuel the Frontline stock ownership program. We believe these investments have enabled us to attract the very best parts people in the business and are enabling continued improvement in primary execution metrics, like Net Promoter Score, units per transaction, and ultimately, sales and profit per store. 
Finally, we took steps to reduce corporate and other SG&A costs in the quarter. This includes 3 broad territories: integration, safety and new ways of working. 
In terms of integration, our Finance ERP is near completion, and we continue to build proficiency in our global capability center at Hyderabad, India. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to recognize our India team who stood up an entirely new operation literally in the middle of a global pandemic last year. We've been working hard to support them as COVID-19 infection rates have risen in India over the past few weeks. 
The GCC team, including IT, finance and HR team members today has certainly enabled us to reduce costs, both in terms of CapEx and OpEx. In addition, the IT team brings new skills in the area of software engineering, data analytics and artificial intelligence. These critical capabilities will help enable the successful implementation of our many tech initiatives. 
Secondly, our safety performance continues as field leaders across Advance hold their teams accountable as we build a safety culture. We delivered a 9% reduction in our total recordable injury rate compared to the previous year and reduced our lost time injury rate 2%. By focusing on people, behavior and continuous improvement, we're reducing claims and overall costs. 
Third, we recently completed a thorough review on the ways we work in our corporate offices and incorporated key learnings from working remotely for over a year. The objective was to ensure our corporate team is focused on our highest value priorities while eliminating less productive work. From this work, we announced a restructure of our corporate functions and the reduction of our corporate office footprint. This will result in savings of approximately $30 million in SG&A, which will be realized over the next 12 months. We also believe this streamlined approach will be more effective to supporting our field and supply chain teams. 
While we're pleased with our Q1 performance, we're confident that there is so much more opportunity ahead. To fully realize our potential, we plan to continue to invest in our brands, the customer experience, our team members and market expansion to drive top line growth above market. Our entire team also remains focused on the execution of our margin expansion initiatives. We're energized and focused on building on the momentum we saw in Q1 to execute our long-term strategy in the months to come. 
Now let me pass it over to Jeff, who will go into more details on our financial results."

And thanks to everyone joining us today, especially our team members who continue to work tirelessly, which has contributed to the results that we're reporting today. 
In Q1, our net sales increased 23.4% to $3.3 billion. Adjusted gross profit margin expanded 91 basis points to 44.8% as a result of improvement throughout gross margin, including supply chain, net pricing, channel mix and material cost optimization. These improvements were slightly offset by unfavorable inventory-related costs, product mix and headwinds associated with shrink and defectives. 
Our Q1 adjusted SG&A expense was $1.2 billion. On a rate basis, this represented 35.8% of net sales, which improved 387 basis points compared to one year ago. The improvement was driven by sales leverage in both payroll and rent as well as lower claim-related expenses from the company's emphasis on safety. 
We discussed our labor management system previously, but we really saw the benefit this quarter as we staffed our stores based on customer needs, utilizing nights, weekends, and the improved mix of full and part-time schedules. In addition, our ongoing focus on team member safety will always remain one of our highest priorities. 
The savings were partially offset by an increase in field bonus costs related to our improved performance. In addition, as Tom outlined earlier, we invested in marketing during Q1, primarily associated with DieHard. This [ lap ] marketing cuts the previous year, which were made at the onset of the pandemic. We also saw an increase in third-party and service contracts related to our transformational plans, primarily within IT. 
Related to the increased COVID-19 cases we saw late in 2020 and early 2021, we incurred approximately $16 million in COVID-19 costs during the quarter, which was flat to the prior year. While the future impact of COVID-19 remains unknown, we expect these costs to subside throughout the year, assuming infection rates continue to decline. 
Our adjusted operating income increased from $113 million last year to $299 million. On a rate basis, our adjusted OI margin expanded by 478 basis points to 9%. Finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.34, up from $1 a year ago. 
Our free cash flow for the quarter was $259 million, an increase of $330 million compared to last year. The improvement was primarily driven by year-over-year operating income growth as well as improvements we achieved from working capital initiatives, including higher utilization of our supply chain financing facilities that we began to see during the pandemic last year. 
Our AP ratio improved by nearly 1,000 basis points to 84%, the highest we've achieved since the GPI acquisition. A portion of the improvement is attributable to the actions we took during the pandemic and the continued partnerships we have with our suppliers. 
In the quarter, we spent $71 million in capital expenditures versus $83 million in the prior year quarter. We expect to be within our guidance for capital expenditures as we continue to invest in our transformation initiatives. 
During Q1, we returned more than $200 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of 1.1 million shares and our quarterly cash dividend. We expect to be within our 2021 share repurchase guidance of $300 million to $500 million. 
Additionally, as you saw during our investor presentation in April, our Board approved our quarterly shareholder dividend of $1, payable on July 2. 
As outlined in our press release this morning, we've seen continued momentum in the first 4 weeks of Q2, with our 2-year comparable store sales growth rate in line with the 2-year stack we reported in Q1. Miles driven are beginning to grow for the first time in over a year. And historically, this has been an overall positive for our industry. In addition, our Professional business is accelerating, and we expect Pro to outperform DIY for the balance of the year. For these reasons, we're raising our comp sales guidance to up 4% to 6%. 
We're also cognizant of several macroeconomic factors. This includes inflationary costs in commodities, transportation and wages, along with currency headwinds. As a reminder, our industry has historically been very rational and successful in passing on inflationary costs in the form of price, and that is our intention this year as well. Also, Our Pro business carried a lower margin rate than DIY, which may partially offset the gains we expect to see in sales. As a result of our top line strength and current cost assumptions, we're updating our adjusted OI margin range to be between 9% and 9.2%. Our guide for comp sales is now up 3 full points. And our adjusted OI margin rate is now up 30 basis points compared to our initial guidance provided in February. 
We remain committed to delivering against the strategy we laid out in April and are confident in our ability to execute our long-term strategic plans to deliver strong and sustainable total shareholder return.

And as we outlined in the prepared remarks, it was really early in the quarter, a continuation of what we've seen all of last year, strong performance from DIY, Pro lagging. And then obviously, as we got towards the end of the quarter, that started to change. And this is beginning to lap the unusual events of last year. Clearly, April and May was the low point for Professional sales last year when the pandemic hit and work remote orders were put in place, and you really saw a difficult environment for the installer community. And I'm really proud of what we did at that point. I mean we stayed with it. We supported our Pro installers. We didn't have anybody furloughed or anything like that. People are out on the street, helping them out. And that's really helped us through the year last year and into this year. And so now as we start to lap those results, Pro is significantly outperforming DIY, and we expect that to continue for the balance of this year. So we're very excited about that, obviously, given that 60% of our business is Pro. 
And then in terms of the cadence, we're obviously early on in the year. We know there was a huge surge on DIY in 2020. We talked about that throughout the year last year. There's some trends that -- some of which could be stickier than we initially thought when we planned the year. People at time on their hands. There's the stimulus impact last year. There was a shift from big box. How is it all going to unfold for the balance of the year is difficult to say.

If you contrast that to last year or even 2019, it's generally inventory build. We're building inventory in the first quarter as we prepare for the spring selling season. From 2020, inventory was up over $90 million. And if you want to go back to 2019, it's up over $70 million. Now the good news, Chris, is that translates into very favorable free cash flow, which you saw in terms of the good operating cash, over 300 -- almost $330 million in operating cash, $259 million of free cash flow. So realizing that is very favorable for our cash balance. 
In terms of pricing, we took a number of pricing actions during the end of last year. Beginning of this year, we're seeing it flow through. We haven't seen any resistance there from a pricing standpoint. So we feel really good about that. We know there's some inflationary factors that are coming, and we're planning to address those. But for the quarter, our pricing actions took hold, and we were really pleased with the results."

So we're obviously making some bets on inventory to make sure that we're able to delight the customer when they need us. 
In terms of the performance in the back half, yes, I mean we are a professional organization. With 60% of our business in there, we definitely would see us continuing to benefit from that trend in the back half of the year overall. Geographically, absolutely, we called out in our remarks that the Northeast was leading the country quarter-to-date. We haven't seen that in over a year. So those are 2 big factors that help us out. And obviously, we're excited about both of those trends. We've got multiple banners on the Professional side that are all cranking right now. Our installers are covered up. We've got cars waiting out there to be repaired. People are getting back on the road. Miles driven are recovering. So all of those things are very positive. And we fully contemplated the impact on gross margin. We obviously recognize that the Pro margins are lower than that of DIY, and that's fully contemplated in the guide. So we'll continue to focus on expanding our margins with the initiatives we outlined in April."

The second and third is exactly what you just mentioned, Simeon, which is the clarity we have on Q1 in terms of the beat. Beat coming in at 9 versus the 8.5% to 8.7 that's modeled in. And then the upside that we're seeing early on in Q2, we've modeled some of that. 
And then the last one that I would throw in there is our assessment around inflation. We're seeing inflation in a number of different categories. And so while that would benefit the top line in the form of higher comps, we wouldn't see that flow through as much as we generally we and the industry price to maintain margin rate. 
So those are the 4 things that we contemplated that were, quite frankly, different 45 days ago and why we thought it was prudent to update guidance now."

My question is the dependence on sales to drive margin is something we've talked about in the past. you feel better? I don't think you'd be satisfied if sales aren't growing, and I think that's the ultimate essence of transforming the business. But can you talk about how dependent your margin goals are on sales? Is there some portion of margin that you think this business can achieve without seeing consistent sales growth? And again, I'm not saying that's the goal, but curious if you can separate the 2."

Well, the 4 territories that we talked about, Simeon, really the one that is most sales dependent is obviously sales and profit per store. There is a leverage component to that in our outlook. I mean we talked about 240 to 440 basis points of margin expansion. And the range of revenue growth that was contemplated was 3 on the low end and 6 on the high end, if you remember. So Obviously, the one that swings the most is that particular one. Now there are pure cost-out initiatives in there. Without question, return, shrink effectives, we've got ways of improving profit per store without sales. But that is the one that has a dependency there. 
Supply chain, the vast majority of the supply chain initiatives are not sales dependent. These are just pure productivity opportunities. You're familiar with the cross-banner and health management system implementation, but also the 2 new ones that Reuben outlined in the April presentation. Neither of those are sales dependent. Those are just improving our current efficiency and how we get product from distribution centers to the stores and how we move product in market. 
Category management is a pure rate play. There is really no sales dependency on category management. And then, obviously, the SG&A moves in the ERP implementation, the new ways of working, those are all -- none of those are sales dependent. So the majority of the initiatives we have are not sales dependent. Obviously, the more sales we have, the more we get not just leverage on those that are contemplated in the initial low end of the guide, the $220 million. But we get leverage on other fixed costs, which takes us up to the $440 million. Hope that helps."

You think about bringing the work we've done on availability, making sure that our industry-leading assortment of parts is available to people in Portland just like it is in Boston. 
Bringing DieHard to the West Coast is a huge opportunity for us. Our team was on the ground. The week we announced the Pep Boys leasing arrangement. And the first thing people talked about in the stores when we went out there was DieHard. They were very excited to hear that they'd be selling DieHard batteries. All the digital investments that we've made in our online platform, whether that's the B2B website that Bob Cushing leads with Advance Pro, the B2C website that Jason leads, and our app, we bring that to these markets. We're able to supplement our Pro customers who are out there today, our large Professional customers that we sell to nationally, but cannot sell to in those geographies because we don't have the presence to do so. So we're able to integrate the digital and physical asset piece. So we're very excited about the announcement with Baxter. They're a terrific organization. They've got a tremendous track record. And they're very excited about converting to the Carquest banner here soon. 
And then in terms of Southern California, as we -- as you heard, we have 109 locations. We're going to start converting those soon, and we expect to complete that in 2022. 
So that's really a quick rundown of what we're doing out there. I got to tell you, our team is so excited about being able to open new stores after a couple of years where we were closing them. And clearly, that's something that brings in new energy to the organization overall."

I mean, better than historical, obviously, but nothing compared to batteries where intermittent driving causes failure. So we expect Pro to outperform, I think.

As you look at the data, as you understand your consumer, is there a point at which the consumer sort of say, pushes back, and the ability of advance to pass these costs along is no longer as significant or no longer is, I guess, relevant? 
And then the second question I have, with regard to the updated outlook here. And clearly, it's extraordinarily fluid, a lot of factors. But as you think about this, what could be the bigger surprise factors to the upside or downside as far as the end of the year in the guidance, and the results are different than what you expected? Where would that variance, you think, likely come from?"

As an example, my car won't start as compared to my brakes or squeaking as compared to, I would like to accessorize my car or something like that. There's obviously different elements there of whether or not somebody is going to defer anything. The reality is on failure-related items, it's unlikely that it's going to have a big impact. It certainly hasn't had a big impact historically. And as long as we're competitive, we'll continue to see growth there. There may be some things that end up getting deferred based on the job type. But in general, this industry has been incredibly resilient. being able to pass on pricing, and I think that's what you're going to continue to see. 
Your second question was on the outlook. I think the short answer is we've obviously contemplated some level of pricing in the outlook. We've also contemplated how much of that's going to flow through all of the variables there. If the pricing flows through what we've guided, we'll obviously be right there in the guide. If it's better than that, we'll be better. That's really the answer. It's -- that's probably the biggest variable that's out there. All the rest of the stuff is fully within our control.

We think we've got tremendous runway. We're still transacting in the mid-30s range. And best-in-class would say that number could be dramatically higher than that. There are some retailers that are north of 80%.

Obviously, we do have discounts in there, but we manage that holistically. We manage that across the broader portfolio. And as people migrate up to these higher levels, that's fully contemplated in what discounts we use and how we offer value to those customers. So we won't see any kind of degradation on gross margin as we migrate people to up to these higher tiers. What we will see is higher share of wallet, which is what the aspiration is so that we can move from like in the case of VIPs, you're significantly underpenetrated with your most loyal customers. So you want to increase that share of wallet significantly. And that first-party data that we get from them enables us to get much more relevant. We know their vehicle.

And we have algorithms that help us determine how we're going to price what category and with geography and those kinds of things. 
Marketing is an investment. I mean marketing is an investment in driving margin expansion. When we invest behind a DieHard marketing campaign as we did last fall and in the first quarter, the intention there is to build loyalty, to build equity in the DieHard brand, to build awareness of the fact that DieHard is available at Advanced Auto Parts. And when we do that, what we find is we actually are able to reduce our promotional discounting and build the strength of that brand because it's trusted by the customer. So they're very different. And one of them is relatively easy to replicate. The other one is more difficult to replicate. And that -- we'll invest in marketing when we get a return that expands margins. That's the focus of our marketing dollars."

And at the time, if you think back to the second quarter, a lot of companies took some pretty drastic actions with their workforce and how they approach the pandemic and we stayed with it. We stayed with it. We had people on the street, as I mentioned earlier. We had our training programs. Our people put on a mask every single day and went out there and served our customers.

And they play a key role in our assortment and our availability. We have the largest number of stock parts in market of anyone in the industry. Terrific relationships with our national brand partners, terrific relationships with the OE suppliers that we have out there. So that gives us a competitive advantage. And we are going to continue to offer those brands where it makes sense for our business. This is about choice, not necessarily about an either/or. It's a bit of an and. 
So that said, where we have a category where we can bring the Carquest trademark into that category, offer it to our customers, with very, very high quality, and I want to really emphasize that. Our Carquest parts are OE quality. It's got a tremendous reputation. The Carquest brand has been around for a very long time. The professional installers love the Carquest brand. And our merchant team goes out and works very closely with our suppliers to make sure when we put the Carquest name on that box, it's going to be OE quality. So we offer that. If the customer chooses on the lookup that they want Carquest, they choose Carquest. Great. If they choose the national brand, they choose the national brand. Now having said that, as we brought the strength to some of these categories with Carquest, we are seeing our customers choose Carquest, which back to your initial question, we are roughly -- we think we're about 10 points underpenetrated versus our potential. And while we won't get there in the next 3 years, 2023 is obviously the strategic plan time line we outlined in April. It's a pretty significant number, in the 200 basis points of margin expansion we expect from category management. So that's fully contemplated. And as we roll out all we'll be in great shape to capture that margin opportunity."

As you go into SG&A, I mean we're going to execute the initiatives we have set. So we've already done the restructure. And I think the restructure, just to be clear, it wasn't just a cost play. We've been able to really organize our corporate team around the highest-value priorities We streamlined and simplified the work. We've given more responsibility to the top people in this company. And yes, we saved what we outlined in the April meeting, about $30 million, which we'll realize over the next 2 months. So that's a AAA bond. We'll get that. There are some offsets though inside of SG&A this year, as you know, that we're -- that will minimize that benefit, I guess, that we're getting out of SG&A. But that's a quick run through.

First, I'd like to thank our independent partners and Team Members all over the world for their passion and commitment to serve our customers throughout the pandemic. We also hope that you and your families are healthy and safe. The health and safety of our Team Members and customers has been a top priority over the past year. 
As you saw earlier this morning, our final Q1 financial performance exceeded the estimated results we provided on April 20. With strength across all channels, we delivered comparable store sales growth of 24.7% and margin expansion of 478 basis points versus the prior year. On a 2-year stack, our comp sales growth was 15.4%. Adjusted diluted EPS of $3.34 represented an all-time quarterly high for AAP and improved more than 230% compared to Q1 2020.
Free cash flow of $259 million was up significantly versus the prior year. And we returned over $203 million to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and our quarterly cash dividend. 
In addition, we recently announced an updated capital allocation framework, targeting top-quartile total shareholder return, highlighted by operating income growth, share repurchases and an increase in our dividend. This further reinforces our confidence in future cash generation and our commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders.
As outlined in April, we're building an ownership culture as well as a differentiated operating model at Advance. Over the past few years, we've made substantial investments in our brands, our digital and physical assets and our team. These investments, along with external factors, enabled us to post a strong start to 2021. Clearly, the federal stimulus package, along with our first real winter weather in 3 years, was a benefit to our industry.
From a category perspective, net sales growth was led by batteries, appearance chemicals and wipers. Geographically, all 8 regions posted over 20% growth. Importantly, over the past year, the Northeast, our largest region, had been below our overall reported growth rate and well below that of our top-performing regions. In Q1, the gap narrowed. And in recent weeks, the Northeast has been leading our growth. This was in line with our expectations as mobility is increasing in large urban markets in the Northeast, which were disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 last year.
Both DIY omnichannel and professional performed well, delivering double-digit comp sales growth in the quarter. We saw strong increases versus year ago, with a double-digit increase in transactions and high single-digit increases in dollars per transaction in both channels.
In terms of cadence, DIY led the way early in Q1. As the country began to reopen later in the quarter, professional came on strong, resulting in pro growth of over 20% in Q1, with continued momentum into Q2. The changes in channel performance highlights the importance of flexibility in our operating model as we adapt to rapid shifts in consumer behavior relative to 2020. 
Throughout AAP, our merchant, supply chain and store operations teams have been extremely agile in adjusting to this evolving environment to ensure we take care of our customers.Within the pro sales channel, our overarching focus remains to get the right part in the right place at the right time. This enables us to compete on availability, customer service and speed of fulfillment, which are the primary drivers of choice for pro garages. To achieve these goals, we continue to strengthen our value proposition through improved availability as well as our Advance Pro catalog, featuring tools like MotoLogic and delivery estimates.
As vaccinations roll out across the country, mobility is increasing across all income strata. As discussed in April, this is very good for AAP as our diverse set of assets within pro is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this trend. 
Specifically, Worldpac led our professional growth in the quarter. With a customer base that serves higher-end installers and more premium vehicles, Worldpac gained momentum throughout Q1. This is because middle to high-income motorists are becoming increasingly mobile. And in some cases, they are now returning to daily commuting. Stated simply, they're driving more than they did a year ago.
Secondly, we're seeing benefits from the owned brand product offering expansion with the integration of Autopart International. Further, we believe our independent Carquest stores are also well positioned. They're leveraging our enterprise assortment and have excellent relationships with customers. These relationships have been strengthened over the past year given the support we provided to both independent and our pro customers during a difficult time. 
We continue to grow our independent store base through a combination of greenfield locations and the conversion of existing independent locations. Today, we're extremely excited to announce that we're adding 29 new independent locations to the Pacific Northwest to the Carquest family, the single largest conversion in our history. Baxter Auto Parts announced that they will bring over 80 years of automotive aftermarket experience and strong customer relationships to the Carquest banner. This is a testament to the strength of the Carquest independent program, including product availability, differentiated brands, technology platforms and robust marketing plans. 
We also grew our TechNet program across all pro channels. TechNet enables independent service shops to create their own national network. We now have over 13,000 North American members, and we'll continue to leverage TechNet to differentiate our pro offering and build loyalty. In summary, we expect that as our pro installers recover, our industry-leading assortment, customized pro solutions and dedicated pro banners will enable us to drive market share gains in a growing segment throughout the balance of the year.
Meanwhile, our DIY omnichannel business led our growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Stepping back and as a reminder, there was a significant increase in DIY penetration across the industry beginning in Q2 2020. According to syndicated data, an estimated 4 million new DIY buyers were added. Spend per buyer for 2020 grew close to 9%, led by online spend per buyer. DIY growth was led by project, recreation and more discretionary categories as people worked on their vehicles or even learned how to work on their vehicles. These trends generally continued through Q1, and the industry is now beginning to lap the significant increase from prior year in Q2. 
From an Advance standpoint, we grew share of wallet and overall market share in Q1, led by DieHard batteries. DieHard continues to have strong momentum, and our advertising is clearly resonating with customers. We plan to continue to invest behind this powerful brand in 2021 to further build awareness and association with Advance.
Our loyalty program remains focused on attracting, retaining and graduating Speed Perks members. Our loyalty program enables us to provide personalized offers and increased share of wallet as we leverage our customer data platform. In Q1, this helped drive growth in our VIP members by approximately 14% and our Elite members by 30%.
Consistent with broader retail, during Q1, we began to see a shift back to store sales from e-commerce given the outsized growth of the online business during the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Our investments in digital and e-commerce have been another differentiator for our DIY business. We continue to strengthen our online experience on desktop, mobile, and with our app, which recently crossed nearly 1.3 million downloads. 
The integration of our digital and physical assets is communicated through our Advance Same Day suite of services. This enables DIYers to find the right part from our industry-leading assortment, order it online, and either pick it up in one of our stores within 30 minutes or have it delivered in 3 hours or less. 
Finally, we're very excited about our footprint expansion and new store opening plans for the year. We're targeting between 100 to 150 new stores in 2021. This includes the Pep Boys leases we're executing in California. The opening of the California locations will ramp up during the back half of the year and finish in 2022.
Now I'd like to transition to the unique opportunity we have to significantly expand our margins. As we outlined in our strategic update, there are 4 broad initiatives: leveraging category management; streamlining our supply chain; improving sales and profit per store; and reducing corporate SG&A.
Our largest margin expansion initiative is leveraging category management to drive gross margin improvement. This involves 3 components: material cost optimization, owned brand expansion and strategic pricing. 
Material cost optimization and strategic sourcing has been an ongoing effort for us and will continue to be a focus. Given the current inflationary environment, we are leveraging these capabilities to push back on cost increases to keep our price to the customer low. We'll continue to work collaboratively with our supplier partners on managing input costs.
Owned brand expansion as a percent of our mix is an important contributor to margin rate improvement. However, growing our DieHard and Carquest brand is not just about margin. It's also about differentiation. Our merchant team is building out capabilities and sourcing to develop high-quality products, leveraging our strong supplier relationships. Two recent examples include our DieHard robust enhanced flooded batteries and our Carquest hub assemblies. Once equipped with a differentiated product, our marketing team is building the awareness and the reputation of our owned brand, as evidenced by our DieHard is Back advertising campaign.
Finally, we supplement innovative, quality parts and breakthrough marketing with an improved online experience and extensive Team Member training. This includes enhanced part, product and brand training to ensure our store Team Members are well positioned to provide our customers with trusted advice and an excellent in-store experience. 
So we're not only on track with margin expansion behind owned brands. We're also leveraging these brands to enhance differentiation and improve store traffic. Our extensive research around customer journeys highlights the role that brands play in customer purchase decisions. When a customer's car won't start, we want them to think of DieHard first, such that this becomes a reason that they come to Advance. This is why collaborating with our supplier partners is so important to ensure high quality for our owned brands. We're confident as we continue to invest in product quality, building our brands and training our Team Members to drive owned brands as a percent of mix, we will further deliver growth across AAP. 
The final component of our category management initiatives is strategic pricing. By investing in new tools, we're now able to competitively price on a market-by-market basis, using detailed analytics to improve rate. We're also realizing success in reducing discounts online through a rapid test-and-learn approach, which is driving significant margin expansion in key categories. 
In total, our category management initiatives are currently on track to deliver up to 200 basis points of margin expansion through 2023. As we look beyond 2023, we plan to continue building out customer data and personalization platforms to further enhance the customer experience and expand margins. 
Staying with gross margin, we once again leveraged supply chain in Q1 versus both 2020 and 2019. Despite the current environment, We remain focused on executing our primary margin expansion initiatives, while working to mitigate the impact of global supply chain challenges. We expect to complete our warehouse management system implementation in 2022, with the majority of our largest buildings converted this year.
In conjunction with WMS, we're also rolling out our labor management system, which allows us to implement common standard operating procedures across our DC network. This will also enable us to incentivize hourly Team Members based on their performance. In terms of cross-banner replenishment or CBR, we've converted over 70% of stores to date and expect to complete the remaining stores we originally planned by the end of Q3. 
CBR significantly reduces our miles driven, which is even more important today given rising fuel and labor costs. More importantly, CBR will complete the integration of the Advance and Carquest supply chains and enable us to service our approximately 4,800 corporate Advance stores and 1,300 independent Carquest stores from a single supply chain. 
We also continue to integrate the dedicated professional supply chain within Worldpac and Autopart International. In the quarter, we converted another 5 AI stores to the Worldpac system and are on track to complete this integration by the end of Q1 2022. 
In April, we discussed 2 additional supply chain initiatives, building on what will soon be a more streamlined supply chain network. This includes tiering our supply chain and transforming in-market delivery and customer fulfillment. Our tiered supply chain pools the slowest moving SKUs into 4 strategically located regional DCs. This will allow us to make room for faster-moving SKUs and ultimately improve the availability of our higher-turnover products.
Our second new initiative is transforming in-market delivery and customer fulfillment to improve service and productivity. The new delivery management system will select for multiple modes of transportation to move and deliver parts at lower costs. Both of these initiatives are in their early stages. And we are targeting completion of these in 2023 and 2024, respectively.
In terms of SG&A improvements, our store operations team is executing initiatives to increase sales and profit per store. We've now increased sales per store for 3 straight years, and we're on track to get to our target of 1.8 million average sales per store by 2023.
In Q1, with strong top line growth and disciplined execution, we leveraged store payroll versus both 2019 and 2020. We've also made improvements in scheduling and task management to drive efficiency, which helps with our customer experience as it enables us to schedule our most tenured and knowledgeable Team Members when we may need them most. 
We continue to invest in our store Team Members in terms of training, technology and in compensation, including our unique Fuel the Frontline stock ownership program. We believe these investments have enabled us to attract the very best parts people in the business and are enabling continued improvement in primary execution metrics, like Net Promoter Score, units per transaction, and ultimately, sales and profit per store.
Finally, we took steps to reduce corporate and other SG&A costs in the quarter. This includes 3 broad territories: integration, safety and new ways of working. In terms of integration, our finance ERP is near completion, and we continue to build proficiency in our global capability center at Hyderabad, India. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to recognize our India team who stood up an entirely new operation literally in the middle of a global pandemic last year. We've been working hard to support them as COVID-19 infection rates have risen in India over the past few weeks. 
The GCC team, including IT, finance and HR Team Members today has certainly enabled us to reduce costs, both in terms of CapEx and OpEx. In addition, the IT team brings new skills in the area of software engineering, data analytics and artificial intelligence. These critical capabilities will help enable the successful implementation of our many tech initiatives. 
Secondly, our safety performance continues as field leaders across Advance hold their teams accountable as we build a safety culture. We delivered a 9% reduction in our total recordable injury rate compared to the previous year and reduced our lost time injury rate 2%. By focusing on people, behavior and continuous improvement, we're reducing claims and overall costs. 
Third, we recently completed a thorough review on the ways we work in our corporate offices and incorporated key learnings from working remotely for over a year. The objective was to ensure our corporate team is focused on our highest-value priorities while eliminating less productive work. From this work, we announced a restructure of our corporate functions and the reduction of our corporate office footprint. This will result in savings of approximately $30 million in SG&A, which will be realized over the next 12 months. We also believe this streamlined approach will be more effective to supporting our field and supply chain teams. 
While we're pleased with our Q1 performance, we're confident that there is so much more opportunity ahead. To fully realize our potential, we plan to continue to invest in our brands, the customer experience, our Team Members and market expansion to drive top line growth above market. Our entire team also remains focused on the execution of our margin expansion initiatives. We're energized and focused on building on the momentum we saw in Q1 to execute our long-term strategy in the months to come. 
Now let me pass it over to Jeff, who will go into more details on our financial results."

And thanks to everyone joining us today, especially our Team Members who continue to work tirelessly, which has contributed to the results that we're reporting today.In Q1, our net sales increased 23.4% to $3.3 billion. Ad",825,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning. And thanks to everyone joining us today, especially our Team Members who continue to work tirelessly, which has contributed to the results that we're reporting today.
In Q1, our net sales increased 23.4% to $3.3 billion. Adjusted gross profit margin expanded 91 basis points to 44.8% as a result of improvement throughout gross margin, including supply chain, net pricing, channel mix and material cost optimization. These improvements were slightly offset by unfavorable inventory-related costs, product mix and headwinds associated with shrink and defectives. 
Our Q1 adjusted SG&A expense was $1.2 billion. On a rate basis, this represented 35.8% of net sales, which improved 387 basis points compared to 1 year ago. The improvement was driven by sales leverage in both payroll and rent as well as lower claim-related expenses from the company's emphasis on safety.
We discussed our labor management system previously, but we really saw the benefit this quarter as we staffed our stores based on customer needs, utilizing nights, weekends and an improved mix of full and part-time schedules. In addition, our ongoing focus on Team Member safety will always remain one of our highest priorities. 
The savings were partially offset by an increase in field bonus costs related to our improved performance. In addition, as Tom outlined earlier, we invested in marketing during Q1, primarily associated with DieHard. This lapped marketing cuts the previous year, which were made at the onset of the pandemic. We also saw an increase in third-party and service contracts related to our transformational plans, primarily within IT.
Related to the increased COVID-19 cases we saw late in 2020 and early 2021, we incurred approximately $16 million in COVID-19 costs during the quarter, which was flat to the prior year. While the future impact of COVID-19 remains unknown, we expect these costs to subside throughout the year, assuming infection rates continue to decline. 
Our adjusted operating income increased from $113 million last year to $299 million. On a rate basis, our adjusted OI margin expanded by 478 basis points to 9%. Finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.34, up from $1 a year ago. 
Our free cash flow for the quarter was $259 million, an increase of $330 million compared to last year. The improvement was primarily driven by year-over-year operating income growth as well as improvements we achieved from working capital initiatives, including higher utilization of our supply chain financing facilities that we began to see during the pandemic last year.
Our AP ratio improved by nearly 1,000 basis points to 84%, the highest we've achieved since the GPI acquisition. A portion of the improvement is attributable to the actions we took during the pandemic and the continued partnerships we have with our suppliers.
In the quarter, we spent $71 million in capital expenditures versus $83 million in the prior year quarter. We expect to be within our guidance for capital expenditures as we continue to invest in our transformation initiatives. 
During Q1, we returned more than $200 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of 1.1 million shares and our quarterly cash dividend. We expect to be within our 2021 share repurchase guidance of $300 million to $500 million. Additionally, as you saw during our investor presentation in April, our Board approved our quarterly shareholder dividend of $1 payable on July 2. 
As outlined in our press release this morning, we've seen continued momentum in the first 4 weeks of Q2, with our 2-year comparable store sales growth rate in line with the 2-year stack we reported in Q1. Miles driven are beginning to grow for the first time in over a year. And historically, this has been an overall positive for our industry. In addition, our professional business is accelerating, and we expect pro to outperform DIY for the balance of the year. For these reasons, we're raising our comp sales guidance to up 4% to 6%.
We're also cognizant of several macroeconomic factors. This includes inflationary costs in commodities, transportation and wages, along with currency headwinds. As a reminder, our industry has historically been very rational and successful in passing on inflationary costs in the form of price, and that is our intention this year as well. Also, our pro business carries a lower-margin rate than DIY, which may partially offset the gains we expect to see in sales. 
As a result of our top line strength and current cost assumptions, we're updating our adjusted OI margin range to be between 9% and 9.2%. Our guide for comp sales is now up 3 full points. And our adjusted OI margin rate is now up 30 basis points compared to our initial guidance provided in February. We remain committed to delivering against the strategy we laid out in April and are confident in our ability to execute our long-term strategic plans to deliver strong and sustainable total shareholder return.

And as we outlined in the prepared remarks, it was really early in the quarter, a continuation of what we've seen all of last year, strong performance from DIY, pro lagging. And then obviously, as we got towards the end of the quarter, that started to change. And this is beginning to lap the unusual events of last year. Clearly, April and May was the low point for professional sales last year when the pandemic hit and work remote orders were put in place. And you really saw a difficult environment for the installer community. 
And I'm really proud of what we did at that point. I mean we stayed with it. We supported our pro installers. We didn't have anybody furloughed or anything like that. People are out on the street, helping them out. And that's really helped us through the year last year and into this year. And so now as we start to lap those results, pro is significantly outperforming DIY, and we expect that to continue for the balance of this year. So we're very excited about that, obviously, given that 60% of our business is pro. 
And then in terms of the cadence, we're obviously early on in the year. We know there was a huge surge on DIY in 2020. We talked about that throughout the year last year. There's some trends that -- some of which could be stickier than we initially thought when we planned the year, people with time on their hands. There's the stimulus impact last year. There was shift from big box. How is it all going to unfold for the balance of the year is difficult to say. But clearly, we're off to a good start in Q2, and we'll keep monitoring it as the year goes on."

First, on the inventory related, that's really the capitalized supply chain costs. And we had a really interesting phenomenon this quarter that we typically don't have in previous quarters, where our inventory was down substantially over $60 million in the first quarter. And when we do that, we recognize the capitalized supply chain costs that are associated with that sitting on the balance sheet.
If you contrast that to last year or even 2019, it's generally inventory build. We're building inventory in the first quarter as we prepare for the spring selling season. In 2020, inventory was up over $90 million, and if you want to go back to 2019, it's up over $70 million. Now the good news, Chris, is that translates into very favorable free cash flow, which you saw in terms of the good operating cash, over 300 -- almost $330 million in operating cash, $259 million of free cash flow. So realizing that is very favorable for our cash balance.
In terms of pricing, we took a number of pricing actions during the end of last year, beginning of this year. We're seeing it flow through. We haven't seen any resistance there from a pricing standpoint, so we feel really good about that. We know there's some inflationary factors that are coming, and we're planning to address those. But for the quarter, our pricing actions took hold, and we were really pleased with the results."

And so we're looking at our in-stocks across the organization, making sure that this inventory is forward deployed. So there's really going to be some puts and takes throughout the year.

So we're obviously making some bets on inventory to make sure that we're able to delight the customer when they need us. 
In terms of the performance in the back half, yes, I mean we are a professional organization. With 60% of our business in there, we definitely would see us continuing to benefit from that trend in the back half of the year overall. Geographically, absolutely, we called out in our remarks that the Northeast was leading the country quarter-to-date. We haven't seen that in over a year. 
So those are 2 big factors that help us out. And obviously, we're excited about both of those trends. We've got multiple banners on the professional side that are all cranking right now. Our installers are covered up. We've got cars waiting out there to be repaired. People are getting back on the road. Miles driven are recovering. So all of those things are very positive.

The second and third is exactly what you just mentioned, Simeon, which is the clarity we have on Q1 in terms of the beat. Beat coming in at 9% versus the 8.5% to 8.7% that's modeled in. And then the upside that we're seeing early on in Q2, we've modeled some of that. 
And then the last one that I would throw in there is our assessment around inflation. We're seeing inflation in a number of different categories. And so while that would benefit the top line in the form of higher comps, we wouldn't see that flow through as much. We generally, we and the industry, price to maintain margin rate. So those are the 4 things that we contemplated that were, quite frankly, different 45 days ago and why we thought it was prudent to update guidance now."

Well, the 4 territories that we talked about, Simeon, really the one that is most sales dependent is obviously sales and profit per store. There is a leverage component to that in our outlook. I mean we talked about 240 to 440 basis points of margin expansion. And the range of revenue growth that was contemplated was 3% on the low end and 6% on the high end, if you remember. So obviously, the one that swings the most is that particular one. 
Now there are pure cost-out initiatives in there, without question, return, shrink, defectives. We've got ways of improving profit per store without sales. But that is the one that has a dependency there. 
Supply chain, the vast majority of the supply chain initiatives are not sales dependent. These are just pure productivity opportunities. You're familiar with the cross-banner and warehouse management system implementation, but also the 2 new ones that Reuben outlined in the April presentation. Neither of those are sales dependent. Those are just improving our current efficiency and how we get product from distribution centers to the stores and how we move product in market. 
Category management is a pure rate play. There is really no sales dependency on category management. And then, obviously, the SG&A moves in the ERP implementation, the new ways of working, those are all -- none of those are sales dependent. 
So the majority of the initiatives we have are not sales dependent. Obviously, the more sales we have, the more we get, not just leverage on those that are contemplated in the initial low end of the guide, the 220, but we get leverage on other fixed costs, which takes us up to the 440. Hope that helps."

Essentially, we've been working at strengthening our core value proposition here for several years now, as you know. And the investments we've made in that value proposition are now yielding comp sales performance at the kind of levels that we aspired to from the beginning. 
We've had 3 straight years of comp sales growth, and we would say we've earned the right to expand and take that proposition elsewhere. You think about bringing the work we've done on availability, making sure that our industry-leading assortment of parts is available to people in Portland just like it is in Boston. Bringing DieHard to the West Coast is a huge opportunity for us. Our team was on the ground the week we announced the Pep Boys leasing arrangement. And the first thing people talked about in the stores when we went out there was DieHard. They were very excited to hear that they'd be selling DieHard batteries. 
All the digital investments that we've made in our online platform, whether that's the B2B website that Bob Cushing leads with Advance Pro, the B2C website that Jason leads, and our app, we bring that to these markets. We're able to supplement our pro customers who are out there today, our large professional customers that we sell to nationally but cannot sell to in those geographies because we don't have the presence to do so. So we're able to integrate the digital and physical asset piece. 
So we're very excited about the announcement with Baxter. They're a terrific organization. They've got a tremendous track record. And they're very excited about converting to the Carquest banner here soon. And then in terms of southern California, as we -- as you heard, we have 109 locations. We're going to start converting those soon, and we expect to complete that in 2022. 
So that's really a quick rundown of what we're doing out there. I got to tell you, our team is so excited about being able to open new stores after a couple of years where we were closing them. And clearly, that's something that brings in new energy to the organization overall."

So there is quite a variation in the categories within DIY. Those categories that rely on miles driven, they didn't do that well even inside of DIY. I mean better than historical, obviously, but nothing compared to batteries where intermittent driving causes failure. 
So we expect pro to outperform. I think as we get towards Q3 and Q4, you'll see those 2-year stacks start to come closer together. But in general, the DIY business tends to be a little bit more volatile, as you know."

We're gradually picking it back up, I think. We're very thankful our suppliers have really done everything they can to keep us in stock. We feel like we're well positioned competitively. We don't think this is a competitive disadvantage at all.

I mean we really measure that by customer journey, if you will. If you look at a battery failure, as an example, my car won't start as compared to my brakes are squeaking as compared to -- I would like to accessorize my car or something like that, there's obviously different elements there of whether or not somebody is going to defer anything. The reality is on failure-related items, it's unlikely that it's going to have a big impact. It certainly hasn't had a big impact historically. And as long as we're competitive, we'll continue to see growth there. There may be some things that end up getting deferred based on the job type. But in general, this industry has been incredibly resilient at being able to pass on pricing, and I think that's what you're going to continue to see.
Your second question was on the outlook. I think the short answer is we've obviously contemplated some level of pricing in the outlook. And we've also contemplated how much of that's going to flow through all of the variables there. If the pricing flows through at what we've guided, we'll obviously be right there in the guide. If it's better than that, we'll be better. That's really the answer. It's -- that's probably the biggest variable that's out there. All the rest of the stuff is fully within our control.

I guess, one, is that a correct assumption on marketing expense? And then secondly, as industry demand does slow from these higher levels, do you think increased marketing will be needed or increased promotions will be needed to keep those sales rates up? Or how do you think the industry responds from a marketing or promotion expense -- or promotional outlook as comps slow?"

Somebody drops their price. Somebody else drops their price. I mean it's -- we measure our competitive price index literally every day. So we're looking at what's going on inside of our industry, and we have algorithms that help us determine how we're going to price what category in which geography and those kinds of things. 
Marketing is an investment. I mean marketing is an investment in driving margin expansion. When we invest behind a DieHard marketing campaign, as we did last fall and in the first quarter, the intention there is to build loyalty, to build equity in the DieHard brand, to build awareness of the fact that DieHard is available at Advanced Auto Parts. And when we do that, what we find is we actually are able to reduce our promotional discounting and build the strength of that brand because it's trusted by the customer. 
So they're very different. And one of them is relatively easy to replicate. The other one is more difficult to replicate. And that -- we'll invest in marketing when we get a return that expands margins. That's the focus of our marketing dollars."

I mean, obviously, we talked about this in our April presentation that this is a very fragmented market, particularly on the professional side. And right or wrong, last year was a highly disruptive time for, well, everything, but certainly our industry. And at the time, if you think back to the second quarter, a lot of companies took some pretty drastic actions with their workforce and how they approach the pandemic. 
And we stayed with it. We stayed with it. We had people on the street, as I mentioned earlier. We had our training programs. Our people put on a mask every single day and went out there and served our customers. And being an enduring time for the world, I mean, I think those pro installers have remembered that. 
And so I do think that it's conceivable that the larger players who behaved in that manner could see share gains, outsized share performance for a period of time as a result of that. And when the larger players are a fairly small slice of the overall pie, and we have scale, we have parts availability, we've got great brands, we think that we can continue to show outsized performance relative to the industry for a period of time."

And they play a key role in our assortment and our availability. We have the largest number of stock parts in market of anyone in the industry. Terrific relationships with our national brand partners, terrific relationships with the OE suppliers that we have out there. So that gives us a competitive advantage. And we are going to continue to offer those brands where it makes sense for our business. This is about choice, not necessarily about an either/or. It's a bit of an and. 
So that said, where we have a category where we can bring the Carquest trademark into that category, offer it to our customers, with very, very high quality, and I want to really emphasize that. Our Carquest parts are OE quality. It's got a tremendous reputation. The Carquest brand has been around for a very long time. The professional installers love the Carquest brand. And our merchant team goes out and works very closely with our suppliers to make sure when we put the Carquest name on that box, it's going to be OE quality. So we offer that. If the customer chooses on the lookup that they want Carquest, they choose Carquest, great. If they choose the national brand, they choose the national brand. 
Now having said that, as we brought strength to some of these categories with Carquest, we are seeing our customers choose Carquest, which -- back to your initial question, we are roughly -- we think we're about 10 points underpenetrated versus our potential. And while we won't get there in the next 3 years -- 2023 is obviously the strategic plan time line we outlined in April. It's a pretty significant number in the 200 basis points of margin expansion we expect from category management. So that's fully contemplated. And as we roll out all the SKUs, we'll be in great shape to capture that margin opportunity."

Very confident in the category management initiatives. We'll leverage supply chain. There's obviously some things with supply chain this year. We are seeing some wage inflation on supply chain that we didn't plan, if you go back to last fall. But we still believe we've got an opportunity to leverage supply chain based on the initiatives that we have there. 
As you go into SG&A, I mean we're going to execute the initiatives we have set. So we've already done the restructure. And I think the restructure, just to be clear, it wasn't just a cost play. We've been able to really organize our corporate team around the highest-value priorities. We streamlined and simplified the work. We've given more responsibility to the top people in this company. And yes, we saved what we outlined in the April meeting, about $30 million, which we'll realize over the next 12 months. So that's a AAA bond. We'll get that. 
There are some offsets though inside of SG&A this year, as you know, that we're -- that will minimize that benefit, I guess, that we're getting out of SG&A. But that's a quick run through. More from gross margin, not as much from SG&A."

First, I'd like to thank our independent partners and Team Members all over the world for their passion and commitment to serve our customers throughout the pandemic. We also hope that you and your families are healthy and safe. The health and safety of our Team Members and customers has been a top priority over the past year. 
As you saw earlier this morning, our final Q1 financial performance exceeded the estimated results we provided on April 20. With strength across all channels, we delivered comparable store sales growth of 24.7% and margin expansion of 478 basis points versus the prior year. On a 2-year stack, our comp sales growth was 15.4%. Adjusted diluted EPS of $3.34 represented an all-time quarterly high for AAP and improved more than 230% compared to Q1 2020.
Free cash flow of $259 million was up significantly versus the prior year. And we returned over $203 million to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and our quarterly cash dividend. 
In addition, we recently announced an updated capital allocation framework, targeting top-quartile total shareholder return, highlighted by operating income growth, share repurchases and an increase in our dividend. This further reinforces our confidence in future cash generation and our commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders.
As outlined in April, we're building an ownership culture as well as a differentiated operating model at Advance. Over the past few years, we've made substantial investments in our brands, our digital and physical assets and our team. These investments, along with external factors, enabled us to post a strong start to 2021. Clearly, the federal stimulus package, along with our first real winter weather in 3 years, was a benefit to our industry.
From a category perspective, net sales growth was led by batteries, appearance chemicals and wipers. Geographically, all 8 regions posted over 20% growth. Importantly, over the past year, the Northeast, our largest region, had been below our overall reported growth rate and well below that of our top-performing regions. In Q1, the gap narrowed. And in recent weeks, the Northeast has been leading our growth. This was in line with our expectations as mobility is increasing in large urban markets in the Northeast, which were disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 last year.
Both DIY omnichannel and professional performed well, delivering double-digit comp sales growth in the quarter. We saw strong increases versus year ago, with a double-digit increase in transactions and high single-digit increases in dollars per transaction in both channels.
In terms of cadence, DIY led the way early in Q1. As the country began to reopen later in the quarter, professional came on strong, resulting in pro growth of over 20% in Q1, with continued momentum into Q2. The changes in channel performance highlights the importance of flexibility in our operating model as we adapt to rapid shifts in consumer behavior relative to 2020. 
Throughout AAP, our merchant, supply chain and store operations teams have been extremely agile in adjusting to this evolving environment to ensure we take care of our customers.Within the pro sales channel, our overarching focus remains to get the right part in the right place at the right time. This enables us to compete on availability, customer service and speed of fulfillment, which are the primary drivers of choice for pro garages. To achieve these goals, we continue to strengthen our value proposition through improved availability as well as our Advance Pro catalog, featuring tools like MotoLogic and delivery estimates.
As vaccinations roll out across the country, mobility is increasing across all income strata. As discussed in April, this is very good for AAP as our diverse set of assets within pro is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this trend. 
Specifically, Worldpac led our professional growth in the quarter. With a customer base that serves higher-end installers and more premium vehicles, Worldpac gained momentum throughout Q1. This is because middle to high-income motorists are becoming increasingly mobile. And in some cases, they are now returning to daily commuting. Stated simply, they're driving more than they did a year ago.
Secondly, we're seeing benefits from the owned brand product offering expansion with the integration of Autopart International. Further, we believe our independent Carquest stores are also well positioned. They're leveraging our enterprise assortment and have excellent relationships with customers. These relationships have been strengthened over the past year given the support we provided to both independent and our pro customers during a difficult time. 
We continue to grow our independent store base through a combination of greenfield locations and the conversion of existing independent locations. Today, we're extremely excited to announce that we're adding 29 new independent locations to the Pacific Northwest to the Carquest family, the single largest conversion in our history. Baxter Auto Parts announced that they will bring over 80 years of automotive aftermarket experience and strong customer relationships to the Carquest banner. This is a testament to the strength of the Carquest independent program, including product availability, differentiated brands, technology platforms and robust marketing plans. 
We also grew our TechNet program across all pro channels. TechNet enables independent service shops to create their own national network. We now have over 13,000 North American members, and we'll continue to leverage TechNet to differentiate our pro offering and build loyalty. In summary, we expect that as our pro installers recover, our industry-leading assortment, customized pro solutions and dedicated pro banners will enable us to drive market share gains in a growing segment throughout the balance of the year.
Meanwhile, our DIY omnichannel business led our growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Stepping back and as a reminder, there was a significant increase in DIY penetration across the industry beginning in Q2 2020. According to syndicated data, an estimated 4 million new DIY buyers were added. Spend per buyer for 2020 grew close to 9%, led by online spend per buyer. DIY growth was led by project, recreation and more discretionary categories as people worked on their vehicles or even learned how to work on their vehicles. These trends generally continued through Q1, and the industry is now beginning to lap the significant increase from prior year in Q2. 
From an Advance standpoint, we grew share of wallet and overall market share in Q1, led by DieHard batteries. DieHard continues to have strong momentum, and our advertising is clearly resonating with customers. We plan to continue to invest behind this powerful brand in 2021 to further build awareness and association with Advance.
Our loyalty program remains focused on attracting, retaining and graduating Speed Perks members. Our loyalty program enables us to provide personalized offers and increased share of wallet as we leverage our customer data platform. In Q1, this helped drive growth in our VIP members by approximately 14% and our Elite members by 30%.
Consistent with broader retail, during Q1, we began to see a shift back to store sales from e-commerce given the outsized growth of the online business during the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Our investments in digital and e-commerce have been another differentiator for our DIY business. We continue to strengthen our online experience on desktop, mobile, and with our app, which recently crossed nearly 1.3 million downloads. 
The integration of our digital and physical assets is communicated through our Advance Same Day suite of services. This enables DIYers to find the right part from our industry-leading assortment, order it online, and either pick it up in one of our stores within 30 minutes or have it delivered in 3 hours or less. 
Finally, we're very excited about our footprint expansion and new store opening plans for the year. We're targeting between 100 to 150 new stores in 2021. This includes the Pep Boys leases we're executing in California. The opening of the California locations will ramp up during the back half of the year and finish in 2022.
Now I'd like to transition to the unique opportunity we have to significantly expand our margins. As we outlined in our strategic update, there are 4 broad initiatives: leveraging category management; streamlining our supply chain; improving sales and profit per store; and reducing corporate SG&A.
Our largest margin expansion initiative is leveraging category management to drive gross margin improvement. This involves 3 components: material cost optimization, owned brand expansion and strategic pricing. 
Material cost optimization and strategic sourcing has been an ongoing effort for us and will continue to be a focus. Given the current inflationary environment, we are leveraging these capabilities to push back on cost increases to keep our price to the customer low. We'll continue to work collaboratively with our supplier partners on managing input costs.
Owned brand expansion as a percent of our mix is an important contributor to margin rate improvement. However, growing our DieHard and Carquest brand is not just about margin. It's also about differentiation. Our merchant team is building out capabilities and sourcing to develop high-quality products, leveraging our strong supplier relationships. Two recent examples include our DieHard robust enhanced flooded batteries and our Carquest hub assemblies. Once equipped with a differentiated product, our marketing team is building the awareness and the reputation of our owned brand, as evidenced by our DieHard is Back advertising campaign.
Finally, we supplement innovative, quality parts and breakthrough marketing with an improved online experience and extensive Team Member training. This includes enhanced part, product and brand training to ensure our store Team Members are well positioned to provide our customers with trusted advice and an excellent in-store experience. 
So we're not only on track with margin expansion behind owned brands. We're also leveraging these brands to enhance differentiation and improve store traffic. Our extensive research around customer journeys highlights the role that brands play in customer purchase decisions. When a customer's car won't start, we want them to think of DieHard first, such that this becomes a reason that they come to Advance. This is why collaborating with our supplier partners is so important to ensure high quality for our owned brands. We're confident as we continue to invest in product quality, building our brands and training our Team Members to drive owned brands as a percent of mix, we will further deliver growth across AAP. 
The final component of our category management initiatives is strategic pricing. By investing in new tools, we're now able to competitively price on a market-by-market basis, using detailed analytics to improve rate. We're also realizing success in reducing discounts online through a rapid test-and-learn approach, which is driving significant margin expansion in key categories. 
In total, our category management initiatives are currently on track to deliver up to 200 basis points of margin expansion through 2023. As we look beyond 2023, we plan to continue building out customer data and personalization platforms to further enhance the customer experience and expand margins. 
Staying with gross margin, we once again leveraged supply chain in Q1 versus both 2020 and 2019. Despite the current environment, We remain focused on executing our primary margin expansion initiatives, while working to mitigate the impact of global supply chain challenges. We expect to complete our warehouse management system implementation in 2022, with the majority of our largest buildings converted this year.
In conjunction with WMS, we're also rolling out our labor management system, which allows us to implement common standard operating procedures across our DC network. This will also enable us to incentivize hourly Team Members based on their performance. In terms of cross-banner replenishment or CBR, we've converted over 70% of stores to date and expect to complete the remaining stores we originally planned by the end of Q3. 
CBR significantly reduces our miles driven, which is even more important today given rising fuel and labor costs. More importantly, CBR will complete the integration of the Advance and Carquest supply chains and enable us to service our approximately 4,800 corporate Advance stores and 1,300 independent Carquest stores from a single supply chain. 
We also continue to integrate the dedicated professional supply chain within Worldpac and Autopart International. In the quarter, we converted another 5 AI stores to the Worldpac system and are on track to complete this integration by the end of Q1 2022. 
In April, we discussed 2 additional supply chain initiatives, building on what will soon be a more streamlined supply chain network. This includes tiering our supply chain and transforming in-market delivery and customer fulfillment. Our tiered supply chain pools the slowest moving SKUs into 4 strategically located regional DCs. This will allow us to make room for faster-moving SKUs and ultimately improve the availability of our higher-turnover products.
Our second new initiative is transforming in-market delivery and customer fulfillment to improve service and productivity. The new delivery management system will select for multiple modes of transportation to move and deliver parts at lower costs. Both of these initiatives are in their early stages. And we are targeting completion of these in 2023 and 2024, respectively.
In terms of SG&A improvements, our store operations team is executing initiatives to increase sales and profit per store. We've now increased sales per store for 3 straight years, and we're on track to get to our target of 1.8 million average sales per store by 2023.
In Q1, with strong top line growth and disciplined execution, we leveraged store payroll versus both 2019 and 2020. We've also made improvements in scheduling and task management to drive efficiency, which helps with our customer experience as it enables us to schedule our most tenured and knowledgeable Team Members when we may need them most. 
We continue to invest in our store Team Members in terms of training, technology and in compensation, including our unique Fuel the Frontline stock ownership program. We believe these investments have enabled us to attract the very best parts people in the business and are enabling continued improvement in primary execution metrics, like Net Promoter Score, units per transaction, and ultimately, sales and profit per store.
Finally, we took steps to reduce corporate and other SG&A costs in the quarter. This includes 3 broad territories: integration, safety and new ways of working. In terms of integration, our finance ERP is near completion, and we continue to build proficiency in our global capability center at Hyderabad, India. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to recognize our India team who stood up an entirely new operation literally in the middle of a global pandemic last year. We've been working hard to support them as COVID-19 infection rates have risen in India over the past few weeks. 
The GCC team, including IT, finance and HR Team Members today has certainly enabled us to reduce costs, both in terms of CapEx and OpEx. In addition, the IT team brings new skills in the area of software engineering, data analytics and artificial intelligence. These critical capabilities will help enable the successful implementation of our many tech initiatives. 
Secondly, our safety performance continues as field leaders across Advance hold their teams accountable as we build a safety culture. We delivered a 9% reduction in our total recordable injury rate compared to the previous year and reduced our lost time injury rate 2%. By focusing on people, behavior and continuous improvement, we're reducing claims and overall costs. 
Third, we recently completed a thorough review on the ways we work in our corporate offices and incorporated key learnings from working remotely for over a year. The objective was to ensure our corporate team is focused on our highest-value priorities while eliminating less productive work. From this work, we announced a restructure of our corporate functions and the reduction of our corporate office footprint. This will result in savings of approximately $30 million in SG&A, which will be realized over the next 12 months. We also believe this streamlined approach will be more effective to supporting our field and supply chain teams. 
While we're pleased with our Q1 performance, we're confident that there is so much more opportunity ahead. To fully realize our potential, we plan to continue to invest in our brands, the customer experience, our Team Members and market expansion to drive top line growth above market. Our entire team also remains focused on the execution of our margin expansion initiatives. We're energized and focused on building on the momentum we saw in Q1 to execute our long-term strategy in the months to come. 
Now let me pass it over to Jeff, who will go into more details on our financial results."

And thanks to everyone joining us today, especially our Team Members who continue to work tirelessly, which has contributed to the results that we're reporting today.In Q1, our net sales increased 23.4% to $3.3 billion. Ad",825,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning. And thanks to everyone joining us today, especially our Team Members who continue to work tirelessly, which has contributed to the results that we're reporting today.
In Q1, our net sales increased 23.4% to $3.3 billion. Adjusted gross profit margin expanded 91 basis points to 44.8% as a result of improvement throughout gross margin, including supply chain, net pricing, channel mix and material cost optimization. These improvements were slightly offset by unfavorable inventory-related costs, product mix and headwinds associated with shrink and defectives. 
Our Q1 adjusted SG&A expense was $1.2 billion. On a rate basis, this represented 35.8% of net sales, which improved 387 basis points compared to 1 year ago. The improvement was driven by sales leverage in both payroll and rent as well as lower claim-related expenses from the company's emphasis on safety.
We discussed our labor management system previously, but we really saw the benefit this quarter as we staffed our stores based on customer needs, utilizing nights, weekends and an improved mix of full and part-time schedules. In addition, our ongoing focus on Team Member safety will always remain one of our highest priorities. 
The savings were partially offset by an increase in field bonus costs related to our improved performance. In addition, as Tom outlined earlier, we invested in marketing during Q1, primarily associated with DieHard. This lapped marketing cuts the previous year, which were made at the onset of the pandemic. We also saw an increase in third-party and service contracts related to our transformational plans, primarily within IT.
Related to the increased COVID-19 cases we saw late in 2020 and early 2021, we incurred approximately $16 million in COVID-19 costs during the quarter, which was flat to the prior year. While the future impact of COVID-19 remains unknown, we expect these costs to subside throughout the year, assuming infection rates continue to decline. 
Our adjusted operating income increased from $113 million last year to $299 million. On a rate basis, our adjusted OI margin expanded by 478 basis points to 9%. Finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.34, up from $1 a year ago. 
Our free cash flow for the quarter was $259 million, an increase of $330 million compared to last year. The improvement was primarily driven by year-over-year operating income growth as well as improvements we achieved from working capital initiatives, including higher utilization of our supply chain financing facilities that we began to see during the pandemic last year.
Our AP ratio improved by nearly 1,000 basis points to 84%, the highest we've achieved since the GPI acquisition. A portion of the improvement is attributable to the actions we took during the pandemic and the continued partnerships we have with our suppliers.
In the quarter, we spent $71 million in capital expenditures versus $83 million in the prior year quarter. We expect to be within our guidance for capital expenditures as we continue to invest in our transformation initiatives. 
During Q1, we returned more than $200 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of 1.1 million shares and our quarterly cash dividend. We expect to be within our 2021 share repurchase guidance of $300 million to $500 million. Additionally, as you saw during our investor presentation in April, our Board approved our quarterly shareholder dividend of $1 payable on July 2. 
As outlined in our press release this morning, we've seen continued momentum in the first 4 weeks of Q2, with our 2-year comparable store sales growth rate in line with the 2-year stack we reported in Q1. Miles driven are beginning to grow for the first time in over a year. And historically, this has been an overall positive for our industry. In addition, our professional business is accelerating, and we expect pro to outperform DIY for the balance of the year. For these reasons, we're raising our comp sales guidance to up 4% to 6%.
We're also cognizant of several macroeconomic factors. This includes inflationary costs in commodities, transportation and wages, along with currency headwinds. As a reminder, our industry has historically been very rational and successful in passing on inflationary costs in the form of price, and that is our intention this year as well. Also, our pro business carries a lower-margin rate than DIY, which may partially offset the gains we expect to see in sales. 
As a result of our top line strength and current cost assumptions, we're updating our adjusted OI margin range to be between 9% and 9.2%. Our guide for comp sales is now up 3 full points. And our adjusted OI margin rate is now up 30 basis points compared to our initial guidance provided in February. We remain committed to delivering against the strategy we laid out in April and are confident in our ability to execute our long-term strategic plans to deliver strong and sustainable total shareholder return.

And as we outlined in the prepared remarks, it was really early in the quarter, a continuation of what we've seen all of last year, strong performance from DIY, pro lagging. And then obviously, as we got towards the end of the quarter, that started to change. And this is beginning to lap the unusual events of last year. Clearly, April and May was the low point for professional sales last year when the pandemic hit and work remote orders were put in place. And you really saw a difficult environment for the installer community. 
And I'm really proud of what we did at that point. I mean we stayed with it. We supported our pro installers. We didn't have anybody furloughed or anything like that. People are out on the street, helping them out. And that's really helped us through the year last year and into this year. And so now as we start to lap those results, pro is significantly outperforming DIY, and we expect that to continue for the balance of this year. So we're very excited about that, obviously, given that 60% of our business is pro. 
And then in terms of the cadence, we're obviously early on in the year. We know there was a huge surge on DIY in 2020. We talked about that throughout the year last year. There's some trends that -- some of which could be stickier than we initially thought when we planned the year, people with time on their hands. There's the stimulus impact last year. There was shift from big box. How is it all going to unfold for the balance of the year is difficult to say. But clearly, we're off to a good start in Q2, and we'll keep monitoring it as the year goes on."

First, on the inventory related, that's really the capitalized supply chain costs. And we had a really interesting phenomenon this quarter that we typically don't have in previous quarters, where our inventory was down substantially over $60 million in the first quarter. And when we do that, we recognize the capitalized supply chain costs that are associated with that sitting on the balance sheet.
If you contrast that to last year or even 2019, it's generally inventory build. We're building inventory in the first quarter as we prepare for the spring selling season. In 2020, inventory was up over $90 million, and if you want to go back to 2019, it's up over $70 million. Now the good news, Chris, is that translates into very favorable free cash flow, which you saw in terms of the good operating cash, over 300 -- almost $330 million in operating cash, $259 million of free cash flow. So realizing that is very favorable for our cash balance.
In terms of pricing, we took a number of pricing actions during the end of last year, beginning of this year. We're seeing it flow through. We haven't seen any resistance there from a pricing standpoint, so we feel really good about that. We know there's some inflationary factors that are coming, and we're planning to address those. But for the quarter, our pricing actions took hold, and we were really pleased with the results."

And so we're looking at our in-stocks across the organization, making sure that this inventory is forward deployed. So there's really going to be some puts and takes throughout the year.

So we're obviously making some bets on inventory to make sure that we're able to delight the customer when they need us. 
In terms of the performance in the back half, yes, I mean we are a professional organization. With 60% of our business in there, we definitely would see us continuing to benefit from that trend in the back half of the year overall. Geographically, absolutely, we called out in our remarks that the Northeast was leading the country quarter-to-date. We haven't seen that in over a year. 
So those are 2 big factors that help us out. And obviously, we're excited about both of those trends. We've got multiple banners on the professional side that are all cranking right now. Our installers are covered up. We've got cars waiting out there to be repaired. People are getting back on the road. Miles driven are recovering. So all of those things are very positive.

The second and third is exactly what you just mentioned, Simeon, which is the clarity we have on Q1 in terms of the beat. Beat coming in at 9% versus the 8.5% to 8.7% that's modeled in. And then the upside that we're seeing early on in Q2, we've modeled some of that. 
And then the last one that I would throw in there is our assessment around inflation. We're seeing inflation in a number of different categories. And so while that would benefit the top line in the form of higher comps, we wouldn't see that flow through as much. We generally, we and the industry, price to maintain margin rate. So those are the 4 things that we contemplated that were, quite frankly, different 45 days ago and why we thought it was prudent to update guidance now."

This is going back to margin opportunity over the next few years. And it seems like a lot of these initiatives or these transformations are starting to take hold. My question is the dependence on sales to drive margin is something we've talked about in the past. Do you feel better? I don't think you'd be satisfied if sales aren't growing, and I think that's the ultimate essence of transforming the business. 
But can you talk about how dependent your margin goals are on sales? Is there some portion of margin that you think this business can achieve without seeing consistent sales growth? And again, I'm not saying that's the goal, but curious if you can separate the 2."

Well, the 4 territories that we talked about, Simeon, really the one that is most sales dependent is obviously sales and profit per store. There is a leverage component to that in our outlook. I mean we talked about 240 to 440 basis points of margin expansion. And the range of revenue growth that was contemplated was 3% on the low end and 6% on the high end, if you remember. So obviously, the one that swings the most is that particular one. 
Now there are pure cost-out initiatives in there, without question, return, shrink, defectives. We've got ways of improving profit per store without sales. But that is the one that has a dependency there. 
Supply chain, the vast majority of the supply chain initiatives are not sales dependent. These are just pure productivity opportunities. You're familiar with the cross-banner and warehouse management system implementation, but also the 2 new ones that Reuben outlined in the April presentation. Neither of those are sales dependent. Those are just improving our current efficiency and how we get product from distribution centers to the stores and how we move product in market. 
Category management is a pure rate play. There is really no sales dependency on category management. And then, obviously, the SG&A moves in the ERP implementation, the new ways of working, those are all -- none of those are sales dependent. 
So the majority of the initiatives we have are not sales dependent. Obviously, the more sales we have, the more we get, not just leverage on those that are contemplated in the initial low end of the guide, the 220, but we get leverage on other fixed costs, which takes us up to the 440. Hope that helps."

Bringing DieHard to the West Coast is a huge opportunity for us. Our team was on the ground the week we announced the Pep Boys leasing arrangement.

We're gradually picking it back up, I think. We're very thankful our suppliers have really done everything they can to keep us in stock. We feel like we're well positioned competitively. We don't think this is a competitive disadvantage at all.

I mean we really measure that by customer journey, if you will. If you look at a battery failure, as an example, my car won't start as compared to my brakes are squeaking as compared to -- I would like to accessorize my car or something like that, there's obviously different elements there of whether or not somebody is going to defer anything. The reality is on failure-related items, it's unlikely that it's going to have a big impact. It certainly hasn't had a big impact historically. And as long as we're competitive, we'll continue to see growth there. There may be some things that end up getting deferred based on the job type. But in general, this industry has been incredibly resilient at being able to pass on pricing, and I think that's what you're going to continue to see.
Your second question was on the outlook. I think the short answer is we've obviously contemplated some level of pricing in the outlook. And we've also contemplated how much of that's going to flow through all of the variables there. If the pricing flows through at what we've guided, we'll obviously be right there in the guide. If it's better than that, we'll be better. That's really the answer. It's -- that's probably the biggest variable that's out there. All the rest of the stuff is fully within our control.

Obviously, we do have discounts in there, but we manage that holistically. We manage that across the broader portfolio. And as people migrate up to these higher levels, that's fully contemplated in what discounts we use and how we offer value to those customers. 
So we won't see any kind of degradation on gross margin as we migrate people to up to these higher tiers. What we will see is higher share of wallet, which is what the aspiration is so that we can move from -- like in the case of VIPs, you're significantly underpenetrated with your most loyal customers.

Marketing is an investment. I mean marketing is an investment in driving margin expansion. When we invest behind a DieHard marketing campaign, as we did last fall and in the first quarter, the intention there is to build loyalty, to build equity in the DieHard brand, to build awareness of the fact that DieHard is available at Advanced Auto Parts. And when we do that, what we find is we actually are able to reduce our promotional discounting and build the strength of that brand because it's trusted by the customer. 
So they're very different. And one of them is relatively easy to replicate. The other one is more difficult to replicate. And that -- we'll invest in marketing when we get a return that expands margins. That's the focus of our marketing dollars."

Our people put on a mask every single day and went out there and served our customers. And being an enduring time for the world, I mean, I think those pro installers have remembered that.

And they play a key role in our assortment and our availability. We have the largest number of stock parts in market of anyone in the industry. Terrific relationships with our national brand partners, terrific relationships with the OE suppliers that we have out there. So that gives us a competitive advantage. And we are going to continue to offer those brands where it makes sense for our business. This is about choice, not necessarily about an either/or. It's a bit of an and. 
So that said, where we have a category where we can bring the Carquest trademark into that category, offer it to our customers, with very, very high quality, and I want to really emphasize that. Our Carquest parts are OE quality. It's got a tremendous reputation. The Carquest brand has been around for a very long time. The professional installers love the Carquest brand. And our merchant team goes out and works very closely with our suppliers to make sure when we put the Carquest name on that box, it's going to be OE quality. So we offer that. If the customer chooses on the lookup that they want Carquest, they choose Carquest, great. If they choose the national brand, they choose the national brand. 
Now having said that, as we brought strength to some of these categories with Carquest, we are seeing our customers choose Carquest, which -- back to your initial question, we are roughly -- we think we're about 10 points underpenetrated versus our potential. And while we won't get there in the next 3 years -- 2023 is obviously the strategic plan time line we outlined in April. It's a pretty significant number in the 200 basis points of margin expansion we expect from category management. So that's fully contemplated.

We've been able to really organize our corporate team around the highest-value priorities. We streamlined and simplified the work. We've given more responsibility to the top people in this company. And yes, we saved what we outlined in the April meeting, about $30 million, which we'll realize over the next 12 months. So that's a AAA bond. We'll get that. 
There are some offsets though inside of SG&A this year, as you know, that we're -- that will minimize that benefit, I guess, that we're getting out of SG&A. But that's a quick run through. More from gross margin, not as much from SG&A."

We hope you're all healthy and safe amid the ongoing pandemic and recent surge of the Delta variant. I'd like to start by thanking the entire Advance and Carquest independent family for your hard work to serve our customers throughout the quarter. It's because of you that we're reporting the positive growth in sales, profit and earnings per share we're reviewing today. 
In Q2, we continued to deliver strong financial performance on both the 1- and 2-year stack, as we began lapping more difficult comparisons. In the quarter, we delivered comparable store sales growth of 5.8%, and adjusted operating income margin of 11.4% and an increase of 11 basis points versus 2020. As a reminder, we lapped a highly unusual quarter from 2020, where we significantly reduced hours of operation and professional delivery expenses reflective of the channel shift from Pro to DIY. 
As we anticipated, the Professional business accelerated in Q2 2021 and between our ongoing strategic initiatives and additional actions, we expanded margins. Our actions offset known headwinds within SG&A and an extremely competitive environment for talent. On a 2-year stack, our comp sales improved 13.3% and margins expanded 227 basis points compared to Q2 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS of $3.40 increased 15.3% compared to Q2 2020 and 56.7% compared to 2019. 
Year-to-date, free cash flow more than doubled, which led to a higher-than-anticipated return of cash to shareholders in the first half of the year, returning $661.4 million through a combination of share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. Our sales growth and margin expansion were driven by a combination of industry-related factors as well as internal operational improvements. On the industry side, the macroeconomic backdrop remained positive in the quarter as consumers benefited from the impact of government stimulus. 
Meanwhile, long-term industry drivers of demand continue to improve. This includes a gradual recovery in miles driven, along with an increase in used car sales, which contributes to an aging fleet. While we delivered positive comp sales in all 3 periods of Q2, our year-over-year growth slowed late in the quarter as we lapped some of our highest growth weeks of 2020. Our category growth was led by strength in brakes, motor oil and filters with continued momentum in key hard part professional categories. 
Regionally, the West led our growth, benefiting from an unusually hot summer, followed by the Southwest, Northeast and Florida. To summarize channel performance, we saw double-digit growth in our Professional business and a slight decline in our DIY omnichannel business. To understand the shift in our channel mix, it's important to look back at 2020 to provide context. Beginning in Q2, we saw abrupt shifts in consumer behavior across our industry due to the pandemic, resulting from the implementation of stay-at-home orders. 
This led to more consumers repairing their own vehicles, which drove DIY growth. In addition, our DIY online business surged as many consumers chose to shop from home and leverage digital services. Finally, as we discussed last year, our research indicated that large box retailers temporarily deprioritize long-tail items such as auto parts in response to the pandemic. These and other factors resulted in robust sales growth and market share gains for our DIY business in 2020.
Contrary to historical trends, the confluence of these factors also led to a slight decline in our Professional business in Q2 2020. As we begin to lap this highly unusual time, we leveraged our extensive research on customer decision journeys. This enabled us to move quickly as customers shifted how they repaired and maintain their vehicles. Our sales growth and margin expansion in Q2 demonstrates the flexibility of our diversified asset base as we adapted to a very different environment in 2021. 
Specific to our Professional business, we began to see improving demand late in Q1 2021, which continued into Q2, resulting in double-digit comp sales growth. This is directly related to the factors just discussed, along with improved mobility trends as more people return to work and miles driven increased versus the previous year. Strategic investments are strengthening our professional customer value proposition. It starts with improved availability and getting parts closer to the customer as we leverage our dynamic assortment machine learning platform. 
Within our Advance Pro catalog, we saw improved key performance indicators across the board, including more online traffic, increased assortment and conversion rates, and ultimately, growth in transaction count and average ticket. We also continue to invest in our technical training programs to help installers better serve their customers. Our TechNet program is also performing well as we continue to expand our North American TechNet members, providing them with a broad range of services. Each of these Pro-focused initiatives has been a differentiator for Advance, enabling us to increase first call status with both national strategic accounts and local independent shops. 
Finally, we're pleased that through the first half of the year, we added 28 net new independent Carquest stores. We also announced the planned conversion of an additional 29 locations in the West as Baxter Auto Parts joined the Carquest family. We're excited to combine our differentiated Pro customer value proposition with an extremely strong family business, highlighted by Baxter's excellent relationships with their customers in this growing market. In summary, all of our professional banners performed at or above our expectations in Q2, including our Canadian business despite stringent lockdowns. 
Moving to DIY omni-channel. Our business performed in line with expectations, considering our strong double-digit increases in 2020. While Q2 DIY comp sales were down slightly, DIY omnichannel was still the larger contributor to our 2-year growth. DIY growth versus a year ago gradually moderated throughout the quarter as some consumers return to professional [ horizons. ] 
Within DIY omnichannel, we saw a shift in consumer behavior back to in-store purchases, consistent with broader retail. We've also been working to optimize and reduce inefficient online discounts. These factors, along with highly effective advertising, contributed to an increase in our DIY in-store mix and a significant increase in gross margins versus prior year. We remain focused on improving the DIY experience to increase share of wallet through our Speed Perks loyalty platform. We made several upgrades to our mobile app to make it easier for Speed Perks members to see their status and access rewards. We continue to see positive graduation rates among our existing Speed Perk members. 
In Q2, our VIP membership grew by 8% and our LEAP members, representing the highest tier of customer spend, increased 21%. Shifting to operating income. We expanded margin in the quarter on top of significant margin expansion in Q2 2020. This was led by our category management initiatives, which drove strong gross margin expansion in the quarter. First, our work on strategic sourcing remains a key focus as consistent sales growth over several quarters resulted in an increase in supplier incentives. Secondly, we've talked about growing owned brands as a percent of our total sales. This has been a thoughtful and gradual conversion, and we began to see the benefits of several quarters of hard work in Q2. This was highlighted by our first major category conversion with steering and suspension, where we saw extremely strong unit growth for our high-margin Carquest premium products. 
In addition, the CQ product is highly regarded by our professional installers with consistent high level of quality standards that are now delivering lower defect rates and improved customer satisfaction. We also recently celebrated the 1-year anniversary of the DieHard battery launch. Following strong year 1 share gains in DIY omnichannel, we've now extended DieHard distribution into the professional sales to where we're off to a terrific start. Further expansion of the DieHard and Carquest brands is planned for other relevant categories. In terms of strategic pricing, we significantly improved our capabilities, leveraging our new enterprise pricing platform. This platform enabled us to respond quickly as inflation escalated beyond our initial expectations for the year. 
Moving to supply chain. While we're continuing to execute our initiatives, we faced several unplanned offsetting headwinds in Q2. Like most retailers, we experienced disruption within the global supply chain, wage inflation in our distribution centers, and an overall shortage of workers to process a continued high level of demand. In addition, our suppliers experienced labor challenges and raw material shortages. Despite a challenging external environment, we continue to execute our internal supply chain initiatives. This includes the implementation of our new warehouse management system, or WMS, which we're on track to complete in 2022. 
In the DCs that we've converted, we're delivering improvements in fill rate, on-hand accuracy and productivity. The implementation of WMS is a critical component of our new labor management system, or LMS. Once completed, LMS will standardize operating procedures and enable performance-based compensation. We also continue to execute our cross-banner replenishment, or CBR initiative, transitioning stores to the most freight logical servicing DC. In Q2, we converted nearly 150 additional stores and remain on track with the completion of the originally planned stores by the end of Q3 2021. In addition to CBR, we're on track with the integration of Worldpac and Autopart International, which is expected to be completed early next year. 
Shifting to SG&A. We lapped several cost reduction actions in Q2 2020, which we knew we would not replicate in 2021. We discussed these actions on our Q2 call last year, primarily a reduction in delivery costs as a result of a substantial channel mix shift, along with the reduction in store labor costs at the beginning of the pandemic. Jeff will discuss these in more detail in a few minutes. In terms of our initiatives, we continue to make progress on sales and profit per store. Our team delivered sales per store improvement, and we remain on track to reach our goal of $1.8 million average sales per store within our time line. 
Our profit per store is also growing faster than sales per store, enabling 4-wall margin expansion. In addition to the positive impacts of operational improvements we've implemented to drive sales and profit per store, we've also done a lot of work pruning underperforming stores, and we're back to store growth. In the first half of the year, we opened 6 Worldpac branches, 12 Advance and Carquest stores, and added 28 net new Carquest independents as discussed earlier. We also announced the planned conversion of 109 Pep Boys locations in California. We're very excited about our California expansion with the opening of our first group of stores scheduled this fall. 
The resurgence of the Delta variant has resulted in some construction-related delays in our store opening schedule. We expect to complete the successful conversion of all stores to the Advanced banner by the end of the first quarter 2022. Finally, we are focused on reducing our corporate and other SG&A costs, including a continued focus on safety. Our total recordable injury rate decreased 19% compared to Q2 2020 and 36% compared to Q2 2019. We're also finishing up our finance ERP consolidation, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Separately, we're in the early stages of integrating our merchandising systems to a single platform. Both these large-scale technology platforms are expected to drive SG&A savings over time. 
The last component of our SG&A cost reduction was a review of our corporate structure. In terms of the restructuring of our corporate functions announced earlier this year, savings were limited in Q2 due to the timing of the actions. We expect SG&A savings associated with the restructure beginning in Q3. 
In summary, we're very pleased with our team's dedication to caring for our customers and delivering strong financial performance in Q2. We're optimistic as the industry-related drivers of demand continue to indicate a favorable long-term outlook for the automotive aftermarket. We remain focused on executing our long-term strategy to grow above the market, expand margins, and return significant excess cash back to shareholders. 
Now let me pass it to Jeff to discuss more details on our financial results."

I want to echo Tom's thanks to our team members who continue to prioritize the health and safety of our customers and their fellow team members while helping to deliver solid results for the quarter. 
In Q2, our net sales increased 5.9% to $2.6 billion. Adjusted gross profit margin expanded 239 basis points to 46.4%, primarily as a result of the ongoing execution of our category management initiatives, including strategic sourcing, strategic pricing and own brand expansion. We also experienced favorable inventory-related costs versus the prior year. These benefits were partially offset by inflationary cost in supply chain and unfavorable channel mix. In the quarter, same-SKU inflation was approximately 2%, and we expect this will increase through the balance of the year. 
We're working with our supplier partners to mitigate costs where possible. Year-to-date, gross margin improved 156 basis points compared to the first half of 2020. As anticipated, Q2 adjusted SG&A expenses increased year-over-year and were up $109 million versus 2020. This deleveraged 228 basis points and was a result of 3 primary factors: first, our incentive compensation was much higher than the prior year, primarily in our Professional business as we left a very challenging quarter in 2020 when Pro sales were negative. Second, we experienced wage inflation beyond our expectations in stores. We remain focused on attracting, retaining and developing the very best parts people in the business and will continue to be competitive. We expect bolt headwinds to continue in the back half of the year. Third, and as expected, we incurred incremental costs associated with professional delivery and normalized hours of operation when compared to Q2 2020. These increases in Q2 were partially offset by a decrease in COVID-19-related expenses to approximately $4 million compared to $15 million in the prior year. 
As a result of these factors, our SG&A expenses increased 13.3% to $926.4 million. As a percent of net sales, our SG&A was 35% compared to 32.7% in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date SG&A as a percent of net sales improved 88 basis points compared to the first half of 2020. While we've seen a decrease in COVID-19-related costs year-to-date, the health and safety of our team members and customers will continue to be our top priority. As the current environment remains volatile, and the Delta variant remains a concern, we may see increased COVID-19 expenses in the back half of the year. 
Our adjusted operating income increased to $302 million compared to $282 million 1 year ago. On a rate basis, our adjusted OI margin expanded by 11 basis points to 11.4%. Finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15.3% to $3.40 compared to $2.95 in Q2 of 2020. Our free cash flow for the first half of the year was $646.6 million, an increase of $338.4 million compared to last year. This increase was driven in part by our operating income growth, along with continued momentum in our working capital initiatives. Our capital spending was $58.7 million for the quarter and $129.6 million year-to-date. We expect our investments to ramp up in the back half of the year. and in line with our guidance, we estimate we will spend between $300 million and $350 million in 2021. 
Due to favorable market conditions, along with our improved free cash flow in Q2, we returned nearly $458 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of 2 million shares at an average price of $197.52 and our recently increased quarterly cash dividend of $1 per share. We're pleased with our performance during the first half of the year and moving into the first 4 weeks of Q3 on a 2-year stack, our comparable store sales are in line with Q2. We're continuing to monitor the COVID-19 situation as well as other macro factors, which may put pressure on our results, including inflationary costs in commodities, wages and transportation. 
Based on all these factors, we're increasing our full year 2021 guidance ranges, including net sales in the range of $10.6 billion to $10.8 billion, comparable store sales of 6% to 8%, and adjusted operating income margin of 9.2% to 9.4%. As you heard from Tom, on our new store openings, we've encountered some delays in the construction process of converting Pep Boys stores, primarily permitting and obtaining building materials related to the ongoing pandemic. As a result, we're lowering our guidance range and now expect to open 80 to 120 new stores this year. Additionally, given the improvement of our free cash flow and our accelerated share repurchases in the first half of the year, we're also increasing our guidance for free cash flow to a minimum of $700 million and an expected range for share repurchases of $700 million to $900 million. 
We remain committed to delivering against our long-term strategy as we execute against our plans to deliver strong and sustainable total shareholder return. Now let's open the call for your questions. Operator?"

That 3-week period, we can see our growth. It was over 50% in those weeks and they get replaced by a couple of weeks in July. Our quarter ended on July 17. So it's really around the timing piece. As far as we're concerned, you've normalized the calendar for the months of April through June. We're performing very well in relative terms. 
So in general, this is a very fragmented industry as well. There's lots of room for everyone to grow. We have just 7% of the total market. We're also pleased that we were able to grow margins -- gross margins in the quarter on top of the sales growth. So again, when we normalize our quarter relative to our peers, we feel very good about our sales performance."

And I think that just about even it out, in fact, we might actually be a little bit better on a relative basis when you take out those $4 million. In terms of inflation, we certainly experienced inflation throughout the P&L. And the wage inflation was higher than our expectations. Certainly, the product costs are well within our expectations. They are a little over 2%. But just kind of stepping back, if we continue to execute our margin expansion initiatives, especially in gross margin, many of what you saw this quarter, we think that's going to continue into the back half of the year. 
And keep in mind, a lot of our SG&A initiatives that we laid out in April either don't start in '21 at all or just begin in the back half of '21. So for example, that $30 million of restructuring, we're not going to start seeing that until the back half. So that will help us somewhat. But SG&A is going to be challenged throughout the balance of the year, but we're confident we can continue with our gross margin and hopefully continue to show positive operating margins."

We're pleased with the -- not only the 1 year, but the 2-year improvement in the second quarter on margin expansion is over 200 bps. The big thing that's starting to kick in for us and is sustainable is the category management initiatives. I mean we've been working on those for a couple of years. We've said all along it's going to take time. We've had several quarters, 5 quarters in a row of growth now. The last couple of years, we only have the one difficult quarter in early 2020. And that's helped us on the sourcing side and vendor incentives piece. The rollout of our own brands, which as you know, given the turns in our category, has taken time. But that is really starting to benefit our P&L. 
There's a significant difference in the margin rate between the Carquest premium own brand products and some of the alternatives that we have there. And as you know, we implemented that pricing tool in the middle of last year, and that also hasn't enabled us to be a lot smarter in how we price, whether that's regionally or by channel or by account, all of those things. So clearly, the category management initiatives are going to be sustainable for us. The supply chain initiatives, we're going to continue to execute against. They're very much on track. 
What we're dealing with on the unknown side is just the ongoing inflationary environment. And in the second quarter, we saw that coming. We dealt with it. We feel confident this is an industry that's been able to deal with unplanned inflation very successfully over many years. So that's the approach that we're going to take. But the gross margin initiatives, we feel very strong -- very good about and we believe are sustainable, and we're going to continue to execute that."

Again, in the second quarter of 2020, people were locked in their homes. They had time on their hands. They were doing things that they wouldn't normally do, including DIY automotive. So as we get back into more of a normalized environment here where people are commuting, they're going out to baseball games and traveling on airplanes and all the things that they do. They lose that time, and then they're going to obviously get their car repaired and maintained by a professional. It's more likely that they would do that. 
And also in the second quarter last year, many of the professional garages were closed for a period of time, so they couldn't even get them repaired at the garage. So it's really held up more than we would have expected. And we're very pleased with our DIY performance in the quarter. we can see that we held on to customers that joined us last year.

So first of all, we do think we're going to still generate meaningful operating cash in the back half. But that's going to be largely offset by 3 things. First is our capital expenditures. We still have a very robust plan in the back half to invest back in the business, investing in our margin expansion objectives. And so the CapEx spend will be elevated as compared to the second half. As you saw, we held our guidance there at $300 million to $350 million for the year. 
Second, and related to the first question, we are going to be making investments in inventory that will likely increase our inventory in the back half to support what Tom just said, both the in-stocks as well as our new store openings. So that will put some pressure on our working capital. And then the last thing is we have a couple of expenditures that we didn't see in the first half, we have to repay half of the CARES Act. So if you recall, we didn't have to make the cash payment on the employer payroll tax last year. We have to pay back half of that this year in the fourth quarter. And then we do have an additional rent payment due to the timing of our fiscal year end. So those are really the drivers for the lower free cash flows compared to the first half."

We hope you're all healthy and safe amid the ongoing pandemic and recent surge of the Delta variant. I'd like to start by thanking the entire Advance and Carquest independent family for your hard work to serve our customers throughout the quarter. It's because of you that we're reporting the positive growth in sales, profit and earnings per share we're reviewing today.
In Q2, we continued to deliver strong financial performance on both the 1- and 2-year stack as we began lapping more difficult comparisons. In the quarter, we delivered comparable store sales growth of 5.8%, and adjusted operating income margin of 11.4%, an increase of 11 basis points versus 2020. As a reminder, we lapped a highly unusual quarter from 2020, where we significantly reduced hours of operation and professional delivery expenses reflective of the channel shift from pro to DIY.
As we anticipated, the professional business accelerated in Q2 2021, and between our ongoing strategic initiatives and additional actions, we expanded margins. Our actions offset known headwinds within SG&A and an extremely competitive environment for talent. 
On a 2-year stack, our comp sales improved 13.3%, and margins expanded 227 basis points compared to Q2 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS of $3.40 increased 15.3% compared to Q2 2020 and 56.7% compared to 2019. Year-to-date, free cash flow more than doubled, which led to a higher-than-anticipated return of cash to shareholders in the first half of the year, returning $661.4 million through a combination of share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. 
Our sales growth and margin expansion were driven by a combination of industry-related factors as well as internal operational improvements. On the industry side, the macroeconomic backdrop remained positive in the quarter as consumers benefited from the impact of government stimulus.
Meanwhile, long-term industry drivers of demand continued to improve. This includes a gradual recovery in miles driven, along with an increase in used car sales, which contributes to an aging fleet. While we delivered positive comp sales in all 3 periods of Q2, our year-over-year growth slowed late in the quarter as we lapped some of our highest growth weeks of 2020. Our category growth was led by strength in brakes, motor oil and filters with continued momentum in key hard part professional categories. 
Regionally, the West led our growth, benefiting from an unusually hot summer, followed by the Southwest, Northeast and Florida. To summarize channel performance, we saw double-digit growth in our professional business and a slight decline in our DIY omnichannel business. 
To understand the shift in our channel mix, it's important to look back at 2020 to provide context. Beginning in Q2, we saw abrupt shifts in consumer behavior across our industry due to the pandemic, resulting from the implementation of stay-at-home orders. This led to more consumers repairing their own vehicles, which drove DIY growth. 
In addition, our DIY online business surged as many consumers chose to shop from home and leverage digital services. Finally, as we discussed last year, our research indicated that large box retailers temporarily deprioritize long-tail items, such as auto parts, in response to the pandemic. These and other factors resulted in robust sales growth and market share gains for our DIY business in 2020. Contrary to historical trends, the confluence of these factors also led to a slight decline in our professional business in Q2 2020. 
As we begin to lap this highly unusual time, we leveraged our extensive research on customer decision journeys. This enabled us to move quickly as customers shifted how they repaired and maintained their vehicles. Our sales growth and margin expansion in Q2 demonstrates the flexibility of our diversified asset base as we adapted to a very different environment in 2021. 
Specific to our professional business, we began to see improving demand late in Q1 2021, which continued into Q2, resulting in double-digit comp sales growth. This is directly related to the factors just discussed, along with improved mobility trends as more people return to work and miles driven increased versus the previous year. 
Strategic investments are strengthening our professional customer value proposition. It starts with improved availability and getting parts closer to the customer as we leverage our dynamic assortment machine learning platform.
Within our Advance Pro catalog, we saw improved key performance indicators across the board, including more online traffic, increased assortment and conversion rates, and ultimately, growth in transaction count and average ticket. We also continued to invest in our technical training programs to help installers better serve their customers. Our TechNet program is also performing well as we continue to expand our North American TechNet members, providing them with a broad range of services. Each of these pro-focused initiatives has been a differentiator for Advance, enabling us to increase first-call status with both national strategic accounts and local independent shops.
Finally, we're pleased that through the first half of the year, we added 28 net new independent Carquest stores. We also announced the planned conversion of an additional 29 locations in the West as Baxter Auto Parts joins the Carquest family. We're excited to combine our differentiated pro customer value proposition with an extremely strong family business, highlighted by Baxter's excellent relationships with their customers in this growing market. In summary, all of our professional banners performed at or above our expectations in Q2, including our Canadian business despite stringent lockdowns. 
Moving to DIY omnichannel. Our business performed in line with expectations considering our strong double-digit increases in 2020. While Q2 DIY comp sales were down slightly, DIY omnichannel was still the larger contributor to our 2-year growth. DIY growth versus a year ago gradually moderated throughout the quarter as some consumers return to professional garages.
Within DIY omnichannel, we saw a shift in consumer behavior back to in-store purchases, consistent with broader retail. We've also been working to optimize and reduce inefficient online discounts. These factors, along with highly effective advertising, contributed to an increase in our DIY in-store mix and a significant increase in gross margins versus prior year. We remain focused on improving the DIY experience to increase share of wallet through our Speed Perks loyalty platform. We made several upgrades to our mobile app to make it easier for Speed Perks members to see their status and access rewards. 
We continue to see positive graduation rates among our existing Speed Perk members. In Q2, our VIP membership grew by 8%, and our Elite members, representing the highest tier of customer spend, increased 21%.
Shifting to operating income. We expanded margin in the quarter on top of significant margin expansion in Q2 2020. This was led by our category management initiatives, which drove strong gross margin expansion in the quarter. First, our work on strategic sourcing remains a key focus as consistent sales growth over several quarters resulted in an increase in supplier incentives. 
Secondly, we've talked about growing owned brands as a percent of our total sales. This has been a thoughtful and gradual conversion, and we began to see the benefits of several quarters of hard work in Q2. This was highlighted by our first major category conversion with steering and suspension, where we saw extremely strong unit growth for our high-margin Carquest premium products. 
In addition, the CQ product is highly regarded by our professional installers with consistent high level of quality standards that are now delivering lower defect rates and improved customer satisfaction. 
We also recently celebrated the 1-year anniversary of the DieHard battery launch. Following strong year 1 share gains in DIY omnichannel, we've now extended DieHard distribution into the professional sales channel, where we're off to a terrific start. Further expansion of the DieHard and Carquest brands is planned for other relevant categories. 
In terms of strategic pricing, we significantly improved our capabilities, leveraging our new enterprise pricing platform. This platform enabled us to respond quickly as inflation escalated beyond our initial expectations for the year. 
Moving to supply chain. While we're continuing to execute our initiatives, we faced several unplanned offsetting headwinds in Q2. Like most retailers, we experienced disruption within the global supply chain, wage inflation in our distribution centers, and an overall shortage of workers to process a continued high level of demand. In addition, our suppliers experienced labor challenges and raw material shortages. 
Despite a challenging external environment, we continue to execute our internal supply chain initiatives. This includes the implementation of our new warehouse management system, or WMS, which we're on track to complete in 2022. In the DCs that we've converted, we're delivering improvements in fill rate, on-hand accuracy and productivity. The implementation of WMS is a critical component of our new labor management system, or LMS. Once completed, LMS will standardize operating procedures and enable performance-based compensation. 
We also continue to execute our cross-banner replenishment, or CBR initiative, transitioning stores to the most freight-logical service in DC. In Q2, we converted nearly 150 additional stores and remain on track with the completion of the originally planned stores by the end of Q3 2021. 
In addition to CBR, we're on track with the integration of Worldpac and Autopart International, which is expected to be completed early next year. 
Shifting to SG&A. We lapped several cost reduction actions in Q2 2020, which we knew we would not replicate in 2021. We discussed these actions on our Q2 call last year. Primarily a reduction in delivery costs as a result of a substantial channel mix shift, along with the reduction in store labor costs at the beginning of the pandemic. Jeff will discuss these in more detail in a few minutes. 
In terms of our initiatives, we continue to make progress on sales and profit per store. Our team delivered sales per store improvement, and we remain on track to reach our goal of $1.8 million average sales per store within our time line. 
Our profit per store is also growing faster than sales per store, enabling 4-wall margin expansion. In addition to the positive impacts of operational improvements we've implemented to drive sales and profit per store, we've also done a lot of work pruning underperforming stores, and we're back to store growth. In the first half of the year, we opened 6 Worldpac branches, 12 Advance and Carquest stores, and added 28 net new Carquest independents as discussed earlier. We also announced the planned conversion of 109 Pep Boys locations in California. We're very excited about our California expansion with the opening of our first group of stores scheduled this fall. 
The resurgence of the Delta variant has resulted in some construction-related delays in our store opening schedule. We expect to complete the successful conversion of all stores to the Advance banner by the end of the first quarter 2022. 
Finally, we are focused on reducing our corporate and other SG&A costs, including a continued focus on safety. Our total recordable injury rate decreased 19% compared to Q2 2020 and 36% compared to Q2 2019. We're also finishing up our finance ERP consolidation, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Separately, we're in the early stages of integrating our merchandising systems to a single platform. Both these large-scale technology platforms are expected to drive SG&A savings over time.
The last component of our SG&A cost reduction was a review of our corporate structure. In terms of the restructuring of our corporate functions announced earlier this year, savings were limited in Q2 due to the timing of the actions. We expect SG&A savings associated with the restructure beginning in Q3.
In summary, we're very pleased with our team's dedication to caring for our customers and delivering strong financial performance in Q2. We're optimistic as the industry-related drivers of demand continue to indicate a favorable long-term outlook for the automotive aftermarket. We remain focused on executing our long-term strategy to grow above the market, expand margins, and return significant excess cash back to shareholders.
Now let me pass it to Jeff to discuss more details on our financial results."

I want to echo Tom's thanks to our team members, who continue to prioritize the health and safety of our customers and their fellow team members while helping to deliver solid results for the quarter. 
In Q2, our net sales increased 5.9% to $2.6 billion. Adjusted gross profit margin expanded 239 basis points to 46.4%, primarily as a result of the ongoing execution of our category management initiatives, including strategic sourcing, strategic pricing and owned brand expansion. We also experienced favorable inventory-related costs versus the prior year. These benefits were partially offset by inflationary cost in supply chain and unfavorable channel mix. 
In the quarter, same-SKU inflation was approximately 2%, and we expect this will increase through the balance of the year. We're working with our supplier partners to mitigate costs where possible. 
Year-to-date, gross margin improved 156 basis points compared to the first half of 2020. As anticipated, Q2 adjusted SG&A expenses increased year-over-year and were up $109 million versus 2020. This deleveraged 228 basis points and was a result of 3 primary factors: First, our incentive compensation was much higher than the prior year, primarily in our professional business as we lapped a very challenging quarter in 2020 when pro sales were negative. Second, we experienced wage inflation beyond our expectations in stores. We remain focused on attracting, retaining and developing the very best parts people in the business and will continue to be competitive. We expect both headwinds to continue in the back half of the year. 
Third, and as expected, we incurred incremental costs associated with professional delivery and normalized hours of operation when compared to Q2 2020. These increases in Q2 were partially offset by a decrease in COVID-19-related expenses to approximately $4 million compared to $15 million in the prior year. 
As a result of these factors, our SG&A expenses increased 13.3% to $926.4 million. As a percent of net sales, our SG&A was 35% compared to 32.7% in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date SG&A as a percent of net sales improved 88 basis points compared to the first half of 2020. 
While we've seen a decrease in COVID-19-related costs year-to-date, the health and safety of our team members and customers will continue to be our top priority. As the current environment remains volatile, and the Delta variant remains a concern, we may see increased COVID-19 expenses in the back half of the year.
Our adjusted operating income increased to $302 million compared to $282 million 1 year ago. On a rate basis, our adjusted OI margin expanded by 11 basis points to 11.4%. Finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15.3% to $3.40 compared to $2.95 in Q2 of 2020. Our free cash flow for the first half of the year was $646.6 million, an increase of $338.4 million compared to last year. This increase was driven in part by our operating income growth, along with continued momentum in our working capital initiatives. 
Our capital spending was $58.7 million for the quarter and $129.6 million year-to-date. We expect our investments to ramp up in the back half of the year, and in line with our guidance, we estimate we will spend between $300 million and $350 million in 2021. Due to favorable market conditions, along with our improved free cash flow in Q2, we returned nearly $458 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of 2 million shares at an average price of $197.52 and our recently increased quarterly cash dividend of $1 per share. 
We're pleased with our performance during the first half of the year and moving into the first 4 weeks of Q3, on a 2-year stack, our comparable store sales are in line with Q2. We're continuing to monitor the COVID-19 situation as well as other macro factors, which may put pressure on our results, including inflationary costs in commodities, wages and transportation. Based on all these factors, we're increasing our full year 2021 guidance ranges, including net sales in the range of $10.6 billion to $10.8 billion, comparable store sales of 6% to 8%, and adjusted operating income margin of 9.2% to 9.4%. 
As you heard from Tom on our new store openings, we've encountered some delays in the construction process of converting Pep Boys stores, primarily permitting and obtaining building materials related to the ongoing pandemic. As a result, we're lowering our guidance range and now expect to open 80 to 120 new stores this year. Additionally, given the improvement of our free cash flow and our accelerated share repurchases in the first half of the year, we're also increasing our guidance for free cash flow to a minimum of $700 million and an expected range for share repurchases of $700 million to $900 million.
We remain committed to delivering against our long-term strategy as we execute against our plans to deliver strong and sustainable total shareholder return. Now let's open the call for your questions. Operator?"

This is one of those unusual quarters where the timing of the quarter makes a very big difference. If you think about our quarter that started on April 25, we didn't have the first 24 days of April. That 3-week period, we can see our growth. It was over 50% in those weeks, and they get replaced by a couple of weeks in July. Our quarter ended on July 17. So it's really around the timing piece. 
As far as we're concerned, it's -- we've normalized the calendar for the months of April through June. We're performing very well in relative terms. 
So in general, this is a very fragmented industry as well. There's lots of room for everyone to grow. We have just 7% of the total market. We're also pleased that we were able to grow margins -- gross margins in the quarter on top of the sales growth. So again, when we normalize our quarter relative to our peers, we feel very good about our sales performance."

In fact, we might actually be a little bit better on a relative basis when you take out those $4 million. 
In terms of inflation, we certainly experienced inflation throughout the P&L. And the wage inflation was higher than our expectations. Certainly, the product costs are well within our expectations. They are a little over 2%. But just kind of stepping back, if we continue to execute our margin expansion initiatives, especially in gross margin, many of which you saw this quarter, we think that's going to continue into the back half of the year.
And keep in mind, a lot of our SG&A initiatives that we laid out in April either don't start in '21 at all or just begin in the back half of '21. So for example, that $30 million of restructuring, we're not going to start seeing that until the back half. So that will help us somewhat. But SG&A is going to be challenged throughout the balance of the year, but we're confident we can continue with our gross margin and, hopefully, continue to show positive operating margins."

Now we did see favorability with some of those inventory-related items, namely capitalized supply chain costs, but those were essentially offset by the supply chain headwinds and channel mix.

We're pleased with the -- not only the 1 year, but the 2-year improvement in the second quarter on margin expansions over 200 bps. The big thing that's starting to kick in for us and is sustainable is the category management initiatives. I mean we've been working on those for a couple of years. We've said all along it's going to take time. 
We've had several quarters, 5 quarters in a row of growth now. The last couple of years, we only have the one difficult quarter in early 2020. And that's helped us on the sourcing side and vendor incentives piece. The rollout of our owned brands, which as you know, given the turns in our category, has taken time. But that is really starting to benefit our P&L.
There's a significant difference in the margin rate between the Carquest premium owned brand products and some of the alternatives that we have there. And as you know, we implemented that pricing tool in the middle of last year, and that also has enabled us to be a lot smarter in how we price, whether that's regionally or by channel or by account, all of those things. So clearly, the category management initiatives are going to be sustainable for us. The supply chain initiatives, we're going to continue to execute against. They're very much on track.
What we're dealing with on the unknown side is just the ongoing inflationary environment. And in the second quarter, we saw that coming. We dealt with it. We feel confident. This is an industry that's been able to deal with unplanned inflation very successfully over many years. So that's the approach that we're going to take.

So first of all, we do think we're going to still generate meaningful operating cash in the back half. But that's going to be largely offset by 3 things. 
First is our capital expenditures. We still have a very robust plan in the back half to invest back in the business, investing in our margin expansion objectives. And so the CapEx spend will be elevated as compared to the second half. As you saw, we held our guidance there at $300 million to $350 million for the year. 
Second, and related to the first question, we are going to be making investments in inventory that will likely increase our inventory in the back half to support what Tom just said, both the in-stocks as well as our new store openings. So that will put some pressure on our working capital. 
And then the last thing is we have a couple of expenditures that we didn't see in the first half. We have to repay half of the CARES Act. So if you recall, we didn't have to make the cash payment on the employer payroll tax last year. We have to pay back half of that this year in the fourth quarter. And then we do have an additional rent payment due to the timing of our fiscal year-end. So those are really the drivers for the lower free cash flows compared to the first half."

We've got a very unique program called Fuel the Frontline, which provides stock to our frontline team members. No one else in the industry has that. We've invested over $60 million there. And as we look at our store team, we want to keep that turnover number down as low as possible. So there are markets where we made investments in the quarter in the stores. 
Supply chain is a very challenging situation. We are seeing inflation there, as we called out, more than we expected. The turnover, I think has peaked and started to come down is what I would tell you there. Obviously, as some of the benefits, the unemployment benefits, et cetera, start to come off, we are seeing more applicants and able to source the people that we need.

We hope that you and your families are healthy and safe. I'd like to start by thanking the Advance team and Carquest independents for their hard work and perseverance through these challenging times.  Their continued dedication to provide outstanding service to our customers allowed us to deliver another quarter of top line sales growth, adjusted margin expansion and a double-digit increase in earnings per share. 
We've been investing in both our team and our business over multiple years to transform and better leverage Advance's assets. In Q3, this helped enable us to comp the comp until our strongest quarterly comparable store sales growth of 2020. Specifically, we delivered comp store sales growth of 3.1% while sustaining an identical 2-year stack of 13.3% compared with Q2. 
As expected, this was led by the continued recovery of our professional business, and a gradual improvement in key urban markets. By putting DIY consumers of Pro customers at the center of every decision we make, we've been able to respond quickly to evolving needs. 
In Q3, this was highlighted by an overall channel shift back to Professional and a return to stores for DIYers. Within Professional, we're seeing increasing strength in certain geographies which lagged the rest of the country last year as the ongoing return to office of professional workers in large urban markets, catches up with the rest of the country. 
Our diversified digital and physical asset base has enabled us to respond rapidly to these changing channel dynamics in the current environment. In addition, we also delivered significant improvements in our adjusted gross margin rate of 246 basis points, led by our category management initiatives. Our adjusted SG&A costs as a percentage of net sales were 209 basis points higher as we lapped a unique quarter in Q3 2020. 
As we've discussed over the past year, our SG&A costs were much lower than normal in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. This was due to an unusually high DIY sales mix and actions we took last year during the initial stages of the pandemic, which were not repeated. Overall, we delivered adjusted operating income margin expansion of 37 basis points to 10.4% versus Q3 2020. 
Adjusted diluted EPS of $3.21 increased 21.6% compared with Q3 2020 and 31% compared with the same period of 2019. Our year-to-date adjusted earnings per share are up approximately 50% compared with 2020. Year-to-date, our balance sheet remains strong with a 19% increase in free cash flow to $734 million, while returning a record $953 million to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. 
Consistent with the front half of the year, there were several industry-related factors, coupled with operational improvements contributing to our sales growth and margin expansion in Q3. As discussed in our April investor presentation, the 3 primary external drivers of industry demand are still improving versus prior year, and the outlook remains positive. 
The car park continues to grow slightly. The fleet is aging and perhaps most importantly, vehicle miles driven continue to improve versus both 2020 and 2019. More broadly, the chip shortage continues to impact availability of new vehicles and is contributing to a surge in used car sales. 
This benefits our industry as consumers are repairing and maintaining their vehicles longer. As we all know, over the last 18 months, the pandemic changed consumer behavior across our industry which led to a surge in DIY omnichannel growth in 2020, while the professional business declined. 
However, as the economy continues to reopen, with miles driven steadily increasing, our professional business is now consistently exceeding pre-pandemic levels as discussed last quarter. Regional performance was led by the Southwest and West. Category growth was led by brakes, motor oil and filters as miles driven reliant categories improved versus a softer 2020. 
We also saw continued strength in DieHard batteries, which led the way on a 2-year stack basis. Each of these categories performed well as a result of the diligent planning between our merchant and supply chain teams, enabling a strong competitive position despite global supply chain disruptions. 
At the same time, we experienced challenges in Q3 as we strategically transitioned tens of thousands of undercar and engine management SKUs to own brand. Importantly, these in-stock positions are now significantly improved, and we're confident these initiatives will help drive future margin expansion. 
Overall, comp sales were positive in all 3 periods of Q3, led by Professional. DIY omnichannel delivered slightly positive comp growth in Q3 while lapping high double-digit growth in the prior year. Within professional we navigated a very challenging global supply chain environment to allow us to say yes to our customers. 
The investments we've made in our supply chain, inventory positioning and in our dynamic assortment tool helped put us in a favorable position competitively. We've implemented the dynamic assortment tool in all company-owned U.S. stores as well as over 800 independent locations. Our MyAdvance portal and embedded Advance Pro catalog continues to be a differentiator for us while driving online traffic. 
Our online sales to professional customers continues to grow as we strengthen the speed and functionality of Advance Pro. We remain committed to providing our industry-leading assortment of parts for all professional customers. This will help enable us to grow first call status and increase share of wallet in a very fragmented market. 
In addition, we expanded DieHard to our professional customers. Following a recent independent consumer survey, DieHard stake disclaims as America's most trusted auto battery. During Q3, we announced a multiyear agreement with our national customer Bridgestone to sell DieHard batteries in more than 2,200 tire and vehicle service centers across the United States. 
With this system-wide rollout during Q3, we replaced their previous battery provider, making us the exclusive battery supplier across all Bridgestone locations. In terms of our independent business, we added 16 net new independent Carquest stores in the quarter, bringing our total to 44 net new this year. 
We continue to grow our independent business through differentiated offerings for our Carquest partners, including our new Carquest by Advance banner program, which we announced earlier this month. As we continue to build and strengthen the Advance brand and our DIY business, Carquest by Advance adds DIY relevance for our Carquest branded independent partners while providing incremental traffic and margin opportunities. 
We've recently enrolled this new initiative out to our independent partners and look forward to further expansion over time for both new and existing Carquest independents. Transitioning to DIY omnichannel. Comparable store sales were slightly positive in Q3. As you'll recall, our DIY omnichannel business reported strong double-digit comp sales growth in Q3 2020. 
We continue to enhance our offerings and execute our long-term strategy to differentiate our DIY business and increased market share. In Q3, we continue to leverage our Speed Perks loyalty program as VIP membership grew by 13% and our number of Elite members representing the highest tier of customer spend increased 21%. 
Last year, the launch of our Advance same-day suite of services helped enable a huge surge in e-commerce growth. This year, as DIYers return to our stores, in-store sales growth led our DIY sales growth. Part of this was expected due to a planned reduction in inefficient online discounts, which significantly increased gross margins. 
Turning to margin expansion. We again increased our adjusted operating income margin in the quarter. Like Q2, this was driven by category management actions within gross margin, where our key initiatives played a role. First, we are realizing benefits from our new strategic pricing tools and capabilities. 
Like other companies, we're experiencing higher-than-expected inflation. However, our team has been able to respond rapidly in this dynamic environment as industry pricing remains rational. Behind strategic sourcing, vendor income was positive versus the previous year with continued strong sales growth. 
Finally, double-digit revenue growth and own brand outpaced our overall growth in the quarter as we expanded the Carquest brand into new categories. Carquest products have a lower price per unit than comparable branded products which reduced comp and net sales growth in the quarter as expected. At the same time, the margin rate for owned brands is much higher and contributed to the Q3 adjusted gross margin expansion. 
Shifting to supply chain. We continue to make progress on our productivity initiatives. In Q3, the benefits from these initiatives were more than offset by widely documented disruptions and inflationary pressure within the global supply chain. As a result, we did not leverage supply chain in the quarter. 
We completed the rollout of cross-banner replenishment or CBR for the originally planned group of stores in the quarter. The completion of this milestone is driving cost savings through a reduction in stem miles from our DCs to stores. Over the course of our implementation, our team identified additional stores that will be added over time. 
Secondly, we're continuing the implementation of our new warehouse management system or WMS. This is helping to deliver further improvements in fill rate, on-hand accuracy and productivity. We successfully transitioned to our new WMS and approximately 36% of our distribution center network as measured by unit volume. 
As previously communicated, we followed WMS with a new labor management system, or LMS, which drive standardization and productivity. We are on track to complete the WMS and LMS implementations by the end of 2023 as discussed in April. 
Further, our consolidation efforts to integrate Worldpac and Autopart International, known as AI, are also on track to be completed by early next year. This is enabling accelerated growth gross margin expansion and SG&A savings. Gross margin expansion here comes behind the expanded distribution of AI's high-margin owned brand products, such as shocks and struts, to the larger Worldpac customer base. 
Finally, as we expand our store footprint, we're also enhancing our supply chain capabilities on the West Coast with the addition of a much larger and more modern DC in San Bernardino. This facility will the consolidation point for supplier shipments for the Western U.S. and enable rapid e-commerce delivery. In addition, we began to work to consolidate our DC network in the Greater Toronto area, 2 separate distribution centers, 1 Carquest and 1 Worldpac will be transitioned into a single brand-new facility that will allow us to better serve growing demand in the Ontario market. 
Turning to SG&A. We continue to execute our initiatives, both sales and profit per store along with the reduction of corporate SG&A. As previewed on our Q2 call, we also faced both planned and unplanned inflationary cost pressure versus the prior year in Q3. SG&A headwinds include higher-than-planned store labor cost per hour, higher incentive compensation and increased delivery costs associated with the recovery of our Professional business. Jeff will discuss these and other SG&A details in a few minutes. 
We remain on track with our sales and profit per store initiative, including our average sales per store objective of $1.8 million per store by 2023. In terms of new locations year-to-date, we've opened 19 stores, 6 new Worldpac branches and converted 44 net new locations to the Carquest independent family. This puts our net new locations at 69, including stores, branches and independents during the first 3 quarters. 
Separately, we're actively working to convert the 109 locations in California we announced in April. However, we're experiencing construction-related delays, primarily due to a much slower-than-normal permitting process. This is attributable to more stringent guidelines associated with COVID-19, which were exacerbated by the surge of the Delta variant. We now expect the majority of the store openings planned for 2021 to shift into 2022. As a result, we're incurring start-up costs within SG&A for the balance of the year while realizing less-than-planned revenue and income. 
The good news is we remain confident that once converted, these stores will be accretive to our growth trajectory. The final area of margin expansion is reducing our corporate and other SG&A costs. We began to realize some of the cost benefits related to the restructuring of our corporate functions announced earlier this year in addition to savings from our continued focus on Team Member safety. 
In Q3, we saw a 22% reduction in our total recordable injury rate compared with the prior year. Our lost time injury rate improved 14% compared with the same period in 2020. Our focus on Team Member safety is only 1 component of our ESG agenda at Advance. Our vision advancing a world in motion is demonstrated by the objective we outlined last April to deliver top quartile total shareholder return in the 2021 through 2023 time frame. 
While delivering this goal, we're also focused on ESG. As part of this commitment, we launched our first materiality assessment earlier this year to help prioritize ESG initiatives. During Q3, we completed this assessment and are working to finalize the findings. The results will be incorporated in our 2021 Corporate Sustainability Report, which we expect to publish in mid-2022. 
Before turning the call over to Jeff, I want to recognize all team members and generous customers for their contribution to our recent American Heart Association campaign. This year, we introduced a new technology solution in stores that allows customers to round up at the point of sale. This made it even easier for customers to participate and helped us achieve a record-setting campaign of $1.7 million. 
The mission of this organization is important to all of us across the Advance family, and I want to personally thank everyone for helping making this our most successful campaign to date. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff for more details on our financial performance."

I would like to start by thanking our team members who prioritize the health and safety of our customers and solid team members while continuing to deliver exceptional results through an uncertain and challenging times. 
In Q3, our net sales increased 3.1% to $2.6 billion. Adjusted gross profit margin improved 246 basis points to 46.2% primarily the result of our ongoing category management initiatives, including strategic pricing, strategic sourcing, own brand expansion and favorable product mix. 
Consistent with last quarter, these were partially offset by inflationary product and supply chain costs as well as an unfavorable channel mix. In the quarter, same-SKU inflation was approximately 3.6% which was our plan entering the year and was by far the largest headwind we had overcome within gross profit. 
We're working with all our supplier partners to mitigate costs where possible. Year-to-date, adjusted gross margin improved 184 basis points compared with the same period of 2020. As expected, our Q3 SG&A expenses increased due to several factors we discussed earlier in the year. As a percent of net sales, our adjusted SG&A deleveraged by 209 basis points, driven primarily by labor costs, which included a meaningful cost per hour increase as well as higher incentive compensation compared to the prior year. 
In addition, we incurred higher delivery expenses related to serving our Professional customers and approximately $10 million in start-up costs related to the conversion of our California locations in Q3. Year-to-date, SG&A as a percent of net sales was relatively flat compared to the same period of 2020, increasing 9 basis points year-over-year. 
While we've reduced our COVID-19-related costs by $13 million year-to-date, the health and safety of our team members and customers continues to be our top priority. Our adjusted operating income increased to $274 million in Q3 compared to $256 million 1 year ago. On a rate basis, our adjusted OI margin expanded by 37 basis points to 10.4%. 
Finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 21.6% to $3.21 compared to $2.64 in Q3 of 2020. Compared with 2019, adjusted diluted EPS was up 31% in the quarter. Our free cash flow for the first 9 months of the year was $734 million, an increase of 19% versus last year. This increase was primarily driven by improvements in our operating income as well as our continued focus on working capital metrics, including our accounts payable ratio, which expanded 351 basis points versus Q3 2020.  
Year-to-date through Q3, our capital investments were $191 million. We continue to focus on maintaining sufficient liquidity while returning excess cash to shareholders. In Q3, we returned approximately $228 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of 1.1 million shares at an average price of $205.65. Year-to-date, we returned approximately $792 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of nearly 4.2 million shares at an average price of $189.43. 
Since restarting our share repurchase program in Q3 of 2018, we returned over $2 billion in share repurchases at an average share price of approximately $164. Additionally, we paid a cash dividend of $1 per share in the quarter totaling $63 million. As we mentioned in our press release yesterday, our Board once again approved a quarterly cash dividend of $1 per share. 
We remain confident in our ability to generate meaningful cash from our business and expect to return excess cash to our shareholders in a balanced approach between dividends and buybacks. As you saw in yesterday's 8-K filing with the SEC, we recently closed the refinancing of our new 5-year revolving credit facility. The prior facility was set to mature in January 2023. The bank markets have returned to pre-pandemic levels, we took the opportunity to secure our liquidity for another 5 years. 
This included improved pricing and terms while also increasing the overall facility size to $1.2 billion. We have strong relationships with our banks, and this commitment allows us to secure future financial flexibility. More details of this facility can be found in our 8-K filings. 
Turning to our updated full year outlook. We are increasing 2021 sales and profit guidance to reflect the positive results year-to-date and our expectations for the balance of the year. Through the first 4 weeks of Q4, we're continuing to see sales strength in our 2-year stack remaining in line with what we delivered in the last 2 quarters. This guidance incorporates continued top line strength, ongoing inflationary headwinds and up to an additional $10 million in startup costs related to our West Coast expansion. 
As discussed, the construction environment in California remains challenging resulting in a reduction of our guidance from new store openings and capital expenditures. As a result, we're updating our full year 2021 guidance to net sales of $10.9 billion to $10.95 billion; comparable store sales of 9.5% to 10%; adjusted operating income margin rate of 9.4% to 9.5%, a minimum of 30 new stores this year, a minimum of $275 million in CapEx and a minimum of $725 million in free cash flow. 
In summary, we're very excited about our current momentum. We remain focused on the execution of the long-term strategy while delivering top quartile total shareholder return over the 2021 to 2023 time frame. Now let's open the call for your questions. Operator?"

Well, first of all, on the geography front, our leading geographies for the West and Southwest, 2 of our smaller regions. We're really excited about our performance out there. We're gaining share out there, but they're smaller. We haven't seen the Northeast come back at the level we would have liked on a 2-year stack basis. So that's kind of the geography point. 
I think just to go back to the framework we shared in April, we're targeting top quartile total shareholder return. And there's 3 components to that. The first 1 is comp sales, and it's very important. I mean, we've got 7% of the industry sales, and we want to grow above the market and comp sales are very important. 
The second is to significantly expand our margins and the third is to return a substantial amount of cash back to our shareholders. We think we've got a unique opportunity as a company. With top quartile, we said we would deliver 20% to 22% total shareholder return over the next couple of years, and we delivered about 22% EPS growth in the quarter. 
So we think that's going to stack up really well. I will say that we wish our comp sales would have been higher in the quarter. And I think the thing that we called out in the script pertain to our -- a couple of categories that we made a pretty big change in. I think our supply chain and merchant team did a terrific job on the sourcing front in terms of brakes and batteries and filters. We had a very strong quarter on those categories. 
In terms of engine management, it's steering and suspension, we transitioned tens of thousands of SKUs in the quarter to Carquest own brand. And given the current global supply chain environment, it was just challenging. They've got -- our in-stocks were just not where we wanted them to be overall. And in the end, I think in the quarter, the category changes we made ended up giving us some short-term pain in the quarter, but it's definitely for long-term gain. 
This is a huge move for us. We're in much better shape now than we were this summer. And our customers love this product. It's a great product. It's OE quality. It's selling extremely well. Our in-stock rates are improving. And obviously, we love the margin rate. So we didn't like the in-stock this summer on those categories. But the move is highly consistent with our plan to drive total shareholder return. And we believe that it will be a big margin driver for us next year into 2022."

Well, the short answer is DIFM is continuing to recover as we expected, but we are encouraged by the strength and resiliency of the DIY business, which has pretty consistently performed above our expectations throughout the year. And the Pro, once again, wasn't a surprise. We felt it was going to leave the way as people return to offices and school and started to travel again for both personal and business. 
These kind of consumer dynamics that were created by the pandemic created an increased need for people having their vehicle. It's been a positive on miles driven and our industry overall. But in terms of DIY, we've seen some interesting and also positive trends. You've got consumers picking up hobbies like they're detailing their cars. You've got people keeping their cars longer because they can't find a new one, they're buying recreational vehicles to visit parts of the country they've never seen before. 
And even in urban markets, you've got some people that have bought cars because they're no longer comfortable with mass transit. So it's difficult to say how sticky some of these trends are going to be. But we're seeing robust demand across both DIY and DIFM, and we're excited by that. It's a very good time for the industry."

So I mentioned the change with steering and suspension and engine management. We've got a terrific product that's at a lower price point. So that gives the customer some options that honestly we didn't have before, and we have the advantage of that being a much higher margin than the alternatives. 
So I am concerned about it. We're going to watch it very closely.

As always, we hope that you and your families are healthy and safe. I'd like to start by thanking the Advance team and Carquest independents for their hard work and perseverance through",2287,"Thanks, Elisabeth, and good morning to all of you joining us today.  As always, we hope that you and your families are healthy and safe. I'd like to start by thanking the Advance team and Carquest independents for their hard work and perseverance through these challenging times.  Their continued dedication to provide outstanding service to our customers allowed us to deliver another quarter of top line sales growth, adjusted margin expansion and a double-digit increase in earnings per share.  
We've been investing in both our team and our business over multiple years to transform and better leverage Advance's assets. In Q3, this helped enable us to comp the comp on top of our strongest quarterly comparable store sales growth of 2020. Specifically, we delivered comp store sales growth of 3.1% while sustaining an identical 2-year stack of 13.3% compared with Q2.  
As expected, this was led by the continued recovery of our professional business, and a gradual improvement in key urban markets. By putting DIY consumers of Pro customers at the center of every decision we make, we've been able to respond quickly to evolving needs.  
In Q3, this was highlighted by an overall channel shift back to Professional and a return to stores for DIYers. Within Professional, we're seeing increasing strength in certain geographies  which lagged the rest of the country last year as the ongoing return to office of professional workers in large urban markets, catches up with the rest of the country.  
Our diversified digital and physical asset base has enabled us to respond rapidly to these changing channel dynamics in the current environment. In addition, we also delivered significant improvements in our adjusted gross margin rate of 246 basis points, led by our category management initiatives. Our adjusted SG&A costs as a percentage of net sales were 209 basis points higher as we lapped a unique quarter in Q3 2020.  
As we've discussed over the past year, our SG&A costs were much lower than normal in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. This was due to an unusually high DIY sales mix and actions we took last year during the initial stages of the pandemic, which were not repeated. Overall, we delivered adjusted operating income margin expansion of 37 basis points to 10.4% versus Q3 2020.
Adjusted diluted EPS of $3.21 increased 21.6% compared with Q3 2020 and 31% compared with the same period of 2019. Our year-to-date adjusted earnings per share are up approximately 50% compared with 2020. Year-to-date, our balance sheet remains strong with a 19% increase in free cash flow to $734 million, while returning a record $953 million to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends.  
Consistent with the front half of the year, there were several industry-related factors, coupled with operational improvements contributing to our sales growth and margin expansion in Q3. As discussed in our April investor presentation, the 3 primary external drivers of industry demand are still improving versus prior year, and the outlook remains positive.  
The car park continues to grow slightly. The fleet is aging and perhaps most importantly, vehicle miles driven continue to improve versus both 2020 and 2019. More broadly, the chip shortage continues to impact availability of new vehicles and is contributing to a surge in used car sales.  
This benefits our industry as consumers are repairing and maintaining their vehicles longer. As we all know, over the last 18 months, the pandemic changed consumer behavior across our industry which led to a surge in DIY omnichannel growth in 2020, while the professional business declined.  
However, as the economy continues to reopen, with miles driven steadily increasing, our professional business is now consistently exceeding pre-pandemic levels as discussed last quarter. Regional performance was led by the Southwest and West. Category growth was led by brakes, motor oil and filters as miles driven reliant categories improved versus a softer 2020.  
We also saw continued strength in DieHard batteries, which led the way on a 2-year stack basis. Each of these categories performed well as a result of the diligent planning between our merchant and supply chain teams, enabling a strong competitive position despite global supply chain disruptions.  
At the same time, we experienced challenges in Q3 as we strategically transitioned tens of thousands of undercar and engine management SKUs to own brand. Importantly, these in-stock positions are now significantly improved, and we're confident these initiatives will help drive future margin expansion.  
Overall, comp sales were positive in all 3 periods of Q3, led by Professional. DIY omnichannel delivered slightly positive comp growth in Q3 while lapping high double-digit growth in the prior year. Within professional we navigated a very challenging global supply chain environment to allow us to say yes to our customers.  
The investments we've made in our supply chain, inventory positioning and in our dynamic assortment tool helped put us in a favorable position competitively. We've implemented the dynamic assortment tool in all company-owned U.S. stores as well as over 800 independent locations. Our my Advance portal and embedded Advance Pro catalog continues to be a differentiator for us while driving online traffic.  
Our online sales to professional customers continues to grow as we strengthen the speed and functionality of Advance Pro. We remain committed to providing our industry-leading assortment of parts for all professional customers. This will help enable us to grow first call status and increase share of wallet in a very fragmented market.  
In addition, we expanded DieHard to our professional customers. Following a recent independent consumer survey, DieHard staked its claim as America's most trusted auto battery. During Q3, we announced a multiyear agreement with our national customer Bridgestone to sell DieHard batteries in more than 2,200 tire and vehicle service centers across the United States.  
With this system-wide rollout during Q3, we replaced their previous battery provider, making us the exclusive battery supplier across all Bridgestone locations. In terms of our independent business, we added 16 net new independent Carquest stores in the quarter, bringing our total to 44 net new this year.  
We continue to grow our independent business through differentiated offerings for our Carquest partners, including our new Carquest by Advance banner program, which we announced earlier this month. As we continue to build and strengthen the Advance brand and our DIY business, Carquest by Advance adds DIY relevance for our Carquest branded independent partners while providing incremental traffic and margin opportunities.  
We've recently enrolled this new initiative out to our independent partners and look forward to further expansion over time for both new and existing Carquest independents. Transitioning to DIY omnichannel. Comparable store sales were slightly positive in Q3. As you'll recall, our DIY omnichannel business reported strong double-digit comp sales growth in Q3 2020.  
We continue to enhance our offerings and execute our long-term strategy to differentiate our DIY business and increased market share. In Q3, we continue to leverage our Speed Perks loyalty program as VIP membership grew by 13% and our number of Elite members representing the highest tier of customer spend increased 21%.  
Last year, the launch of our Advance same-day suite of services helped enable a huge surge in e-commerce growth. This year, as DIYers return to our stores, in-store sales growth led our DIY sales growth. Part of this was expected due to a planned reduction in inefficient online discounts, which significantly increased gross margins.  
Turning to margin expansion. We again increased our adjusted operating income margin in the quarter. Like Q2, this was driven by category management actions within gross margin, where our key initiatives played a role. First, we are realizing benefits from our new strategic pricing tools and capabilities.  
Like other companies, we're experiencing higher-than-expected inflation. However, our team has been able to respond rapidly in this dynamic environment as industry pricing remains rational. Behind strategic sourcing, vendor income was positive versus the previous year with continued strong sales growth.  
Finally, double-digit revenue growth and own brand outpaced our overall growth in the quarter as we expanded the Carquest brand into new categories. Carquest products have a lower price per unit than comparable branded products, which reduced comp and net sales growth in the quarter as expected. At the same time, the margin rate for owned brands is much higher and contributed to the Q3 adjusted gross margin expansion.  
Shifting to supply chain. We continue to make progress on our productivity initiatives. In Q3, the benefits from these initiatives were more than offset by widely documented disruptions and inflationary pressure within the global supply chain. As a result, we did not leverage supply chain in the quarter.  
We completed the rollout of cross-banner replenishment or CBR for the originally planned group of stores in the quarter. The completion of this milestone is driving cost savings through a reduction in stem miles from our DCs to stores. Over the course of our implementation, our team identified additional stores that will be added over time.  
Secondly, we're continuing the implementation of our new warehouse management system or WMS. This is helping to deliver further improvements in fill rate, on-hand accuracy and productivity. We successfully transitioned to our new WMS and approximately 36% of our distribution center network as measured by unit volume.  
As previously communicated, we followed WMS with a new labor management system, or LMS, which drive standardization and productivity. We are on track to complete the WMS and LMS implementations by the end of 2023 as discussed in April.  
Further, our consolidation efforts to integrate Worldpac and Autopart International, known as AI, are also on track to be completed by early next year. This is enabling accelerated growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A savings. Gross margin expansion here comes behind the expanded distribution of AI's high-margin owned brand products, such as shocks and struts, to the larger Worldpac customer base.  
Finally, as we expand our store footprint, we're also enhancing our supply chain capabilities on the West Coast with the addition of a much larger and more modern DC in San Bernardino. This facility will serve as the consolidation point for supplier shipments for the Western U.S. and enable rapid e-commerce delivery. In addition, we began to work to consolidate our DC network in the Greater Toronto area, 2 separate distribution centers, 1 Carquest and 1 Worldpac will be transitioned into a single brand-new facility that will allow us to better serve growing demand in the Ontario market.  
Turning to SG&A, we continue to execute our initiatives, both sales and profit per store along with the reduction of corporate SG&A. As previewed on our Q2 call, we also faced both planned and unplanned inflationary cost pressure versus the prior year in Q3. SG&A headwinds include higher-than-planned store labor cost per hour, higher incentive compensation and increased delivery costs associated with the recovery of our Professional business. Jeff will discuss these and other SG&A details in a few minutes.  
We remain on track with our sales and profit per store initiative, including our average sales per store objective of $1.8 million per store by 2023. In terms of new locations year-to-date, we've opened 19 stores, 6 new Worldpac branches and converted 44 net new locations to the Carquest independent family. This puts our net new locations at 69, including stores, branches and independents during the first 3 quarters.  
Separately, we're actively working to convert the 109 locations in California we announced in April. However, we're experiencing construction-related delays, primarily due to a much slower-than-normal permitting process. This is attributable to more stringent guidelines associated with COVID-19, which were exacerbated by the surge of the Delta variant. We now expect the majority of the store openings planned for 2021 to shift into 2022. As a result, we're incurring start-up costs within SG&A for the balance of the year while realizing less-than-planned revenue and income. 
The good news is we remain confident that once converted, these stores will be accretive to our growth trajectory. The final area of margin expansion is reducing our corporate and other SG&A costs. We began to realize some of the cost benefits related to the restructuring of our corporate functions announced earlier this year in addition to savings from our continued focus on Team Member safety. 
In Q3, we saw a 22% reduction in our total recordable injury rate compared with the prior year. Our lost time injury rate improved 14% compared with the same period in 2020. Our focus on Team Member safety is only 1 component of our ESG agenda at Advance. Our vision advancing a world in motion is demonstrated by the objective we outlined last April to deliver top quartile total shareholder return in the 2021 through 2023 time frame. 
While delivering this goal, we're also focused on ESG. As part of this commitment, we launched our first materiality assessment earlier this year to help prioritize ESG initiatives. During Q3, we completed this assessment and are working to finalize the findings. The results will be incorporated in our 2021 Corporate Sustainability Report, which we expect to publish in mid-2022. 
Before turning the call over to Jeff, I want to recognize all team members and generous customers for their contribution to our recent American Heart Association campaign. This year, we introduced a new technology solution in stores that allows customers to round up at the point of sale. This made it even easier for customers to participate and helped us achieve a record-setting campaign of $1.7 million. 
The mission of this organization is important to all of us across the Advance family, and I want to personally thank everyone for helping making this our most successful campaign to date. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff for more details on our financial performance."

I would like to start by thanking our team members who prioritize the health and safety of our customers and solid team members while continuing to deliver exceptional results through an uncertain and challenging times. 
In Q3, our net sales increased 3.1% to $2.6 billion. Adjusted gross profit margin improved 246 basis points to 46.2% primarily the result of our ongoing category management initiatives, including strategic pricing, strategic sourcing, own brand expansion and favorable product mix. 
Consistent with last quarter, these were partially offset by inflationary product and supply chain costs as well as an unfavorable channel mix. In the quarter, same-SKU inflation was approximately 3.6%, which was                 our plan entering the year and was by far the largest headwind we had overcome within gross profit. 
We're working with all our supplier partners to mitigate costs where possible. Year-to-date, adjusted gross margin improved 184 basis points compared with the same period of 2020. As expected, our Q3 SG&A expenses increased due to several factors we discussed earlier in the year. As a percent of net sales, our adjusted SG&A deleveraged by 209 basis points, driven primarily by labor costs, which included a meaningful cost per hour increase as well as higher incentive compensation compared to the prior year. 
In addition, we incurred higher delivery expenses related to serving our Professional customers and approximately $10 million in start-up costs related to the conversion of our California locations in Q3. Year-to-date, SG&A as a percent of net sales was relatively flat compared to the same period of 2020, increasing 9 basis points year-over-year. 
While we've reduced our COVID-19-related costs by $13 million year-to-date, the health and safety of our team members and customers continues to be our top priority. Our adjusted operating income increased to $274 million in Q3 compared to $256 million 1 year ago. On a rate basis, our adjusted OI margin expanded by 37 basis points to 10.4%. 
Finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 21.6% to $3.21 compared to $2.64 in Q3 of 2020. Compared with 2019, adjusted diluted EPS was up 31% in the quarter. Our free cash flow for the first 9 months of the year was $734 million, an increase of 19% versus last year. This increase was primarily driven by improvements in our operating income as well as our continued focus on working capital metrics, including our accounts payable ratio, which expanded 351 basis points versus Q3 2020.  
Year-to-date through Q3, our capital investments were $191 million. We continue to focus on maintaining sufficient liquidity while returning excess cash to shareholders. In Q3, we returned approximately $228 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of 1.1 million shares at an average price of $205.65. Year-to-date, we returned approximately $792 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of nearly 4.2 million shares at an average price of $189.43. 
Since restarting our share repurchase program in Q3 of 2018, we returned over $2 billion in share repurchases at an average share price of approximately $164. Additionally, we paid a cash dividend of $1 per share in the quarter totaling $63 million. As we mentioned in our press release yesterday, our Board once again approved a quarterly cash dividend of $1 per share. 
We remain confident in our ability to generate meaningful cash from our business and expect to return excess cash to our shareholders in a balanced approach between dividends and buybacks. As you saw in yesterday's 8-K filing with the SEC, we recently closed the refinancing of our new 5-year revolving credit facility. The prior facility was set to mature in January 2023. The bank markets have returned to pre-pandemic levels, we took the opportunity to secure our liquidity for another 5 years. 
This included improved pricing and terms while also increasing the overall facility size to $1.2 billion. We have strong relationships with our banks, and this commitment allows us to secure future financial flexibility. More details of this facility can be found in our 8-K filings. 
Turning to our updated full year outlook, we are increasing 2021 sales and profit guidance to reflect the positive results year-to-date and our expectations for the balance of the year. Through the first 4 weeks of Q4, we're continuing to see sales strength in our 2-year stack remaining in line with what we delivered in the last 2 quarters. This guidance incorporates continued top line strength, ongoing inflationary headwinds and up to an additional $10 million in startup costs related to our West Coast expansion. 
As discussed, the construction environment in California remains challenging, resulting in a reduction of our guidance from new store openings and capital expenditures. As a result, we're updating our full year 2021 guidance to net sales of $10.9 billion to $10.95 billion; comparable store sales of 9.5% to 10%; adjusted operating income margin rate of 9.4% to 9.5%, a minimum of 30 new stores this year, a minimum of $275 million in CapEx and a minimum of $725 million in free cash flow. 
In summary, we're very excited about our current momentum. We remain focused on the execution of the long-term strategy while delivering top quartile total shareholder return over the 2021 to 2023 time frame. Now let's open the call for your questions. Operator?"

Well, first of all, on the geography front, our leading geographies for the West and Southwest, 2 of our smaller regions. We're really excited about our performance out there. We're gaining share out there, but they're smaller. We haven't seen the Northeast come back at the level we would have liked on a 2-year stack basis. So that's kind of the geography point. 
I think just to go back to the framework we shared in April, we're targeting top quartile total shareholder return. And there's 3 components to that. The first one is comp sales, and it's very important. I mean, we've got 7% of the industry sales, and we want to grow above the market and comp sales are very important. 
The second is to significantly expand our margins and the third is to return a substantial amount of cash back to our shareholders. We think we've got a unique opportunity as a company. With top quartile, we said we would deliver 20% to 22% total shareholder return over the next couple of years, and we delivered about 22% EPS growth in the quarter. 
So we think that's going to stack up really well. I will say that we wish our comp sales would have been higher in the quarter. And I think the thing that we called out in the script pertaining to our -- a couple of categories that we made a pretty big change in. I think our supply chain and merchant team did a terrific job on the sourcing front in terms of brakes and batteries and filters. We had a very strong quarter on those categories. 
In terms of engine management, it's steering and suspension, we transitioned tens of thousands of SKUs in the quarter to Carquest own brand. And given the current global supply chain environment, it was just challenging. They've got -- our in-stocks were just not where we wanted them to be overall. And in the end, I think in the quarter, the category changes we made ended up giving us some short-term pain in the quarter, but it's definitely for long-term gain. 
This is a huge move for us. We're in much better shape now than we were this summer. And our customers love this product. It's a great product. It's OE quality. It's selling extremely well. Our in-stock rates are improving. And obviously, we love the margin rate. So we didn't like the in-stock this summer on those categories. But the move is highly consistent with our plan to drive total shareholder return. And we believe that it will be a big margin driver for us next year into 2022."

And in some cases, certainly in the summer, where we were making a transition, and we didn't have something that we would have lost that sale. I don't know that we were able to pick up everything that we would have liked in the summer. But as that comes back in, we're starting to see those categories bounce back nicely.

These kind of consumer dynamics that were created by the pandemic created an increased need for people having their vehicle. It's been a positive on miles driven and our industry overall. But in terms of DIY, we've seen some interesting and also positive trends. You've got consumers picking up hobbies like they're detailing their cars. You've got people keeping their cars longer because they can't find a new one, they're buying recreational vehicles to visit parts of the country they've never seen before. 
And even in urban markets, you've got some people that have bought cars because they're no longer comfortable with mass transit. So it's difficult to say how sticky some of these trends are going to be. But we're seeing robust demand across both DIY and DIFM, and we're excited by that. It's a very good time for the industry."

Like I said, we want to be cautious going into the fourth quarter. It's our lowest revenue quarter of the year. So when you've got a fixed cost in SG&A, like we have, having that lower top line revenue makes it a little bit harder to flow it through. And we just want to be cautious. We've seen volatility in the past. And while we're off to a great start, we would want to make sure that we're being cautious as we finish out the year."

If you remember, last year, we had very robust transaction growth in DIY. On the Pro side, our sales per account up double digits. And if I look at our transactions with the largest segment of accounts, it was up significantly on both a 1- and 2-year basis. The big strategic accounts, our TechNet customers. We're really pleased to be growing our share of wallet with our biggest accounts because that really drives more loyalty. It means we're selling more of the whole job to the customer. 
There's obviously a lot of variables that go into transaction growth, changing vehicle technology, shipping channel dynamics. We love to get the whole job in 1 transaction for our Pro customers, which is always the goal. So we're very focused on growing both transactions and dollars per transaction, but that's kind of what happened in the quarter."

The industry fundamentals are healthy, and we're continuing to execute against our long-term strategic plans. And we also have a lot to be grateful for.

Advance is proud to honor these men and women through their incredible events as on our service team network posted last week. As we continue to celebrate our veterans through our continued partnership with organizations that help support service members, including building homes for heroes.
