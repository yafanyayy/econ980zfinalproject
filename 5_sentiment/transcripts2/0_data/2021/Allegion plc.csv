2020 was an extremely difficult year, perhaps the most challenging that I have encountered during my career. I want to take the time to acknowledge the sacrifice and hard work of our employees in helping Allegion deliver strong results in the face of the obstacles presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thank you for your diligence, flexibility and perseverance. 
Please go to Slide 4. Despite the pressures posed by the global pandemic, Allegion experienced only a modest top line revenue decline in 2020, and we saw pockets of strength during the year. The business, as you may remember, performed extremely well in the first quarter and in the second half of the year. The Americas residential business, the Simonsvoss business, Interflex and Global Portable Security businesses in Europe realized good growth. 
Although revenue was down modestly for the year, we expanded adjusted operating margins by 20 basis points, aided by quickly implementing restructuring and cost management actions to mitigate the volume-related COVID-19 impacts. 
Allegion produced record adjusted earnings per share and increased available cash flow by more than $20 million versus the prior year. 
We strengthened foundational elements of Allegion's culture around safety, sustainability, inclusion, diversity and engagement which will help drive our continued success as a company. I'm very proud of our commitment to employee safety and customer excellence, which remain top priorities. In 2020, we made improvements in all of our employee safety metrics which are already industry leading. This has and will be our North Star. I believe that the time and resources we had invested in safety since spin paid us back in 2020. We were able to keep our essential employees working and took extra protections to keep people safe, whether they were on the sites or working remotely. And our dedication to customer excellence allowed us to better serve our customers. 
Today, Allegion is greener and cleaner, reducing greenhouse gases and water usage throughout the year. 
We paid considerable attention to drive progress on inclusion and diversity, creating a strategic framework and leadership commitment to our action agenda. Our team is significantly more engaged, meaning our global employees are more committed to our vision and our workforce than ever before. 
All Allegion employees are surveyed annually by Gallup in their native language. Our engagement has seen solid improvements since we have been a stand-alone company. 
Please go to Slide 5, and I'll walk you through the fourth quarter financial summary. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $727.3 million, an increase of 1.1%. Organic revenue declined 0.6%. Currency tailwinds more than offset the organic revenue decline and the impact of divestitures. Organic revenue in the quarter included Americas residential, Simonsvoss, Interflex and Global Portable Security in Europe and Australia and New Zealand and the Asia Pacific. These gains were offset by expected headwinds experienced in our Americas nonresidential business. Patrick will share more detail on the regions in a moment. 
Adjusted operating margin increased by 150 basis points in the fourth quarter as we saw the benefits from restructuring and cost-reduction actions mitigate deleverage from volume declines. 
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.49 increased $0.21, more than 16% versus the prior year. High operating income, favorable share count and year-over-year tax rate accounted for the increase. 
Available cash flow for the year came in at $443.2 million, an increase of over $20 million versus the prior year. Higher adjusted earnings and lower capital expenditures were the driving forces for the increase. 
I encourage all of you to review the body of work and execution of the Allegion team globally versus our competitors and peers in 2020. Solid top line performance in a pandemic, margin expansion and record cash flows. 
During the year, we leaned out our structure, increased our investment in technology and retained our go-to-market resources and strengthened the engagement of our worldwide team in a pandemic, positioning Allegion to exit the COVID plague as a stronger company. 
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our strategic agenda and 2021 outlook."

Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide #6. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter 2019, reported earnings per share was $0.86. Ad",998,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. 
Please go to Slide #6. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter 2019, reported earnings per share was $0.86. Adjusting $0.42 for charges related to restructuring, trade name impairments as well as loss on divestitures in Turkey and Colombia, the 2019 adjusted earnings per share was $1.28. Operational earnings were the primary driver for the year-over-year increase. As indicated, operational results increased earnings per share by $0.13 as favorable price, productivity and material deflationary impacts more than offset reduced volume-related deleverage as well as plant inefficiencies due to COVID-19. Favorable year-over-year tax rate and share count drove another $0.06 and $0.02 increase, respectively. Interest and other income were slightly positive and offset the slight reduction associated with incremental investments during the quarter. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2020 earnings per share of $1.49, an increase of $0.21 or 16.4% compared to the prior year. 
Lastly, we have a $0.48 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring, M&A costs, impairments as well as a loss on held-for-sale assets. This is related to our decision to divest the QMI door business in the Middle East which is expected to close in Q1 subject to normal regulatory approvals. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the fourth quarter 2020 reported earnings per share of $1.01. 
Please go to Slide #7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year 2020. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. 
As indicated, we experienced a 0.6% organic revenue decline in the fourth quarter. As shown in the trending chart, we saw sequential improvement in the organic revenue decline as well as positive total growth of 1.1%, with currency tailwinds mitigating the organic decline and divestitures. Price continued to remain strong and helped to offset some of the volume decline. 
With the fourth quarter performance, you can see that total revenue was down 4.7% for the full year with organic revenue decline of 4.8%. All 3 regions ended the year down organically, with Americas down 4.2%, EMEA lower by 5.1% and Asia Pacific off 10.6%. All regions experienced organic revenue declines from the prior year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Please go to Slide #8. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $521.2 million, down 1% and down 0.7% on an organic basis. The region continued to deliver solid price realization. On volume, Americas residential was outstanding, experiencing mid-20s percent growth, boosted by robust retail point of sale, new home construction and electronics growth, which nearly offset the expected decline in the nonresidential business caused by lower new construction and discretionary project delays. 
Electronics revenue was slightly down with good growth in residential offset by reduced commercial electronics driven by delays in discretionary projects. We continue to see electronics and touchless solutions as long-term growth drivers and expect electronics' accelerated growth to resume when market conditions normalize. 
Americas adjusted operating income of $148.5 million decreased 3.5% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 70 basis points. The decrease was driven primarily by volume deleverage, plant inefficiencies due to the challenges from COVID-19 and unfavorable mix, partially offset by benefits from cost-reduction actions, restructuring benefits and material deflation. 
Please go to Slide #9. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEA region were $165.3 million, up 10.5% in total and up 3.1% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by good price realization and strength in our SimonsVoss, Interflex and Global Portable Security businesses. These businesses demonstrated resiliency throughout the year and are well positioned to continue profitable growth in 2021. Currency tailwinds added to the total growth. 
EMEA adjusted operating income of $24.9 million increased 49.1% versus the prior year period. And adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 390 basis points. Also note that these results absorbed a $5.1 million environmental remediation charge which had a 310 basis point negative impact on adjusted operating margins. The margin expansion was primarily driven by the organic growth leverage and the benefits of the restructuring and cost control actions taken throughout the year. 
Please go to Slide #10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $40.8 million, down 6.4% versus the prior year. Organic revenue was down 11.9%. The decline was driven by continued weakness in Korea and slightly offset by growth in Australia and New Zealand, particularly in the residential business. Currency tailwinds muted some of the organic revenue decline. 
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $8.2 million, an increase of $6.3 million, with adjusted operating margins up 1,570 basis points versus the prior year period. Approximately $4 million of the income increase was attributable to a gain on the sale of a building. Even excluding that, the benefits realized from restructuring and cost control actions drove substantial margin expansion. 
Please go to Slide #11. Available cash flow for 2020 came in at $443.2 million, which is an increase of $20.6 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by higher adjusted net earnings and lower capital expenditures. 
Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percent of revenues decreased based on a 4-point quarter average. This was driven by reduced working capital needs from the lower volume. 
The business continues to generate strong cash flow and conversion of net earnings. Liquidity in our capital structure are in a great position and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize working capital and drive effective cash flow conversion. 
We resumed share repurchases and acquired approximately 1.1 million shares for approximately $115 million during the fourth quarter. We also announced a 13% increase in our dividend payout later in March. 
I will now hand the call back over to Dave."

Please go to Slide #12. There's no doubt that throughout the fourth quarter and 2020 as a whole, our vision of seamless access and a safer world continued to drive our business forward. Despite the pandemic and resulting market headwinds, our vision and strategy are progressing on many fronts. We continued our commitments and investments to R&D in 2020, creating a robust pipeline of new product development projects across both our 4 brands and new electronic product offerings. Our recent acquisition of Yonomi is an example of it, infusing outside thinking and yet, in another way, we're making digital and software investments to meet customers' needs now and in the future. Yonomi will accelerate Allegion's digital journey and product offerings. 
And our vision remains anchored in our strategic pillars, delivering new value and access and to be the partner of choice, but also in the strength of our historic brands.

In fact, throughout the pandemic, Schlage, Von Duprin, SimonsVoss and Interflex, among others in our portfolio, demonstrated both flexibility and creativity to meet customers' immediate and changing needs. 
I couldn't be prouder of how our team grounded our company in sound business practices while strategically investing for our future to position Allegion for growth as markets rebound. 
I said this before and I'll say it again, because of how we've managed our business and how we are investing, and because of the engagement, commitment and resiliency of our employees, I believe we'll exit the pandemic stronger than when we started and we are committed to advancing environmental, social and governance topics. They are important to the company and the communities where we live. 
Please go to Slide 13. Another example from the quarter that demonstrates our focus on Allegion's future and our vision of seamless access is the creation of Allegion International. As we announced in December, Allegion International officially launched this year on January 1 as a consolidation of the former EMEA and Asia Pacific operating segments. Tim Eckersley is now leading Allegion International, and we are excited to leverage his broad experiences there as a veteran of the security industry and high-growth technologies and is a long time leader within our business. Creating Allegion International is designed to drive speed and efficiency by moving decisions closer to the customer, simplifying our operating segments and by reducing overhead in our non-U.S. operations. With this updating operating model in place, we expect to accelerate momentum in electronics growth, software and seamless access in those international markets. Again, we have elite brands with rich histories in Europe and Asia Pacific. 
While Tim is now leading the way for Allegion International, I want to welcome Luis Orbegoso as Senior Vice President of the Americas. If you haven't already, I encourage you to read our press release or look up Luis' bio on allegion.com. Luis brings a wealth of diverse leadership experiences, spanning multiple industries, geographies and cultures, and has a track record of guiding teams through transformation with a focus on operational and customer excellence. He possesses a deep understanding of smart home security, cloud technology, consumer access solutions as well as commercial and institutional safety which support our strategic priorities. 
Needless to say, Tim and Luis are both dedicated to our leadership commitments, delivering value to our customer and shareholders and driving our strategy forward. We are focused and disciplined heading into 2021. 
Please go to Slide 14. Looking ahead at the 2021 nonresidential business, it's important to understand the cyclical nature of this market and where we fit in. In general, we are a late cycle, meaning our products are installed up to 1 year, sometimes longer, after new construction projects start. Our views on commercial institutional markets have not changed. I expect new construction to remain soft this year, with institutional markets recovering faster than commercial. I also believe that this recovery will be faster than the 2008 downturn. And thus, we have maintained our sales and specification capability and capacity while continuing to invest in innovation. 
Relative to the broader market and competitors, Allegion continues to perform well. We continue to provide innovative solutions in our core markets as well as underserved market opportunities to drive profitable growth. As K-12 schools, college campuses and health care begin to normalize with regard to the pandemic, we would expect discretionary projects on the nonresidential side to pick up in the back half of the year as pent-up demand begins to break loose. 
The residential piece of the Americas business continues to be a bright spot and is expected to grow in 2021 as the undersupply of single-family homes continues to be corrected. In addition, the build -- in addition to the builder channel, DIY projects will continue to drive opportunities as consumers invest in their homes and adopt electronic solutions. We anticipate strength in residential to persist in the foreseeable future. 
Seamless access, software and electronics continue to be a long-term growth driver and will remain our top investment priority. They are the future of Allegion. 
With the strength in residential and softness in commercial and institutional, we project total organic revenue in the Americas to be down 3% to 4% in 2021. 
In the Allegion International segment, markets continue to recover and we expect growth in our electronics and system integration businesses of SimonsVoss and Interflex as well as Global Portable Security business. Currency tailwinds more than offset expected -- the expected divestiture of our QMI business and contribute to total growth. For the region, we project total growth of 6% to 7%, with organic growth of 2% to 3%. 
All in, for total Allegion, we are projecting total revenues to be down 0.5% to 1.5% and organic revenue to decline 1.5% to 2.5%. 
Please go to Slide 15. Our 2021 outlook for adjusted earnings per share is $4.70 to $4.85. As indicated, adjusted operating earnings are expected to decrease 5% to 8%, driven by reduced volumes, as a result of the nonresidential end markets, incremental investments and inflationary impacts. We are not immune to the macro inflationary headwinds, especially from steel and electronic components as well as with freight and transportation. For 2021, we expect an EPS headwind of $0.25 to $0.30 related to direct material input costs and freight inflation alone. We will continue to drive price and productivity to offset, but the net benefit will be less than prior years. 
Incremental investments continue to be a priority as we remain focused on accelerating electronics and seamless access growth in support of our vision and strategy. These incremental investments predominantly relate to added R&D and engineering capabilities to further develop, enhance and accelerate new product development. The combination of interest and other expense is expected to be a headwind as some of the more formidable items that we experienced in 2020 are nonrecurring. 
Our outlook assumes a full adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 12%, an increase from the 11.2% in 2020. It also assumes outstanding weighted average diluted shares of approximately 91 million. The outlook additionally includes $0.10 to $0.15 per share for restructuring charges during the year. As a result, reported EPS is projected to be $4.55 to $4.75. 
We are projecting our available cash flow for 2021 to be in the $400 million to $420 million range. 
Please go to Slide 16. We are pleased with our 2020 performance in a pandemic. We saw our expanded -- we saw expanded -- we expanded our operating margins, increased adjustable earnings per share and delivered higher available cash flow in a difficult macro environment in which we were operating. We have taken actions that will allow Allegion to be leaner and more focused in 2021. As we and the rest of the world navigate and emerge from the pandemic, Allegion will be a stronger company and we are positioned for long-term success. As always, our execution and commitment to driving solid results will remain high. Allegion's future is bright.

And then kind of things return, I'd say, more on a normalized basis in the back half of the year. 
So first half, it's going to be, say, down Q1, up Q2 and kind of more of a normalized basis, but continued strength in our residential business. 
Nonresidential, challenged first half of the year, but getting better as we progress throughout the year, particularly as it relates to discretionary project-based business. And when people start returning to work relative to the easing of the COVID impact, we should start seeing some improvement on that side of the business. 
Hopefully, that answers what you're looking for."

So a couple of things, and you touched on one specific relative to our investments that are incremental associated with R&D and engineering to really push forward the electronics, enhance our product offering going forward. Most of that incremental spend is attached to Americas. And so that alone will put pressure on the margin profile associated with Americas. 
In addition to that, you have the incremental inflation that we highlighted, $0.25 to $0.30 pressure on material input cost. We will do our best to offset that with pricing. But if we break even, just the [indiscernible] of the math would suggest you're going to have margin pressure attached to that. And then you layer on top of that the mix component, i.e., residential growing faster than non-residential and the nonresidential business profile having a higher-margin profile would suggest some additional mix there. 
So Americas margins will be under pressure in '21 associated with those 3 things. We will continue to drive productivity and those type of things to help mitigate that. But there's going to be margin pressure. 
Come to your second question relative to any growth in the increments associated with nonresidential? Yes. There's going to be some improvement if we can experience growth in the back half of the year. And you know how we've leveraged historically. I would expect that to continue. And let me make one more point. The margin profile for '21 being under pressure, I view as temporary, okay? This is a market dynamic. It's not a structural issue associated with Allegion. When business comes back, and it will, margin profiles will get better, okay? We will continue to grow margin. And we're not in a situation where we've maximized our margin going forward."

And I think our unique position on the door, along with partners, investment and further development, we can go in and solve new problems, like why does a building have to be open 16 hours a day? Why don't I allow that access through edge device? Or think about how people move through complex buildings, and I know you have, Jeff.

2020 was an extremely difficult year, perhaps the most challenging that I have encountered during my career. I want to take the time to acknowledge the sacrifice and hard work of our employees in helping Allegion deliver strong results in the face of the obstacles presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thank you for your diligence, flexibility and perseverance. 
Please go to Slide 4. Despite the pressures posed by the global pandemic, Allegion experienced only a modest top line revenue decline in 2020, and we saw pockets of strength during the year. The business, as you may remember, performed extremely well in the first quarter and in the second half of the year. the Americas residential business, the SimonsVoss business, Interflex and Global Portable Security businesses in Europe realized good growth. 
Although revenue was down modestly for the year, we expanded adjusted operating margins by 20 basis points, aided by quickly implementing restructuring and cost management actions to mitigate the volume-related COVID-19 impacts. Allegion produced record adjusted earnings per share and increased available cash flow by more than $20 million versus the prior year. 
We strengthened foundational elements of Allegion's culture around safety, sustainability, inclusion, diversity and engagement, which will help drive our continued success as a company. I'm very proud of our commitment to employee safety and customer excellence, which remain top priorities. 
In 2020, we made improvements in all of our employee safety metrics which are already industry leading. This has and will be our North Star. I believe that the time and resources we had invested in safety since spin paid us back in 2020. 
We were able to keep our essential employees working and took extra protections to keep people safe, whether they were on the sites or working remotely. And our dedication to customer excellence allowed us to better serve our customers. 
Today, Allegion is greener and cleaner, reducing greenhouse gases and water usage throughout the year. We paid considerable attention to drive progress on inclusion and diversity, creating a strategic framework and leadership commitment to our action agenda. Our team is significantly more engaged, meaning our global employees are more committed to our vision and our workforce than ever before. 
All Allegion employees are surveyed annually by Gallup in their native language. Our engagement has seen solid improvements since we have been a stand-alone company. 
Please go to Slide 5, and I'll walk you through the fourth quarter financial summary. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $727.3 million, an increase of 1.1%. Organic revenue declined 0.6%. Currency tailwinds more than offset the organic revenue decline and the impact of divestitures. 
Organic revenue in the quarter included Americas residential, SimonsVoss, Interflex and Global Portable Security in Europe and Australia and New Zealand and the Asia Pacific. These gains were offset by expected headwinds experienced in our Americas nonresidential business. Patrick will share more detail on the regions in a moment. 
Adjusted operating margin increased by 150 basis points in the fourth quarter as we saw the benefits from restructuring and cost-reduction actions mitigate deleverage from volume declines. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.49 increased $0.21, more than 16% versus the prior year. High operating income, favorable share count and year-over-year tax rate accounted for the increase. 
Available cash flow for the year came in at $443.2 million, an increase of over $20 million versus the prior year. Higher adjusted earnings and lower capital expenditures were the driving forces for the increase. 
I encourage all of you to review the body of work and execution of the Allegion team globally versus our competitors and peers in 2020. Solid top line performance in a pandemic, margin expansion and record cash flows.
During the year, we leaned out our structure, increased our investment in technology and retained our go-to-market resources and strengthened the engagement of our worldwide team in a pandemic, positioning Allegion to exit the COVID plague as a stronger company. 
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our strategic agenda and 2021 outlook."

Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide #6. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter 2019, reported earnings per share was $0.86. Ad",998,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. 
Please go to Slide #6. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter 2019, reported earnings per share was $0.86. Adjusting $0.42 for charges related to restructuring, trade name impairments as well as loss on divestitures in Turkey and Colombia, the 2019 adjusted earnings per share was $1.28. 
Operational earnings were the primary driver for the year-over-year increase. As indicated, operational results increased earnings per share by $0.13 as favorable price, productivity and material deflationary impacts more than offset reduced volume-related deleverage as well as plant inefficiencies due to COVID-19. Favorable year-over-year tax rate and share count drove another $0.06 and $0.02 increase, respectively. 
Interest and other income were slightly positive and offset the slight reduction associated with incremental investments during the quarter. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2020 earnings per share of $1.49, an increase of $0.21 or 16.4% compared to the prior year. 
Lastly, we have a $0.48 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring, M&A costs, impairments as well as a loss on held-for-sale assets. This is related to our decision to divest the QMI door business in the Middle East which is expected to close in Q1 subject to normal regulatory approvals. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the fourth quarter 2020 reported earnings per share of $1.01. 
Please go to Slide #7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year 2020. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. 
As indicated, we experienced a 0.6% organic revenue decline in the fourth quarter. As shown in the trending chart, we saw sequential improvement in the organic revenue decline as well as positive total growth of 1.1%, with currency tailwinds mitigating the organic decline and divestitures. Price continued to remain strong and helped to offset some of the volume decline. 
With the fourth quarter performance, you can see that total revenue was down 4.7% for the full year with organic revenue decline of 4.8%. All 3 regions ended the year down organically, with Americas down 4.2%, EMEA lower by 5.1% and Asia Pacific off 10.6%. All regions experienced organic revenue declines from the prior year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Please go to Slide #8. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $521.2 million, down 1% and down 0.7% on an organic basis. The region continued to deliver solid price realization. On volume, Americas residential was outstanding, experiencing mid-20s percent growth, boosted by robust retail point of sale, new home construction and electronics growth, which nearly offset the expected decline in the nonresidential business caused by lower new construction and discretionary project delays. 
Electronics revenue was slightly down with good growth in residential offset by reduced commercial electronics driven by delays in discretionary projects. We continue to see electronics and touchless solutions as long-term growth drivers and expect electronics' accelerated growth to resume when market conditions normalize. 
Americas adjusted operating income of $148.5 million decreased 3.5% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 70 basis points. The decrease was driven primarily by volume deleverage, plant inefficiencies due to the challenges from COVID-19 and unfavorable mix, partially offset by benefits from cost-reduction actions, restructuring benefits and material deflation. 
Please go to Slide #9. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEA region were $165.3 million, up 10.5% in total and up 3.1% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by good price realization and strength in our SimonsVoss, Interflex and Global Portable Security businesses. These businesses demonstrated resiliency throughout the year and are well positioned to continue profitable growth in 2021. Currency tailwinds added to the total growth.
EMEA adjusted operating income of $24.9 million increased 49.1% versus the prior year period. And adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 390 basis points. Also note that these results absorbed a $5.1 million environmental remediation charge, which had a 310 basis point negative impact on adjusted operating margins. The margin expansion was primarily driven by the organic growth leverage and the benefits of the restructuring and cost control actions taken throughout the year. 
Please go to Slide #10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $40.8 million, down 6.4% versus the prior year. Organic revenue was down 11.9%. The decline was driven by continued weakness in Korea and slightly offset by growth in Australia and New Zealand, particularly in the residential business. Currency tailwinds muted some of the organic revenue decline. 
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $8.2 million, an increase of $6.3 million, with adjusted operating margins up 1,570 basis points versus the prior year period. Approximately $4 million of the income increase was attributable to a gain on the sale of a building. Even excluding that, the benefits realized from restructuring and cost control actions drove substantial margin expansion. 
Please go to Slide #11. Available cash flow for 2020 came in at $443.2 million, which is an increase of $20.6 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by higher adjusted net earnings and lower capital expenditures. 
Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percent of revenues decreased based on a 4-point quarter average. This was driven by reduced working capital needs from the lower volume. 
The business continues to generate strong cash flow and conversion of net earnings. Liquidity and our capital structure are in a great position and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize working capital and drive effective cash flow conversion. 
We resumed share repurchases and acquired approximately 1.1 million shares for approximately $115 million during the fourth quarter. We also announced a 13% increase in our dividend payout later in March. 
I will now hand the call back over to Dave."

There's no doubt that throughout the fourth quarter and 2020 as a whole, our vision of seamless access and a safer world continued to drive our business forward.

In fact, throughout the pandemic, Schlage, Von Duprin, SimonsVoss and Interflex, among others in our portfolio, demonstrated both flexibility and creativity to meet customers' immediate and changing needs. 
I couldn't be prouder of how our team grounded our company in sound business practices while strategically investing for our future to position Allegion for growth as markets rebound. I said this before and I'll say it again, because of how we've managed our business and how we are investing, and because of the engagement, commitment and resiliency of our employees, I believe we'll exit the pandemic stronger than when we started and we are committed to advancing environmental, social and governance topics. They are important to the company and the communities where we live. 
Please go to Slide 13. Another example from the quarter that demonstrates our focus on Allegion's future and our vision of seamless access is the creation of Allegion International. As we announced in December, Allegion International officially launched this year on January 1 as a consolidation of the former EMEA and Asia Pacific operating segments. Tim Eckersley is now leading Allegion International, and we are excited to leverage his broad experiences there as a veteran of the security industry and high-growth technologies and as a longtime leader within our business. 
Creating Allegion International is designed to drive speed and efficiency by moving decisions closer to the customer, simplifying our operating segments and by reducing overhead in our non-U.S. operations. With this updating operating model in place, we expect to accelerate momentum in electronics growth, software and seamless access in those international markets. Again, we have elite brands with rich histories in Europe and Asia Pacific. 
While Tim is now leading the way for Allegion International, I want to welcome Luis Orbegoso as Senior Vice President of the Americas. If you haven't already, I encourage you to read our press release or look up Luis' bio on allegion.com. 
Luis brings a wealth of diverse leadership experiences, spanning multiple industries, geographies and cultures, and has a track record of guiding teams through transformation with a focus on operational and customer excellence. He possesses a deep understanding of smart home security, cloud technology, consumer access solutions as well as commercial and institutional safety which support our strategic priorities. 
Needless to say, Tim and Luis are both dedicated to our leadership commitments, delivering value to our customer and shareholders and driving our strategy forward. We are focused and disciplined heading into 2021. 
Please go to Slide 14. Looking ahead at the 2021 nonresidential business, it's important to understand the cyclical nature of this market and where we fit in. In general, we are a late cycle, meaning our products are installed up to 1 year, sometimes longer, after new construction projects start. 
Our views on commercial institutional markets have not changed. I expect new construction to remain soft this year, with institutional markets recovering faster than commercial. I also believe that this recovery will be faster than the 2008 downturn and thus, we have maintained our sales and specification capability and capacity while continuing to invest in innovation. 
Relative to the broader market and competitors, Allegion continues to perform well. We continue to provide innovative solutions in our core markets as well as underserved market opportunities to drive profitable growth. As K-12 schools, college campuses and health care begin to normalize with regard to the pandemic, we would expect discretionary projects on the nonresidential side to pick up in the back half of the year as pent-up demand begins to break loose. 
The residential piece of the Americas business continues to be a bright spot and is expected to grow in 2021 as the undersupply of single-family homes continues to be corrected. In addition, the builder -- in addition to the builder channel, DIY projects will continue to drive opportunities as consumers invest in their homes and adopt electronic solutions. We anticipate strength in residential to persist in the foreseeable future.
Seamless access, software and electronics continue to be a long-term growth driver and will remain our top investment priority. They are the future of Allegion. With the strength in residential and softness in commercial and institutional, we project total organic revenue in the Americas to be down 3% to 4% in 2021.
In the Allegion International segments, markets continue to recover and we expect growth in our electronics and system integration businesses of SimonsVoss and Interflex as well as Global Portable Security business. Currency tailwinds more than offset expected -- the expected divestiture of our QMI business and contribute to total growth.
For the region, we project total growth of 6% to 7%, with organic growth of 2% to 3%. All in, for total Allegion, we are projecting total revenues to be down 0.5% to 1.5% and organic revenue to decline 1.5% to 2.5%. 
Please go to Slide 15. Our 2021 outlook for adjusted earnings per share is $4.70 to $4.85. As indicated, adjusted operating earnings are expected to decrease 5% to 8%, driven by reduced volumes as a result of the nonresidential end markets, incremental investments and inflationary impacts. 
We are not immune to the macro inflationary headwinds, especially from steel and electronic components as well as with freight and transportation. For 2021, we expect an EPS headwind of $0.25 to $0.30 related to direct material input costs and freight inflation alone. We will continue to drive price and productivity to offset, but the net benefit will be less than prior years. 
Incremental investments continue to be a priority as we remain focused on accelerating electronics and seamless access growth in support of our vision and strategy. These incremental investments predominantly relate to added R&D and engineering capabilities to further develop, enhance and accelerate new product development. The combination of interest and other expense is expected to be a headwind as some of the more formidable items that we experienced in 2020 are nonrecurring.
Our outlook assumes a full adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 12%, an increase from the 11.2% in 2020. It also assumes outstanding weighted average diluted shares of approximately 91 million. 
The outlook additionally includes $0.10 to $0.15 per share for restructuring charges during the year. As a result, reported EPS is projected to be $4.55 to $4.75. We are projecting our available cash flow for 2021 to be in the $400 million to $420 million range. 
Please go to Slide 16. We are pleased with our 2020 performance in a pandemic. We saw our expanded -- we saw expanded -- we expanded our operating margins, increased adjustable earnings per share and delivered higher available cash flow in a difficult macro environment in which we were operating. 
We have taken actions that will allow Allegion to be leaner and more focused in 2021 as we and the rest of the world navigate and emerge from the pandemic, Allegion will be a stronger company and we are positioned for long-term success. As always, our execution and commitment to driving solid results will remain high. Allegion's future is bright.

Q1 is going to be a difficult comparison because we had really good growth, particularly in the nonresidential business. That's going to be a really tough comp for us.

And then kind of things return, I'd say, more on a normalized basis in the back half of the year. So first half, it's going to be, say, down Q1, up Q2 in a kind of more of a normalized basis, but continued strength in our residential business. 
Nonresidential, challenged, first half of the year, but getting better as we progress throughout the year, particularly as it relates to discretionary, project-based business.

So a couple of things, and you touched on one specific relative to our investments that are incremental, associated with R&D and engineering to really push forward the electronics, enhance our product offering going forward. Most of that incremental spend is attached to Americas. And so that alone will put pressure on the margin profile associated with Americas. 
In addition to that, you have the incremental inflation that we highlighted, $0.25 to $0.30 pressure on material input cost. We will do our best to offset that with pricing. But if we break even, just the tyranny of the math would suggest you're going to have margin pressure attached to that. And then you layer on top of that the mix component, i.e., residential growing faster than nonresidential and the nonresidential business profile having a higher-margin profile would suggest some additional mix there. 
So Americas margins will be under pressure in '21 associated with those 3 things. We will continue to drive productivity and those type of things to help mitigate that, but there's going to be margin pressure. 
Just to come to your second question relative to any growth in the increments associated with nonresidential. Yes. There's going to be some improvement if we can experience growth in the back half of the year. And you know how we've leveraged historically. I would expect that to continue. 
And let me make one more point. The margin profile for '21 being under pressure, I view as temporary, okay? This is a market dynamic. It's not a structural issue associated with Allegion. When business comes back, and it will, margin profiles will get better, okay? We will continue to grow margin. And we're not in a situation where we've maximized our margin going forward."

2020 was an extremely difficult year, perhaps the most challenging that I have encountered during my career. I want to take the time to acknowledge the sacrifice and hard work of our employees in helping Allegion deliver strong results in the face of the obstacles presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thank you for your diligence, flexibility and perseverance. 
Please go to Slide 4. Despite the pressures posed by the global pandemic, Allegion experienced only a modest top line revenue decline in 2020, and we saw pockets of strength during the year. The business, as you may remember, performed extremely well in the first quarter and in the second half of the year. the Americas residential business, the SimonsVoss business, Interflex and Global Portable Security businesses in Europe realized good growth. 
Although revenue was down modestly for the year, we expanded adjusted operating margins by 20 basis points, aided by quickly implementing restructuring and cost management actions to mitigate the volume-related COVID-19 impacts. Allegion produced record adjusted earnings per share and increased available cash flow by more than $20 million versus the prior year. 
We strengthened foundational elements of Allegion's culture around safety, sustainability, inclusion, diversity and engagement, which will help drive our continued success as a company. I'm very proud of our commitment to employee safety and customer excellence, which remain top priorities. 
In 2020, we made improvements in all of our employee safety metrics which are already industry leading. This has and will be our North Star. I believe that the time and resources we had invested in safety since spin paid us back in 2020. 
We were able to keep our essential employees working and took extra protections to keep people safe, whether they were on the sites or working remotely. And our dedication to customer excellence allowed us to better serve our customers. 
Today, Allegion is greener and cleaner, reducing greenhouse gases and water usage throughout the year. We paid considerable attention to drive progress on inclusion and diversity, creating a strategic framework and leadership commitment to our action agenda. Our team is significantly more engaged, meaning our global employees are more committed to our vision and our workforce than ever before. 
All Allegion employees are surveyed annually by Gallup in their native language. Our engagement has seen solid improvements since we have been a stand-alone company. 
Please go to Slide 5, and I'll walk you through the fourth quarter financial summary. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $727.3 million, an increase of 1.1%. Organic revenue declined 0.6%. Currency tailwinds more than offset the organic revenue decline and the impact of divestitures. 
Organic revenue in the quarter included Americas residential, SimonsVoss, Interflex and Global Portable Security in Europe and Australia and New Zealand and the Asia Pacific. These gains were offset by expected headwinds experienced in our Americas nonresidential business. Patrick will share more detail on the regions in a moment. 
Adjusted operating margin increased by 150 basis points in the fourth quarter as we saw the benefits from restructuring and cost-reduction actions mitigate deleverage from volume declines. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.49 increased $0.21, more than 16% versus the prior year. High operating income, favorable share count and year-over-year tax rate accounted for the increase. 
Available cash flow for the year came in at $443.2 million, an increase of over $20 million versus the prior year. Higher adjusted earnings and lower capital expenditures were the driving forces for the increase. 
I encourage all of you to review the body of work and execution of the Allegion team globally versus our competitors and peers in 2020. Solid top line performance in a pandemic, margin expansion and record cash flows.
During the year, we leaned out our structure, increased our investment in technology and retained our go-to-market resources and strengthened the engagement of our worldwide team in a pandemic, positioning Allegion to exit the COVID plague as a stronger company. 
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our strategic agenda and 2021 outlook."

Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide #6. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter 2019, reported earnings per share was $0.86. Ad",998,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. 
Please go to Slide #6. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter 2019, reported earnings per share was $0.86. Adjusting $0.42 for charges related to restructuring, trade name impairments as well as loss on divestitures in Turkey and Colombia, the 2019 adjusted earnings per share was $1.28. 
Operational earnings were the primary driver for the year-over-year increase. As indicated, operational results increased earnings per share by $0.13 as favorable price, productivity and material deflationary impacts more than offset reduced volume-related deleverage as well as plant inefficiencies due to COVID-19. Favorable year-over-year tax rate and share count drove another $0.06 and $0.02 increase, respectively. 
Interest and other income were slightly positive and offset the slight reduction associated with incremental investments during the quarter. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2020 earnings per share of $1.49, an increase of $0.21 or 16.4% compared to the prior year. 
Lastly, we have a $0.48 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring, M&A costs, impairments as well as a loss on held-for-sale assets. This is related to our decision to divest the QMI door business in the Middle East which is expected to close in Q1 subject to normal regulatory approvals. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the fourth quarter 2020 reported earnings per share of $1.01. 
Please go to Slide #7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year 2020. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. 
As indicated, we experienced a 0.6% organic revenue decline in the fourth quarter. As shown in the trending chart, we saw sequential improvement in the organic revenue decline as well as positive total growth of 1.1%, with currency tailwinds mitigating the organic decline and divestitures. Price continued to remain strong and helped to offset some of the volume decline. 
With the fourth quarter performance, you can see that total revenue was down 4.7% for the full year with organic revenue decline of 4.8%. All 3 regions ended the year down organically, with Americas down 4.2%, EMEA lower by 5.1% and Asia Pacific off 10.6%. All regions experienced organic revenue declines from the prior year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Please go to Slide #8. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $521.2 million, down 1% and down 0.7% on an organic basis. The region continued to deliver solid price realization. On volume, Americas residential was outstanding, experiencing mid-20s percent growth, boosted by robust retail point of sale, new home construction and electronics growth, which nearly offset the expected decline in the nonresidential business caused by lower new construction and discretionary project delays. 
Electronics revenue was slightly down with good growth in residential offset by reduced commercial electronics driven by delays in discretionary projects. We continue to see electronics and touchless solutions as long-term growth drivers and expect electronics' accelerated growth to resume when market conditions normalize. 
Americas adjusted operating income of $148.5 million decreased 3.5% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 70 basis points. The decrease was driven primarily by volume deleverage, plant inefficiencies due to the challenges from COVID-19 and unfavorable mix, partially offset by benefits from cost-reduction actions, restructuring benefits and material deflation. 
Please go to Slide #9. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEA region were $165.3 million, up 10.5% in total and up 3.1% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by good price realization and strength in our SimonsVoss, Interflex and Global Portable Security businesses. These businesses demonstrated resiliency throughout the year and are well positioned to continue profitable growth in 2021. Currency tailwinds added to the total growth.
EMEA adjusted operating income of $24.9 million increased 49.1% versus the prior year period. And adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 390 basis points. Also note that these results absorbed a $5.1 million environmental remediation charge, which had a 310 basis point negative impact on adjusted operating margins. The margin expansion was primarily driven by the organic growth leverage and the benefits of the restructuring and cost control actions taken throughout the year. 
Please go to Slide #10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $40.8 million, down 6.4% versus the prior year. Organic revenue was down 11.9%. The decline was driven by continued weakness in Korea and slightly offset by growth in Australia and New Zealand, particularly in the residential business. Currency tailwinds muted some of the organic revenue decline. 
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $8.2 million, an increase of $6.3 million, with adjusted operating margins up 1,570 basis points versus the prior year period. Approximately $4 million of the income increase was attributable to a gain on the sale of a building. Even excluding that, the benefits realized from restructuring and cost control actions drove substantial margin expansion. 
Please go to Slide #11. Available cash flow for 2020 came in at $443.2 million, which is an increase of $20.6 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by higher adjusted net earnings and lower capital expenditures. 
Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percent of revenues decreased based on a 4-point quarter average. This was driven by reduced working capital needs from the lower volume. 
The business continues to generate strong cash flow and conversion of net earnings. Liquidity and our capital structure are in a great position and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize working capital and drive effective cash flow conversion. 
We resumed share repurchases and acquired approximately 1.1 million shares for approximately $115 million during the fourth quarter. We also announced a 13% increase in our dividend payout later in March. 
I will now hand the call back over to Dave."

There's no doubt that throughout the fourth quarter and 2020 as a whole, our vision of seamless access and a safer world continued to drive our business forward. 
Despite the pandemic and resulting market headwinds, our vision and strategy are progressing on many fronts. We continued our commitments and investments to R&D in 2020, creating a robust pipeline of new product and development projects across both our core brands and new electronic product offerings. 
Our recent acquisition of Yonomi is an example of infusing outside thinking and yet, in another way, we're making digital and software investments to meet customer needs now and in the future. Yonomi will accelerate Allegion's digital journey and product offerings. 
And our vision remains anchored in our strategic pillars, delivering new value and access and to be the partner of choice, but also in the strength of our historic brands. In fact, throughout the pandemic, Schlage, Von Duprin, SimonsVoss and Interflex, among others in our portfolio, demonstrated both flexibility and creativity to meet customers' immediate and changing needs. 
I couldn't be prouder of how our team grounded our company in sound business practices while strategically investing for our future to position Allegion for growth as markets rebound. I said this before and I'll say it again, because of how we've managed our business and how we are investing, and because of the engagement, commitment and resiliency of our employees, I believe we'll exit the pandemic stronger than when we started and we are committed to advancing environmental, social and governance topics. They are important to the company and the communities where we live. 
Please go to Slide 13. Another example from the quarter that demonstrates our focus on Allegion's future and our vision of seamless access is the creation of Allegion International. As we announced in December, Allegion International officially launched this year on January 1 as a consolidation of the former EMEA and Asia Pacific operating segments. Tim Eckersley is now leading Allegion International, and we are excited to leverage his broad experiences there as a veteran of the security industry and high-growth technologies and as a longtime leader within our business. 
Creating Allegion International is designed to drive speed and efficiency by moving decisions closer to the customer, simplifying our operating segments and by reducing overhead in our non-U.S. operations. With this updating operating model in place, we expect to accelerate momentum in electronics growth, software and seamless access in those international markets. Again, we have elite brands with rich histories in Europe and Asia Pacific. 
While Tim is now leading the way for Allegion International, I want to welcome Luis Orbegoso as Senior Vice President of the Americas. If you haven't already, I encourage you to read our press release or look up Luis' bio on allegion.com. 
Luis brings a wealth of diverse leadership experiences, spanning multiple industries, geographies and cultures, and has a track record of guiding teams through transformation with a focus on operational and customer excellence. He possesses a deep understanding of smart home security, cloud technology, consumer access solutions as well as commercial and institutional safety which support our strategic priorities. 
Needless to say, Tim and Luis are both dedicated to our leadership commitments, delivering value to our customer and shareholders and driving our strategy forward. We are focused and disciplined heading into 2021. 
Please go to Slide 14. Looking ahead at the 2021 nonresidential business, it's important to understand the cyclical nature of this market and where we fit in. In general, we are a late cycle, meaning our products are installed up to 1 year, sometimes longer, after new construction projects start. 
Our views on commercial institutional markets have not changed. I expect new construction to remain soft this year, with institutional markets recovering faster than commercial. I also believe that this recovery will be faster than the 2008 downturn and thus, we have maintained our sales and specification capability and capacity while continuing to invest in innovation. 
Relative to the broader market and competitors, Allegion continues to perform well. We continue to provide innovative solutions in our core markets as well as underserved market opportunities to drive profitable growth. As K-12 schools, college campuses and health care begin to normalize with regard to the pandemic, we would expect discretionary projects on the nonresidential side to pick up in the back half of the year as pent-up demand begins to break loose. 
The residential piece of the Americas business continues to be a bright spot and is expected to grow in 2021 as the undersupply of single-family homes continues to be corrected. In addition, the builder -- in addition to the builder channel, DIY projects will continue to drive opportunities as consumers invest in their homes and adopt electronic solutions. We anticipate strength in residential to persist in the foreseeable future.
Seamless access, software and electronics continue to be a long-term growth driver and will remain our top investment priority. They are the future of Allegion. With the strength in residential and softness in commercial and institutional, we project total organic revenue in the Americas to be down 3% to 4% in 2021.
In the Allegion International segments, markets continue to recover and we expect growth in our electronics and system integration businesses of SimonsVoss and Interflex as well as Global Portable Security business. Currency tailwinds more than offset expected -- the expected divestiture of our QMI business and contribute to total growth.
For the region, we project total growth of 6% to 7%, with organic growth of 2% to 3%. All in, for total Allegion, we are projecting total revenues to be down 0.5% to 1.5% and organic revenue to decline 1.5% to 2.5%. 
Please go to Slide 15. Our 2021 outlook for adjusted earnings per share is $4.70 to $4.85. As indicated, adjusted operating earnings are expected to decrease 5% to 8%, driven by reduced volumes as a result of the nonresidential end markets, incremental investments and inflationary impacts. 
We are not immune to the macro inflationary headwinds, especially from steel and electronic components as well as with freight and transportation. For 2021, we expect an EPS headwind of $0.25 to $0.30 related to direct material input costs and freight inflation alone. We will continue to drive price and productivity to offset, but the net benefit will be less than prior years. 
Incremental investments continue to be a priority as we remain focused on accelerating electronics and seamless access growth in support of our vision and strategy. These incremental investments predominantly relate to added R&D and engineering capabilities to further develop, enhance and accelerate new product development. The combination of interest and other expense is expected to be a headwind as some of the more formidable items that we experienced in 2020 are nonrecurring.
Our outlook assumes a full adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 12%, an increase from the 11.2% in 2020. It also assumes outstanding weighted average diluted shares of approximately 91 million. 
The outlook additionally includes $0.10 to $0.15 per share for restructuring charges during the year. As a result, reported EPS is projected to be $4.55 to $4.75. We are projecting our available cash flow for 2021 to be in the $400 million to $420 million range. 
Please go to Slide 16. We are pleased with our 2020 performance in a pandemic. We saw our expanded -- we saw expanded -- we expanded our operating margins, increased adjustable earnings per share and delivered higher available cash flow in a difficult macro environment in which we were operating. 
We have taken actions that will allow Allegion to be leaner and more focused in 2021 as we and the rest of the world navigate and emerge from the pandemic, Allegion will be a stronger company and we are positioned for long-term success. As always, our execution and commitment to driving solid results will remain high. Allegion's future is bright.

And then you had the blow up. And again, we used that strong backlog and the wrap-up of projects to really put up, I think, a respectable '20 -- 2020 for Allegion as we navigated through that. As we go into '21 and '22, the backlogs are softened. The new project pipeline is down, and we've got to reposition that. Patrick can talk more about the comps on a quarter-to-quarter basis."

Q1 is going to be a difficult comparison because we had really good growth, particularly in the nonresidential business. That's going to be a really tough comp for us. 
Q2 obviously becomes much easier, particularly on the residential business, where we had a plant closure in our Mexico facilities and we're kind of playing catch up when they reopened the back half of the quarter. And then kind of things return, I'd say, more on a normalized basis in the back half of the year. So first half, it's going to be, say, down Q1, up Q2 in a kind of more of a normalized basis, but continued strength in our residential business. 
Nonresidential, challenged, first half of the year, but getting better as we progress throughout the year, particularly as it relates to discretionary, project-based business. And when people start returning to work relative to the easing of the COVID impact, we should start seeing some improvement on that side of the business. Hopefully, that answers what you're looking for."

Maybe some way to kind of give us some sensitivity, because they look pretty heavy, especially including the investments, but we're also talking about small declines and a lower-mix business growing and a higher-mix business declining. 
If nonresi does show some upside through the year, what sort of incremental should we put on that growth? Is it kind of the 40% to 50% that we've kind of grown accustomed to since that number is already fully loaded for investments? Or is there something else working here? Because, again, small numbers on the top line in terms of movement kind of distort the margin line."

So a couple of things, and you touched on one specific relative to our investments that are incremental, associated with R&D and engineering to really push forward the electronics, enhance our product offering going forward. Most of that incremental spend is attached to Americas. And so that alone will put pressure on the margin profile associated with Americas. 
In addition to that, you have the incremental inflation that we highlighted, $0.25 to $0.30 pressure on material input cost. We will do our best to offset that with pricing. But if we break even, just the tyranny of the math would suggest you're going to have margin pressure attached to that. And then you layer on top of that the mix component, i.e., residential growing faster than nonresidential and the nonresidential business profile having a higher-margin profile would suggest some additional mix there. 
So Americas margins will be under pressure in '21 associated with those 3 things. We will continue to drive productivity and those type of things to help mitigate that, but there's going to be margin pressure. 
Just to come to your second question relative to any growth in the increments associated with nonresidential. Yes. There's going to be some improvement if we can experience growth in the back half of the year. And you know how we've leveraged historically. I would expect that to continue. 
And let me make one more point. The margin profile for '21 being under pressure, I view as temporary, okay? This is a market dynamic. It's not a structural issue associated with Allegion. When business comes back, and it will, margin profiles will get better, okay? We will continue to grow margin. And we're not in a situation where we've maximized our margin going forward."

I'm pleased with the company's first quarter performance. We delivered revenue growth, margin expansion, double-digit earnings growth and strong available cash flow against a tough prior year",904,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with the company's first quarter performance. We delivered revenue growth, margin expansion, double-digit earnings growth and strong available cash flow against a tough prior year comparable. We continue to make progress on our seamless AXA strategy while maintaining a focus on keeping our employees safe and serving our customers efficiently. 
Let's begin by walking through the first quarter financial summary. Revenue for the first quarter was $694.3 million, an increase of 2.9% or 0.5% organically. The organic revenue increase was driven by strength in the Americas Residential and Allegion's International businesses, offsetting continued softness in Americas nonresidential. Currency tailwinds provided a boost to total revenue and more than offset the impact of divestitures. Patrick will share more detail on Allegion in a moment. 
Adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points in the first quarter. We executed extremely well, and the restructuring and cost management actions taken during 2020, along with the volume leverage on the businesses that grew, offset the mix headwinds we are experiencing. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.20 increased $0.16 or 15.4% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by expanded operating income, along with favorable other income and share count. 
Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $105.5 million, an increase of more than $86 million versus the prior year. The increased cash flow was driven by improvement in net working capital, growth in net earnings and reduced capital expenditures. 
Please go to Slide 5. As we discussed previously, reflecting on 2020, despite the ongoing pandemic, Allegion continues to invest in our future, most notably through our innovation engines. From industrial design, engineering and IT to ventures, partnerships and acquisitions, we're building a build-borrow-buy approach to accelerate seamless access. Investing in our capabilities, partnering and integration are all core to our innovation strategy. 
Let's review some of Allegion's innovation and investments. Allegion's Overtur, our cloud-based ecosystem where project teams collaborate on the specification, design and construction of door security and openings, expanded in multiple ways during the past year. Key and credential management was added, more functionality and integration for our building information modeling customers and automation that helps hardware specification writers. Overtur allows digital connectivity to our customers over the life of the structure. It's proving its value as a single source of truth for hardware requirements and decisions and to empower our partners to work more productively. 
Our ISONAS brand also launched a significant upgrade of its software platform in Q1 and, the Pure Access Cloud 4.0 reader controllers are pre-configured to the cloud and only require a network connection on site, making the ISONAS system truly plug and play. The software upgrade includes new front-end technology with customized dashboards, gives a boost to cybersecurity and anticipates added capabilities and future new devices. Our product innovation spans the world of Allegion. 
SimonsVoss recently released a Smart Locker, a retrofit, no drilling lock option for lockers and furnitures in schools, hospitals and industrial facilities. This innovation was customer inspired based on trends and needs in the market. Importantly, it integrates the existing Simonsvoss digital ecosystem. And there's additional functionality to pride or open each lock remotely to display break-in attempts in the software and do send notifications. 
And just as our internal innovations continue to delight our customers, innovation is built through key partnerships and our early leadership in the IoT market has established us as a go-to partner. In Q1, Homebase announced that they're working with Allegion and Walmart In Home to enable direct to fridge grocery delivery for apartment residents starting in the Kansas City metro. Homebased enables communities come with pre installed Schlage smart locks, meaning that the Walmart associate making the delivery give secure, onetime access for entry during a designated time frame for delivery. This is a clear demonstration of seamless access, adding value to people's everyday's life. 
Partnering with CBORD, Apple and Android has rapidly expanded seamless access use cases on higher education campuses. By enabling mobile credential technologies, we are part of the ecosystem that supports contactless student IDs for iPhones, Apple Watches and Google. CBORD also brings our Von Duprin exit devices into play, giving colleges new remote lockdown and monitoring capabilities. These integrations are good for campus securities and help universities and colleges operate more efficiently and safely. 
Rounding out our build-borrow-buy approach to innovation, Allegion Ventures continues to invest in companies like CASA, Mint House, Bird Sense and OpenPath. We also acquired Yonomi, a technology company and leader in IoT cloud platforms. Founded in 2013 by building automation and enterprise computing experts, Yonomi was the first to create a smart home ecosystem, one that automatically discovers and coordinates devices. Allegion was an early customer and investor. 
Today, Yonomi Solutions are used in more than 150 countries connected to millions of IoT devices. IoT -- excuse me, Yonomi also holds unique intellectual property that matches well to Allegion's strategic priorities for accelerating growth through seamless access, innovation and meaningful partnership. Our goal is to be the provider of choice among IoT developers and integrators. You'll continue to see more examples of investments innovation through our build borrow and buy approach in '21, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the future. 
Patrick will now walk you through the financials, and I'll be back later to discuss our '21 outlook and wrap up."

Thank you for joining today's call. If you would, please go to Slide #6. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the first quarter.

This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter 2020, reported earnings per share was 0, adjusting $1.04 for charges related to intangible asset impairments. Restructuring expenses and integration costs related to acquisitions, the 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $1.04. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.06, driven by volume leverage, along with continued benefits from cost control measures and restructuring actions taking it in 2020. Favorable price and currency also contributed to the increase. 
The combination of these items offset the unfavorable mix. Favorable other income and interest expense increased earnings per share by $0.08 and was driven primarily by favorable unrealized investment gains in 2021 compared to unrealized investment losses experienced in 2020. Favorable share count drove another $0.03 per share impact, more than offsetting the $0.01 reduction from investments. 
This results in adjusted first quarter 2021 earnings per share of $1.20, an increase of $0.16 or 15.4% compared to the prior year. Lastly, we have a $0.02 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring costs. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the first quarter 2021 reported earnings per share of $1.18. 
Please go to Slide #7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the first quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we experienced a 0.5% organic revenue growth in the first quarter as solid price performance was able to offset lower volume. Although the total company volume was slightly down, we did see strength in the Americas Residential and International businesses. Currency also provided a tailwind to total growth and more than offset the impact of divestitures. 
Please go to Slide #8. First quarter revenues for the Allegion Americas segment were $498.9 million, down 2.6% on a reported basis and down 2.9% organically. The region continued to deliver good price realization. On volume, Americas residential was outstanding again, experiencing low 20% growth, boosted by continued strength in retail point of sale, new home construction and electronics growth, which nearly offset the anticipated decline in the nonresidential business caused by lower new construction and discretionary project delays. 
Electronics revenue was down mid-single digits with growth in residential products that was offset by reduced commercial electronics driven by delays in discretionary projects. We continue to see electronics and touchless solutions as long-term growth drivers and expect electronics accelerated growth to resume when market conditions normalize. Americas adjusted operating income of $135.5 million decreased 7.6% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 140 basis points. The decrease was driven primarily by volume deleverage, negative mix and incremental investments, partially offset by benefits from cost reduction actions and restructuring. 
Please go to Slide #9. First quarter revenues for the Allegion International segment were $195.4 million, up 20.2% and up 11% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by strength across all major geographies and businesses as markets continue to rebound. Part of the year-over-year growth was due to the comparative impact of COVID-related shutdowns in the prior year. 
Favorable currency impacts also contributed to total revenue growth and were slightly offset by divestiture impacts. International adjusted operating income of $18 million increased nearly 1,000% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased by 820 basis points. The margin increase was driven primarily by solid volume leverage, benefits from lower operating costs from the restructuring cost control actions taken during 2020, as well as favorable currency impacts. 
This is also our first quarter reporting under the new Allegion International segment. The transition was seamless and made possible by having strong leadership in place to drive effective change. 
Please go to Slide #10. Year-to-date available cash flow for the first quarter 2021 came in at $105.5 million, which is an increase of more than $86 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by improvements in net working capital, higher earnings and reduced capital expenditures. Our strong cash flow generation continues to be an asset of the company. 
Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percent of revenues decreased based on a 4.25 average. This was driven by reduced working capital needs from the lower volume throughout 2020 as well as strong collections performance. The business continues to generate strong cash flow, and we remain committed to effective and efficient use of working capital. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize working capital and drive effective cash flow conversion. 
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2021 outlook."

The Americas Residential business continues to be hot and is expected to grow in 2021. We anticipate strength in residential to persist for the foreseeable future. DIY demand remains strong, and the construction market is strengthened by a shortage of available new homes, continued low mortgage rates and improved trends in permits and starts. However, completion rates have been lagging starts due to labor and supply shortages, which should improve as we move further past the pandemic. 
Looking at the Americas Nonresidential business. We saw demand begin to increase on the repair retrofit projects sooner than we previously anticipated. We expect this trend to continue for the remainder of the year. In new constructions, we are starting to see positive movement in macroeconomic indicators, but it's important to remember the late cycle nature of this market. 
For 2021, I expect nonresidential new construction to remain soft, but the monthly change in The architectural Building Index, Dodge construction starts and potential stimulus spending are trending favorable. And assuming this continues, it will lead to growth in 2022 and beyond. 
The seamless access, software and electronics continue to be long-term growth drivers, and they will remain our top investment priorities. They are the future of Allegion. With these parameters in place, we are now projecting total inorganic revenue in the Americas to be flat to up 1% in 2021. 
In the Allegion International segment, markets continue to recover, and we expect full year growth in most of our international segments, led by our Germanic and global portable securities business. We continue to monitor the pace of vaccine rollouts internationally as this will lead to sustainable improvements in the economic environment. Currency tailwinds more than offset the divestiture of our QMI door business and contribute to total growth. 
For the region, we are raising our outlook for total revenue growth to 12% to 13%, with our organic growth of 7.5% to 8.5%. All in for total Allegion, we are now projecting total revenue to be up 3% to 4% and organic revenue to increase 2% to 3%. We are also raising our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at a range of $4.85 to $5.05 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $5 and $5.15. This guide incorporates pricing actions to offset direct material inflation as well as reflecting our supply chain capability to mitigate industry challenges on supply and electronic component shortages. We anticipate that these challenges will persist for the balance of the year, and we will continue to monitor and adapt to changing market conditions. Our outlook for available cash flow is also being raised and now projected to be $430 million to $450 million. 
The outlook assumes investment spend of approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 12.5%. The outlook for outstanding diluted shares continues to be approximately $91 million. 
Please go to Slide 12. Allegion is off to a great start. We experienced, reported an organic revenue growth, expanded operating margins and delivered strong cash flow. We have solid business fundamentals and a proven ability to execute and adapt to changing and uncertain market conditions. We have managed the business extremely well to set us up for success as markets return to normal. Macroeconomic indicators and specific indices related to our business are trending positive, and I'm increasingly confident in the recovery. The Allegion commitment to shareholders, employees and customers is to be stronger exiting the pandemic than when we entered our work continues. 
I want to thank this opportunity to thank our employees for their diligence and dedication during the pandemic. It is their commitment that has driven the company to perform well and accelerated our vision of seamless access in a safer world. Allegion's future is bright. Thank you. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

And by that, meaning just kind of the level of activity, orders, customer enthusiasm, specifically related to discretionary projects, and so that piece of information, plus with the improvement in certain indices, leading indicators relative to our business, i.e., ABI, new construction starts, those type of things, which I'll remind you relative to new construction, it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be incremental business this year, but continued improvement, particularly as we look out beyond 2021. And with the improvement in non-resi, it really relates to discretionary projects continuing to be favorable more than what we had originally anticipated last time we were on the conference call. 
Residential continues its strength really across the board, just really seeing good improvement in DIY, new build construction, et cetera. We expect that strength to continue. I would just remind you, keep in mind that last year, as we're coming -- exiting out of Q2 after the plant shutdowns, demand started to surge, we were kind of catching our feet relative to production and kind of keeping up with demand. We didn't start kind of filling channel inventory until late Q3, Q4. That will be nonrecurring, right, this year. And so you get into a tougher comp, if you will, in the back half of this year as it relates to the residential business, but still growth on a normalized basis."

And the reason being is the inflationary item will step up, it's going to be worse as we progress kind of throughout the course of the year. Why? Because of the input cost specific to commodities and material components. The other thing I would remind you of is, remember, we talked last year about some of the boomerang effect of the cost kind of coming back in into 2021 that was not there in 2020. And so that's another item. Plus, we're going to have incremental investments. All of those are going to weigh a little bit more on margin, and we'll put more pressure, if you will, on margins in the back half of the year, that -- for '21 that we didn't experience in 2020. 
Let me just add something else. I think on the non-resi side of things, relative to the reduced volume, even though things are getting better as we progress throughout year, we do have volume deleverage, we have taken the necessary actions to extract variable costs, okay? So it's really a volume deleverage issue. It's not a permanent item. When volumes come back, margins will accelerate because we've taken the necessary cost control actions."

I think over the last 12 months, there's been an absence of any type of preventive maintenance and small project work because the focus was on the health and safety of the occupants of buildings. I believe what we saw strongly, beginning mid-March and continues on, is the return of that. People are going after those projects. Those small projects, preventive maintenance activity, particularly if it's security-related, carry a pretty high priority versus other preventive maintenance aspects. Let's say the door doesn't shut properly, it's not locking. I have a security breach. 
Maintenance people are always making trade-offs as we move into the air conditioning season or I don't have heat, those tends to be a red priority. We could fall into yellow, but -- Tim, I believe there's an absent -- there has been an absence of preventive maintenance, these small projects, and those are moving in. I believe the budgets are there. I've also been refreshed that in larger projects that have -- that were delayed, those are coming back in the mid-project level. An example would be the University of Tennessee. They had a project that was slated to go in '20. That's come back on. So it's fully budgeted. I think, again, what -- that will naturally occur and we'll get our share of that wallet. And as the new construction comes back, it will add more momentum to Allegion."

So again, as you indicated, really strong performance, both top line and margin rate, particularly relative compared to prior year. Just as a reminder, you may recall, last year, we were pretty quick out of the gate in terms of implementing cost control measures, going in with the restructuring programs across the board, in Asia as well as Europe. And so you're seeing kind of the full benefit of that, if you will, reflected in the '21 results. So the restructuring actions taken last year begin to lap in the back half of the year. So you're not going to see kind of a step-up in the margin performance that you saw in Q1. However, I would suggest that margins will continue to improve year-over-year as we continue throughout the year. 
And we should finish, on an aggregate basis, i.e., the consolidation of Asia and Europe together, at kind of a record performance in terms of margin percent. And that's really reflective, as Dave kind of highlighted earlier, the continued strength in electronics, which has a higher-margin profile, the -- all the cost reduction actions that we've taken will continue to manifest itself and the collapse and consolidation of the 2 segments together. We're seeing the benefits of that as well. 
I feel like we're in a really good position kind of going forward, not only to drive top line, but to ensure that we do it in a profitable basis. And we continue from here on out, getting margin accretion as the business continues to grow."

Jeff, there's been a tremendous amount of work that's gone on in that business over the last couple of years. And one is, I talked about the restructuring. Significant investment and prioritization around Interflex and SimonsVoss, really nice growth over the last 6 quarters. Interflex and SimonsVoss performed exceptionally during the pandemic, and I think that momentum will continue. 
As you think about strategic priorities for Tim, it's to continue that growth and expand the cloud and technical capabilities. You know better than others that SimonsVoss really thrives on what we call active technologies, driving more investment that goes into some of the passive areas will help fuel their growth, which could include also acquisition. But we like that SimonsVoss and Interflex. 
I think second important for Tim is we acquired the Gainsborough asset. That's well positioned. We launched the first electronic Trilock in the region, and we think we're well positioned to be with -- in the new build and the DIY to see nice growth as that residential market recovers in Gainsborough. I think, third, what has been surprising to Tim in his first 90 days is the opportunity to export more capability from the Americas, which he has more knowledge than anybody in the company. So looking forward to taking some of the real strengths we have here in the Americas and helping our international partners grow even faster."

And what we're also seeing is, simply put, a gain in software as the driver as opposed to hardware as a driver in getting into access control. And with access control, let's say, becoming a faster growth area than even video, and we've seen some crazy valuations in the venture and private equity markets for some of these companies that are getting involved in areas that are either adjacent to you or actually may compete with you from intercoms all the way to all the way to SaaS-based things.

I'm pleased with the company's first quarter performance.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with the company's first quarter performance. We delivered revenue growth, margin expansion, double-digit earnings growth and strong available cash flow against a tough prior year comparable. We continue to make progress on our seamless access strategy while maintaining the focus on keeping our employees safe and serving our customers efficiently.
Let's begin by walking through the first quarter financial summary. Revenue for the first quarter was $694.3 million, an increase of 2.9% or 0.5% organically. The organic revenue increase was driven by strength in the Americas residential and Allegion's International businesses, offsetting continued softness in Americas nonresidential. Currency tailwinds provided a boost to total revenue and more than offset the impact of divestitures. Patrick will share more detail on the regions in a moment.
Adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points in the first quarter. We executed extremely well. And the restructuring and cost management actions taken during 2020, along with the volume leverage on the businesses that grew, offset the mix headwinds we are experiencing.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.20 increased $0.16 or 15.4% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by expanded operating income, along with favorable other income and share count. Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $105.5 million, an increase of more than $86 million versus the prior year. The increased cash flow was driven by improvement in net working capital, growth in net earnings and reduced capital expenditures.
Please go to Slide 5. As we discussed previously, reflecting on 2020, despite the ongoing pandemic, Allegion continues to invest in our future, most notably through our innovation engines. From industrial design, engineering and IT, to ventures, partnerships and acquisitions, we're building a build-borrow-buy approach to accelerate seamless access. Investing in our capabilities, partnering and integration are all core to our innovation strategy.
Let's review some of Allegion's innovation and investments. Allegion's Overtur, our cloud-based ecosystem where project teams collaborate on the specification design and construction of door security and openings, expanded in multiple ways during the past year. Key and credential management was added, more functionality and integration for our building information modeling customers and automation that helps hardware specification writers. Overtur allows digital connectivity to our customers over the life of the structure. It's proving its value as a single source of truth for hardware requirements and decisions and to empower our partners to work more productively.
Our ISONAS brand also launched a significant upgrade of its software platform in Q1, the Pure Access Cloud 4.0. Reader-controllers are pre-configured to the cloud and only require a network connection on site, making the ISONAS system truly plug and play. The software upgrade includes new front-end technology with customized dashboards, gives a boost to cybersecurity and anticipates added capabilities and future new devices.
Our product innovation spans the world of Allegion. SimonsVoss recently released the SmartLocker, a retrofit, no-drilling lock option for lockers and furnitures in schools, hospitals and industrial facilities. This innovation was customer-inspired based on trends and needs in the market. Importantly, it integrates the existing SimonsVoss digital ecosystem. And there's additional functionality to pry or open each lock remotely to display breaking attempts in the software and to send notifications.
And just as our internal innovations continue to delight our customers, innovation is built through key partnerships, and our early leadership in the IoT market has established us as a go-to partner. In Q1, Homebase announced that they're working with Allegion and Walmart InHome to enable direct-to-fridge grocery delivery for apartment residents starting in the Kansas City metro. Homebase enables communities -- Homebase-enabled communities come with pre-installed Schlage Smart Locks, meaning that the Walmart associate making the delivery gets secure onetime access for entry during a designated time frame for delivery. This is a clear demonstration of seamless access, adding value to people's everyday lives.
Partnering with CBORD, Apple and Android has rapidly expanded seamless access use cases on higher education campuses. By enabling mobile credential technologies, we are part of the ecosystem that supports contactless student IDs for iPhones, Apple Watches and Google Pay. CBORD also brings our Von Duprin exit devices into play, giving colleges new remote lockdown and monitoring capabilities. These integrations are good for campus securities and help universities and colleges operate more efficiently and safely.
Rounding out our build-borrow-buy approach to innovation, Allegion Ventures continues to invest in companies like Kasa, Mint House, VergeSense and Openpath. We also acquired Yonomi, a technology company and leader in IoT cloud platforms. Founded in 2013 by building automation and enterprise computing experts, Yonomi was the first to create a smart home ecosystem, one that automatically discovers and coordinates devices. Allegion was an early customer and investor. Today, Yonomi solutions are used in more than 150 countries, connected to millions of IoT devices.
IoT -- excuse me, Yonomi also holds unique intellectual property that matches well to Allegion's strategic priorities for accelerating growth through seamless access, innovation and meaningful partnership. Our goal is to be the provider of choice among IoT developers and integrators. You'll continue to see more examples of investments in innovation through our build, borrow and buy approach in '21, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the future.
Patrick will now walk you through the financials, and I'll be back later to discuss our '21 outlook and wrap up."

If you would, please go to Slide #6. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter of 2020, reported earnings per share was 0. Adjusting $1.04 for charges related to intangible asset impairments, restructuring expenses and integration costs related to acquisitions, the 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $1.04.
Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.06, driven by volume leverage, along with continued benefits from cost-control measures and restructuring actions taken in 2020. Favorable price and currency also contributed to the increase. The combination of these items offset the unfavorable mix.
Favorable other income and interest expense increased earnings per share by $0.08 and was driven primarily by favorable unrealized investment gains in 2021 compared to unrealized investment losses experienced in 2020. Favorable share count drove another $0.03 per share impact, more than offsetting the $0.01 reduction from investments. This results in adjusted first quarter 2021 earnings per share of $1.20, an increase of $0.16 or 15.4% compared to the prior year.
Lastly, we have a $0.02 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring costs. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the first quarter 2021 reported earnings per share of $1.18.
Please go to Slide #7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the first quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we experienced a 0.5% organic revenue growth in the first quarter as solid price performance was able to offset lower volume. Although the total company volume was slightly down, we did see strength in the Americas residential and International businesses. Currency also provided a tailwind to total growth and more than offset the impact of divestitures.
Please go to Slide #8. First quarter revenues for the Allegion Americas segment were $498.9 million, down 2.6% on a reported basis and down 2.9% organically. The region continued to deliver good price realization. On volume, Americas residential was outstanding again, experiencing low-20s percent growth, boosted by continued strength in retail point-of-sale, new home construction and electronics growth, which nearly offset the anticipated decline in the nonresidential business caused by lower new construction and discretionary project delays.
Electronics revenue was down mid-single digits with growth in residential products that was offset by reduced commercial electronics, driven by delays in discretionary projects. We continue to see electronics and touchless solutions as long-term growth drivers and expect electronics accelerated growth to resume when market conditions normalize.
Americas adjusted operating income of $135.5 million decreased 7.6% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 140 basis points. The decrease was driven primarily by volume deleverage, negative mix and incremental investments, partially offset by benefits from cost-reduction actions and restructuring. 
Please go to Slide #9. First quarter revenues for the Allegion International segment were $195.4 million, up 20.2% and up 11% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by strength across all major geographies and businesses as markets continue to rebound. Part of the year-over-year growth was due to the comparative impact of COVID-related shutdowns in the prior year. Favorable currency impacts also contributed to total revenue growth and were slightly offset by divestiture impacts. 
International adjusted operating income of $18 million increased nearly 1,000% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased by 820 basis points. The margin increase was driven primarily by solid volume leverage, benefits from lower operating costs from the restructuring cost-control actions taken during 2020 as well as favorable currency impacts. This is also our first quarter reporting under the new Allegion International segment. The transition was seamless and made possible by having strong leadership in place to drive effective change. 
Please go to Slide #10. Year-to-date available cash flow for the first quarter 2021 came in at $105.5 million, which is an increase of more than $86 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by improvements in net working capital, higher earnings and reduced capital expenditures. Our strong cash flow generation continues to be an asset of the company.
Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percent of revenues decreased based on a 4-point quarter average. This was driven by reduced working capital need from the lower volume throughout 2020 as well as strong collections performance. The business continues to generate strong cash flow, and we remain committed to effective and efficient use of working capital. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize working capital and drive effective cash flow conversion.
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2021 outlook."

Please go to Slide 11. We have more visibility into our markets, and I am increasingly optimistic on the economic recovery. The Americas residential business continues to be hot and is expected to grow in 2021. We anticipate strength in residential to persist for the foreseeable future. DIY demand remains strong, and the construction market is strengthened by a shortage of available new homes, continued low mortgage rates and improved trends in permits and starts. However, completion rates have been lagging starts due to labor and supply shortages, which should improve as we move further past the pandemic.
Looking at the Americas nonresidential business, we saw demand begin to increase on the repair/retrofit projects sooner than we previously anticipated. We expect this trend to continue for the remainder of the year. In new constructions, we are starting to see positive movement in macroeconomic indicators, but it's important to remember the late cycle nature of this market.
For 2021, I expect nonresidential new construction to remain soft, but the monthly change in the architectural building index, Dodge construction starts and potential stimulus spending are trending favorable. And assuming this continues, it will lead to growth in 2022 and beyond. The seamless access, software and electronics continue to be long-term growth drivers, and they will remain our top investment priorities. They are the future of Allegion.
With these parameters in place, we are now projecting total and organic revenue in the Americas to be flat to up 1% in 2021. In the Allegion International segment, markets continue to recover, and we expect full year growth in most of our International segments, led by our Germanic and Global Portable Securities business. We continue to monitor the pace of vaccine rollouts internationally as this will lead to sustainable improvements in the economic environment. Currency tailwinds more than offset the divestiture of our QMI door business and contribute to total growth.
For the region, we are raising our outlook for total revenue growth to 12% to 13% with organic growth of 7.5% to 8.5%. All in for total Allegion, we are now projecting total revenue to be up 3% to 4% and organic revenue to increase 2% to 3%.
We are also raising our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at a range of $4.85 to $5.05 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $5 and $5.15. This guide incorporates pricing actions to offset direct material inflation as well as reflecting our supply chain capability to mitigate industry challenges on supply and electronic component shortages. We anticipate that these challenges will persist for the balance of the year, and we will continue to monitor and adapt to changing market conditions. 
Our outlook for available cash flow is also being raised and now projected to be $430 million to $450 million. The outlook assumes investment spend of approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 12.5%. The outlook for outstanding diluted shares continues to be approximately 91 million.
Please go to Slide 12. Allegion is off to a great start. We experienced reported and organic revenue growth, expanded operating margins and delivered strong cash flow. We have solid business fundamentals and a proven ability to execute and adapt to changing and uncertain market conditions. We have managed the business extremely well to set us up for success as markets return to normal. Macroeconomic indicators and specific indices related to our business are trending positive, and I'm increasingly confident in the recovery.
The Allegion commitment to shareholders, employees and customers is to be stronger exiting the pandemic than when we entered, our work continues. I want to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their diligence and dedication during the pandemic. It is their commitment that has driven the company to perform well and accelerated our vision of seamless access and a safer world. Allegion's future is bright. Thank you.
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

First of all, during the course of the quarter, things progressively got better, particularly as we looked at our nonresidential business. And by that, meaning just kind of the level of activity, orders, customer enthusiasm, specifically related to discretionary projects. And so that piece of information, plus with the improvement in certain indices, leading indicators relative to our business, i.e., ABI, new construction starts, those type of things, which I'll remind you, relative to new construction, it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be incremental business this year, but continued improvement, particularly as we look out beyond 2021.
But the improvement in non-resi really relates to discretionary projects continuing to be favorable more than what we had originally anticipated last time we were on the conference call. Residential continues its strength really across the board, just really seeing good improvement in DIY, new build construction, et cetera. We expect that strength to continue.
I would just remind you, keep in mind that last year, as we're coming -- exiting out of Q2, after the plant shutdowns, demand started to surge. We were kind of catching our feet relative to production and kind of keeping up with demand. We didn't start kind of filling channel inventory until late Q3, Q4. That will be nonrecurring, right, this year. And so you get into a tougher comp, if you will, in the back half of this year as it relates to the residential business, but still growth on a normalized basis."

Why? Because of the input cost specific to commodities and material components.
The other thing I would remind you of is, remember, we talked last year about some of the boomerang effect of the cost kind of coming back in into 2021 that was not there in 2020. So that's another item. Plus, we're going to have incremental investments. All of those are going to weigh a little bit more on margin and will put more pressure, if you will, on margins in the back half of the year that, for '21, that we didn't experience in 2020. 
But let me just add something else. I think the -- on the non-resi side of things, relative to the reduced volume, even though things are getting better as we progress throughout the year, we do have volume deleverage.

Number two, our continued investment in electronics and software, our Interflex and SimonsVoss businesses are performing extremely well. I'm quite proud of the work, the leverage of investment to drive top line, which we will continue.
Third, success in our GPS business. For those of you that have gone to try and buy a bike, there's no inventory in. We made supply chain changes that gives us some advantages versus importers. We like that. And then we're beginning to see early recovery as well, Australia and New Zealand.

I think over the last 12 months, there's been the absence of any type of preventive maintenance and small project work because the focus was on the health and safety of the occupants of buildings. I believe what we saw strongly, beginning mid-March and continues on, is the return of that. People are going after those projects. Those small projects, preventive maintenance activity, particularly if it's security-related, carry a pretty high priority versus other preventive maintenance aspects.
Let's say the door doesn't shut properly, it's not locking, I have a security breach, maintenance people are always making trade-offs. As we move into the air conditioning season or I don't have heat, those tend to be a red priority. We could fall into yellow, but, Tim, I believe there's an absent -- there has been an absence of preventive maintenance, these small projects, and those are moving in. I believe the budgets are there.
I've also been refreshed that in larger projects that have -- that were delayed, those are coming back in the mid-project level. An example would be the University of Tennessee. They had a project that was slated to go in '20. That's come back on. So it's fully budgeted. I think, again, what -- that will naturally occur, and we'll get our share of that wallet.

So again, as you indicated, really strong performance, both top line and margin rate, particularly relative compared to prior year. Just as a reminder, you may recall, last year, we were pretty quick out of the gate in terms of implementing cost-control measures, going in with the restructuring programs across the board in Asia as well as Europe.
And so you're seeing kind of the full benefit of that, if you will, reflected in the '21 results. So the restructuring actions taken last year begin to lap in the back half of the year. So you're not going to see kind of a step-up in the margin performance that you saw in Q1. However, I would suggest that margins will continue to improve year-over-year as we continue throughout the year. And we should finish, on an aggregate basis, i.e., the consolidation of Asia and Europe together, at kind of a record performance in terms of margin percent.
And that's really reflective, as Dave kind of highlighted earlier, the continued strength in electronics, which has a higher-margin profile. The -- all the cost-reduction actions that we've taken will continue to manifest itself. And the collapse and consolidation of the 2 segments together, we're seeing the benefits of that as well. I feel like we're in a really good position kind of going forward, not only to drive top line, but to ensure that we do it in a profitable basis.

Preventive maintenance, small projects were delayed, and that's come back, and we're very pleased to see that. It was a little earlier. I think the results of the vaccination success we're having here in the U.S. has driven that and overall confidence. So feel good about that.  
We added to Allegion's commercial and institutional backlog in the Americas during the period. And we continue to believe that will -- that demand will continue. I think the challenge is that new construction backlog, which the projects are complete, I think it's evident in the starts data that comes out of Dodge, and we just got to work through that. I think we've got a reasonable view on it. Again, market demand was better than we anticipated in Q1, reasonably better. It's still softer than it was a year ago."

I guess there's still plenty of uncertainty on new construction, and you sort of prefaced with your answer just now that the non-res new backlog is still lower. But is it lower than what you would have thought a few months ago? I guess that would sort of imply some higher level of conversion. So I guess, that's always possible.

Significant investment and prioritization around Interflex and SimonsVoss, really nice growth over the last 6 quarters. Interflex and SimonsVoss performed exceptionally during the pandemic, and I think that momentum will continue.  
As you think about strategic priorities for Tim, it's to continue that growth and expand the cloud and technical capabilities. You know better than others that SimonsVoss really thrives on what we call active technologies. Driving more investment that goes into some of the passive areas will help fuel those -- their growth, which could include also acquisition. But we like that SimonsVoss, Interflex.

Their dedication to safety and customer excellence is outstanding.  And our teams have moved quickly to adapt to opportunities in a dynamic market. 
Before I jump into the financials, I want to give you a high-level update on recovery trends and the business overall. The pandemic has changed our world and created volatility throughout the last 18 months, both in terms of the economic contraction last year and the current economic rebound we are seeing. Starting in Q1 and accelerating in Q2, demand surged faster and stronger than expected. This is a positive sign and provides confidence in the sustainable economic recovery. In fact, Allegion is already returning to pre-pandemic demand levels. At the same time, the robust demand is constraining the global supply chain's ability to fully meet the pull for labor and materials, especially electronic components. 
Allegion has a record nonresidential backlog in 2021, which is a healthy sign of strong demand, and we believe Allegion will be well positioned for the remainder of this year and for 2022.  In another positive sign of recovery, our Americas electronics grew more than 20% in the second quarter. There was strong demand for electronic residential products and in the nonresidential retrofit, repair and small project opportunities. Allegion is not immune to inflation and the supply chain constraints impacting the industrial markets. Allegion navigated well during Q2, but these industry-wide constraints will persist for the remainder of the year and put pressure on margins for the short term. We will leverage the strength of our supply chain management capabilities as well as price to mitigate these impacts. During the pandemic, we were also able to restructure the business and make it leaner, while keeping our front-facing and strategic investments. Allegion is stronger exiting the pandemic than when we entered it. 
Now let's turn to the second quarter performance for more details. Please go to Slide 5. I'm pleased with the company's second quarter results. We delivered strong performance in all areas. Revenue for the second quarter was $746.9 million, an increase of 26.7% or 23.8% organically. The organic revenue increase was driven by the favorable comparable created by last year's shutdowns, solid price realization from the price increase announced earlier this year and the increased market demand, which returned to pre-pandemic levels. Currency tailwinds provided a boost to total revenue and more than offset the impact of divestitures. Adjusted operating margin increased by 70 basis points in the second quarter. The restructuring and cost management actions taken during 2020 along with volume leverage, have offset the accelerated inflation. We are also seeing cost creep back from reductions experienced last year during the pandemic. Mix is also a margin headwind due to our strong residential growth. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.32 increased $0.40 or 43.5% versus the prior year. The increase was driven largely by the expanded operating income with some benefits also coming from a favorable tax rate and share count. 
Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $249.6 million, an increase of $146 million versus the prior year. The increased cash flow was driven by higher net earnings, along with improvements in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures. 
Please go to Slide 6. Last quarter, I shared with you Allegion's build, borrow, buy approach to accelerating seamless access. Today, I want to briefly focus on the borrow innovation engine and our strategic pillar to be the partner of choice. Allegion participates in recognized secure industry-leading platforms. We expand our reach through strategic relationships with recognized experts and tech innovators, and we leverage open standards. By doing this, we not only set up Allegion as the partner of choice in a continued leader in the IoT marketplace, we also ensure Allegion has its choice of strategic partners as well. Allegion has a growing breadth of strategic partners, mega tech, software and product integrators, our venture portfolio and technology alliance and industry consortiums. We are executing on our partnership strategic pillar and here are a few recent examples. 
Allegion was showcased at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference. We are expanding our innovation with Apple in both the residential and commercial marketplaces. In the smart home space, Schlage will soon be growing its connected portfolio with a new device that allows people to easily and securely unlock their doors with just a tap using home keys for the iPhone or the Apple Watch. At the same time, we are extending our work with Student ID in the Apple Wallet to offer more access control options to universities and colleges, enterprises and their students plus employees. A renewed our engagement with the Matter Work Group, a mega-tech consortium. Through this partnership, we're working to establish a secure connectivity standard for the future of the smart home that will ultimately allow more seamless connections between more IoT devices. We announced the Allegion venture investments in both in-house and MAP two startups driving new value in a post-COVID world through revolutionary experiences and technology.

This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter 2020, reported earnings per share was $0.80, adjusting $0.12 for charges related to restructuring expenses, the 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $0.92. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.36, driven by volume leverage, along with continued benefits from cost control measures and restructuring actions taken in 2020. Favorable price and currency also contributed to the increase. The combination of these items offset headwinds from inflation, bounce back variable costs related to reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic and unfavorable mix. Favorable tax rate drove a $0.06 increase in earnings per share. Divestitures had a positive $0.01 per share impact and offset the impact of other income and interest expense. Investment spend increased during the quarter and reduced earnings per share by $0.05. As a reminder, the incremental investment spend is predominantly related to R&D, technology and market investments to accelerate future growth. This results in adjusted second quarter 2021 earnings per share of $1.32, an increase of $0.40 or 43.5% compared to the prior year. 
Lastly, we had a $0.01 per share reduction related to restructuring charges and acquisition and integration expenses. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the second quarter 2021 reported earnings per share of $1.31. 
Please go to Slide #8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the second quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we experienced organic revenue growth of 23.8% in the second quarter as higher demand and a favorable comparable drove significant volume increases versus the prior year. We also experienced solid price performance coming in over 2%, which is up sequentially. Currency continued to be a tailwind to total growth and more than offset the impact of divestitures. In total, reported revenue came in at 26.7% growth. 
Please go to Slide #9. Second quarter revenues for the Allegion Americas segment were $549.4 million, up 23.7% on a reported basis and 22.9% organically. While the strong book reflects the impact of COVID-related shutdowns last year, it is also the result of accelerated market demand. The region continued to deliver good price realization. On volume, Americas nonresidential experienced high single-digit growth driven by retrofit, repair and small projects. Americas residential was outstanding, again, experiencing growth of more than 70%. The significant growth from the prior year was primarily due to facility closures in 2020. However, we continue to see strength in retail point-of-sale and new home construction. Electronics revenue was up high 20s percent. We experienced electronics growth in both the nonresidential and residential businesses. Electronics and touchless solutions will continue to be a long-term growth drivers. 
The accelerated demand, coupled with labor and parts shortages, especially in electronic components is resulting in elevated backlogs as we enter the third quarter, particularly in nonresidential. The timing of when we see the revenue could shift as the industry works through the supply chain constraints. Americas adjusted operating income of $150.5 million increased 21.3% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 50 basis points. The decrease was driven by headwinds related to inflation, bounce back costs and unfavorable mix more than offsetting the volume leverage. While the price productivity inflation dynamic was slightly positive on a dollar basis, it did have a 60 basis point dilutive impact on adjusted margins as did the incremental investment spend. 
Please go to Slide #10. Second quarter revenues for the Allegion International segment were $197.5 million, up 36% and up 26.6% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven predominantly by strength across all European countries and businesses as markets continue to rebound. Part of the year-over-year growth was due to the comparative impact of COVID-related shutdowns in the prior year. Favorable currency impacts also contributed to total revenue growth and were slightly offset by divestiture impacts. International adjusted operating income of $18.5 million increased more than $18 million versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased by 920 basis points. The margin increase was driven primarily by solid volume leverage benefits from lower operating costs due to the restructuring and cost control actions taken during 2020 as well as favorable currency impacts. All of these offset the higher inflation and bounce back costs, which had a 150 basis point impact and incremental investments, which were a 20 basis point headwind. 
Please go to Slide #11. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2021 came in at $249.6 million, which is an increase of $146 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by higher earnings, improvements in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures. Our cash flow generation continues to be a strong asset for the company. 
Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percent of revenues decreased based on a 4-point quarter average. This was driven by improved asset turnover in both receivables and inventory. The business continues to generate strong cash flow and is well positioned to deliver $500 million in available cash flow for the year. I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update for our full year 2021 outlook."

I'm increasingly optimistic on the economic recovery. The Americas residential business continues to be hot. On the nonresidential side of Americas, demand accelerated for retrofit, repair and small projects and is recovering in new construction. However, labor and part charges are proving to be challenging, and we are building a strong backlog that will benefit us in the future. With these parameters in place, we are raising our outlook for total revenue in the Americas to be up 4.5% to 5% and organic revenue to be up 4% to 4.5% in 2021. 
In the Allegion International segments, markets continue to recover led by our germanic and global portable security businesses. Currency tailwinds more than offset the divestiture of our QMI door business and contribute to total growth. For that region, we are raising our outlook for total revenue growth to 13.5% to 14.5% with organic growth of 8.5% to 9.5%. All-in for total Allegion, we are now projecting total revenue to be up 7% to 7.5% and organic revenue to increase to 5.5% to 6%. We are also raising our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at a range of $5.15 to $5.30 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.25 and $5.40. This guide incorporates pricing actions to mitigate the expected impact of direct material inflation. We anticipate these inflationary challenges will persist for the balance of the year and we will continue to monitor and adapt to changing market conditions. 
Our outlook for available cash flow is also being raised and is now projected to be $490 million to $510 million. The outlook assumes investment spend of approximately $0.20 per share. The full adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 12%. The outlook for outstanding diluted shares continued to be approximately 91 million shares. 
Please go to Slide 13. Allegion continued its great start in 2021. We have managed the business extremely well and leading indicators in specific market indices related to our business continue to be positive. Looking forward, we are prepared to navigate the pressures related to accelerated inflation and labor and parts shortages. We are encouraged by the positive resiliency of our supply chain and we will continue to manage these challenges for the balance of the year. Thank you. 
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

I would characterize it this way, and you're right, there's a lot of churning the math. But what we've seen is an acceleration of inflation, predominantly in commodity costs, material components, freight, packaging, et cetera. It's continued to be a headwind. As you know, we're pretty aggressive moving on price. And we're taking similar actions in the back half of this year. We went ahead and announced a price increase that will take effect at the beginning of Q4. So there's going to be some margin pressure, I would say, given the acceleration in inflation, particularly in Q3. I expect price to offset material inflation. The issue is really in some of the other components as it relates to packaging, freight, those type of things. We'll drive productivity to help mitigate those type of things like we have previously. But it's going to be a challenge. There will be some margin pressure in the back half of the year. But I feel very confident relative to margin improvement as we go into 2022, predominantly because of the carryover price, and we'll continue to take pricing actions next year. We'll have an improved mix profile as it relates to the nonresidential business growing faster and accelerating more so than the residential business. And we're not going to have these bounce back costs, which were an issue for us in Q2 and will kind of linger during Q3, Q4 this year. So I think -- to answer your question, Josh, we'll continue to manage the business. We'll get through some of these supply chain challenges. That in and of itself will also put a little bit of margin pressure because of some of the inefficiencies of the factories. But we'll manage through it. Margins sequentially will improve in the second half relative to the first half. still down year-over-year. But then in 2020, expect margin improvement to accelerate."

Our residential backlog slightly above what we'd normally run. The backlog creation has been on the commercial side of the business and the rapid build has really happened over the last 60 to 90 days. The commercial backlog predominantly on the Americas business is double normal, and it was really driven by the acceleration of order demand that we started seeing in April. And I'll give you some backdrop here. You go back December, January, February, March, and we would have talked about this in the Q1 call, commercial institutional demand in the Americas business was down low double digits, and it's like someone turned on a light and -- it's extremely pleased with that demand acceleration. We're doing a good job of, I think, processing that through, but there's supply constraints and it's resulted in a record backlog that I think we'll continue to see. There's been analysts out there that have said we've done a better job of managing this, and I believe that to be true. Our supply chain is strong and we're going to benefit from that trend. I'd also share one other comment is, the macroeconomic forecast on what I'd say, the commercial brake fix was not particularly clear. In fact, I've got economic reports that would suggest that the repair replacement would have been soft even today. That switch came back on. We've gained that opportunity in -- so why couldn't we have seen it? When you shut off access to college campuses, hospitals and commercial buildings for 400 days, you get pent-up demand. And that's what we're seeing reacting positively in the marketplace."

First, maybe a little shout out to your international friends. Just wonder if you could give a little bit of color on how you're thinking about the margins in the back half there, right? Usually, we start fairly low in the first half and step up materially. I'm assuming from this kind of better run rate here in the first half, you're not expecting the same magnitude of step-up but assume margins are going higher. Could you just elaborate on the trajectory there, the price cost dynamics in those markets collectively, and what, if any, other restructuring benefits you have coming through."

The outstanding performance by the international team, particularly when you're looking at not only margin increase, but the top line growth. And that's been a key contributor to the margin expansion there as well. But you may recall, if you kind of look at that segment in isolation,  they were probably out in front of this pandemic quicker in terms of reducing costs, managing that side of the equation, restructuring programs that kind of went through both in Europe and Asia Pacific. We also are seeing the benefit of the amalgamation of both the Asia Pacific and European segments coming together as Allegion International. All of that combined has really accelerated the margin improvement year-over-year. The restructuring actions, the benefits we saw in the first half kind of lap, if you will, beginning in Q3. So you're not going to see the step up in margin expansion year-over-year. Seasonally, you know this, Jeff, that the margins expand in Q4 for that segment, in particular. We would expect the same seasonal increase. But the year-over-year margin improvement, you're not going to see there was some onetime benefits in Q4 that are nonrecurring this year, bounce back in cost, higher inflation, these type of things. But the great performance first half, we would expect kind of this kind of continuous margin improvement going into next year or 2. And so I really like what the team has done there, how they're executing, driving top line growth, those type of things. Great performance."

Allegion delivered a very strong quarter, and I would like to thank the employees of Allegion for their contributions and efforts. Our employees are the greatest strength of Allegion. Their dedication to safety and customer excellence is outstanding. And our teams have moved quickly to adapt to opportunities in a dynamic market.
Before I jump into the financials, I want to give you a high-level update on recovery trends and the business overall. The pandemic has changed our world and created volatility throughout the last 18 months, both in terms of the economic contraction last year and the current economic rebound we are seeing. Starting in Q1 and accelerating in Q2, demand surged faster and stronger than expected. This is a positive sign and provides confidence in the sustainable economic recovery. In fact, Allegion is already returning to pre-pandemic demand levels. At the same time, the robust demand is constraining the global supply chain's ability to fully meet the pull for labor and materials, especially electronic components.
Allegion has built a record nonresidential backlog in 2021, which is a healthy sign of strong demand, and we believe Allegion will be well positioned for the remainder of this year and for 2022. In another positive sign of recovery, our Americas electronics grew more than 20% in the second quarter. There was strong demand for electronic residential products and in the nonresidential retrofit, repair and small project opportunities. Allegion is not immune to inflation and the supply chain constraints impacting the industrial markets. Allegion navigated well during Q2, but these industry-wide constraints will persist for the remainder of the year and put pressure on margins for the short term. We will leverage the strength of our supply chain management capabilities as well as price to mitigate these impacts. During the pandemic, we were also able to restructure the business and make it leaner, while keeping our front-facing and strategic investments. Allegion is stronger exiting the pandemic than when we entered it.
Now let's turn to the second quarter performance for more details. Please go to Slide 5. I'm pleased with the company's second quarter results. We delivered strong performance in all areas. Revenue for the second quarter was $746.9 million, an increase of 26.7% or 23.8% organically. The organic revenue increase was driven by the favorable comparable created by last year's shutdowns, solid price realization from the price increase announced earlier this year and the increased market demand, which returned to pre-pandemic levels. Currency tailwinds provided a boost to total revenue and more than offset the impact of divestitures.
Adjusted operating margin increased by 70 basis points in the second quarter. The restructuring and cost management actions taken during 2020 along with volume leverage have offset the accelerated inflation. We are also seeing cost creep back from reductions experienced last year during the pandemic. Mix is also a margin headwind due to our strong residential growth.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.32 increased $0.40 or 43.5% versus the prior year. The increase was driven largely by the expanded operating income with some benefits also coming from a favorable tax rate and share count. Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $249.6 million, an increase of $146 million versus the prior year. The increased cash flow was driven by higher net earnings, along with improvements in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures.
Please go to Slide 6. Last quarter, I shared with you Allegion's build, borrow, buy approach to accelerating seamless access. Today, I want to briefly focus on the borrow innovation engine in our strategic pillar to be the partner of choice. Allegion participates in recognized, secure industry-leading platforms. We expand our reach through strategic relationships with recognized experts and tech innovators, and we leverage open standards. By doing this, we not only set up Allegion as the partner of choice and a continued leader in the IoT marketplace, we also ensure Allegion has its choice of strategic partners as well. Allegion has a growing breadth of strategic partners, mega tech, software and product integrators, our venture portfolio and technology alliance and industry consortiums. We are executing on our partnership strategic pillar and here are a few recent examples.
Allegion was showcased at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference. We are expanding our innovation with Apple in both the residential and commercial marketplaces. In the smart home space, Schlage will soon be growing its connected portfolio with a new device that allows people to easily and securely unlock their doors with just a tap using home keys for the iPhone or the Apple Watch. At the same time, we are extending our work with Student ID in the Apple Wallet to offer more access control options to universities and colleges, enterprises and their students plus employees. Allegion renewed our engagement with the Matter Work Group, a mega-tech consortium. Through this partnership, we're working to establish a secure connectivity standard for the future of the smart home that will ultimately allow more seamless connections between more IoT devices.
We announced Allegion Venture investments in both Mint House and Mapped, 2 startups driving new value in a post-COVID world through revolutionary experiences and technology. And we completed a brand-new cloud-to-cloud integration with Openpath, leveraging our ENGAGE technology and Schlage NDE and the LE mobile-enabled smart locks. Through these partnerships, we're investing in promising innovation. We are leveraging developer-friendly APIs and open standards. Allegion is building strategic, commercial and technical relationships. We are collaborating with recognized experts who also understand and embrace how Allegion creates value by securing people and assets with seamless access wherever they reside, work and thrive.
Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our revised '21 outlook and to wrap up."

Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide #7. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter 2020, reported earnings per share was $0.80, adju",902,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide #7. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter 2020, reported earnings per share was $0.80, adjusting $0.12 for charges related to restructuring expenses, the 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $0.92. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.36, driven by volume leverage, along with continued benefits from cost control measures and restructuring actions taken in 2020. Favorable price and currency also contributed to the increase. The combination of these items offset headwinds from inflation, bounce back variable costs related to reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic and unfavorable mix.
Favorable tax rate drove a $0.06 increase in earnings per share. Divestitures had a positive $0.01 per share impact and offset the impact of other income and interest expense. Investment spend increased during the quarter and reduced earnings per share by $0.05. As a reminder, the incremental investment spend is predominantly related to R&D, technology and market investments to accelerate future growth. This results in adjusted second quarter 2021 earnings per share of $1.32, an increase of $0.40 or 43.5% compared to the prior year. Lastly, we had a $0.01 per share reduction related to restructuring charges and acquisition and integration expenses. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the second quarter 2021 reported earnings per share of $1.31.
Please go to Slide #8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the second quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we experienced organic revenue growth of 23.8% in the second quarter as higher demand and a favorable comparable drove significant volume increases versus the prior year. We also experienced solid price performance coming in over 2%, which is up sequentially. Currency continued to be a tailwind to total growth and more than offset the impact of divestitures. In total, reported revenue came in at 26.7% growth.
Please go to Slide #9. Second quarter revenues for the Allegion Americas segment were $549.4 million, up 23.7% on a reported basis and 22.9% organically. While the strong growth reflects the impact of COVID-related shutdowns last year, it is also the result of accelerated market demand. The region continued to deliver good price realization. On volume, Americas nonresidential experienced high single-digit growth driven by retrofit, repair and small projects. Americas residential was outstanding, again, experiencing growth of more than 70%. The significant growth from the prior year was primarily due to facility closures in 2020. However, we continue to see strength in retail point-of-sale and new home construction.
Electronics revenue was up high 20s percent. We experienced electronics growth in both the nonresidential and residential businesses. Electronics and touchless solutions will continue to be a long-term growth drivers. The accelerated demand, coupled with labor and parts shortages, especially in electronic components is resulting in elevated backlogs as we enter the third quarter, particularly in nonresidential. The timing of when we see the revenue could shift as the industry works through the supply chain constraints.
Americas adjusted operating income of $150.5 million increased 21.3% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 50 basis points. The decrease was driven by headwinds related to inflation, bounce back costs and unfavorable mix more than offsetting the volume leverage. While the price productivity inflation dynamic was slightly positive on a dollar basis, it did have a 60 basis point dilutive impact on adjusted margins as did the incremental investment spend.
Please go to Slide #10. Second quarter revenues for the Allegion International segment were $197.5 million, up 36% and up 26.6% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven predominantly by strength across all European countries and businesses as markets continue to rebound. Part of the year-over-year growth was due to the comparative impact of COVID-related shutdowns in the prior year. Favorable currency impacts also contributed to total revenue growth and were slightly offset by divestiture impacts. International adjusted operating income of $18.5 million increased more than $18 million versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased by 920 basis points. The margin increase was driven primarily by solid volume leverage, benefits from lower operating costs due to the restructuring and cost control actions taken during 2020 as well as favorable currency impacts. All of these offset the higher inflation and bounce back costs, which had a 150 basis point impact in incremental investments, which were a 20 basis point headwind.
Please go to Slide #11. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2021 came in at $249.6 million, which is an increase of $146 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by higher earnings, improvements in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures. Our cash flow generation continues to be a strong asset for the company.
Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percent of revenues decreased based on a 4-point quarter average. This was driven by improved asset turnover in both receivables and inventory. The business continues to generate strong cash flow and is well positioned to deliver $500 million in available cash flow for the year.
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update for our full year 2021 outlook."

I'm increasingly optimistic on the economic recovery. The Americas residential business continues to be hot. On the nonresidential side of Americas, demand accelerated for retrofit, repair and small projects and is recovering in new construction. However, labor and part charges are proving to be challenging, and we are building a strong backlog that will benefit us in the future. With these parameters in place, we are raising our outlook for total revenue in the Americas to be up 4.5% to 5% and organic revenue to be up 4% to 4.5% in 2021.
In the Allegion International segments, markets continue to recover led by our Germanic and Global Portable Security businesses. Currency tailwinds more than offset the divestiture of our QMI door business and contribute to total growth. For that region, we are raising our outlook for total revenue growth to 13.5% to 14.5% with organic growth of 8.5% to 9.5%. All-in for total Allegion, we are now projecting total revenue to be up 7% to 7.5% and organic revenue to increase to 5.5% to 6%. We are also raising our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at a range of $5.15 to $5.30 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.25 and $5.40. This guide incorporates pricing actions to mitigate the inspected -- the expected impact of direct material inflation. We anticipate these inflationary challenges will persist for the balance of the year and we will continue to monitor and adapt to changing market conditions.
Our outlook for available cash flow is also being raised and is now projected to be $490 million to $510 million. The outlook assumes investment spend of approximately $0.20 per share. The full adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 12%. The outlook for outstanding diluted shares continue to be approximately 91 million shares.
Please go to Slide 13. Allegion continued its great start in 2021. We have managed the business extremely well and leading indicators in specific market indices related to our business continue to be positive. Looking forward, we are prepared to navigate the pressures related to accelerated inflation and labor and parts shortages. We are encouraged by the positive resiliency of our supply chain and we will continue to manage these challenges for the balance of the year. Thank you.

But what we've seen is an acceleration of inflation, predominantly in commodity costs, material components, freight, packaging, et cetera. It's continued to be a headwind. As you know, we're pretty aggressive moving on price. And we're taking similar actions in the back half of this year. We went ahead and announced a price increase that will take effect at the beginning of Q4. So there's going to be some margin pressure, I would say, given the acceleration in inflation, particularly in Q3. I expect price to offset material inflation. 
The issue is really in some of the other components as it relates to packaging, freight, those type of things. We'll drive productivity to help mitigate those type of things like we have previously. But it's going to be a challenge. There will be some margin pressure in the back half of the year. But I feel very confident relative to margin improvement as we go into 2022 predominantly because of the carryover price, and we'll continue to take pricing actions next year. We'll have an improved mix profile as it relates to the nonresidential business growing faster and accelerating more so than the residential business. And we're not going to have these bounce back costs, which were an issue for us in Q2 and will kind of linger during Q3, Q4 this year.
So I think to answer your question, Josh, we'll continue to manage the business. We'll get through some of these supply chain challenges. That in and of itself will also put a little bit of margin pressure because of some of the inefficiencies at the factories. But we'll manage through it. Margins sequentially will improve in the second half relative to the first half, still down year-over-year. But then in [ 2020, ] expect margin improvement to accelerate."

Our residential backlog slightly above what we'd normally run. The backlog creation has been on the commercial side of the business and the rapid build has really happened over the last 60 to 90 days. The commercial backlog predominantly on the Americas business is double normal, and it was really driven by the acceleration of order demand that we started seeing in April. And I'll give you some backdrop here. You go back December, January, February, March, and we would have talked about this in the Q1 call, commercial institutional demand in the Americas business was down low double digits, and it's like someone turned on a light and it's -- extremely pleased with that demand acceleration. We're doing a good job of, I think, processing that through, but there's supply constraints and it's resulted in a record backlog that I think we'll continue to see.
There's been analysts out there that have said we've done a better job of managing this, and I believe that to be true. Our supply chain is strong and we're going to benefit from that trend. I'd also share one other comment is, the macroeconomic forecast on what I'd say, the commercial break fix was not particularly clear. In fact, I've got economic reports that would suggest that the repair replacement would have been soft even today. That switch came back on. We've gained that opportunity in -- so why couldn't we have seen it? When you shut off access to college campuses, hospitals and commercial buildings for 400 days, you get pent-up demand.

So we're putting monies in those that I think will position us extremely well for growth going forward and will help us continue to grow faster than the broader market is the plan there.
Your question on ROIC, it's always been a really good payback, not only on investment, but on a cash on cash basis. And good things to do that will position us in the marketplace for further growth.

Outstanding performance by the international team, particularly when you're looking at not only margin increase, but the top line growth. And that's been a key contributor to the margin expansion there as well. But you may recall, if you kind of look at that segment in isolation, they were probably out in front of this pandemic quicker in terms of reducing costs, managing that side of the equation, restructuring programs that kind of went through both in Europe and Asia Pacific. We also are seeing the benefit of the amalgamation of both the Asia Pacific and European segments coming together as Allegion International. All that combined has really accelerated the margin improvement year-over-year.
The restructuring actions, the benefits we saw in the first half kind of lap, if you will, beginning in Q3. So you're not going to see the step up in margin expansion year-over-year. Seasonally, you know this, Jeff, that the margins expand in Q4 for that segment, in particular, would expect the same seasonal increase, but the year-over-year margin improvement, you're not going to see. There was some onetime benefits in Q4 that are nonrecurring this year, bounce back in cost, higher inflation, these type of things. But the -- great performance first half. We would expect kind of continuous margin improvement going into next year or 2.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before we go into our third quarter results, I'd like to take a minute to acknowledge and congratulate my fellow Allegion team members for their ongoing dedication to the environment, society and governance. I'm humbled and honored to share that just last week, Allegion was recognized for ESG leadership through 2 different awards. The Robert W. Campbell award and the Jackson Lewis Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Champion Award. The Campbell Award is an annual recognition by the National Safety Council. America's leading nonprofit safety advocate. 
It is the premier award for excellence in integrated environmental, health and safety management into business operating systems. Winners have strong processes and show measurable achievement over a 5-year period in EH&S performance that leads to productivity and profitability and are expected to demonstrate a long-term track record of not just EH&S compliance, but also critical improvements. 
The prestigious award is also known for its rigorous application process with a systematic review and audit attached to it. Submissions are reviewed by management, labor, academic and government experts from around the world, followed by a meticulous audit format at 3 or more of a company's global sites. 
With this in mind, Campbell award winners are an elite group of organizations. Past winners include Boeing, Cummins, Dow Chemical, DuPont, Honeywell Aerospace and Johnson & Johnson. Allegion is proud to have our name added to this best-in-class list. 
We are also excited to have been named the Jackson Lewis Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Champion by the Indiana Chamber of Commerce. This is a statewide honor that recognizes an organization making significant strides in the workplace. The just noted that a lesion was chosen as its first-ever winner of this award because of our company's proactive and intentional diversity, equity and inclusion efforts around the globe. 
We have strong momentum on our diversity efforts, and we know there's more work to be done. We're not asking the people of Allegion to agree on everything, but we need to be a place where racism and bias are rejected, where inclusion is a way of life and where all employees feel they belong and can contribute to our business success. 
Importantly, I've shared before that Allegion's ESG commitments are vital to how our company achieved results and the way we do business. ESG excellence will give us better long-term outcomes across the board, better employee safety, better employee engagement, better productivity, better creativity, better innovation and stronger financial performance. 
We see this firsthand and external data points to it as well. Please go to Slide 5. During the quarter, we experienced continued strength in demand, particularly in the Americas nonresidential market. This trend began in Q2 and accelerated through Q3. Leading indicators like ABI and Dodge New Construction indices remain positive. 
Increased demand is for both discretionary projects and new construction and is across all verticals and product categories. The recovery has been faster than we originally anticipated and is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Residential end market demand is also favorable across both retail point-of-sale and new home construction. 
The strength in demand continues to constrain the global supply chain's ability to fully meet demand requirements. Similar to last quarter, this was especially prevalent in electronic components in Q3. As I'm sure you're aware, this is a global issue and not isolated to Allegion or to any single industry. We have redirected resources and are taking actions such as reconfiguring and redesigning products as well as developing alternative sources of supply to help alleviate the pressures we are experiencing in procuring electronic components. 
Additionally, material and freight input costs continued to accelerate during Q3. We now anticipate material and freight inflation to be approximately $60 million higher compared to last year. In addition to the supply chain pressures we are seeing for electronics, there are also widespread industry shortages of labor and other components. 
Once again, these issues are not Allegion specific and we expect the global constraints driving these shortages to continue beyond 2021. These challenges led to margin deterioration in the quarter. We will leverage the strength of our supply chain management capabilities as well as price to help mitigate these impacts going forward. 
During the quarter, the continued robust demand, coupled with the supply chain pressures resulted in record backlogs, approximately 4x normal levels. We estimate that widespread shortages have delayed approximately $80 million to $100 million of 2021 revenue. We believe this impact is evenly distributed across the third and fourth quarter. We do not believe this is lost revenue, but expect it will be recovered as supply chain constraints ease. 
Now let's turn to the third quarter performance for more details. Please go to Slide 6. Revenue for the third quarter was $717 million, a decrease of 1.6% on both a reported and organic basis. The organic revenue decrease was driven by lower volume in the Americas region related to the aforementioned electronics, components and labor shortages. Currency tailwind and acquisitions offset the impact of divestitures. Patrick will share more details on the regions in a moment. 
Adjusted operating margins decreased by 330 basis points in the third quarter. Higher input costs, productivity challenges and volume deleverage drove the majority of the decrease. Incremental investments important to our future growth caused 90 basis points of the decline. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.56 decreased to $0.11 or 6.6% versus the prior year. The decrease was driven by reduced operating income offset by a favorable tax rate and share count. 
Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $327.7 million, an increase of $71.6 million or 28% versus the prior year. The increased cash flow was driven by higher year-to-date net earnings, along with improvement in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures.  Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back later to discuss our 2021 outlook and wrap up."

For the third quarter of 2020, reported earnings per share was $1.58, adjusting $0.09 for charges related to restructuring and impairment, the 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $1.67. 
Favorable tax rate drove a $0.13 increase in earnings per share. The negative tax rate for the third quarter reflects favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions, a benefit of mix of income as well as the nonrecurring unfavorable tax impact in 2020 related to certain valuation allowances. 
Reduced share count drove another favorable $0.04 per share. Acquisitions and divestitures had a positive $0.02 per share impact. Option results decreased earnings per share by $0.21, driven by higher material and freight costs, productivity challenges and volume deleverage, which more than offset the favorable impacts of price and currency. 
Investment spend increased during the quarter and reduced earnings per share by $0.06. As a reminder, the incremental investment spend is predominantly related to R&D technology and market investments to accelerate future growth. The combination of interest and other income drove another $0.03 per share reduction. This results in adjusted third quarter 2021 earnings per share of $1.56, a decrease of $0.11 or 6.6% compared to the prior year. 
Lastly, we have a $0.03 per share increase driven by a gain on the sale of an equity method investment, offset slightly by the combination of restructuring charges and acquisition and integration expenses. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the third quarter 2021 reported earnings per share of $1.59. 
Please go to Slide #8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the third quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we experienced an organic revenue decline of 1.6% in the third quarter. The electronics components and labor shortages, primarily in the Americas region, had an impact on our ability to meet the continued strong demand. 
Still, we realized good price performance, which offset some of the volume decline. Currency continued to be a tailwind to total growth and offset the combined impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In total, reported revenue reduced by 1.6%. 
Please go to Slide #9. Third quarter revenues for the Allegion Americas segment were $524.4 million, down 2.7% on a reported basis and 3% organically. As previously stated, the supply chain pressures we are experiencing drove the revenue decline. We are still seeing strong market demand, which has resulted in record backlogs, particularly in the nonresidential part of the business. The region continued to deliver good price realization. Our latest price increase went into effect at the beginning of October, so we expect the price realization to accelerate in the future. 
On volume, Americas nonresidential was down low single digits, driven by the electronics components and labor shortages. Americas residential was down high single digits. This was uniquely driven by the prior year being inflated by channel refill coming out of the pandemic shutdowns experienced in Q2 of 2020. The shortage of electronic components also had a negative impact on residential performance primarily in the DIY space of big box retail and e-commerce. 
Electronics revenue was down high single digits, driven by shortages of electronic components in both the nonresidential and residential businesses. Electronics and touchless solutions remain a long-term growth driver and is an integral to our investment and innovation efforts. Americas adjusted operating income of $133.7 million decreased 19.7% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 540 basis points. The decrease was driven by higher material and freight costs, productivity challenges related to inconsistent supply and volume deleverage. 
Incremental investments had a 100 basis point dilutive impact on adjusted margins. Please go to Slide #10. The Allegion International segment delivered another solid quarter. Third quarter revenues were $192.6 million, up 1.7% and up 2.5% on an organic basis. We continue to see strength in our SimonsVoss, Interflex and global portable security businesses, which, along with good price realization, drove the organic revenue growth. Favorable currency and acquisition impacts also contributed to total revenue growth and were slightly offset by divestitures. 
International adjusted operating income of $21.3 million increased 4.9% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased by 40 basis points. The margin increase was driven primarily by volume leverage, along with favorable impacts from divestitures and currency. The combination of price productivity inflation were an 80 basis point headwind to margins. Incremental investments reduced margins by 40 basis points. 
Please go to Slide #11. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter 2021 came in at $327.7 million, which is an increase of $71.6 million compared to the prior year period. The increase is attributed to higher year-to-date earnings, improvements in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures. Our cash flow generation continues to be an asset to the company. 
Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percentage of revenues decreased based on a 4-point quarter average. The business continues to manage working capital efficiently and generate strong cash flow. I will now hand it back over to Dave for some comments on our full year 2021 outlook."

On October 1, we issued a prerelease to our earnings and updated our 2021 full year outlook for revenue, earnings per share and available cash flow. We are reaffirming those updated outlooks. We have talked at length about the demand strength in the Americas business as well as supply chain pressures that are having an impact on our ability to meet that demand which will delay an estimated $80 million to $100 million of revenue. 
The outlook for total revenue in the Americas is now projected to be at 1% to 1.5%, with organic revenue growth at 0.5% to 1%. In the Allegion International segment, we have not seen as large of an impact from component and labor shortages and our SimonsVoss, Interflex and global portable security businesses continued to perform well. 
For that region, we expect total revenue growth to be between 12% and 13% with organic growth of 9% to 10%. All in for total Allegion, total revenue is projected to be up 4% to 4.5% and organic revenue is expected to increase 3% to 3.5%. We are expecting reported EPS to come in, in the range of $4.95 to $5.05 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $5 and $5.10. 
Our outlook for available cash flow is projected to be $460 million to $480 million. The outlook assumes investment spend of approximately $0.15 to $0.20 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 9%. The outlook for outstanding diluted shares is approximately 90.5 million. 
Please go to Slide #13.  As we close the presentation and move on to Q&A, I want to take some time to stress Allegion's strong long-term fundamentals. First, even with the disruption caused by the global pandemic, our strategy around seamless access and electronic transformation remains strong. We expect electronic and seamless access solutions to be the future of access control, and we are using multiple innovation engines to lead the industry. 
You've seen proactive work from Allegion through Allegion Ventures, our recent acquisitions, like you know me, and in our Interflex business, accelerating our software and tech capabilities. We're making investments and expanding partnerships with mega techs and leading access control platforms. We are making significant progress on our ESG journey. This is evident with the 2 awards that we received earlier this month, the Campbell award given by the National Safety Council is a very prestigious honor, and we joined an elite group of previous winners. I'm also proud of the Jackson Lewis Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Champion Award which we received from the Indiana Chamber, which recognizes our proactive leadership in diversity, equity and inclusion. Congratulations to the Allegion team. 
All markets in America remain robust. We continue to see positive trends from leading indicators like ABI and the Dodge New Construction Index and expect these trends to continue into 2022. With the International segment, the strength in our SimonsVoss, Interflex and global portable security business persist. We have aligned and adjusted resources to navigate and adapt the supply chain pressures that the world is experiencing. Actions taken, including the redesign of products, the development of alternative supply sources and we continue to leverage our pricing power. 
Allegion's supply chain will continue to differentiate us and the strength in our backlog would indicate that our channel partners believe we will navigate through the global pressures better than. Demand remains strong. We have implemented pricing actions that will carry forward into next year and the substantial backlog to work down. With that backdrop and assuming supply chain pressures related to inflation and component shortages begin to ease, we expect solid revenue growth with year-over-year margin improvement and continued strong cash flow generation into 2022. 
The future of Allegion remains bright. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

Number two is, some of the strength of our supply chain adaptability was evident. If we had not adapted, made design changes, over the last couple of quarters, our backlog would even be larger. 
So I feel very good about the performance and the adaptability flexibility. It's clear the electronics is going to be a problem that all companies, including Allegion will have to adapt to through 2022. I think an important element of the rest, and it's the complexity of the Allegion supply chain is the return of labor pressures to our partner suppliers.  This -- we'll have to continue to monitor. This is everything from castings to power supplies, to wire harnesses. There's a labor scarcity across the globe. And again, I believe, are adaptive at our ability to adapt and our philosophy to produce in region, will help Allegion."

So the significant portion of the margin degradation year-over-year is predominantly inflation and freight cost. And then we've got productivity challenges associated with some of the component shortages and those type of things, creating inefficiencies at our facilities. 
So if you think about it relative to -- normally, we've done a good job in terms of managing the price inflation dynamic. We're underwater today as we kind of look at that, price being lower than the incremental material and freight costs. That will get better as we kind of progress here, we're putting in more price increases to make up for the Delta. 
One of the challenges is kind of given the high backlog and the fact that a lot of the backlog today is kind of price protected. You don't see the benefit of the price increases coming through and offsetting the incremental inflation until going into 2022. 
So we're still going to be under pressure for the balance of the year, but inflation really accelerated, particularly when you look year-over-year on steel components and those type of things. So it's -- it's just -- it's one of these short-term phenomena. If you assume that inflation has kind of peaked today, going into 2022, things will kind of continue to get better than we would expect to be in the positive end of the equation as we progress throughout 2022."

We see -- I don't know if you ever -- it's an industrial game we call the beer date, bottlenecks move. There's bottlenecks at the ports, there's bottlenecks in labor. These things are going to be moving throughout the year. But my fundamental belief is Allegion has a superior ability to navigate the nation and the world will navigate it, and we'll see these things ease as we go through, and it's a tailwind to push that backlog through."

So I look at overall demand for resi as we move into '22 is net positive based on continued starts of new construction, solid repair and replacement and good multifamily. So that WIP is going on the supply chain, make sure you think of that in your models because I think a year ago, I'm sitting here talking through record backlogs in residential, we work through that. And I would suggest if you look at our performance versus our competitors that we gained share throughout the last 8 quarters."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before we go into our third quarter results, I'd like to take a minute to acknowledge and congratulate my fellow Allegion team members for their ongoing dedication to the environment, society and governance. I'm humbled and honored to share that just last week, Allegion was recognized for ESG leadership through 2 different awards. The Robert W. Campbell Award and the Jackson Lewis Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Champion Award. The Campbell Award is an annual recognition by the National Safety Council. America's leading nonprofit safety advocate. 
It is the premier award for excellence in integrated environmental, health and safety management into business operating systems. Winners have strong processes and show measurable achievement over a 5-year period in EH&S performance that leads to productivity and profitability and are expected to demonstrate a long-term track record of not just EH&S compliance, but also critical improvements. 
The prestigious award is also known for its rigorous application process with a systematic review and audit attached to it. Submissions are reviewed by management, labor, academic and government experts from around the world, followed by a meticulous audit format at 3 or more of a company's global sites. 
With this in mind, Campbell Award winners are an elite group of organizations. Past winners include Boeing, Cummins, Dow Chemical, DuPont, Honeywell Aerospace and Johnson & Johnson. Allegion is proud to have our name added to this best-in-class list. 
We are also excited to have been named the Jackson Lewis Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Champion by the Indiana Chamber of Commerce. This is a statewide honor that recognizes an organization making significant strides in the workplace. The just noted that a lesion was chosen as its first-ever winner of this award because of our company's proactive and intentional diversity, equity and inclusion efforts around the globe. 
We have strong momentum on our diversity efforts, and we know there's more work to be done. We're not asking the people of Allegion to agree on everything, but we need to be a place where racism and bias are rejected, where inclusion is a way of life and where all employees feel they belong and contribute to our business success. 
Importantly, I've shared before that Allegion's ESG commitments are vital to how our company achieved results and the way we do business. ESG excellence will give us better long-term outcomes across the board, better employee safety, better employee engagement, better productivity, better creativity, better innovation and stronger financial performance. 
We see this firsthand and external data points to it as well. Please go to Slide 5. During the quarter, we experienced continued strength in demand, particularly in the Americas nonresidential market. This trend began in Q2 and accelerated through Q3. Leading indicators like ABI and Dodge New Construction indices remain positive. 
Increased demand is for both discretionary projects and new construction and is across all verticals and product categories. The recovery has been faster than we originally anticipated and is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Residential end market demand is also favorable across both retail point-of-sale and new home construction. 
The strength in demand continues to constrain the global supply chain's ability to fully meet demand requirements. Similar to last quarter, this was especially prevalent in electronic components in Q3. As I'm sure you're aware, this is a global issue and not isolated to Allegion or to any single industry. We have redirected resources and are taking actions such as reconfiguring and redesigning products as well as developing alternative sources of supply to help alleviate the pressures we are experiencing in procuring electronic components. 
Additionally, material and freight input costs continued to accelerate during Q3. We now anticipate material and freight inflation to be approximately $60 million higher compared to last year. In addition to the supply chain pressures we are seeing for electronics, there are also widespread industry shortages of labor and other components. 
Once again, these issues are not Allegion specific and we expect the global constraints driving these shortages to continue beyond 2021. These challenges led to margin deterioration in the quarter. We will leverage the strength of our supply chain management capabilities as well as price to help mitigate these impacts going forward. 
During the quarter, the continued robust demand, coupled with the supply chain pressures resulted in record backlogs, approximately 4x normal levels. We estimate that widespread shortages have delayed approximately $80 million to $100 million of 2021 revenue. We believe this impact is evenly distributed across the third and fourth quarter. We do not believe this is lost revenue, but expect it will be recovered as supply chain constraints ease. 
Now let's turn to the third quarter performance for more details. Please go to Slide 6. Revenue for the third quarter was $717 million, a decrease of 1.6% on both a reported and organic basis. The organic revenue decrease was driven by lower volume in the Americas region related to the aforementioned electronics, components and labor shortages. Currency tailwind and acquisitions offset the impact of divestitures. Patrick will share more details on the regions in a moment. 
Adjusted operating margins decreased by 330 basis points in the third quarter. Higher input costs, productivity challenges and volume deleverage drove the majority of the decrease. Incremental investments important to our future growth caused 90 basis points of the decline. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.56 decreased to $0.11 or 6.6% versus the prior year. The decrease was driven by reduced operating income offset by a favorable tax rate and share count.
Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $327.7 million, an increase of $71.6 million or 28% versus the prior year. The increased cash flow was driven by higher year-to-date net earnings, along with improvement in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures.  Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back later to discuss our 2021 outlook and wrap up."

Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide #7. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2020, reported earnings per share was $1.58, adj",891,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide #7. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2020, reported earnings per share was $1.58, adjusting $0.09 for charges related to restructuring and impairment, the 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $1.67. 
Favorable tax rate drove a $0.13 increase in earnings per share. The negative tax rate for the third quarter reflects favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions, a benefit of mix of income as well as the nonrecurring unfavorable tax impact in 2020 related to certain valuation allowances. 
Reduced share count drove another favorable $0.04 per share. Acquisitions and divestitures had a positive $0.02 per share impact. Operational results decreased earnings per share by $0.21, driven by higher material and freight costs, productivity challenges and volume deleverage, which more than offset the favorable impacts of price and currency. 
Investment spend increased during the quarter and reduced earnings per share by $0.06. As a reminder, the incremental investment spend is predominantly related to R&D, technology and market investments to accelerate future growth. The combination of interest and other income drove another $0.03 per share reduction. This results in adjusted third quarter 2021 earnings per share of $1.56, a decrease of $0.11 or 6.6% compared to the prior year. 
Lastly, we have a $0.03 per share increase driven by a gain on the sale of an equity method investment, offset slightly by the combination of restructuring charges and acquisition and integration expenses. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the third quarter 2021 reported earnings per share of $1.59. 
Please go to Slide #8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the third quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we experienced an organic revenue decline of 1.6% in the third quarter. The electronics components and labor shortages, primarily in the Americas region, had an impact on our ability to meet the continued strong demand. 
Still, we realized good price performance, which offset some of the volume decline. Currency continued to be a tailwind to total growth and offset the combined impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In total, reported revenue reduced by 1.6%. 
Please go to Slide #9. Third quarter revenues for the Allegion Americas segment were $524.4 million, down 2.7% on a reported basis and 3% organically. As previously stated, the supply chain pressures we are experiencing drove the revenue decline. We are still seeing strong market demand, which has resulted in record backlogs, particularly in the nonresidential part of the business. The region continued to deliver good price realization. Our latest price increase went into effect at the beginning of October, so we expect the price realization to accelerate in the future. 
On volume, Americas nonresidential was down low single digits, driven by the electronics components and labor shortages. Americas residential was down high single digits. This was uniquely driven by the prior year being inflated by channel refill coming out of the pandemic shutdowns experienced in Q2 of 2020. The shortage of electronic components also had a negative impact on residential performance primarily in the DIY space of big-box retail and e-commerce. 
Electronics revenue was down high single digits, driven by shortages of electronic components in both the nonresidential and residential businesses. Electronics and touchless solutions remain a long-term growth driver and is an integral to our investment and innovation efforts. Americas adjusted operating income of $133.7 million decreased 19.7% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 540 basis points. The decrease was driven by higher material and freight costs, productivity challenges related to inconsistent supply and volume deleverage. 
Incremental investments had a 100 basis points dilutive impact on adjusted margins. Please go to Slide #10. The Allegion International segment delivered another solid quarter. Third quarter revenues were $192.6 million, up 1.7% and up 2.5% on an organic basis. We continue to see strength in our SimonsVoss, Interflex and Global Portable Security businesses, which, along with good price realization, drove the organic revenue growth. Favorable currency and acquisition impacts also contributed to total revenue growth and were slightly offset by divestitures. 
International adjusted operating income of $21.3 million increased 4.9% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased by 40 basis points. The margin increase was driven primarily by volume leverage, along with favorable impacts from divestitures and currency. The combination of price, productivity inflation were an 80 basis point headwind to margins. Incremental investments reduced margins by 40 basis points. 
Please go to Slide #11. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter 2021 came in at $327.7 million, which is an increase of $71.6 million compared to the prior year period. The increase is attributed to higher year-to-date earnings, improvements in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures. Our cash flow generation continues to be an asset to the company. 
Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percentage of revenues decreased based on a 4-point quarter average. The business continues to manage working capital efficiently and generates strong cash flow. I will now hand it back over to Dave for some comments on our full year 2021 outlook."

On October 1, we issued a prerelease to our earnings and updated our 2021 full year outlook for revenue, earnings per share and available cash flow. We are reaffirming those updated outlooks. We have talked at length about the demand strength in the Americas business as well as supply chain pressures that are having an impact on our ability to meet that demand which will delay an estimated $80 million to $100 million of revenue. 
The outlook for total revenue in the Americas is now projected to be at 1% to 1.5%, with organic revenue growth at 0.5% to 1%. In the Allegion International segment, we have not seen as large of an impact from component and labor shortages and our SimonsVoss, Interflex and Global Portable Security businesses continued to perform well. 
For that region, we expect total revenue growth to be between 12% and 13%, with organic growth of 9% to 10%. All in for total Allegion, total revenue is projected to be up 4% to 4.5% and organic revenue is expected to increase 3% to 3.5%. We are expecting reported EPS to come in, in the range of $4.95 to $5.05 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $5 and $5.10. 
Our outlook for available cash flow is projected to be $460 million to $480 million. The outlook assumes investment spend of approximately $0.15 to $0.20 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 9%. The outlook for outstanding diluted shares is approximately 90.5 million. 
Please go to Slide #13.  As we close the presentation and move on to Q&A, I want to take some time to stress Allegion's strong long-term fundamentals. First, even with the disruption caused by the global pandemic, our strategy around seamless access and electronic transformation remains strong. We expect electronic and seamless access solutions to be the future of access control, and we are using multiple innovation engines to lead the industry. 
You've seen proactive work from Allegion through Allegion Ventures, our recent acquisitions, like you know me, and in our Interflex business, accelerating our software and tech capabilities. We're making investments and expanding partnerships with mega-techs and leading access control platforms. We are making significant progress on our ESG journey. This is evident with the 2 awards that we received earlier this month, the Campbell Award given by the National Safety Council is a very prestigious honor, and we joined an elite group of previous winners. I'm also proud of the Jackson Lewis Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Champion Award which we received from the Indiana Chamber, which recognizes our proactive leadership in diversity, equity and inclusion. Congratulations to the Allegion team. 
All markets in America remain robust. We continue to see positive trends from leading indicators like ABI and the Dodge New Construction Index and expect these trends to continue into 2022. With the International segment, the strength in our SimonsVoss, Interflex and Global Portable Security business persists. We have aligned and adjusted resources to navigate and adapt the supply chain pressures that the world is experiencing. Actions taken, including the redesign of products, the development of alternative supply sources and we continue to leverage our pricing power. 
Allegion's supply chain will continue to differentiate us and the strength in our backlog would indicate that our channel partners believe we will navigate through the global pressures [indiscernible]. Demand remains strong. We have implemented pricing actions that will carry forward into next year and the substantial backlog to work down. With that backdrop and assuming supply chain pressures related to inflation and component shortages begin to ease, we expect solid revenue growth with year-over-year margin improvement and continued strong cash flow generation into 2022. 
The future of Allegion remains bright. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

So I feel very good about the performance and the adaptability flexibility. It's clear the electronics is going to be a problem that all companies, including Allegion will have to adapt to through 2022. I think an important element of the rest, and it's the complexity of the Allegion supply chain is the return of labor pressures to our partner suppliers. This -- we'll have to continue to monitor. This is everything from castings to power supplies, to wire harnesses. There's a labor scarcity across the globe. And again, I believe, our adaptive -- our ability to adapt and our philosophy to produce in region, will help Allegion."

So the significant portion of the margin degradation year-over-year is predominantly inflation and freight cost. And then we've got productivity challenges associated with some of the component shortages and those type of things, creating inefficiencies at our facilities. 
So if you think about it relative to -- normally, we've done a good job in terms of managing the price inflation dynamic. We're underwater today as we kind of look at that, price being lower than the incremental material and freight costs. That will get better as we kind of progress here, we're putting in more price increases to make up for the Delta. 
One of the challenges is kind of given the high backlog and the fact that a lot of the backlog today is kind of price protected. You don't see the benefit of the price increases coming through and offsetting the incremental inflation until going into 2022. 
So we're still going to be under pressure for the balance of the year, but inflation really accelerated, particularly when you look year-over-year on steel components and those type of things. So it's -- it's just -- it's one of these short-term phenomenas. If you assume that inflation has kind of peaked today, going into 2022, things will kind of continue to get better than we would expect to be in the positive end of the equation as we progress throughout 2022."

And then we've also gotten some questions from investors today around the fact that pricing stepped down on a year-over-year basis, if you took a look at the second quarter versus 3Q. So curious like any comments around why pricing was a little bit weaker in 3Q versus 2Q?"

Allegion delivered a very strong quarter, and I would like to thank the employees of Allegion for their contributions and efforts. Our employees are the greatest strength of Allegion. Their dedication to safety and customer excellence is outstanding. And our teams have moved quickly to adapt to opportunities in a dynamic market.
Before I jump into the financials, I want to give you a high-level update on recovery trends and the business overall. The pandemic has changed our world and created volatility throughout the last 18 months, both in terms of the economic contraction last year and the current economic rebound we are seeing. Starting in Q1 and accelerating in Q2, demand surged faster and stronger than expected. This is a positive sign and provides confidence in the sustainable economic recovery. In fact, Allegion is already returning to pre-pandemic demand levels. At the same time, the robust demand is constraining the global supply chain's ability to fully meet the pull for labor and materials, especially electronic components.
Allegion has built a record nonresidential backlog in 2021, which is a healthy sign of strong demand, and we believe Allegion will be well positioned for the remainder of this year and for 2022. In another positive sign of recovery, our Americas electronics grew more than 20% in the second quarter. There was strong demand for electronic residential products and in the nonresidential retrofit, repair and small project opportunities. Allegion is not immune to inflation and the supply chain constraints impacting the industrial markets. Allegion navigated well during Q2, but these industry-wide constraints will persist for the remainder of the year and put pressure on margins for the short term. We will leverage the strength of our supply chain management capabilities as well as price to mitigate these impacts. During the pandemic, we were also able to restructure the business and make it leaner, while keeping our front-facing and strategic investments. Allegion is stronger exiting the pandemic than when we entered it.
Now let's turn to the second quarter performance for more details. Please go to Slide 5. I'm pleased with the company's second quarter results. We delivered strong performance in all areas. Revenue for the second quarter was $746.9 million, an increase of 26.7% or 23.8% organically. The organic revenue increase was driven by the favorable comparable created by last year's shutdowns, solid price realization from the price increase announced earlier this year and the increased market demand, which returned to pre-pandemic levels. Currency tailwinds provided a boost to total revenue and more than offset the impact of divestitures.
Adjusted operating margin increased by 70 basis points in the second quarter. The restructuring and cost management actions taken during 2020 along with volume leverage have offset the accelerated inflation. We are also seeing cost creep back from reductions experienced last year during the pandemic. Mix is also a margin headwind due to our strong residential growth.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.32 increased $0.40 or 43.5% versus the prior year. The increase was driven largely by the expanded operating income with some benefits also coming from a favorable tax rate and share count. Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $249.6 million, an increase of $146 million versus the prior year. The increased cash flow was driven by higher net earnings, along with improvements in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures.
Please go to Slide 6. Last quarter, I shared with you Allegion's build, borrow, buy approach to accelerating seamless access. Today, I want to briefly focus on the borrow innovation engine in our strategic pillar to be the partner of choice. Allegion participates in recognized, secure industry-leading platforms. We expand our reach through strategic relationships with recognized experts and tech innovators, and we leverage open standards. By doing this, we not only set up Allegion as the partner of choice and a continued leader in the IoT marketplace, we also ensure Allegion has its choice of strategic partners as well. Allegion has a growing breadth of strategic partners, mega tech, software and product integrators, our venture portfolio and technology alliance and industry consortiums. We are executing on our partnership strategic pillar and here are a few recent examples.
Allegion was showcased at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference. We are expanding our innovation with Apple in both the residential and commercial marketplaces. In the smart home space, Schlage will soon be growing its connected portfolio with a new device that allows people to easily and securely unlock their doors with just a tap using home keys for the iPhone or the Apple Watch. At the same time, we are extending our work with Student ID in the Apple Wallet to offer more access control options to universities and colleges, enterprises and their students plus employees. Allegion renewed our engagement with the Matter Work Group, a mega-tech consortium. Through this partnership, we're working to establish a secure connectivity standard for the future of the smart home that will ultimately allow more seamless connections between more IoT devices.
We announced Allegion Venture investments in both Mint House and Mapped, 2 startups driving new value in a post-COVID world through revolutionary experiences and technology. And we completed a brand-new cloud-to-cloud integration with Openpath, leveraging our ENGAGE technology and Schlage NDE and the LE mobile-enabled smart locks. Through these partnerships, we're investing in promising innovation. We are leveraging developer-friendly APIs and open standards. Allegion is building strategic, commercial and technical relationships. We are collaborating with recognized experts who also understand and embrace how Allegion creates value by securing people and assets with seamless access wherever they reside, work and thrive.
Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our revised '21 outlook and to wrap up."

Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide #7. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the second quarter.

This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter 2020, reported earnings per share was $0.80, adjusting $0.12 for charges related to restructuring expenses, the 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $0.92. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.36, driven by volume leverage, along with continued benefits from cost control measures and restructuring actions taken in 2020. Favorable price and currency also contributed to the increase. The combination of these items offset headwinds from inflation, bounce back variable costs related to reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic and unfavorable mix.
Favorable tax rate drove a $0.06 increase in earnings per share. Divestitures had a positive $0.01 per share impact and offset the impact of other income and interest expense. Investment spend increased during the quarter and reduced earnings per share by $0.05. As a reminder, the incremental investment spend is predominantly related to R&D, technology and market investments to accelerate future growth. This results in adjusted second quarter 2021 earnings per share of $1.32, an increase of $0.40 or 43.5% compared to the prior year. Lastly, we had a $0.01 per share reduction related to restructuring charges and acquisition and integration expenses. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the second quarter 2021 reported earnings per share of $1.31.
Please go to Slide #8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the second quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we experienced organic revenue growth of 23.8% in the second quarter as higher demand and a favorable comparable drove significant volume increases versus the prior year. We also experienced solid price performance coming in over 2%, which is up sequentially. Currency continued to be a tailwind to total growth and more than offset the impact of divestitures. In total, reported revenue came in at 26.7% growth.
Please go to Slide #9. Second quarter revenues for the Allegion Americas segment were $549.4 million, up 23.7% on a reported basis and 22.9% organically. While the strong growth reflects the impact of COVID-related shutdowns last year, it is also the result of accelerated market demand. The region continued to deliver good price realization. On volume, Americas nonresidential experienced high single-digit growth driven by retrofit, repair and small projects. Americas residential was outstanding, again, experiencing growth of more than 70%. The significant growth from the prior year was primarily due to facility closures in 2020. However, we continue to see strength in retail point-of-sale and new home construction.
Electronics revenue was up high 20s percent. We experienced electronics growth in both the nonresidential and residential businesses. Electronics and touchless solutions will continue to be a long-term growth drivers. The accelerated demand, coupled with labor and parts shortages, especially in electronic components is resulting in elevated backlogs as we enter the third quarter, particularly in nonresidential. The timing of when we see the revenue could shift as the industry works through the supply chain constraints.
Americas adjusted operating income of $150.5 million increased 21.3% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 50 basis points. The decrease was driven by headwinds related to inflation, bounce back costs and unfavorable mix more than offsetting the volume leverage. While the price productivity inflation dynamic was slightly positive on a dollar basis, it did have a 60 basis point dilutive impact on adjusted margins as did the incremental investment spend.
Please go to Slide #10. Second quarter revenues for the Allegion International segment were $197.5 million, up 36% and up 26.6% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven predominantly by strength across all European countries and businesses as markets continue to rebound. Part of the year-over-year growth was due to the comparative impact of COVID-related shutdowns in the prior year. Favorable currency impacts also contributed to total revenue growth and were slightly offset by divestiture impacts. International adjusted operating income of $18.5 million increased more than $18 million versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased by 920 basis points. The margin increase was driven primarily by solid volume leverage, benefits from lower operating costs due to the restructuring and cost control actions taken during 2020 as well as favorable currency impacts. All of these offset the higher inflation and bounce back costs, which had a 150 basis point impact in incremental investments, which were a 20 basis point headwind.
Please go to Slide #11. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2021 came in at $249.6 million, which is an increase of $146 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by higher earnings, improvements in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures. Our cash flow generation continues to be a strong asset for the company.
Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percent of revenues decreased based on a 4-point quarter average. This was driven by improved asset turnover in both receivables and inventory. The business continues to generate strong cash flow and is well positioned to deliver $500 million in available cash flow for the year.
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update for our full year 2021 outlook."

I'm increasingly optimistic on the economic recovery. The Americas residential business continues to be hot. On the nonresidential side of Americas, demand accelerated for retrofit, repair and small projects and is recovering in new construction. However, labor and part charges are proving to be challenging, and we are building a strong backlog that will benefit us in the future. With these parameters in place, we are raising our outlook for total revenue in the Americas to be up 4.5% to 5% and organic revenue to be up 4% to 4.5% in 2021.
In the Allegion International segments, markets continue to recover led by our Germanic and Global Portable Security businesses. Currency tailwinds more than offset the divestiture of our QMI door business and contribute to total growth. For that region, we are raising our outlook for total revenue growth to 13.5% to 14.5% with organic growth of 8.5% to 9.5%. All-in for total Allegion, we are now projecting total revenue to be up 7% to 7.5% and organic revenue to increase to 5.5% to 6%. We are also raising our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at a range of $5.15 to $5.30 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.25 and $5.40. This guide incorporates pricing actions to mitigate the inspected -- the expected impact of direct material inflation. We anticipate these inflationary challenges will persist for the balance of the year and we will continue to monitor and adapt to changing market conditions.
Our outlook for available cash flow is also being raised and is now projected to be $490 million to $510 million. The outlook assumes investment spend of approximately $0.20 per share. The full adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 12%. The outlook for outstanding diluted shares continue to be approximately 91 million shares.
Please go to Slide 13. Allegion continued its great start in 2021. We have managed the business extremely well and leading indicators in specific market indices related to our business continue to be positive. Looking forward, we are prepared to navigate the pressures related to accelerated inflation and labor and parts shortages. We are encouraged by the positive resiliency of our supply chain and we will continue to manage these challenges for the balance of the year. Thank you.
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

I would characterize it this way, and you're right, there's a lot of [indiscernible] the math. But what we've seen is an acceleration of inflation, predominantly in commodity costs, material components, freight, packaging, et cetera. It's continued to be a headwind. As you know, we're pretty aggressive moving on price. And we're taking similar actions in the back half of this year. We went ahead and announced a price increase that will take effect at the beginning of Q4. So there's going to be some margin pressure, I would say, given the acceleration in inflation, particularly in Q3. I expect price to offset material inflation. 
The issue is really in some of the other components as it relates to packaging, freight, those type of things. We'll drive productivity to help mitigate those type of things like we have previously. But it's going to be a challenge. There will be some margin pressure in the back half of the year. But I feel very confident relative to margin improvement as we go into 2022 predominantly because of the carryover price, and we'll continue to take pricing actions next year. We'll have an improved mix profile as it relates to the nonresidential business growing faster and accelerating more so than the residential business. And we're not going to have these bounce back costs, which were an issue for us in Q2 and will kind of linger during Q3, Q4 this year.
So I think to answer your question, Josh, we'll continue to manage the business. We'll get through some of these supply chain challenges. That in and of itself will also put a little bit of margin pressure because of some of the inefficiencies at the factories. But we'll manage through it. Margins sequentially will improve in the second half relative to the first half, still down year-over-year. But then in [ 2020, ] expect margin improvement to accelerate."

Our residential backlog slightly above what we'd normally run. The backlog creation has been on the commercial side of the business and the rapid build has really happened over the last 60 to 90 days. The commercial backlog predominantly on the Americas business is double normal, and it was really driven by the acceleration of order demand that we started seeing in April. And I'll give you some backdrop here. You go back December, January, February, March, and we would have talked about this in the Q1 call, commercial institutional demand in the Americas business was down low double digits, and it's like someone turned on a light and it's -- extremely pleased with that demand acceleration. We're doing a good job of, I think, processing that through, but there's supply constraints and it's resulted in a record backlog that I think we'll continue to see.
There's been analysts out there that have said we've done a better job of managing this, and I believe that to be true. Our supply chain is strong and we're going to benefit from that trend. I'd also share one other comment is, the macroeconomic forecast on what I'd say, the commercial break fix was not particularly clear. In fact, I've got economic reports that would suggest that the repair replacement would have been soft even today. That switch came back on. We've gained that opportunity in -- so why couldn't we have seen it? When you shut off access to college campuses, hospitals and commercial buildings for 400 days, you get pent-up demand.

So Julian, just as a reminder, last year, as we're coming out of the pandemic and demand started to surge for replacement demand on residential products, backlog accelerated channel inventories were depleted. And so a lot of the revenue growth last year was channel fill, big box, retail, e-commerce, et cetera. And so you're getting a tough comp, particularly in the second half as it relates to the residential business. And so that's going to impact the comparability, particularly when you're looking at overall Allegion Americas business. As we indicated, nonresidential business starting to show good demand, a little bit constrained relative to the supply chain issues. But we'll start seeing some growth kind of year-over-year.

Part of what the Allegion franchise is built on is managing this complexity. Our supply chain does an important part of -- plays a critical part of that, but it's rethinking those partnerships, making sure that we've got the availability of any type of part to be able to move it.

Again, it's dominated, I think, by modernization, things that you talked about HVAC. We're going to benefit as a result of that stimulus. I would also say there will continue to be a drive in the K-12 sector to modernize. The average K-12 structure is 40 years old. Security threats persist and access into schools is becoming more sophisticated because of people's edge device, electronic locks, and Allegion is going to benefit from that."

But can you talk about your ability to hold price when you come out of these inflationary cycles, there's probably some regular pricing activity. I think you used the term surcharges for some things as well that maybe those are a little bit more transitory and go away when inflation abates, but can you just talk about your historical experience there, if we think about margin next year?"

So historically, the price increases announced that are permanent in nature, stick going forward, okay, i.e., even in deflationary periods, prices remain the same, and a fairly disciplined industry here.

First, maybe a little shout out to your international friends. Just wonder if you could give a little bit of color on how you're thinking about the margins in the back half there, right? Usually, we start fairly low in the first half and step up materially. I'm assuming from this kind of better run rate here in the first half, you're not expecting the same magnitude of step-up, but I assume the margins are going higher. Could you just elaborate on the trajectory there, the price cost dynamics in those markets collectively, and what, if any, other restructuring benefits you have coming through?"

Outstanding performance by the international team, particularly when you're looking at not only margin increase, but the top line growth. And that's been a key contributor to the margin expansion there as well. But you may recall, if you kind of look at that segment in isolation, they were probably out in front of this pandemic quicker in terms of reducing costs, managing that side of the equation, restructuring programs that kind of went through both in Europe and Asia Pacific. We also are seeing the benefit of the amalgamation of both the Asia Pacific and European segments coming together as Allegion International. All that combined has really accelerated the margin improvement year-over-year.
The restructuring actions, the benefits we saw in the first half kind of lap, if you will, beginning in Q3. So you're not going to see the step up in margin expansion year-over-year. Seasonally, you know this, Jeff, that the margins expand in Q4 for that segment, in particular, would expect the same seasonal increase, but the year-over-year margin improvement, you're not going to see. There was some onetime benefits in Q4 that are nonrecurring this year, bounce back in cost, higher inflation, these type of things. But the -- great performance first half. We would expect kind of continuous margin improvement going into next year or 2. And so I really like what the team has done there, how they're executing, driving top line growth, those type of things. Great performance."

Is that really the message that there kind of in normal circumstances, there would be more upside into the back half, just unlocking this backlog, but just the physical ability to get it out the door, whether it's your own factory or inputs from suppliers, just keeping a lid on what you can actually execute on in 2021."
