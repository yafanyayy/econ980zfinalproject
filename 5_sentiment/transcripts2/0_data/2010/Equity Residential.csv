Well 2009 was certainly a very challenging year for the multifamily business. Really, we've never navigated through such uncertainty caused by such unprecedented job loss. Yet I've got to tell you, I could not been more pleased nor more proud of the way the Equity Residential team rose to the occasion, despite such challenging market conditions.For the year, same-store revenue results were down only 2.9%. The number's right on top of the mid-point of our original guidance that I've given to you all, one year ago. At our operating platform delivered strong same-store expense growth for the year, down 0.1%, and that really is a terrific outcome when compared to the comp year a year ago when expenses were up only 2.2%.Now thinking about this great expense control, I want to make something perfectly clear. This is not the result of reducing services to our residents and it's not the result of cutting back on how we care for our assets. And we know that because our customer service scores increased again in 2009, but it's the result of doing exactly what we have always been doing by using our scale, our concentration and technology to do it cheaper.So as evidenced by our guidance for 2010 in last night's release, we're expecting the picture to improve a little bit as the year progresses. Now in just a minute, Fred will go into a little bit more detail on what we're currently seeing and how we are thinking about revenues for 2010. But before he does that, I first want to say that we are already experiencing improving occupancy across many markets. When seasonally for this time of year, we would be expecting just the opposite to be happening. And while we still have above market leases that will need to be adjusted downward, our net effect of new lease rates are beginning to turn a little bit positive in many markets. And while our 2009 renewals were on average extended at flat to slightly negative levels, we'll beginning to see more renewals today with a very modest upward bias.Now this is all good news for the Apartment business, but I want to make sure that everyone understands, I'm not suggesting that we're experiencing any kind of sharp inflection here. I would rather say, we think we are at the beginning of a period of slowly and I do mean slowly improving fundamentals. But when job returns, if you add job growth to that picture, we believe that will quickly turn into one of the best operating periods in our history. So with that in mind, Fred, give everybody please a little color on how we are looking at revenues for 2010."

And this is based on what we're seeing on the ground today and the trends the we expect the business to follow over the coming year. So first, as",1249,"Thank you, David. So I'll give you a little more detail around our 2010 guidance for the same-store revenue. And this is based on what we're seeing on the ground today and the trends the we expect the business to follow over the coming year. So first, as you know, our rental revenue is mostly impacted by four key drivers:  First, we have a continued roll down of those embedded leases that are currently above market rents, those have to roll down to net effective new lease rates; second is the rental rates achieved on our renewals; third is the resident turnover rate; and fourth is any change assumed in physical occupancy.So at a starting point, if you look at this year, assuming first, assuming no change in occupancy for the moment, our budgets would lead us to think that same-store rental revenue would decline by about a negative 2.9%. As that is just the mix of those first three things without an occupancy change. Then when we adjust for unexpected at least half point occupancy gains and some contribution from our other income categories, then we get to the total same-store revenue of down roughly 2%, which is right in the midpoint of our guidance range. So let's go to look a more detail in each one of those.First let's look at the net effective new lease rates. And if you remember, these are the current rents that we're achieving on brand new leases on a net effective basis, so new people moving in net effective rates. And as noted in previous quarters throughout 2009 is net effective new lease rates have remained relatively stable since January of last year. So had a big roll down late 2008, and we weren't sure what was going to happen in 2009 but we're very pleased with each quarter ticked off in '09. That those rents are pretty stable, up a little bit, down a little bit, but overall on a very narrow band. Let's stay right up to the end of 2009, but right at the end of fourth quarter, we noticed some pretty good seasonal pricing trends begin to develop.As we turned the quarter in late December and into January, we see a slight upward movement continuing in the first quarter of 2010. So after bouncing along a year-long bottom, we're seeing a modest but definitely noticeable upward trend in rates.Now the markets that are leading this upward trend include Boston; Washington D.C.; Denver, Colorado; and now South Florida. Boston is the strongest performer in this regard and rents are up about 3.3% from the same week a year ago. Now some markets are a little bit slower, they are lagging. Those that entered the recession later, kind of last to the end of the downturn such as Seattle and San Francisco. And then also those with deeper economic problems, larger scale job losses, maybe less chance for a recovery such as Phoenix, Arizona and the Inland Empire, it's is going to take longer. They're always going to lag in this recovery of rents. They will get there, it's just going to take a little while longer.Seattle is the farthest behind, and their net effective new lease rates are now about 9% below the same point a year ago. Now let's talk about the renewal fees. Obviously, the roll down to new pricing levels will continue through most of 2010. However, the downward trend as this process occurs is moderated, kind of a governor has put on it by the achieved renewal rates that you can get on those that do not move out.As we mentioned through 2009, we are very pleased. Initially surprised but very pleased that the net 12 month renewal rates on those people renewing, we were able to do that basically flat or only slightly down. That was a great kind of proof of consumer behavior, they are satisfied with their apartment, they are in there, they like us, they stay, they pay and they say good things about us.So the whole renewal process, our strategy starting with our pricing, our sales and communication of it, and we talk people through those change. Communicate, motivate but do not capitulate on those rents. So despite the reduced net effective new lease rates, as we turned into 2010, it has turned positive with an average increase of just under 1% up for our January renewals. And the February trend, we have already read about 39% for February, we're not done yet, so as another significant increase on this. As we get to the easier comp periods of the past plus our ability to sell renewals and negotiate tough, we are seeing a good lift on this renewal basis, which is a significant moderator to the roll down of rent rolls.So all about three of our core markets are now achieving positive renewal rate gains, led by the D.C. Maryland market at up 4.4%, and that's very healthy renewal rates in any market. However, in contrast, Seattle. Again, sorry to pick on Seattle. But as the rents were declining further, as we have noted earlier, they are averaging a 2.4% reduction in 12 months renewal rates in January. So we are seeing some write down in the renewal side piece as well in Seattle.Now coupled with this is resident turnover. And as you know, resident turnover has improved steadily over these past few years. We've been very happy with our resident retention movement. But for the 2010 budget baked into this guidance, we're assuming that it will remain flat for 2009.That brings us to the final driver of rental revenue, which is that of occupancy. As David mentioned, counter to seasonal expectations, leasing remained strong through late Q4 and well into January. Our occupancy has climbed of late and we're now at 94.6% as of yesterday. And it's the broad-based movement, many markets have experienced recent upmoves in occupancy right at a time when you think it might be moderating or soft.Some of these markets have made a move as great as 100 basis points. However, with stable or actually improving net effect of new lease rates. These improved markets like Los Angeles, which is now at 95% occupied, South Florida, 94.8% and Atlanta, Georgia even at 95.5%. And again we did not buy these occupancy gains. And this is the most encouraging signal to me to the start of 2010.So to recap our assumptions for the guidance for this year, our portfolio average net effect of new lease rates have turned upward and we believe this will continue, returning to a slight and modest growth by the years end. Renewal rates will remained positive and growth stronger throughout the year. The Resident turnover will hold steady at 61%.Put this into the rental revenue blender and you get 2.9% decline. However, offset favorably by a half point improvement in occupancy and a further contribution by other income, and again that yield been an approximate 2% decline in same-store revenues. For the entire year of 2010, it represents the midpoint of our guidance.So overall, we are very happy to see some positive signs out there in our system, but we have to remember, there's still a long way to go. Our platform and our people have served us extremely well in 2009. And we feel right now as we enter this year, we're very well positioned to capture the opportunities of a much awaited and much welcomed recovery. Thanks."

Turning to transactions here after sitting on the side lines for quite a while, and not making any acquisitions due to uncertainty about property violations as well as more an important need to pour cash and manage the balance sheet, we've become more active on the buy side over the last 90 days.Now as I said for quite some time, we would begin buying again when two things happen. Number one, we needed to become confident in our ability to fund our maturing debts in the normal course of business. And number two, we said we'd begin buying again when we began to see attractive pricing on good quality assets in core markets. Assets that we could acquire a discount replacement costs at good IRRs and which we thought we'd create good long-term value for our shareholders.We did acquire two assets in the fourth quarter of last year. But first, we discussed a little bit on our last earnings call in late October, and that was a high rise tower in the Pentagon City neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia. Built in 2004, we pro forma the 6.1% yield on that asset in our first year. The second acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2009 was Mosaic at Largo Station. That deal was in Maryland just east of the district near FedEx Field. That was completed in 2008, and was still in leased up when we acquired it and we'd pro forma there a stabilized yield in the high sixes.And more recently, thus far in 2010, we have acquired five additional assets. The two Macklowe assets, which we announced on Monday, which we're just extremely well located in premier multifamily assets. But in addition to those, we acquired a mid-rise property near the beach in Delamar, California which was built in 1998. We are going to do a repositioning on this asset, and we project it a year or a two yield of 6.7%.We've also acquired another high rise tower in Arlington, Virginia called Vista on Courthouse, that deal was built in 2008 and we pro forma on a 5.9% per share yield on that acquisition. We've also acquired just this week and closed on Tuesday, a mid-rise property in Seattle built in 2002 and we acquired that with a 6.6% cap rate.And of course, won a contract to acquire the third Macklowe asset, which will close no later than May 1. We're also pursuing a couple of additional deals, each of which we think are extremely well-located, the high-quality assets, which we think we can acquire at attractive prices at good discounts replacement costs, double-digit IRRs and again, which we will think will provide better long-term total returns in the assets that we're selling.So meanwhile, the markets remained open for the assets that we've targeted for disposition. These are assets in non-core markets, where assets in less attractive submarkets with a risk to valuations going forward. So we continue to sell assets through the fourth quarter, sold three deals in North Carolina, a 37-year-old deal in Atlanta, a 48-year-old asset in Rockville, Maryland. We've also got a pretty good pipeline of potential dispositions in 2010. We're currently working on several more deals in North Carolina, which will nearly complete our exit from that market, working on a portfolio of smaller assets in our non-Boston, new England markets and a property in Jacksonville, Florida just to name a few.But I want to just as everybody understand that our motivation to sell today has changed as of late. Going forward, we will continue to sell if we can find attractive acquisition opportunities that it make sense to recycle that capital into. Because in 2010, we don't expect to be selling to raise capital for liquidity and debt repayment purposes that was behind much of the selling over the last couple of years. Our thinking is now back to what it was prior to the credit meltdown that will be a seller if we think we have a core market reinvestment opportunity that will provide a better, long-term total return on our capital.On the development front, our focus in 2009 was to complete the lease and to stabilize our existing deals. And we're very pleased with our progress on all fronts. During the year, we completed six assets, totaling $670 million of development cost. We've stabilized seven projects, totaling nearly 1,600 units. In the fourth quarter alone, we leased 375 units and had 338 new move-ins just in the fourth quarter of 2009.Now like everywhere, our rents are below our expectations, they are down about 18% on average on a net effective basis from our original underwriting but that's just the fact of what's going on out there in the marketplace today. We have four projects that remain under construction at the end of 2009. This range from 70% to 98 or so percent complete but with only $140 million yet to fund to complete construction on those assets.But as noted in the last night's release, we have added a property to our development pipeline. We have acquired a leasehold interest in a land partial in New York City. This is at the southwest corner of 10th Avenue and 23rd Street in Chelsea right next to the Highline, which is an incredible, incredible thing for that neighborhood, just a great amenity.This was a distressed situation, in which we acquired this interest from an investor who had completed the foundations out-of-pocket but was unable to get financing to go vertical. So the project that had little activity for nearly a year and a half. And we acquired this interest for about 50% of what the seller had into all of the site and foundation work, as well as the architectural and the engineering design work.And we simultaneously entered into an amended ground lease, which didn't really change the economics any, but it did make the lease more commercially reasonable to us and it was necessarily for us go forward the transaction. So on this site, we'll build 111 apartment units beginning as early as the second quarter of 2010 that will include 9,400 square feet of prime retail at just a tremendous corner in the Chelsea neighborhood.Total cost, about $53 million, 100% of these units will be market rate. We've underwritten a 7%, a mid-7% yield on cost and that's at current rents today. And the deal is subject to a 421-A, 10-year tax abatement which is a favorable tax treatment for that site. This really was a unique situation. I got to tell you that our development team led Megumi Brod really brought to the table, and we just did a phenomenal job of making that happen for us and we're really excited about it. So with that, I will turn the call over to Mark."

This morning, I will focus primarily on our fourth quarter performance and our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2010. Same-store NOI declined 6.3% in the quarter, compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Revenue was consistent with our expectations and expenses were better than our expectations.For the quarter, our same-store total revenues decreased 4.7% over the fourth quarter of 2008 due to a 4.5% decrease in average rental rate and a 20 basis point decline in occupancy to 94%. Same-store expenses were down 1.9% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, driven primarily by decreases in real estate taxes and payroll. Our expense categories are broken out in our detailed disclosure on Page 14 of the press release.As most of you know, real estate taxes and payroll are two of our three biggest expense categories. Together, they constitute approximately half of our combined same-store operating expenses. Real estate taxes were down because lower valuations were realized more quickly than we expected and because of our success with appeals.Payroll is down because of the adjustments to accruals, lower headcount and less overtime. The third biggest expense category is utilities, which is about 15% of our expenses. And those expenses were up only 2.7% quarter-over-quarter, less than we expected due primarily to lower energy costs. The next big category, repairs and maintenance costs were down mainly because turnover was down 1.3% for the quarter. And I know that turnover was down 2.7% for the full year.Regarding FFO, we had a terrific incremental contribution about $6.3 million in the quarter from our lease sub-properties. For the full year lease subs contributed an incremental $23.2 million to our FFO results in 2009. Our FFO was $0.52 per share for the quarter, down from $0.61 per share for the fourth quarter of 2008 after adjusting for a one-time items, including the 2008 land impairment charge, and debt extinguishment gain and the 2009 tender offer charge. This difference was primarily due to a decrease in same-store NOI at about $0.06 per share, and $0.06 per share of dilution from our 2008 and our 2009 net disposition activity, offset by the $0.02 per share of higher lease-up results that I just referred to. 2009 was challenging and we came through it well. So with 2009 behind us, let's take a look at 2010.On Page 25 of the release, you will find the assumptions underlying our annual FFO guidance. We have also listed in the release the primary drivers of the difference between 2009 and 2010. Let me discuss further a few key items.On the revenue side, Fred gave some wonderful color on our numbers and I wanted to add a few points to help put our 2010 guidance in perspective, compared to our 2009 results. During 2009, our same-store quarter-over-quarter revenue numbers became progressively worse as the impact of the roll down and net effective new lease rates went through our rent roll.In 2010, we expect our same-store quarter-over-quarter revenue numbers to grow progressively better with the possibility that same-store revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010, when compared to the first quarter of 2009 maybe minimally positive. This is mostly due to the easier comparable periods we will face in later 2010, as well as the improved occupancy in 2010 that Fred discussed.On the expense side, we set a same-store guidance range of up 1% to up 2%. We expect utility increases of approximately 3% and real estate tax increases of approximately 2%. We believe we can manage payroll expenses effectively and continue to find ways to control other costs while keeping our properties in excellent shape. And I know that same-store expenses were essentially flat in 2009 for the year, down 0.1%, after having growth of only 2.2% in 2008 and 2.1% in 2007, which again makes for a very tough comparison period for 2010, but Fred and David Santee are up to attack.The primary drivers of the difference between the midpoint of our first quarter 2010 FFO guidance of $0.50 per share, and our 2009 fourth quarter actual FFO and I'm excluding the tender offer charge of $0.52 per share are as follows: A negative impact of $0.03 per share from the lower same-store NOI. As I explained earlier, our first quarter 2010 same-store revenue will be down more than the negative 2% annual guidance midpoint, but it will be better than the negative 4.7% quarter-over-quarter number we reported for the fourth quarter of 2009. And I expect a positive impact of approximately $0.01 per share from lower interest expense.Our full year 2010 FFO guidance were $1.95 to $2.15 per share as four main moving pieces when compared to 2009. Lower same-store NOI, dilution from transaction activity, accretion from lease-ups and lower interest expense.On the NOI side, we expect lower same-store NOI of about $0.16 per share. As for transaction dilution, we anticipate transaction dilution of about $0.11 per share, that consists of $0.10 of dilution of our net sales activity in 2009 and a $0.01 of dilution from our 2010 transaction activity.As for lease-ups, we anticipate a positive impact of about $0.09 per share from lease-up activity. And finally, on interest expense, I expect a positive impact of about $0.03 per share from lower interest expense and this comes from the lower debt balances, costs from paying of debt both at maturity and through tenders. But this is somewhat offset by a reduction in capitalized interest due to our much smaller active development pipeline in 2010.Now on the capital expenditures. As described in Footnote 9 on Page 22, in 2010 we expect to spend about $825 per unit without major rehabs and about $1,075 per unit with rehabs. In 2010, we estimate that same-store routine replacements will run about $350 per same-store unit. We expect to spend approximately $29.3 million on major unit rehabs on about 3,900 units, which is about $7,500 per unit. This will equate to approximately $250 per unit on averaged out over the entire same-store sales portfolio. We estimate that we will spend approximately $475 per unit on building improvements in 2010.I also want to highlight the impact on 2010 earnings and FFO of some relatively new accounting guidance that will impact us more in 2010 than it did in 2009. This will requires us to expense survey, title outside legal expenses and other similar costs we incur in acquiring existing operating properties. Prior to 2009, these costs on successful acquisitions would have been capitalized.Our past history is that on average, we spend about 50 basis points or half a percent of a property's purchased price on acquisition costs. Therefore, based on our acquisitions guidance of $1 billion, we have budgeted about $5 million of such costs in 2010 with about $2.5 million or $0.01 per share of these costs being incurred in the first quarter.These expenses run through the other expenses line item on the income statement. We have added the other expenses line to our guidance assumptions on Page 25.A quick note on the funding sources for this year's transaction activity. We began 2010 with approximately $150 million of cash available for investment and approximately $250 million in disposition proceeds in our 1031 escrow account. We have budgeted funding this year's acquisition activity with a combination of this $400 million along with expected proceeds from future property dispositions. We will pay off approximately $250 million of debt this year, all of it is secured debt. After adjustments for net operating cash flow and some minimal development spending, we expect to have a balance on our unsecured line of credit of about $225 million at the end of 2010.Given that our line cost is about 50 basis points above LIBOR or 75 basis point in total right now, a bit of line usage does not bother us at all. In the second half of 2009, the capital markets continued to improve substantially, causing us to be more confident in our ability to refinance our future debt maturities. As a result, the company conducted a debt tender offer in order to put to use cash the company had stockpiled in early 2009 to address 2010 through 2011 debt maturities.As you can see on Page 17, we spent about $366 million, retiring about $344 million in 2011 and 2012 unsecured debt. Consistent with our strategy, these past two years, we view the tender as a prudent cash management step and as a means to whittle away at our 2011 and 2012 debt maturities. We will remain vigilant of our liquidity position and debt maturity schedule. And now, I'll turn the call back over to David."

I will tell you, in 2010 in the acquisitions, we've written revenues down 3% during the year. And then we are forecasting improvements in rents going forward. And on the residuals, I could tell you that our residual prices per square foot are in the range of what we think replacement cost is on those assets today. So we're very comfortable with that. Clearly, there are risks on all these, but I will tell you that the ability to buy assets today at the discounts replacement console we have, particularly this macro portfolio, I would be very surprised if we did not wildly exceed what we think our currently low double-digit IRRs on an unleveraged basis."

In all of the other deals that we've acquired, Michael, there is either been an absolute direct transaction or a process by which there was a very small group of people that had been approached. You are right that there is a lot of money out there, coming back from the National Multi Housing Council meeting in Florida last month, I can tell you that there is a lot of money out there and a lot of people that would like to buy more of multifamily assets for all the reasons that we talked about. Extremely competitive and smaller price point transaction, a very competitive and stabilized assets. And we're fortunate that we bought some things that come to us direct. We bought some things that -- we had some conversations with some people months ago who might have come back to us and said, maybe, ""I'm willing to talk to you today."", and  we were able to do something on a direct basis. The Pentagon Row would be the only deal that I would suggest to you, it has been, was one that was fully brokered and heavily shot. My objective this year is to buy as much as we can outside of a large heavily brokered process. I'm not interested in being the winning bidder out of 100 people chasing some of these stuff. I think that the size of the Macklowe transaction, of their desire for something to be done quickly and confidentially, enables us to get that transaction done. And I'm hopeful that we'll be able to shape some other things for us.

From Broward, from Palm Beach, or in the more suburban areas. So we haven't been directly competing with some of these shadow market inventory there, these condos there. It's a little bit on the fringe, our properties nearby, but it really hasn't been a factor. Anecdotally, I have heard recently that the same people who are losing their single-family homes come to rent with us. We welcome them as long as their income qualified, but I do think it's a massive influx. I think the South Florida has been bouncing on the bottom for a couple of years now, and that we're seeing some good signs of demand.

But as of today, we have record dollar volume appeals in the pipeline.

Historically, I think David mentioned earlier that our results over the fourth quarter were kind of the opposite of what we've experienced over the last say 10 years, where demand drops off in the fourth quarter. I would say that we also took some proactive steps in the fourth quarter, to ensure that our rents did not drift downward. We focused on lease expirations, we moved some lease expirations. And when you have less exposure, you can have the same demand and that puts pressure on the rents to move up. So we're not saying that we expect to see tremendous growth in rents over the next year but we are expecting to see increased slow but steady movement up, as we retain more residents and have lower exposure, which just naturally allows you to grow your rents organically rather than from external demand."

Maybe it's even gone up a little bit the year recently, some say 30%, 35%. And that's what we had seen before was about a third of our residents would use brokers and the good times, we would not have to incur any of those fees because the resident would the pay the fee. And once things got a little challenging here, the owner's in New York quickly switch to what is called o-peer [ph], owner pay. So that was a kind of huge drag to us last year in our performance. Not only the rent declines but then also the expense associated with the brokers. As the occupancy recovered, we started kind of in the early summer of '09. By time we hit like August, we decided to take a bold move and said no more broker fees, knowing that our traffic would go down, but we knew that there was sufficient other non-broker demand to fill our units. So as exposure rundown, occupancy was firming, the first move we made was to eliminate the brokers. Now that's stuck on most of our portfolio. Since then we had to put it back on a couple of properties. One of those we've already now switched again and are not taking brokers. So today, we've got one property close to some significant lease-out activity in Hudson Yards, Midtown West that we're still offering brokers. And then the others are a sprinkling of properties on the penthouse units only. The big-ticket penthouse units sometimes traditionally use brokers. So we're not going to let those to bake until the income adds up. And as of today, we only had two penthouse units currently available. So the trend has been on the brokers."

One year ago we were facing extremely seri",1965,"Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our first quarter call. Well what a difference to year make some and I’ll say the way things are changing today what a difference 90 days mix. One year ago we were facing extremely serious headwinds in our business with domestic and global recession full swing and job losses of 500,000 per month really with no end in sight. And we’re rolling down our rents on average 10% to 11% across our portfolio.
Yeah we ended last year with same-store revenues down only 2.9% and we shared with you in early February our sense that we are at the beginning of a recovery. We said in February that we are experiencing improving occupancy across many markets when seasonally we would have been expecting just the opposite at to be happening. We also have said that our net effects in new lease rates were beginning to term positive in many of our markets and that we are beginning to see more renewals with an upward bias.
During the first quarter, those trends have continued and we think they are even stronger today. Our occupancies continued to improve; it’s up 100 basis points from January 1, to 95.3% today. Our net effective new lease rates continue to increase, up 2.3% from one year ago and 4.6% since the beginning of the year.
So that for the month of April, the difference between move-out rents and net effective new lease rates was on average across the portfolio down only 1%. And this is quickly trending towards flat with some markets today already positive and to put this in perspective, you recall that this delta was negative 10% one year ago.
We continue to renew our residents 23,000 so far this year and those renewals have been up 2% and not a single market across the country is renewing leases today for less than at least a 1% increase. The 13,000 renewals that we’d already done year-to-date, there were new leases a year ago so that a year ago the lease rates were likely down about 10% on average. Those 13,000 renewals have been renewed on an average increase of 3.2%.
We’re clearly beginning to recover some of the reduction of rents that we needed to give the market a year ago. And we’re delighted that sequential revenues were essentially flat in the fourth quarter of ‘09 to first quarter ‘10. This is of course primarily the result in the pick up in occupancy while increasing net effective new lease rates contributed as well.
Clearly, even without job growth fundamentals are improving and our expectation today is for continued in improvement in fundamentals. We originally thought to pay that sequential same-store revenue growth would turn positive in the third quarter of this year and we now expect sequential revenue performance to be positive in the second quarter. Said differently we expect to collect more revenue from same-store properties in April, May and June that we did in January, February and March and it will be a first time since mid 2008 that we've been able to do that. And while we originally expected that the fourth quarter of this year would be the first a quarter-over-quarter revenue growth it's possible, but we could now see that occurs earliest in the third quarter. And as a result we think the better end our same-store revenue guidance for the full year is no longer simply possible, but it is now probable. Also what’s happening? Why are we seeing this improvement of fundaments without any reported net new job growth when history would suggest that really have to be happening for any of this take place? 
While prior downturns watching the pain and flicked it on our space was due to oversupply and as a result when the economic picture began to improve multifamily property said 3, 5, 7 points of vacancy if not more that needed to be reestablished in order to start to see an increase in rental rates. What we’re seeing take place today is very much what we thought could happen given a significant reduction and new supply over the last several years. As well as the powerful impact to be applicable in generation 85 million people strong but just having a profound impact on rental housing and we think will for many years to come.
So last year we were able to maintain occupancy despite the massive job was, we have to reduce rents of course but occupancy was maintained. And now with the economic picture improving, the 90% of the workforce that has remained employed that during the downturn is no longer concerned about losing their job, which is enabling us to increase rents nearly across the board, it was still a long way from recovering all the reduction of rents that occurred doing a downturn and it will take a while to get it all back. But we are encouraged by what we are seeing without any real job gains and I am optimistic about the impact on fundamental to job growth we’ll have when it actually does return.
One the transaction side of our business, we were relatively inactive for quite some time. But a window of opportunity opened in a late in the fourth quarter of last year and since then we are delighted to have acquired nearly a $1 billion of assets,
Six of those were acquired in the first quarter of this year for $639 million and all of those that I have been discussed on our prior calls or otherwise publicly disclosed. Those include the three macro assets, I’ll highlight that in the Arlington Virginia that was build in 2008; a mid-rise property near the beach in Demark, California and a mid-rise property in Seattle.
All of these deals we feel primarily extreme well located with the high quality assets and we were able to acquire them at very attractive prices at discounts to replacement cost and what we think were double digit IRRs. We also recently announced the acquisition of another great opportunity for us in Washington D.C. is of 425 Mass Avenue property.
This is the property which conceived and completed in 2009 as-for-sale condominiums. And we acquire the property totally vacant and have a major lease up on their way. We acquired that asset for slightly less than $300,000 at door which represented about 80% of what we think of replacement cost side and about 70% of what it actually cost to build. 
So we projected an 8% but not more stabilized the return on net asset three years [out]. I’m happy to say it in the first two weeks of leasing we’ve done very well and I want to remind you that this leasing began from a dead-standing start because we bought this asset but we didn’t develop this; we didn’t have months to prepare for this leasing activity. But in the first two weeks of leases we’ve written 31 leases and also been done at rate right on top of our $3 per square foot pro forma and while we assume that average of slightly more than one month concession on each week during this lease up concessions has been for no more than one month end up third of the leases. Third of the leases have been written with no concession what so ever. So I am very happy with the progress of [Bobbi Pollard] team that have managed to-date. So we continue to be thrilled about this asset.
All that said I wish I could tell you we had a pipeline flow of similar acquisition opportunities but we don’t and this is not the lack of trying. But as you know there is lot, a lot of products being offered today. But certainly as more than a year ago, but volume is still way down from normal levels and there was a place of capital, plenty of capital chasing these deals. So, properties have really come in, in fact we think that come at 25 or 50 basis points more adjust in the last few months alone.
And values have increased significantly, and we are not expecting to be able to replicate the extraordinary success we’ve had with our last way of acquisitions. So, while we’ve increased our acquisition guidance for the year, this is due more to what we’ve already done rather than what we are currently working on or see ahead of us at the present time.
Meanwhile, like the fourth quarter of ‘09, a disposition activity was below our average run rate for the last several years. This was due to the fact the pressure on liquidity, we had ease to great deal and we thought that values would likely improve so we decided to wait and see how things evolve. 
In the quarter we didn’t sell eight consolidated assets. We were in continuation of our non-core market exits with five deals in North Carolina and one deal in Dallas. It also did include a two phase asset in San Diego, which was a 30 year old product but we saw that big capital meets in the near future and was in imperial location.
We’ve also increased our disposition position guidance for the year and this is a result of our renewed willingness to transact, since value has increased. But March will depend on what acquisition opportunities we see. And as like disposition activity fixed up it will likely be towards the latter part of the year. And many of that will likely be back into a training mode in which we will transact if we find acquisitions that make sense relative to the pricing we can get on our disposition assets.
On the development side we’ll continue great progress there, the deal that being completed on time and under budget, leasing continues to exceed our forecast on our absorption rates and like our stabilized assets we are seeing a lift in net effective rates there. Only three projects currently remain under construction, they range from 67% to 90% complete. And only a $106 million remains to be funded to complete construction on those deals. 
And it’s been a couple of years since our last development starts, and that was our Red 160 property in Redmond, Washington which we started in June of 2008. Now we do expect to soon start on our $53 million development deal in Manhattan Chelsea neighborhood. We also have recently acquired a land part so in Arlington, Virginia, this is the site for 188 units, and this is adjacent to our Sheffield court property there in Arlington.
Total project cost about $67 million and adjustment per value for the ground floor retail that’s about $297,000 a unit, $312 per square foot. We’ve been looking at this site since 2005 and we acquired it from a pension fund at about 60% of their cost. That seller was successful in getting the property rezoned and fully entitled. We expect to receive all final approval, that’s early is late this year and construction should start in the first quarter of 2011.
We anticipated plus 7% return on the current rent on that development in Arlington, Virginia. Now development very much remains a core competency of EQR, and just as we did during the last couple of years we are going to continue to underwrite development opportunities, that will start with own land inventory and we will compare those opportunities to acquisition opportunities as well as deals in IRRs and disposition candidates in order to allocate capital in the highest risk adjusted way possible for credit long-term value for our shareholders.
Now I will turn the call over to Mark to go through the quarter and our guidance.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. This morning, I will focus primarily on our first quarter performance and our guidance for the second quarter and the full year 2010. Revenues were better than our expect",1796,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. This morning, I will focus primarily on our first quarter performance and our guidance for the second quarter and the full year 2010. Revenues were better than our expectations. For the quarter our total same-store revenues decreased to 2.9% when compared to the first quarter of 2009, which was a better performance when we expected really for four reasons.
Firstly, at 100 basis point increase in occupancy to 94.7, we had budgeted occupancy to go up but it happened faster than we though and as David said this trend continues as we are 95.3% occupied today.
Second factor would be 170 basis point decreased in resident turnover for the quarter. Over the past few years we have seen a steady improvement and lessened our retention as our customer royalty programs took hold and as people across the country chose to hunker down and weather the recession in our apartment.
We were not expecting to be able to drive turnover down further and our guidance indeed anticipated that turnover would be flat compared to 2009. So this continued improvement is the good sign, our residents are very satisfied in their homes with us and happy to stay longer.
Third factor as David noted when new leases were executed at better than expected increases across all of our markets. And finally on average across our portfolio the difference are spread between the rent we were receiving from move-out and the lower rent we will receive from new leases on a net effective basis was slower than we expected. In some markets like DC Metro, South Florida, San Diego and Denver the spread was already positive in the first quarter, meaning, that new leases in those markets are being written at higher rents on average than the average rent on move-outs.
In most of our markets this spread was still negative in the first quarter. While net effective new lease transaction is still lower on average than rents on move-out. But as David said that gap is closing more quickly then we had expected. In several of our other markets like Boston and Inland Empire spreads turned positive or likely to turn positive in the second quarter. We find all of this very encouraging, assuming current rent hold which is something that we are only be able to validate once the primary leasing season concludes. We see our year-over-year at same-store revenue number very much at the better end of our guidance.
On the expense side same-store expenses increased 1.5% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. In this quarter lower real estate taxes in payroll expenses where more than offset by an expected storm cost. Without the storm cost our quarter-over-quarter same-store expense number would have been flat and same-store NOI would decline about 4.8%.
However for the year we remain comfortable with our plus 1% to plus 2% range for 2010 expense growth and here is lot. On the real estate tax side which constitute about a quarter of our property operating expenses, these did increase slightly but this increase was lower than our expectation. Because of this early point in the year and it is early yet.
Government revaluations were lower than we had anticipated and because we continue that’s a good success in the appeals process. I do know that most of more material property tax jurisdictions do not announce property tax rate until the second half of the year. So further movement either way in this number is possible, on-sight payrolls the next item and it’s about quarter of our operating expenses as well.
This item was down 2.1% due to reduced headcount resulting from our continued efforts to create efficiencies in our platform. We expect growth in this category to remain sub due this year. Our third biggest expense categories utilities which is about 15% of our operating expenses and those expenses were up only 2.1% quarter-over-quarter. We’d budgeted 3% increase for the entire year. We saw lower gas and electricity costs but saw increases in water and sewer as municipalities look to close budget gaps which rate increases by municipal utilities. So again the municipalities are increasing municipal utility rates.
Our fourth item is repair and maintenance. The main pressure from our expense number came from this line item. Specifically, from costs for snow removal from the extraordinarily severe storm that hit East Coast this winter, as well as costs from the damage caused by rain storms in California and Arizona. The majority of these costs are included in the repairs and maintenance expense category, which were 6.7% quarter-over-quarter. Without these unusual costs, this category would have increased about 1.5% quarter-over-quarter.
Please note that we believe all of our material storm related costs were paid or accrued for in the first quarter. And we do not anticipate an expense in tax and as long as in the second quarter. On the collection side, the field and property operation teams have done a fantastic job managing credit risk to this recession. We saw delinquencies decrease in the quarter to 2.7% down from 3.2% a year ago and well inside the normal historical range.
Also delinquency declined in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 by 20 basis points. The usual seasonal pattern here is that after Christmas going into the New Year delinquency has actually increased, so this is a very good start. Bad debt was 0.9% in the first quarter down from 1.1% a year ago and also well within historical ranges.
As you saw in our release, we reported FFO of $0.49 per share for the first quarter of 2010, we are slightly higher than expected same-store NOI and a terrific incremental contribution about 7.2 million in the quarter from our leased up properties and we have reported $0.51 per share not for the cause from the storms I mentioned as well as some accelerated property acquisition costs.
Last quarter I informed you of the new accounting rule which requires us to expand survey titles outside legal expenses, and other similar cost we incur in acquiring the existing operating properties. Prior to 2009 these costs on successful acquisitions would have been capitalized. These expenses now run through the other expenses line items on the income statement and are included in our guidance assumptions on page 23.
Based on our old acquisitions guidance of $1 billion we budgeted about $5 million to such cost in 2010 was about $2.5 million or 1 penny per share of these costs being incurred in the first quarter. Because we closed on the long acre acquisition in the first quarter, one quarter earlier than we expected and because in the first quarter we incurred substantially all of the acquisition cost for the 425 Mass Avenue deal we had more of these costs earlier than we expected.
Besides the shifting of transaction costs forward one quarter we have also increased the midpoint of our other expense guidance for $1 million. Consistent with our increase in acquisitions guidance from $1 billion to $1.25 billion, of course our second quarter number will benefit from the shifting forward as well as from the fact as David mentioned that are relatively small acquisition pipeline means that we don't expect to incur much in transaction cost in the second quarter.
On to guidance, on page 23 of the release we gave guidance for the second quarter of 2010 FFO between $0.53 and $0.57 per share. The primary drivers will difference between our first quarter 2010 actual FFO of $0.49 per share and the mid point our second quarter 2010 FFO guidance of $0.55 per share are as follows: we got about $0.03 per share than increase from same-store NOI approximately $0.02 per share increase from 2010 acquisition and the lease-up activity and about 1 penny per share increased in the timing of the property acquisition cost that I’ve just discussed.
We have left our annual FFO range in past for now and revisit it as we customarily do in July when we report on our second quarter results. I do note that if we are able to maintain our operating momentum during the leasing season we would expect to be in the upper end of our annual FFO guidance range.
We have revised our acquisition guidance for the year. We now expect acquire about $1.25 billion operating properties up from $1 billion. As of today we have required $806 million of operating properties. We have also increased our disposition guidance from $600 million to $850 million. We are marinating our guidance of 1.5 % spread between disposition and acquisition cap rate because we expect as David mentioned that the cap rate spread between our acquisitions and dispositions will be narrower going forward then the 1.9 % year-to-date thread.
Now a quick note on funding and expected sources and uses in 2010. On the sources side we have budgeted approximately $1.25 billion of 2010 sources consisting at $850 million in expected disposition proceeds and $400 million in 10.31 proceeds and cash on hand that we had at the beginning of 2010. 
We had not budgeted any additional issuance of stock under the ATM program and have in fact now issued any stock under that program since January 14, 2010. It is not our intention to increase our permanent leverage levels to fund, incremental investment activity. 
So you will see temporary swings in our outstanding line of credit balance due to transaction timing issue. Not withstanding recent problems in the overseas debt market it is fair to say that the capital market at least for large well capitalized real estate companies like Equity Residential at fully recovered from the credit crisis. I expect that the company could issue 10 year unsecured debt at rate of about 5.4% as we have not issued unsecured debt since May, 2007 and have repurchased a substantial amount of our unsecured debt directly or through tenders there is a scarcity value in our paper that would make any issuance particularly well received. 
The bank market is also recovering strongly as banks try to put more money to work for desirable low risk clients like equity residential. Finally funding from the GSCs also available to us at slightly better than unsecured rates. 
Our company is fortunate to have minimal debt maturities in 2010 and to have hedged the portion of our interest rate exposure. With our expectation that the line of credit balance at December 31, 2010 assuming no debt activities this year, will be only about $250 million. We are going to be opportunistic in expecting the debt markets to refinance our maturing debt.
Now, I’ll turn the call back over to David.

Before we open the call to questions I want to provide a little perspective release our perspective on the impact in the single family housing market on our business. And I am going to start by telling you that only 65 more of our residents told us that they moved out to buy a home in the first quarter of 2010 versus the first quarter of ’09. 
Only 65 more move outs to buy a home and I was on a base of 12,000 move outs. Now that activity to purchase homes concentrated only a few of our markets Phoenix, Inland Empire, Orlando, Denver and Northern Virginia. But it appears that much of our reconfigured portfolio seems unaffected.
With the strong increase in occupancy we’ve realized during the quarter it seems us to indicate that increased new home sales even though, that’s juiced by the expiring government subsidies has not hurt our operating results and at least not in the near term. The other question is, as economic conditions improved will the single family housing market have a material negative impact on our results. And I will start with an increasingly we believe the answer is no. 
We certainly acknowledged that there is certainly some pent up demand for single family homes within our resident population but it seems that this demand is greatly reduced; it seems to us that the physiology of potential home buying appears to be changing. There is a much greater understanding and focus now, on the many down sides of homeownership, especially the heavy acre homeownership can have on a generation of young adults that understand that they may work for many different employers and possibly in many different cities over their working lots. This is yet a another reason we feel so very optimistic about the fundamentals of our business going forward. 
And with that operator will be happy to open the call for questions.

We did as I said in the fourth quarter saw some opportunities come at a time when we became far more confident in the capital market and our ability to fund ourselves going forward.

And I think the macro acquisitions, the deals we have done in Washington DC have just absolutely been a tremendous deal and you think about what’s happened to care free compressions since those deals have been acquired as well as what’s happening in the top lines since those deals have been acquired. 
We’ve done exceptionally well on them. I wish we had a pipeline of similar opportunities, Michelle but with few deals that are out there and the amount of capital that’s there those key deals that are being offered are being priced very competitively. In fact we are looking at a deal now and I won’t say the market, but we think it's probably being offered close to replacement cost today.
Now recently built deal stabilized but we can sort of buy out of development cost without any of the construction risk. But our focus continues to be on Boston, New York, Washington, Southern California, Seattle San Francisco markets that’s where our key focus has been, but again as I said which we could I can tell you we have lot more opportunities there, but we have not for lack of trying our guys are out there talking to everybody underwriting a lot of stuff, but there are few deals and lot of people looking to buy them and we’re not terribly interested in being the winning bidder of our deal that's been competed on by 100 other people.

We’ve got the terrific team across the country and if it makes more sense on a risk-adjusted basis to pursue development we won't be afraid to do that, I think that we’ve demonstrated with the properties that we’ve delivered recently and know that we will soon deliver then it’s a core competency and we have the ability to deliver terrific assets and assets today but I’ll tell you that a year ago we probably deliver at a value that was less than cost, but today giving were yields are and leasing and we are probably going to deliver these today at cost which is a terrific turnaround for that portfolio.

So some of that risk is 2011 rate, some is 12, some is 13 so not all of that applies to be a debt that we need to refinance. Some of our debt next year must be secured debt because of the restructuring which it is, so 300 of that have to be secured debt so that won’t be financed unsecured. As a final sort of factor, if we refinance the debt now and carry it, so it just sits on our balance sheet as cash for certainly a great amount of dilution and we sort of calculate that to mean that we would be paying 30 to 40 basis points more for the money. So effectively right now EQR can borrow as 540 have that cash and sit there to the middle of 2011 and the real cost to us is about 517.

Final point just on the $0.02 QC that guided you two in terms of increase in NOI in the second quarter for lease up in acquisition. The acquisition number just to be clear, that’s our $607 million of acquisition that incurred in the first quarter, the 425 Mass Avenue deal, which really there is not producing the increment fact is dilutive in the second quarter offset by all that disposition income already.

So, we are getting good lift from the renewal base. Traffic overall has increased over last year. So, the demand is there but we are actually leasing fewer apartments, there are occupancy gain that is really a function of increased retention a lower turnover primarily. That gives us the opportunity then to start pushing the new lease rate. So, I noticed that the new lease rates as David mentioned are up year-over-year because the line early March and they are up significantly year-to-date from January to now and that trend is actually accelerating as we speak. So as the combination of the rotation of the rent roll, people are staying put at a higher proportion, they are paying higher rents and those coming in are paying closer to the rent of those closer to move-out. Put all that together and is building a good firm, steady consistent growth in our rent rolls.

We’re happy to see South Florida is quickly coming back. It’s one of our leading recovery markets right now, occupancy firmed up and now we are seeing some good strong rate growth in South Florida. Rates are up, net effective new lease rates are up 6% little bit more than 6% year-over-year from this time last year and since the begin of the year up almost 5%.
So we’re seeing a good stable occupancy and good rapid current lease rates and renewal rates in South Florida. I think as the single family is clearing right there, job losses have stabilized, they have got some infrastructure projects going on, might give us a little bit job growth, long term and still worry about South Florida because population and helpful formation data is still slightly negative. Going up to state Northern Florida is little bit behind that Orlando is having little more problem in getting risked off in Orlando. Its starting but its starting very recently, we had okay occupancy but rate is tougher in Orlando to push the rate. There they have a significant single family over-hang a very cheap single family, lot of people are still buying homes, lot of investors are buying homes and putting them in the rental market. So Orlando is going to take a little bit longer conclude the single family issue but I’m optimistic on Orlando because their economy is really well positioned. In fact well diversified, it’s not just tourism anymore; UCF is now the third largest university in the country. They've got Lockheed getting a lot of good contracts. They’ve got a biomedical facility and use medical school. Tourism has stabled. Disney has now stabilized in terms of deployment and growing hours. So that’s the good thing from a horizon for Orlando.

I would say that our targets, we wont necessarily focus on occupancy obviously it’s important, but kind of daily number is our level of exposure. And that’s what gives us the confidence to determine what levels that were due increases or aggressiveness that we do. 
And exposure is really just you know left to lease how many un-rented apartments we have. So while we are at 95 free today, we would be comfortable running in the high 94 as long as we are seeing aggressive rate growth. And I believe that’s what we’re seeing today. So everyday I am upstairs with the pricing team push it, push it, push it. And we just don’t want to get a little optimizes rate and occupancy together. So we’re not focused on occupancy.

Your portfolio was right there with the national level, whereas today at least according to one third party provider, the national level is 92% and you're obviously well above that.

Places like Atlanta had 12,000, 14,000 units coming out of the recession that was pretty consistent in many of the markets. Additionally, you had the beginnings of the housing bubble, people started to buy single family homes, so we have those two headwinds at that time. 
Today is different, our turn over is significantly lower today. Our net turnover when you exclude your transfers with the same properties on an annualized run rate at 42% I mean that is phenomenal. And as Mark said, earlier there is just no supply, so I think the dynamics are completely different, I think the prospects just a little bit of job growth and I think everyone will benefit from increased occupancy.

But right",292,"Phoenix, Atlanta, Orlando pretty much similar dynamics, Phoenix actually its been dragging along the bottom for quite some time here, significant job losses and lot’s of supply coming in time, right at the same time, it really got hammered. 
But right now today, Phoenix we are sitting at 95% occupied and it’s up almost 200 basis points from this time last year. So we had a decent winter season in Phoenix and were headed into this typically slower summer season at a very high occupancy pretty low left to lease and we are actually getting little funds in rent growth in Phoenix. 
I think Phoenix after a long time came in the ditch we are seeing we could have some good things to report in the balance of the year in Phoenix. Now given its still has a way to go on job growth and a single family is really still pretty much on that. 
Atlanta throughout this thing I think we have significantly out performed the market in occupancy and in rent growth if you look back, Atlanta we are sitting at 95 rate right now. Exposure little bit higher at 9%, we had some good occupancy firming up so we pushed rates in the Atlanta, we actually got a little bit lift during the middle of first quarter, but then it kind of flattened out and we have to take it a little bit back down. 
So Atlanta is getting better, but it’s not on a sustainable trajectory right now. So it may actually take a little bit longer. Again these are the supply stock market, not the supply constraint markets. The supply constraint markets we’re seeing the good fundamental up lift than accelerated momentum from where we sit today.

Seattle is we got to explain what’s on in Seattle and its all good. First of all our numbers are down 701 for the quarter in revenue lets pass that a little bit if you take, we own significant portfolio in Tacoma, Washington its far south it’s a military town we own 2000 of our 8400 units are in Tacoma and we include the Tacoma results in with our Seattle reports. 
Tacoma has gone through a major down turn right now lot of the military rotated out of Port Louis's and McCord. Last summer we lost may be some reports 15, 20,000 soldiers rotated out and none came in, we had some very large asset there on the market rate side that we’re in the 70 in occupancy but Tacoma revenue is down almost 15% for the quarter included in our 7 if you take that out and just look a the core Seattle was a CVB Eastside to gnomish in the north and few in the south our results were negative 5.5% for the quarter. 
It’s a little different story there. Central business district is on fire right now I mean downtown Seattle where we own 2186 units has shown just a dramatic unbelievable recovery. Our rents are up 20% since the beginning of the year renewals are up 5% occupancy is very high demand is really the price of how strong it is and then given that we got couple of things coming that is going to make situation even better for us there is a property that was only 9 years old downtown that has to be demolished 272 units very nice luxury asset coming out of the market and in the Russell relocation from Tacoma to downtown Seattle and the old WaMu building its just getting started this summer. 
We see nothing is going to hold us back in the CBD of Seattle which will be fantastic. Eastside is doing but a little more actually a lot more supply pressure in Bellevue and Redmond that ones holding back a little bit but still we are seeing on the e side some good occupancy and rents are just after being flat for two quarters are just beginning to move up

That was up 9% but I think as you said a lot of these folks were shopping, I don’t think we stole from future quarters because our net applications were down 7% and that kind of plays through the movement number 2 or the number of movements that we had for Q1 of 2010 were really identical. 
The movements that we had for Q1, 2009 so what’s driving the occupancy as Fred said earlier is really the state say, okay initiative keeping those residents living with us so I think people are just preparing for the spring leasing season and recalibrating, what they have to pay.

We are selling lot of studios right now New York by like David Santee had mentioned that’s an indication that people feel confident, that’s they are willing to take on a living space by there own, on their own and may be they are just getting sick and tried of those roommates after six months and those people living at home with their parents and probably the parents are sick and tired of them what help they are living at home so I think people get a little more confidence in the economy those who have jobs feel more secure perhaps without jobs are optimistic and now we are seeing a little more rotation and movement within our sector.

So again it depends on each individual situation and frankly also depends on whether or not they really truly are acquisition opportunities. Sometimes, we gone forward with development deals when there have been actually no acquisition opportunities available in those market place, so there really was nothing to compare that development yield to that particular time. 
But clearly you need to make sure that you’re getting some premium when your building a stream of income as opposed to be able to buy an existing stabilized stream of income. Whether or not that’s 100 or 105 or 150 and I’m not so sure they will be dictated by each individual situation.

So it is a real season to season, quarter-over-quarter improvement in retention. And what causes it? We are working on retention on a number of fronts, so we can only say one specific thing improves, but if put all that together, we’re seeing the behavior of the consumers.
We’ve put a lot of emphasis on our customer service, customer loyalty over the last two years. We have programs to improve our customer loyalty, we have ways to measuring it in real time from our customer surveys and we have a lot of recognition programs if you are a company based on that. We’ve seen significant steady climbs in our customer loyalty scores, in fact March we had seen all time high. And we open up to our research that those they say that they are very loyal to us, they refer people, they pay higher rents on the margins and they stay with us significantly longer. So we know that that’s a contributing factor. But I think also is as to what’s going on with the economy right now, I think people ate staying put, they are not moving and we’re seeing our renewal retention rates go up and with that we’re able to increase our renewal increase rates on our rents.

Thanks for joining us on our call. It was really great to see so many of you here in Chicago last month at the NAREIT conferences, and it really gave us a great chance to introduce so many of you to our senior management team, and it was also a great opportunity to discuss with you all the dramatic improvement in fundamentals we’ve been seeing since January in our business.
During those meetings, we told you that our indicators suggest that we would continue to see steady occupancy and increasing rents during the summer months, and we’re delighted to say that that did in fact happen, and that the recovery in apartment fundamentals has continued right through our primary leasing season.
Occupancy has held in the 95% range, and as we said on our first quarter call and during NARIET, the second quarter of this year would show the first sequential increase in same store revenue, and it did coming in up 1.3%. We also said that the third quarter of this year would produce the first quarter-over-quarter increase in same store revenues in several years, and it will, with July having already delivered the first month-over-month increase up 0.4%.
We also said that the high end of our guidance given in February was no longer possible, but was probable. And of course, you’ve noticed that we have increased our guidance, and we’ve also increased same store revenue guidance now from down only 0.5% to flat.
Now when you’re down 2.1% in same store revenue as we were in the first six months, that means the back half of the year will have to be pretty strong, and it should be based upon what we did in July, and how August is setting up, as well as the current indicators that we have for September.
Earlier this year, Fred Tuomi talked about the key metrics that would determine revenue performance this year, and I’d like to him to give you a little mid-year update on those metrics. Fred?

As David mentioned I’m going to provide a little more detail, a little more color on how 2010 is progressing and how our visibility into the key drivers of our revenue is shaping our guidance for the balance of this year, and as w",894,"Sure thing. Thank you. As David mentioned I’m going to provide a little more detail, a little more color on how 2010 is progressing and how our visibility into the key drivers of our revenue is shaping our guidance for the balance of this year, and as we have discussed before, these key drivers are resident turnover, physical occupancy our base rent pricing and by that I mean, net effective new lease prices and then of course, renewal prices.
So I would like to give you an update on each of those key drivers, starting with resident turnover.
Looking back into 2009, our fundamentals began to stabilize and we noticed along with this a shift in resident behavior. People began to stay put, they just weren’t moving. Our turnover levels continued to fall as more residents elected to continue to renew their leases versus moving out. I’m happy to say that this trend has continued and is continuing.
Through the end of the second quarter, our annualized turnover is 52.1%. This is 520 basis points below last year at this time and 700 basis points below the same quarter, meaning quarter two for 2008, dramatic shift in turnover.
We all know slower turnover is a good thing but not only does it reduce our expenses, but it also provides a base for occupancy gains, and this in turn allows us to gain pricing power over new leases as well as renewal leases.
However, looking into Q3, we do see a small increase in turnover in some markets, which used to be expected given the seasonal transaction volume we are faced with and the fact we are pushing rents very aggressively.
Next is physical occupancy. The occupancy gains we noted starting back in 2009 and continuing into early Q1 of this year, have held through Q2, as David mentioned.
So growing occupancy coupled with lower turnover and improving demand, we’ve now recovered our occupancy to normal and sustainable levels in virtually every market. The northeast markets, in particular, continue to see very strong demand and therefore have very tight occupancies.
Overall, this morning our portfolio is 95.1% occupied, and with normal or even slightly favorable exposure levels, we’re 7.7% left to lease this morning. We feel very good about where we are in this leasing season.
Next, let’s talk about pricing, the base rent pricing. As also noted in Q1, we told you we saw early signs of improving fundamentals that allowed us to gain pricing power. We achieved very strong rent growth in base rents from January through June of this year and fortunately just in time for setting up in the peak leasing season.
Now through July, base rents have improved up 8.5% year-to-date, meaning from January 1 and stand 5.8% year-over-year compared to the same period last July. At this point, markets like New York, DC, South Florida, and Denver are powering right through the leasing season with continued strong growth in base rents. Other markets, which basically is Southern California, have moderated somewhat on the growth of the base rents in the face of the summer transaction volume.
Now, we know the degree of these future base rent growth will be determined on an individual market demand patterns, which we know is eventually determined by job growth, but again is by market-by-market basis, not to the national headline number.
So finally, renewal pricing. Throughout this entire recession, our renewal process and our renewal pricing strategy have been the stabilizing factors to our revenue stream. Throughout last year, we’ve reported renewals achieved at roughly flat to down 1%, which was a great result at the time.
Then at the turn of this year, the firming occupancy led to strong base rent growth as I just described and these higher base rents in turn, give us the confidence and the ability to push renewal rates with little impact to turnover so far.
So, July renewals we just completed and we’re up 4.9% over the entire portfolio, and for August, we’re quoting right now 6.2% renewal increases and we’ll most likely achieve around a 5.2% or maybe better.
On the renewal rates, Denver has led the way. We had renewal gains of up 6.7% in July. Those were booked to achieve real signed deals in Denver up 6.7%.
Out of all of our core markets Los Angles had the smallest increase and it was only up 3.5%. So, we’re getting very good results on the renewals.
So, we put all that in the blender and how does that impact our guidance. So, these are the factors we use to evaluate our business literally on a daily basis. So, at this point in the year, we now know the outcome of the critical leasing season and we have extended visibility into the balance of this year.
So, based on what we see, we expect first continued lower annual turnover rates. We may give up some as we push rents, but we will still have very good results in terms of our turnover.
We expect to sustain this occupancy level near 95% and we expect to maintain the current base rent pricing trends we had in place in our markets. Couple this with continued strong renewal pricing through the rest of this year, we believe our revenue will be flat to down 1%.
Thank you, David.

We think that our employed residence and our employed prospects are no longer concerned about losing their jobs. Households are unbundling. As noted in Barron’s last weekend, people are not buying homes at anywhere near the rate that they had and that’s for both economic and lifestyle reasons.
So, the homeownership rate continues to decline, and that decline is due to that segment of the population that represents our tenancy not buying homes. Fred indicated the sharp increase in retention we’re experiencing as a result of this, and this has enabled us to aggressively begin to recover the discounts on rents that we gave residents over the last several years. Clearly though, we need job growth to continue this trend.
There is little doubt that with the supply picture what it is and the occupancy levels we currently have that we will continue to raise rents as we go forward. Both our job growth and rising incomes, the rate of growth we are currently experiencing is not sustainable. It will be positive for sure, but it will to moderate from current levels.
So we’re extremely optimistic about the fundamentals of the multi-family space particularly as the economy recovers and begins to add jobs, and we believe that the steps we’ve taken over the last few years to concentrate capital in better quality assets, in higher barrier and higher growth markets have positioned us to success, going forward.
So turning now to the transaction activity; as noted in last night’s release, we acquired two assets in the quarter. One, we discussed previously which is our 425 Mass Ave. deal in Washington D.C. which I’ll mention in just a minute.
The other, City Pointe which is pictured on the cover of our earnings release, its 183 unit Class A property in downtown Fullerton, California, constructed in 2004, acquired at a cap rate of 5.7%, and an underwritten IRR of about 10%. And quickly back to the 425 Mass Avenue deal.
We’ve added this property to the development and lease-up schedule on page 21 of the supplemental because as you recall, when we acquire this deal earlier this year, it was totally vacant, and I’m happy to say that we are well ahead of our underwriting expectations on this deal.
As noted at the end of June, we were 30% leased. Today, we are 38% leased. Absorption is averaging 56 units per month versus pro forma of 31 units per month. Our average lease rate is right on top of our pro forma at $3.17 per foot, and concessions are averaging about three weeks versus our pro forma of slightly more than four weeks.
As a result of all this we’re currently where we had projected to be on December 1. Instead another way in month four we’re achieving month eight results. So we’re obviously extremely pleased with how team is performing at 425 Mass.
After the close of the second quarter, we also acquired a Class A property in the Wilshire Center submarket of Los Angeles called the Versailles, which is also shown on the cover page of last night’s earnings release. This was a 2008 construction, 225 units, which we acquired for $55 million, a cap rate of about 5.4%, and a 10 year underwritten IRR of about 9.4%. That brings our year-to-date acquisition volume to over $900 million.
In the second quarter, we sold only one property and that was an unconsolidated asset in which we had a 25% interest, so there was obviously very little disposition activity. Now you might remember that we discussed on our call last quarter that we had slowed our disposition activity, because we didn’t have much of an acquisition pipeline into which we could reinvest disposition proceeds.
Well, we have seen an increase in potential acquisition activity. We currently have $200 million of deals under contract, and have deals under letter of intent of another $200 million. These are all traffic core assets in core markets in DC, in Southern Cal., in Northern California, and in Seattle. As a result, we’ve also increased our disposition activity, and now have several hundred million dollars of assets under contract to sell or in the early stages of marketing.
We also have several hundred million dollars more identified and ready for marketing. And I would tell you that with the amount of capital out there chasing deals today, we think that our target disposition assets have great liquidity. It’s just up to us to find the right reinvestment opportunities and determine whether or not we’re willing to make the trade.
So, as a result, we’ve maintained our acquisition/disposition guidance for the year. Now obviously, to achieve that disposition guidance we will need to close a lot of deals between now and the year end, because I said the pipeline is full with pending sales. I think we can restart that very quickly and as a result of which the disposition activity will primarily be a fourth quarter process.
On development, we continue to have great progress with our development assets, they are being completed on time and under budget, and leasing continues to exceed our forecasts with respect to absorption, and like our stabilized assets, we’re happy to be seeing a lift at our net effective rates on those deals.
In the second quarter, we started construction on two projects, both wholly-owned. The first is 111 unit $56 million development in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood, which we’ve talked about this on prior calls, and the other is the third and final phase of property in Denver, Colorado. This is 168 units for $24 million and we expect to stabilize yield on current rents there of about 7.5%.
Now we continue to be very active underwriting new development opportunities, certainly, looking at our own land inventory first, but we’re looking at other sites as well, and we could see an increase in this segment of our business in the months ahead. But like everything we do it’s extremely capital intensive.
We have to compare returns on capital invested in new developments to the yields and IRRs and acquisition opportunities in order to allocate capital in the highest risk-adjusted means possible.
Now before I turn the call over to Mark, I’d like to comment briefly on the sudden collapse two weeks ago of the parking garage at our Prospect Towers property in Hackensack, New Jersey, in which fortunately no one was injured.
At the present time, we have 157 units of the property that are unavailable for occupancy and will likely remain so for several months, while services are restored to the building. In the mean time, we’re working with those residents to find them temporary or permanent housing in other properties in the area, be they ours or be they our competitors.
Now we’ve outlined in our press release what we think the financial impact of this incident will be including rebuilding the garage, providing other housing arrangements for residents, loss rent et cetera, et cetera, and Mark in just a moment take you through a high level review of how all this will be handled from an accounting prospect.
I would just like to say in closing, how thankful we are that no one was hurt in the collapse, how grateful we are for the assistance we’ve received from everyone, representing the city of Hackensack, how much we appreciate the understanding and the cooperation we’ve received from our residents that have been affected, and lastly, how proud we are, how proud we are of the dedication shown by the entire EQR team that’s working 24/7 and I do mean 24/7 on all aspects of this and you guys are all absolutely the best. Mark?

This morning I am going to focus primarily on three areas, our strong second quarter performance especially on the expense side, our revised guidance for 2010, and our re",1467,"Thank you, David. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today’s call. This morning I am going to focus primarily on three areas, our strong second quarter performance especially on the expense side, our revised guidance for 2010, and our recent unsecured bond deal. Fred previously gave some terrific color on the drivers of our revenue out-performance, so I’ll just move right along to expenses.
Same store expenses increased 1.5% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We think this is an impressive performance, especially given that in the comparable period last year expenses actually decreased 0.6%.
I will give you a little color on notable aspects of this quarter’s expense performance as well as some perspective on how we expect our various expense line items to perform for the balance of the year.
I am going to start by talking about on-site payroll and property management cost together. They collectively constitute about one-third of our property operating expenses. Both onsite payroll and property management line items consist mostly of direct and indirect personnel costs. Also both line items were higher on a quarter-over-quarter basis for the same two reasons, tough comparable periods and increases in accrual rates for health insurance and workers’ comp insurance.
By tough comparable periods I mean that both of these line items declined in 2009 when compared to 2008 making further improvements in 2010 difficult. In spite of that, the salary component of on-site payroll was actually down on a quarter-over-quarter basis and the salary component of property management costs were flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
Our position management and our other technology initiatives continue to bear fruit for us and we expect overall growth in on-site payroll to be within our expectations. Property management cost will be up about 8% this year, but that brings our two year average growth rate in this line item up to only 1.4%, a level with which we are very comfortable.
On the real estate tax side, these constitute about a quarter of our property operating expenses. These decreased quarter-over-quarter and we now expect these taxes to be flat or slightly down this year. We had originally projected about a 2% increase, but governments have been faster to lower valuation than we had thought and the counterbalancing rate increases that we expected have yet to materialize.
We can’t help but to think that these increases are coming, but they will likely not be here in 2010. Utility cost which constitute about 15% of our property operating expenses are trending lower than the up 3% we expected at the beginning of the year and we now expect about a 2% year-over-year increase in this category.
Energy cost, electric and gas have been lower than we expected at the beginning of this year and this trend will likely continue for all of 2010.
In sum, we remain comfortable with our plus 1% to plus 2% range for 2010 expense growth as most expenses are running at or near plan, and unanticipated increases in categories like property management are being offset by slower than expected growth in areas like property taxes.
Now I’m going to speak for a moment about our revised operating guidance. We are delighted to improve the midpoint of our same store 2010 revenue range by 1.75% and set our new goal post at between down 0.5% and flat. I previously noted that our expense guidance range will remain at plus 1% to plus 2%. This results in a new range for net operating income of down 2% to down 0.5%, a 2.75% improvement in the midpoint of our guidance.
Our strengthening revenue picture made this improvement happen. On page three of the release you can see a detailed reconciliation taking you from $2.05 the midpoint of our old FFO guidance range to $2.17 the midpoint of our new FFO guidance range.
As you can see the main driver of our guidance improvement is $0.13 of better than expected property NOI. This is almost entirely due to same store revenues running ahead of our expectations of six months ago.
The timing of our 2010 transactions activity will also give us more FFO than we expected. By having acquired early in the year and now expecting to sell later in the year, the dilution from our sales activity will be less than we originally budgeted.
We are now projecting most of our disposition activity to be in the fourth quarter allowing us to continue to collect NOI from these disposition properties longer and positively impacting 2010 FFO.
Also, as David noted in his remarks the strong performance of our 2010 acquisitions will drive more in FFO to us than we had expected.
On the unfavorable side, interest expense will be up about $0.03. Our recent unsecured bond issuance, which I will describe in more detail in just a moment, will cause most of this variance.
Finally, we reduced guidance by $0.03 for various costs relating to Prospect Towers Garage, including lost revenues, legal costs, and interim resident-support costs.
In total, the company expects to spend net of anticipated insurance reimbursements about $12 million. The money we spend rebuilding the garage will be capitalized as these dollars are spent.
Other costs, like those to accommodate displaced residents, lost revenues due to the high-rise portion of the property being temporarily unavailable for occupancy, and legal costs will reduce FFO as they are incurred. Generally, insurance proceeds will be recorded as increases to FFO as they are received, which will most likely be in 2011 and 2012.
Without these one-time items, our revised FFO guidance midpoint would have been set at about $2.23 per share. For the balance of the year, a $0.57 per quarter FFO number or even slightly higher feels like a good run rate for our operating business.
However, our actual FFO results will likely be lower for the third quarter and about equal to this $0.57 run rate for the fourth quarter due to the one-time items I noticed before.
Overall, we’re pleased with our FFO results to-date and look forward to finishing the year strong.
On July 15, 2010, the company closed on the $600 million 10-year unsecured bond offering. The bonds carry a 4.75% coupon rate and 4.84% effective yield. After the impact of fees and discounts and terminating an interest rate hedge, the all-in rate to the company was 5.09%.
This was our first unsecured bond issuance in over three years. The deal was met with an enthusiastic reception by our fixed income investors and was a rousing success and we thank our fixed income investors for their support.
We had sufficient demand to double our deal size if we had wanted to do so and the 4.84% effective yield was one of the lowest for 10-year paper in modern REIT history. This debt deal reflects the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet and these are validation of the company’s conservative balance sheet strategy.
We had said on prior calls that we were in no hurry to issue debt, but would monitor the markets as always and be opportunistic. When we saw the late June rally in Treasury is caused by increasing anxiety over Europe, coupled with our borrowing spreads remaining constant or even slightly tightening, we decided that issuing a 5% or less piece of 10-year unsecured debt was just too compelling to pass up.
We also believe that the recent increase in volatility in the markets and mixed economic news wanted a somewhat more cautious refinancing posture. We also thought pre-funding a portion of our 2011 maturities and accretive rates to our maturing 2011 fixed rate debt was prudent long term planning.
We expect about $460 million of cash to be in our balance sheet at year end. This is earmarked to cover 2011 debt maturities. As I mentioned before, this pre-funding will have about a $0.03 per share negative FFO effect on the back half of 2010, this is net of reductions in interest expense due to lower than expected rates on our floating rate debt and all this is included in our revised guidance range.
However the new debt deal will be a pickup in 2011 and later years as the 5.09% all-in rate on the new debt compares favorably with the 5.5% rate on the fixed rate 2011 debt that is maturing and will be replaced.
On the sources and uses side, we expect our revolving line of credit to be undrawn at December 31, 2010 with about $1.4 billion of availability. As I mentioned, cash on hand at December 31, 2010 should be about $460 million due to both the debt deal, and because we expect to receive material disposition proceeds during the second half of 2010.
And operator, we’re now happy to take any question.

The job situation there has been very ugly as we all know related to real estate and construction. A lot of overhang from all the condo mess with single family, but that’s pretty much behind us now. They’re making good strides in selling, clearing that inventory. The jobs are gone. We know that, and they’re actually starting to come back a little bit now with some large infrastructure. They’re getting a lot of the money from the federal stimulus money.
So, things are actually looking up at South Florida, quite well after a long kind of flat period. So, we expect some good growth there. Real increases in South Florida, we just did 5.9%. So we’re looking actually pretty good in South Florida. New York is back with a vengeance. New York is on fire. I mean, I’ve never seen really sell hard, sell deep, but in previous calls, we’ve said it really isn’t as bad as we thought it should be and it never was, and it’s very tight now, very strong demand.
We’re seeing evidence of jobs coming back. I mean, a lot of the firms on this call are hiring again. We’re seeing that not only in Jersey, but all throughout Manhattan. We’re a little nervous about supply pressure Upper West Side, which hit us last year and is continuing, and I’m sorry, Upper West Side this year, and then the Midtown West hit last year, and it’s continuing, but we’re powering right through it. It’s not an issue. So, rents have recovered very strong in New York. We’re getting base rent growth. We’re getting the premiums back. We’re not paying brokers very much.
And the interesting fact is that there are hard big tickets, high-end, high roller units are full. We just rented a double penthouse at Trump at very high rates. Our 600 Washington building down there in the West Village is 100% occupied. We’re getting $7 a foot again. So, good times seem to be rolling in New York, each time we go there it seems to be a little bit better.

I do think the unsecured market and secured market are very close in pricing right now. The secured markets for us might be an eighth of a percent lower than that 4.8%, may be a quarter at most, but they are pretty well on top of each other. So, I think we were probably a little bit more committed to the unsecured market, but I mean we’ll keep our eyes open and we’ll see.

I will say and I just have to commend the GSE multifamily folks. In spite of all this uncertainty, they have continued to be there in the market everyday for us and everyone else in multi.
So, what I’d say, Alex, is that the machine keeps running at the GSE’s very well. What the future holds I don’t have any special insight into. We do know that the President is convening a group in about three weeks at the White House, but I think it’s a very much a political event to talk about the future, the GSEs.

I think the lower turnover rates are going to be sustainable for several years. That’s going to maybe crop in some of the seasonal patterns on the shorter season, and also the lack of supply.
When we look into next year and the year after, supply numbers on each one of our core markets are virtually zero, I mean, very, very small numbers of supply, and typically supply has a disruptive factor to a market and when concessions are offered and when they hit or close these from the concession using double-down or triple-down, and that causes some movement within the market. So basically, this is the fundamental shifts in our industry. I don’t think, it’s going to change, but it may soften some of the seasonal moves.

That was a property that we knew we’d be in a position to start this year and we have. We’re expecting plus 7% or so stabilized yield on current rents on that deal.
And then again the property that we’ve started in Denver which is the third phase of a three-phase deal in Denver. We’ve had this property for some time, and we thought it was a prudent time to begin construction there and we’re expecting a plus 7% return on cost there as well.
As we wait for those things that are under construction because we haven’t put anything into the pipeline for quite some time, most of what we have will soon be complete and it is generally in various stages. The lease-up absorption as I noted on those has gone very well, certainly at rental levels that were below our expectations for 2010 when we underwrote those deals, but we’re happy with absorption and certainly happy to see net effect of pricing or our base rent pricing be higher today than it was earlier this year.
We continue to look for acquisition or for development opportunities. We’re currently looking at some deals in Northern California, in Southern California in some land that we have there, as well as DC, working very preliminary on another deal in Manhattan and in Seattle. So again, we’re very active. I think, it would be some time before we ratchet that business up, but we’re certainly looking and we think it’s a good way to add value.

It’s a high watermark. So I think what’s happening now is we’re recovering that market share of that wallet and we’re not there yet and it will take some time for us to get there. We do believe that these residents are hunkering down, we do expect our retention to be up, we do expect there to be somewhat of a mental shift for much of our tenancy with respect to the wisdom about finding a single family home.
And as a result I think it's very possible that percentage of market share just could increase, that people will be willing to spend a little bit more or will have to spend a little bit more off their wallet on their housing, but for us to sort of realize the kind of growth rates that we had seen kind of back at ‘06-’07 and then currently maybe what we're seeing most recently, as we’re now recovering. We do believe that we need to see job growth and the resulting increase in incomes to actually allow that to happen.

Thanks for joining us today. We are extremely pleased with the operating performance of the company thus far, and we’d like to acknowledge the hard work that the entire team is doing out there to deliver that performance. So, thank you all so [ph] very much for what you do each and every day for us.
We have come an awfully long way in the last year and this is really the result of continued strength in each of the four areas that Fred Tuomi on prior calls has pointed out as key factors for driving performance for us.
The first was retention, which we estimate will improve 4.5 to 5 percentage points over the last year, because our turnover in 2009 was about 61.3%, and we think that will improve to around 56.5% or so in 2010. And I want to add that both of these figures are inclusive of the onsite transfers and those between EQR properties, so that the really net true move out is even better than that.
Our renewal rates in September, we achieved renewal rate increases of 5.1%. In October, those renewal rate increases we achieved were 5.5% and on the 2,500 leases renewed thus far for November, we are achieving a 5.7% increase.
Occupancy which was 93.8% in 2009, will average more than a 100 basis points higher in 2010 and occupancy currently at 94.8% today, is a very strong level for this time of the year.
In our base rents, those being new rents we’re asking for our new residents to pay, these asking rents are up 8.7% since the beginning of the year on a weighted average basis across the portfolio. As a result of this, we’ve recovered a significant portion of the discounts in rents that we gave our residence in 2008 and 2009.
We now have only about 5% more rate growth left to reestablish peak pricing across the portfolio and that’s helped by some markets that have already surpassed the prior high watermarks and are now creating new peak pricing levels. So, we remain very optimistic as we wrap up the year and we move into 2011.
Now we know there’s a bit of disbelief out there about how well the apartment space is doing, despite any kind of real meaningful job growth. I’ll be honest with you by saying that, when we look at our dashboards and we see continued improvement in these four years that I just mentioned and then, we look ourselves at the newspaper headlines, we ask ourselves the same thing. We ask ourselves this question without taking our foot off the gas on rental increases I will tell you, but we do ask the same thing.
In addition all of the things that we’ve talked about over the course of this year that have positively impacted apartment fundamentals such as, the powerful demographic picture comprised of $80 million plus echo-boomers.
The fact is there’s been virtually no new supply added to core markets across the country, as well as the changing dynamic with respect to the wisdom and benefits of single-family home ownership.
The Head of our Research Department, the smart guy by the name of Jay Lybik reminds us about the importance of household growth and that well job growth certainly fuels household growth, household growth can and does occur without job growth and in fact, markets can simultaneously experience household formation, while actually losing jobs.
According to several sources, it’s estimated that nationally we formed somewhere between 800,000 and 900,000 new households this year and that’s the level that’s pretty consistent with a year ago, and this compares to a recent period of economic expansion when we were forming about 1.2 million households annually. So, the number is down this year, but it’s still very meaningful.
Furthermore, notwithstanding what the apartment capture rate might have been of these new households in the past, the likelihood of the new households being created today opting for rental housing rather than home ownership is extremely, extremely high.
So, when one thinks about this increase in household formations at a time of significantly reduced new apartment supply in a time of declining single-family home ownership levels, this can explain a lot of the strength and fundamentals we’re experiencing today in a period of little new job growth.
In any event, I’ll tell you we remained very optimistic about our business prospects and it will only get better as the economy recovers and adds more jobs.
So, on the transaction side, let me tell you that as we noted in the release last night, we acquired six assets in the third quarter for a total of nearly $550 million. That brings the total for the year to 14 assets and $1.4 billion of acquisitions.
The assets we acquired in the third quarter, four of those were in California, two in the San Francisco Bay area, one in Berkley and the other in Burlingame near the San Francisco airport and one each in Los Angeles and San Diego.
We acquired two deals in the D.C. area, one in Arlington, Virginia and the other in Alexandria, Virginia.
Of the five assets that were fully leased, cap rates on these deals ranged from the high 4s at one of the Bay area deal that near airport which is a value-add deal, which should stabilize in the mid 6s to the low 6s on the Alexandria, Virginia acquisition that was adjacent to an existing property that we already own.
The San Diego deal, which we had announced previously is our Vantage Pointe property, which was built in 2009 and contains 679 units. Now that property was 20% leased at acquisition and is obviously subject to a major lease up effort on our part.
Very much like what is happening at our 425 Mass Avenue deal in D.C., which is in lease up we are up and running with Vantage Pointe and that’s from a standing start.
Likewise, like the Mass Avenue deal from a standing start, we’re just doing phenomenal job there and thus far the team has leased 61 units in the first month of ownership and we are extremely excited about that and net effect in pro forma rents that were modestly above what we had projected. We’re very confident that deal was stabilized at a 7% plus yield on current rents today.
Now based up on what we’ve acquired thus far this year and that which we are looking at today, we’ve increased our acquisition guidance for the year to $1.5 billion. We continue to work on a handful of deals that couldn’t close yet this year in Boston, in D.C., in LA and San Francisco.
I’ll tell you we have seen an increase in the number of deals being offered for sale on our core markets, but there remains considerable competition for most of these assets.
Cap rates obviously compressed significantly throughout the year, but we now think that they have stabilized in the low 4s to mid 5s at least in our core markets. As a result values, which were growing dramatically for much of the year, they continue our growth today, but we think at a slower rate and our rate of growth, which we think is more in line with NOI growth.
I’ll tell you we continue to try and find ways to achieve better overall returns by looking at deals with the lease up risk like Vantage Pointe and the 425 Mass deal, deals with value add or repositioning opportunities. But simply put, deals of all sorts other than fully stabilized core assets, will attract the interest of a lot for this institutional capital.
On the disposition side, we sold three wholly-owned assets during the quarter as well as our 25% interest in 24 properties held in joint venture with an institutional partner that we formed 10 years ago.
Two of the three wholly-owned assets we sold were in Stockton, California and the other one in Dallas, Texas, which is we continue our exit from our non-core markets.
Now you will recall that we have significantly slowed our disposition pace earlier in the year because we thought that more fundamentals end values would recover as the year progressed. As a result, we intentionally sold only a $172 million in the first nine months of the year.
We did ramp up our offerings for sale mid-year because values did in fact recover as the strong bid for sticks and bricks made its way into lesser quality assets and into non-core markets.
We know have about $300 million under contract, we have another $300 million under letter of intent and even more in various stages of marketing. So, we have readjusted our 2010 disposition guidance to $750 million for the calendar year.
Even at this reduced level, it’s obvious we’ve got a lot of work to do to make that number by the end of the year and it’s certainly possible that we will. But if we miss, it will only be because some of the closings has slipped into January of next year, because we are committed to selling our non-strategic assets, and we think that at current pricing based on a lot of which is on Fannie and Freddie interest rates liquidity, we think it’s a good time to be selling those assets we don’t think we want to own in the mid-term and we certainly intend to do so.
I’m pleased to say on the development side, we continue to make great progress on our development assets. Deals are being completed on time and under budget. Leasing continues to exceed our forecast on absorption and like our stabilized assets, we’re enjoying a lift in net effective rates.
Thus far this year, we’ve commenced construction on two projects; one in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood and the other our third and final phase of a property in Denver, Colorado.
We have also acquired six land partners thus far this year. A site in Arlington, Virginia that we’d announced earlier in the year, three sites in the third quarter; one in Berkeley, California, one in Alexandria, Virginia, and one in Miami, Florida; and two sites in the Seattle that closed earlier this week.
Now, we expect to be able to begin construction on most of these sites in 2011 and that would represent nearly 340 million of starts next year on these parcels alone. We expect yields at current rents in the mid 6% to mid 7% range on these starts.
In addition, we have some land sites that were acquired before the downturn that are under consideration for near-term construction starts, and we also remain very active underwriting new development opportunities.
Of course though, when we look at development opportunities, we do sell along with acquisition opportunities during the best risk-adjusted returns we can on our invested capital and we will continue to deploy our capital accordingly. Mark?

First, our third quarter performance, especially our expense performance, our revised guidance for 2010, and then just a little bit of a discussion on our balance sheet and the impact of some of our transactional activity on the balance sheet.
Since David has already provided good color on the drivers for our revenue performance, I’m going to move right on to expenses. Same store expenses increased 1.9% on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
We’re very pleased to deliver this strong performance on expenses. This is especially true, because in our comparable period last year expenses decreased 0.6%.
In fact, assuming, we deliver our guidance number of 1.5% increase in operating expenses for 2010, over the last four years, our operating expenses would have grown at an average annual rate of just 1.4%.
We have delivered consistent restrained expense growth, while maintaining terrific customer loyalty, due to efforts of our colleagues at our properties throughout the country, as well as in the Property Operations team in Chicago. Well done, everyone.
I also want to take a look at three of our big expense drivers. We call them the Big Three here. Real estate taxes, first on the real estate side, we had a 4.3% reduction in property taxes quarter-over-quarter, and this was due to changes in the accrual rates.
It’s customary that during the third quarter of each year, we receive rate and evaluation information from most of our properties in the various taxing authorities, we take that information, and we use it to reset our accruals.
The reason we’re resetting our accruals as we’ve said on prior calls is that we continue to experience favorable real estate tax results as lower revaluations of our properties by local governments are occurring, without at least to this point increases in tax rates.
We are also having considerable success with our appeals. We now expect real estate taxes to be down about 1.5% for the year, and I remind everyone that real estate taxes are about a quarter of our property operating expenses.
Second big expense driver for us is onsite payroll, it also makes up about a quarter of our operating expenses. It was up 4.7% in the quarter. As was true for real estate taxes, adjustments to accrual rates in this case accrual rates on health insurance, workmen’s compensation, and bonuses, drove most of the change in this line item during this quarter.
We increased our accruals for both health insurance and workmen’s comp. I don’t think this is a surprise to anyone that health and material cost continue to rise, though the rate of increase was more than we had expected.
Also, based on our improved operating performance we are accruing for a higher level of bonuses this year, after being down considerably in this line item last year. We budgeted for onsite payroll this year to be up to 1.5% and now see it as being up about 2.5%.
Excluding the extraordinary over time costs we incurred in the first quarter of this year, due to the big snow storms in the Northeast, this line item would have been up a bit less than 2% year-to-date.
Our final big expense item is utility costs. These constitute about 15% of our operating expenses and they were up 3.5% in the quarter. One third of our utility expenses or said another way 5% of total operating expenses are directly energy related.
Gas costs were lower than we expected this quarter and we expect that trend to continue as we have locked the cost of the large portion of our 2011 natural gas usage at lower levels in 2010.
Two-thirds of utility expenses or 10% of our property operating expenses are water, sewer and trash and are not directly driven by changes in energy costs. Instead changes in water and sewer rates, cash by municipalities that are tight on cash at the moment have driven up these numbers lately. In the quarter, they were up 6%. At the beginning of the year, we expected utility cost to be up 3%, we now expect about a 2% year-over-year increase in this category.
In summary, we’re comfortable that our operating expenses will increase about 1.5% this year, because modest growth in utilities and payroll will be offset by decline in property taxes.
Now I’m going to talk a little bit about guidance. We expect our same store operating performance to be right in line with the guidance that we provided back in July. For the full year, we expect revenues to be down 0.25%.
We expect same store expenses to be up 1.5% and our resulting same store NOI to be down 1.25%. We expect same store fourth quarter sequential revenues to be roughly flat when compared to the third quarter.
Pure rental revenue which is the combined impact of rental rate and occupancy will be up 0.5% or half a percent or better on a sequential basis. But in the fourth quarter we will sign fewer new leases, due to seasonally slower demand and renew fewer existing leases due to lower exploration volume. Thus we will have fewer opportunities to grow our in place rents.
Also with lower levels of activity, we expect to earn less in transaction-related other income, like application and moving fees, during the lower volume fourth quarter then we earned in the higher volume third quarter. Lower other income will blunt deposit of impact of rates and occupancy at least between the third and fourth quarters.
I do want to mention that we expect same store net operating income to be up $4 million or so between the third and fourth quarters, due to seasonally lower expenses. So for the same reason our revenues go down in the fourth quarter or stay flat our expenses go down. There is less transactional activity, less turnover cost, less maintenance activity.
We also revised our FFO guidance range for the year. Our midpoint is now $2.20 per share, up from the previous midpoint of $2.17 per share. Because our same store operations for the year are going to be right where we thought they would be, a $0.03 midpoint increase us being driven by factors outside of our same store operations, specifically, transaction timing and volume as well as lease ups.
As David described, we purchased a substantial number of operating properties this year. We also just raised our acquisition guidance by $250 million. We also purchased properties earlier in the year than we initially expected. This means more acquisition NOI and FFO in 2010 that we had previously thought.
In addition, we lowered our disposition guidance by $100 million. It is possible that some of our budgeted $750 million in disposition activity will bleed into the beginning of 2011. I would expect cash flow from disposition and acquisition activity to be lumpy and uneven. Transactions do not always neatly close prior to financial statement end dates.
Summing it up, changes in the timing of acquisitions and dispositions will result in a contribution to FFO of about $0.02 per share above our original budget. In addition, our properties and lease up have performed better than expected, contributing $0.01 more than we had budget for the year. Lease ups provide an incremental $9.3 million in the third quarter, and they will provide about $34 million in NOI for us for the entire year.
So, let’s turn to the last item and talk a little bit about the impact of our various investment activities on the balance sheet. Some of our leverage statistics were slightly elevated at this quarter end, due to the timing of our disposition and acquisition activities. We think about our credit metrics over multiyear periods, not just at any specific quarter ending. As I’ve said before, over time we will fund our investment activity on a leverage-neutral basis.
Getting into the specifics, last quarter, I estimated that by the end of this year we would have about $460 million in cash in our balance sheet and that our $1.4 billion revolving line of credit would be undrawn.
Due to changes in the outlook for transactions activity, I still expect that at the end of the year, our revolving line of credit will be undrawn, but that we will have approximately $135 million in cash.
As I mentioned before the precise timing of our transaction activity is hard to gauge, and we expect to receive substantial additional disposition proceeds in the first part of 2011.
We believe in having a conservative balance sheet that has both great strength and great flexibility between our current total liquidity and our ability to access both the debt and equity markets. We have great confidence in our ability to meet our upcoming obligations and to fund our investment activity.
Operator, we’re now happy to take questions.

You’re right, D.C. and New York continue to just moderate though the leasing season and poised for a continued strength in terms of demand, rents, renewals all aspects of our fundamental. Those two markets are extremely strong and favorable and I don’t see anything slowing them down.
In the New York specifically, I was just there last week talking to some of our managers and we are seeing on the ground is good, steady, stream of new people coming into New York who formerly were not from New York and they have jobs. It’s not just the financial sector, has legal, has professional services, the entertainment business, especially in the upper west side it’s brining a lots of people into the area.
So, we are not totally dependent on the financial sector. But within the financial sector we aren’t seeing any further job losses, but the pace of adding has slowed. So, we think that the financial sector is pretty much stable. We have heard some of the large firms have high increases until after the election and then we’ll see what happens after that.
So we don’t see any declines, but obviously continued growth from other sectors and stability in the financial sector. If they are going to have a huge layoff then I think it will be sort of like we had last year, it will create some softening. But we don’t see any signs of that coming yet.
In D.C. kind of similar story, but the lead there obviously is the federal government. We are renting to a lot of federal government employees, lot of contractors related to that, lot of lobbyists, lot of defense industry, but also a lot of lawyers, a lot of accountants, a lot of consulting firms, plus in D.C. area you have the health sciences, with HAS, a lot of biomedical healthcare health sciences. You’ve got a lot of tech, lot high tech, and non-defense related technology.
So, D.C. is more than just the federal government, but clearly it’s the maintenance driver. If the federal government were able to actually accomplish some significant cuts it would be a setback. But as everybody knows usually talked a lot about and not actually accomplished.

Relative to peak, as a general rule most markets peak back in the middle of 2008 on June or July. Those markets that have we right now that have actually established new peaks include South Florida, it was very good to see. South Florida was kind of flat for a long time and now it’s had a good steady run of sequential improvements in South Florida.
It established a new peak here in October. Boston, which has been a leader through the entire process has already established a new peak. Denver, Colorado, kind of the same story, good, steady, consistent growth establish a new peak, as well as D.C. on the Maryland side, Virginia’s close but not quite there yet.
And then on the flip side those furthest away that have the longest recapture to go yet is kind of not surprising on the west coast and specifically in the south west. So, there we have Phoenix, it’s still about 12% off, Santiago about 11% to go, Orange County about the same about 11% to 12% to go yet. And then Seattle is the leader in that respect, it’s got 15% or so to go before establishing a new peak.

But I will tell you that in nearly any acquisition that we’re buying today at some point in the near future be it next year or the year after or the year after that. I’m sure, we’ve got 4%, 5%, 6% increases. In the markets in which we’re buying with occupancy the way it is and single-family home situation, all of the things that we’re talking about, there is no doubt in my minds that we will see some very attractive rental rate growth going forward and improvements in revenue on the assets that we’ve been acquiring.
Like I’ve been saying, we’ve been buying sort of high 4s, maybe, low 6s, we think we’re going to get into the high 6s and 7s in some of these fairly promptly. The IRRs we’ve been underwriting have been low 9s to maybe low 10s, and at what a price per door is today and what that terminal value price per door will be and that value compound average growth rate of that has been 3% or 4%. So, we think that the assumption we’ve been making have been very reasonable given what’s going on out there just on the supply and demand fundamentals across our major markets.

As again I mentioned before at the New York just last week, and what they told me was there was actually a waiting list for some of our penthouse units. So our penthouse units which are at the entire floor, lots of premium rents added to them. Those units are full. In fact we have a waiting list at Trump for some combined units. Same is true in downtown Boston. The penthouse units leased extremely well during the leasing season and went down like may be one rep.
So the premium pricing which we add for premium units such as views, floors, other amenities has recovered fully in those markets. So I feel very good about the ability to rent at the high end. Some of the lease ups that David mentioned, for example, 425 Mass in D.C., that’s an expensive building. It’s a high rent district. We’ve got very high-wage earning people living there and we’ve been able to rent those at a very fast pace. So, there doesn’t seem to be price resistance at the higher level.

I don’t see anything really going to change that. In terms of the supply demand, it’s had a lot of supply brought in over the last three years running, right through the downturn. We’ve had 7,000 units back in ‘08, 7,600 in ‘09, 4,800 units delivered this year at the worst possible time, but yet we’ve had some of the best fundamentals.
The reason is D.C. as a general market had record apartment absorption over the last two years, which is really mind blowing, but when you look at it, it was just fortunate timing with the fantastic job creation from the whole Federal government and all the other aspects I talked about earlier. Right now in 2011, there will be some continued development but only 1,400 units being delivered in entire D.C., Virginia, Maryland market. So that’s a significant reduction. I don’t see a slowdown in demand, but it’s likely to come at some point, it will moderate, but with only 1,400 units coming in, you’ll feel very good about 2011 and early into 2012. We, as well as other people are talking about development in D.C..
When you talk to anybody about development, D.C. is one of the things they talk about. So I do expect some more units to be delivered there in maybe late ‘11, ‘12, ‘13, but will it be back up to 7,000-8,000 units? I don’t think so. That would take a lot of return at a merchant builders and lot of lending to support that. I think it’s going to be well capitalized, more disciplined, folks going to be adding units. So, there will be some supply coming back, but I’ll think it’s going to be disrupted.

What level of development should we be looking for from EQR going forward, what’s the level that you feel comfortable kind of running at? Obviously, you’ve run down the portfolio here over there in the past couple of years just through completions and lease up. Just kind of wondering what we should expect kind of the long-term development strategy is there?

So, I guess we have the capacity both with capital and internal capacity of our development team to do $500 million a year. It’s just going to be a function of will there be sufficient opportunities, priced accordingly relative to acquisition opportunities. So, it’s very hard to tell you, to say Mike, what that will be going forward.

So, there have been limited opportunities in these markets and so we’ve been buying and buying existing deals and buying land sites. So, it’s not always a either or proposition as long as you’re getting the appropriate risk adjusted premium for taking on all the risks of the development. So, right now in every core market in which we operate, we’re considering both.
