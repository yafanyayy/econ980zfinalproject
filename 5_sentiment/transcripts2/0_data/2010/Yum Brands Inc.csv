Given the tough macro environment, I'm especially pleased to announce that 2009 was another strong year of performance as we continue our quest to make Yum! Brands the defining global company that feeds the world.",1997,"Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everybody. Given the tough macro environment, I'm especially pleased to announce that 2009 was another strong year of performance as we continue our quest to make Yum! Brands the defining global company that feeds the world. We reported 13% EPS growth, marking the eighth straight year that we exceeded our annual target of at least 10% and achieved at least 13%. As I look back on the year, I'm really proud of what we accomplish in 2009. In a very tough year, we opened over 1,400 new restaurants outside the United States while making major progress on our incremental sales layers in each of our businesses. We improved our worldwide restaurant margins by 1.7 percentage points and operating profit grew by 9% prior to foreign currency translation. Importantly, we maintained our return on invested capital of 20% and continued to be an industry leader.In China, we grew our profits by a whopping 25% in 2009 on top of 28% in 2008. That's over 50% growth in two years. The good news is that we achieved these impressive results even though our same-store sales were slightly negative, as the consumer has lagged the recent economic trends. We added a record 509 new units and now have nearly 3,500 restaurants. KFC added 428 new locations and made progress adding home delivery and building breakfast. Pizza Hut Casual Dining added 55 new locations and is generating positive same-store sales results by adding a wide variety of appetizers, beverages, entrées and desserts. We also made progress with our two newest brands, Pizza Hut Home Service and East Dawning. Overall, 2009 was another great year of growth for our China business.Next, Yum! Restaurants International continues to produce solid results with 5% system sales and profit growth excluding foreign currency translation. Driven by our franchisee development machine, we opened nearly 900 new units in over 75 countries. Our strong network of around 1,000 franchisees opened over 90% of these new units. Importantly, we made major progress creating new growth vehicles by investing in France, India and Russia, and beginning to develop Taco Bell into a truly global brand. Yum! Restaurants International made significant progress on sales layers as well. KFC aggressively expanded our Krushers line of frozen beverages to over 1,500 units in over 25 countries, up from around 100 units in seven countries at the beginning of the year. Pizza Hut is following China's successful strategy of offering more casual dining variety.In the United States, Taco Bell delivered solid margin and profit growth, which was offset by weak performance of KFC and Pizza Hut. We continue to invest in and expand our sales layers even though the benefit of these efforts was not yet visible in our same-store sales performance. Taco Bell has fortified its value positioning and has a full arsenal of news ready for 2010. I am very optimistic we will have another good year at Taco Bell.Pizza Hut has recently addressed its biggest problem, value with the successfully tested $10 Anyway You Want It everyday promotion launched in earlier this year. KFC made an important long-term investment by adding Kentucky Grilled Chicken, providing a balanced option and eliminating the veto vote. All in all, the U.S. business generated significant margin improvement in a challenged sales environment that led to weaker-than-expected 2009 profit growth of 1%. And importantly, each U.S. brand goes into 2010 better prepared to beat year ago.For those of you that missed our annual investor  update meeting, we showcased our largest resources and profit: China, Yum! Restaurants international and Taco Bell U.S. These three businesses together generate 85% of our worldwide profits and will be the key drivers of our future growth. Now I'd like to thank all of you who attended for the positive feedback from that meeting, but I would like to address two of the biggest questions we have been asked since then. First, is Yum!'s weak same-store sales performance in Mainland China an early indicator that something is wrong with the business, or that Yum! is growing too fast? We believe the answer to the question is definitively no. First, let's look at 2009 and put the facts into perspective. We added over 500 new restaurants, we held our transactions flat for the year, and we have near-record restaurant level margins of 20%. Yes, same-store sales did decline 1%. Considering that, like I said earlier, we still grew our profits 25% on top of 28% growth in 2008. All in what most would call an off year for the Chinese consumer. Now as problems go, I'll take it. For a little more perspective, let me step back in 2005, a year where we saw same-store sales declined 3%. That year, we opened 379 new restaurants and made $211 million. Now I remember some people question our pace of development and the state of our business as a result of our negative same-store sales. Since 2005, we have added over 1,800 restaurants and have tripled our profits to over $600 million. We now have $1.4 million average unit volumes at KFC, with margins of over 20% and $1.2 million average unit volumes at Pizza Hut with margins of 19%. Our foundation for growth has never been stronger. Today, just like in 2005, China is and is predicted to be the fastest-growing major economy in the world. In fact, it's expected to grow its middle class from around 300 million today to 500 million to 2020. Like I said in the past, we will no doubt have some bumpy years. Unquestionably, we will have some ups and downs in China, but I wouldn't trade our position in China with any consumer company.Well, that's enough history. Suffice it to say, we still believe China holds great potential, and we're clearly in the early innings of building our business in this massive and growing economy. Having said this, we constantly, and I mean constantly, monitor our returns and are committed to never building ahead of our people capability and unit economics. Our goal is to build a quality long-term business, and that's exactly what we're going to do.Next, while investors seem to understand our long-term growth strategy around our three largest businesses, China, Yum! Restaurants International and Taco Bell U.S., they are asking, what are we doing to manage the short-term downside risks from our Pizza Hut and KFC U.S. brands? This is more than a fair question because we made the conscious decision to not even cover Pizza Hut and KFC U.S. at the December Analyst Meeting, as they represent only 15% of our Yum! worldwide profit. Instead, we intentionally chose to highlight the 85% of our profits generated in China, Yum! Restaurants International and Taco Bell U.S. And particularly, we wanted to drive home the fact that Taco Bell is our big U.S. growth engine, accounting for over 60% of our U.S. profits and is a net grower of new units with lots of potential. That said, I want you to know that we are absolutely passionate about addressing the challenges of both Pizza Hut and KFC in turning around those businesses.At Pizza Hut, our long-term strategy is to transform the brand from pizza to pizza, pasta and wings. However, our biggest short-term issue is the need to shore up and grow our pizza sales. Here, the consumer has told us that frankly that we are simply too expensive. Basically, they are saying, we love your pizza, we are America's favorite pizza but I can't afford you. Well, going into 2010, the vast majority of our system has responded by making carryout pricing more competitive and we have rolled out our successfully tested $10 Anyway You Want It promotion. We are pleased to say we have already seen a dramatic improvement in sales and traffic.More importantly, our system has seen the power of  being value competitive, and we will continue to focus on everyday value throughout the year. We also have more successfully tested value initiatives in our pipeline, along with premium pizza innovation that will command premium pricing. Simultaneously, we have successfully tested and will be rolling out new ways to drive incremental occasions with pasta and wings. Pizza Hut is also focused on improving the speed of service and executing its Heart of the Hut program designed to improve hospitality. With these strategies and programs under way, we are confident that Pizza Hut will have a much better year in 2010.Now KFC, there's no question, we have our work cut out for us. However, we have an absolutely great leadership team addressing issues our customers have been asking us to do for a long time. First, our customers have been telling us that we need to offer more balanced choices. And our answer here is Kentucky Grilled Chicken. This product receives rave reviews and represents around one quarter of our chicken-on-the-bone business. And the fact is, we hate to think of where we would be without it. In 2010, we will have more new product news and we'll be able to serve consumers Kentucky Grilled Chicken and our world famous Original Recipe Chicken. We no longer have the fried veto vote because we now are the only brand to offer real chicken-on-the-bone choice.Second, our KFC customers have told us we need to give them more value. So in 2009, for the first time in our history, we launched a nationwide value menu. We also brought the value message to our Kentucky Grilled Chicken launch with our $3.99 two-piece meals. Offering everyday value will continue to play a critical role in moving this brand forward in 2010.Third, our customers have asked us to improve our operations, particularly around product availability and speed of service. So we have actively pursued raising our standards, raising our game by aggressively pushing for higher standards by investing in more franchise field support, increasing operational audits and racking and stacking and publishing performance in our system, a tool used by all great operating companies. So in 2010, KFC is better prepared to offer the consumer more choice, better value and better service. But like I said, we have more to do. Our goal is to stay focused on building the business back the right way, and we are confident you will see steady progress. But I want to be clear, we have not yet turned the corner and we expect KFC sales will be tough in the first half.Now from a financial standpoint, remember, we are in the midst of a multi-year program to reduce our company ownership to around 5% from 21% ownership at Pizza Hut and 18% at KFC at the end of 2007. This will give us an even more significant and more predictable stream of franchise revenue. And simply by reducing the G&A from company operations, we expect to generate at least as much profit with no capital expenditure by putting these restaurants in the hands of our good franchise operators.When you look at all our efforts, we're confident our U.S. business is heading towards more reliable and a more predictable earnings and cash flow. So in 2010, here is what we expect our divisions to deliver. China will grow profits by 15%. Yum! Restaurants International will grow profits by 10%. The U.S. business will grow profits by 5%. These are all reasonable targets and not a stretch from our perspective.Now remember, international unit development of about 1,400 new units from China and Yum! Restaurants International drive six percentage points of our EPS growth. We expect the balance of our growth to come from our base business through overall global same-store sales growth of 2%, productivity initiatives and G&A leverage, along with an expected benefit from foreign currency translation. When you add it up, we intend to extend our track record to nine consecutive years of meeting or exceeding our target of at least 10% EPS growth. Now let me turn it over to Rick Carucci, our Chief Financial Officer."

In this section of our call, I'm going to comment on our key themes from our 2009 results, as well as our outlook for 2010.Yum! had another successful year in 2009. We grew earnings per share by 13% and for the first time achieved over $1 billion of net income. I would like to provide some context for our 2009 results around the following four themes: Continued strong international new unit development, weaker-than-usual sales, strong productivity gains and continued investment in growth initiatives. So I'll start with the first one, strong international development. We had a record year of development in China and another strong year of YRI franchise-led development. Our 2009 results again demonstrated that international new unit development is a significant and proven driver of Yum!'s profit growth.Second, weaker than usual sales. Our sales results were below our targets, as a globally weak consumer environment led to lower ticket averages. We had an especially weak second half of the year in 2009. There were some pockets of strength: Our U.K. business, YRI developing markets such as India and Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China, to name a few.Third, let's talk about productivity. Hats off to our teams in China and Taco Bell in the U.S. who drove substantial margin improvement in 2009. Both China and the U.S. saw dramatic commodity inflation in 2008 followed by deflation in 2009. For the China division, the 1.8 point increase in restaurant margin during 2009 more than offset the margin decrease in 2008 despite net commodity inflation of $17 million over the past two years. In the U.S., total net commodity inflation over the past two years has been about $90 million. During this time, we improved our margin from 13.3% in 2007 to 13.9% in 2009. We also dramatically reduced our U.S. G&A cost structure, generating a $65 million benefit in 2009, which exceeded our $60 million target.Fourth, we continued investment in growth initiatives. During 2009, we continued to invest in future growth through emerging concepts, developing countries and incremental sales layers. One example was our investment in breakfast. We tested breakfast in KFC in the U.K., as well as in Taco Bell in the U.S. In China, we expanded the number of units to serve breakfast and increased our breakfast hours. In our New York meeting, we highlighted the dramatic growth of our KFC France and KFC India businesses. We ended the year with new unit growth of 33% in France and 60% in India. We are nearing the 100-unit mark in these two countries, the point of which we have been able to scale our businesses in other markets. We grew in other developing countries as well. Almost 60% of our YRI new units were in developing countries in 2009. When you combine these results with our continued expansion in China, we are able to extend our global lead in growing developing economies.Next, I'd like to give you an update on refranchising. We continued to manage our business with the earned the right to own philosophy. When we don't see high growth or high returns, we offer refranchise units and hand them over to strong local operators. Refranchising brings greater stability to our earnings, reduces our capital and ultimately improves our returns. In 2009, we sold our KFC business in Taiwan to the Jardine Restaurant Group, one of our key franchise partners in Southeast Asia. In the U.S., we continued to make steady progress towards our goal of reducing U.S. company ownership to 10%. In 2009, we sold 541 units, exceeding our goal of 500 despite the challenges of a tight credit market. We made substantial progress at Pizza Hut, where we sold 427 units and reduced company ownership to 11%. In 2010, we expect to refranchise approximately 500 units in the U.S., mainly Pizza Huts and KFCs. In summary, we are proud of our teams for delivering in this environment. We have a demonstrated robust business model that delivered 13% EPS growth despite $45 million of foreign currency headwind. We raised our dividend by 11% and we improved our competitive position by investing in our future with new units, stronger brands and new sales layers.Now let's look ahead. In 2010, we do not expect a strong economic turn around and have built our plans accordingly. We are confident that we will deliver our target of at least 10% EPS growth. Here's why:  First, let's remember that international new unit development will remain a key driver of our growth. We expect to once again add 1,400 new units outside the U.S. in 2010. And as David mentioned, we expect international new units built in 2009 and 2010 to deliver about six points of EPS growth in 2010.Second, although it is especially difficult to predict sales right now, we do believe we are better prepared for a tough consumer environment than we were last year. First of all, we have another year of sales layer experience under our belt. For example, at YRI, we now have Krushers beverage line in over 1,500 stores in 25 countries. In China, KFC now offers delivery in 95 cities and has added protein variety with shrimp and beef as permanent menu items. At Taco Bell, in the U.S., we fortified our value position and continued product news around our Why Pay More value platform. We also have a strong pipeline of new products such as soft corn shell cantina tacos. Across all our Yum! businesses, we are focused on providing a stronger balance of innovation and value.Overall, we expect our first quarter sales to be below our normal growth rates and expect stronger growth in the back half of 2010. And yes, part of the reason for that is we lapped weaker results from the last half of 2009. Finally, we expect to see a tailwind from foreign currency translation, at least with the first half of 2010.For Yum!, our strength is coming from our three largest businesses: China, YRI and Taco Bell in the U.S. We believe that these businesses represent a powerful growth combination. In China, we have high return and rapid new unit development with excellent economics. At YRI, we have a multi-franchised business model with a strong track record for success that is poised to drive further growth around the globe. At Taco Bell in the U.S., we have a contemporary brand that is well positioned for sales layer growth.As David mentioned, we will continue down the steady path of refranchising at KFC and Pizza Hut. Once we complete our refranchising, we are confident that these brands combined will deliver at least as much profit as they did in 2009. Together, they will continue to deliver strong and steady cash flow for our shareholders.In summary, I am very proud of our financial results in 2009. I'm excited about our future as we fully expect to continue to generate consistent financial performance, global growth, strong free cash flow and substantial returns to shareholders in 2010 and beyond.

Brands, Inc.","Executives","Well first of all, I really think that the addition of the pasta and the wings has actually strengthened our U.S. business. Two years ago, we launched pasta and we had very strong sales with the pasta launch. As we went into 2009, we all know we faced a m",1467,"Well first of all, I really think that the addition of the pasta and the wings has actually strengthened our U.S. business. Two years ago, we launched pasta and we had very strong sales with the pasta launch. As we went into 2009, we all know we faced a much tougher economic environment. And what pasta really served for us in 2008 was almost like the launch of a major new pizza. And what we had difficulty doing in 2009 was overlapping the success of pasta, primarily because what the research tells us is that we're just more being value competitive. And so our pizza sales declined, and that typically happens in the Friday, Saturday, Sunday period of the week. And it was so clear, loud and clear, the reason why the decline is not because we are focused on pasta, because we had a mix of both pasta and pizza advertising, it was because we were uncompetitive. Consumers told us very clearly that we've got the pizza they want to eat but we were too premium priced and that we had to get more value competitive to win. So I think that as we go into 2010, the fact that we've won as a system, and I think our entire system has learned this, franchise, company together. We've learned that if you probably provide great competitive value, we can win. And what we're focused on doing is making sure that we provide that great competitive value on a pizza basis. And what we want to do is win the week indication with pizza. However, we also have an asset that's basically not being utilized during the week, and that's where we think we have the opportunity to drive incremental occasions with wings and pasta with Pizza Hut. So we think our strategy is right on the money. Last year, we did testing on how to deliver better value. We also did testing on both pizza or pasta and wings on how to make it more incremental for us and use our asset throughout the week, and you'll see that as we go into 2010. What we're really trying to do with Pizza Hut is change the game. Our business has basically been relatively flat from a sales perspective over the last decade. Our unit economics have been strong but we really haven't growing the business. And what we think we can do by being more value competitive on pizza, we can be more competitive, drive more pizza sales, and we can let them also leverage that asset throughout the week with pasta and wings. So we really think we've made substantial progress at Pizza Hut. And what we have now I think is a much better balance and understanding of how to drive pizza, which is more on the value front. And you will also see pizza innovation from us, which is what we're famous for and which we think we can get more premium pricing on. And in addition to driving pizza, we can leverage our new items, the pasta and wings to get incremental occasion during the week. The big thing in food services is can you stretch your brand and can you have credibility to go into new segments? Without question, Pizza Hut can clearly go into pasta. And wings is a basic add-on in almost every pizza chain in the United States because it just goes with pizza. So there are things that people see totally sink up to the pizza occasion. And we think that what we're trying to do with our business is -- we've had our biggest asset is that we've got 35,000 assets that are underutilized. And it's because we primarily just been focusing on one thing and one daypart. And our biggest opportunity is to take these brands and leverage our assets throughout the weeks and give consumers more meaningful variety. And there's no doubt in our mind that we are on the right track. Pizza Hut in China, for example, added significantly 30% more menu items to really compete in casual dining. And we saw a significant turnaround not only in terms of our same-store sales but also in terms of our margins improved as well. So if you're going to be casual dining, which by the way, Pizza Hut is the number one casual dining chain in the world and particularly outside the United States, it's the number one casual dining chain. If you're going to compete on casual dining, you have to provide variety. And our customers, they want to have pizza, they want to have pasta, they want to have chickens, they want to have salads. If you come in, just sit down, they want to be able to have some coffee and beverages, and they want to have desserts, and we've got that asset sitting there with the back of the house that certainly has a room to provide them, and we want to be the number one casual dining chain. And you're not going to be that by just selling pizza. So Mitch, we could not be more convinced that we are hunting in the right territory and we're moving in the right direction on Pizza Hut. And one of our big advantages with KFC is that we can stretch the brand. In the United States, we're primarily known as Kentucky Fried Chicken. Outside the United States, we're known as KFC. Just like McDonald's, McDonald's might have started out as McDonald's hamburgers. But outside the United States and inside the United States, they're McDonald's today. And they've been able to stretch that brand into eight different product categories, leveraging their assets throughout the day. That's our strategy. We think we can stretch KFC. It's easier to do it outside the United States because we don't stand so much for Kentucky Fried Chicken. In fact, our KFC business was built more with portable sandwiches, more a much bigger business, has much less focus on chicken-on-the-bone. And there's none of them that's closer to the egg than KFC. So if anybody ought to be able to do a breakfast, it ought to be KFC. And that's basically an opportunity that we think we can tap into. And by the way, our most successful business in the world is KFC in China. And KFC in China has taken the approach that we can do chicken, we can do beef, we can do fish, we can do breakfast, we can do beverages. That's the same approach that McDonald's is taking. And I think the fact that we have been preemptive and proactive in doing that in China has been a big competitive advantage for us. It's why we've got $1.4 million average unit volumes in China. It's why we're sitting there saying, we're like McDonald's is in United States and China is why we think we can have so many restaurants in China one day because right here, because McDonald's has leveraged this asset, they've got 14,000 restaurants in the United States. That's only with 300 million people. So 20-20, there's going to be 500 million in the middle class in China. We're going to have an asset that's going to leveraged. We're going to have higher sales. McDonald's has over $2 million average unit volumes in the United States. We've got plenty of runway for same-store sales with KFC, we're only at 1.4 million. Breakfast is only 5% of our mix right now. I mean, but the big thing that we're doing is, we're leveraging the power of our brands. We're leveraging the power that we have in these assets, and we're putting these building blocks in place. And yes, it's hard to see that right now in terms of the same-store sales growth that we're getting. But let's face it, this economy has not exactly been booming, but our strategy for the long term is so right on, it's unbelievable. So we are very excited about where we're at. I'm Sorry, I am going on  this, but this is why I'm talking to people about every single day. I mean, this is like we got opportunity, we got to go out with. I would be worried if we had all these categories and we've already done all these things, and we already had breakfast, and we already had late night. And we're not even open in some markets late. So we've got a big opportunity and we're all over it. And we can perform even in tough economies like we've just had last year and deliver. But the main thing is we're working on a long-term strategy here to leverage these assets, leverage our brands, use our assets throughout the say, get those sales up, improve our unit economics and just keep growing."

The same-store sales were up 3% in low export markets, while high export markets were basically down 5%. So what we're doing basically is we're focusing on developing in low-export markets in the Central and the Western parts of the country. I think there's some increased competition in Chinese QSR and catering service, particularly in the Tier 1 cities. I also remember, Yum! is in 650 cities, and where there really in the vast majority of those cities, we're the only quick-service restaurant there. So we don't know exactly when the Chinese consumer will come all the way back but when they do come back, we're better positioned for any kind of rebound than any other competitor due to our footprint in China. So that's basically all I can give you on that. As it relates Taco Bell, we are very pumped up about what's going on. Taco Bell, our value image, it's definitely been strengthened. In January, we had $0.89 value message out there in tandem with our Fresco advertising. The consumer today recognizes that no one gives you more value. And that perception is stronger today than it's ever been which bodes well in this climate. What we did with Fresco as we took the offense on nutrition because we think its important for the long-term to make sure that we communicate the fact that we've got a balanced options out there for our customer. We did that through the launch of the Drive-Thru Diet, which was featured and talked about on the Today Show just a couple of days ago where we got good mention on that. Our Fresco transactions will be and are climbing and we think it will be a sizable move for us over time. I think about when you look at Taco Bell, the reason why we're confident is that we do have this value image. Right now, we're continuing our $0.89 products, which give you a ton of food for $0.89, it's delicious. And we've got the best pipeline coming up that we've had in a long time. And longer term, our breakfast program continues to be promising. We plan to expand into more test markets this year. We're hopeful for a national launch of breakfast in 2011. And we have extremely good margins. Our margins are very healthy which allows us to grow new units. We had net new unit development last year. We think we have the potential to go from over 5,200 units to Burger King levels of over 7,500 units over time. And as we had breakfast, continue to develop new beverages, we think that that's going to strengthen our unit economics over time as well to facilitate that. And our goal is to -- we're already the second most profitable brand in the U.S. and our goal is to leverage our assets like McDonald's has done ultimately 24 hours a day. I'm thinking last year, we, and the fourth quarter was no exception, you had a very tight, tough economy and everybody offering all kinds of value. We're very placed that when you look at the consumer research today, we improved our value proposition in that environment. And we know that our brand is charismatic. We know we got tremendous upside in stretch so we're very optimistic that we can have a good year, another very good year, at Taco Bell."

And I think this team has done a really good job at that. The way we look at capital, you probably notice. But for some of the others, we don't have a fixed number in the year, right? So we have a plan for China. If China can build more units, we don't turn them off. We could keep going. Similarly, if somebody else is not getting the returns that they need to get on new units, we will shut them off. They don't get to sort of spend their plant.

And then the third thing that we've been working that's been something that we've need to put more focus on and Roger Eaton, and the team in addition to launching Kentucky Grilled, in addition to attacking value, is to provide more reliable service. So we've increased our investment in operations by having more franchise coverage. We've increased our store level operational audits mark.

And certainly, not everybody enjoys seeing their operating performance racked and stacked, public-ed and published. And not everybody enjoys at-store audits, where you go in and you know that you can improve things. Now our best franchisees, they're cheering us on. They're saying, go get them, go get it. Let's build this system together. They're cheering us on. But these are tough issues that Roger Eaton and the team are working with our best franchisees to address. They're not popular with some of our franchisees. But I think the bulk of our franchisees know that it's important and that it's necessary. But running the KFC system is not for the fainthearted. The marketing control is owned by the franchisees. It takes tough-minded leadership to make meaningful progress. And our leadership, which by the way is some of the best leaders we have anywhere in the world and people I admire as much as I admire anybody in our company -- they know that winning in business is not about winning a popularity contest. What we are trying to do is win the hearts and minds of our customers and I'm confident that we have the know-how and more importantly, the perseverance to get this done. We want to be so proud of KFC in the United States. We want to be so proud. We want to be KFC in the United States to be like it is in Australia and the U.K. and we've even had significant progress in Japan which is a very, very immature and tough market. We want to have our chest pumping at KFC and I think the things that we're working on Mark, they're very tough issues to work through with any franchise system, but it's the way how you turn the business around for the good. And I couldn't be more proud of the KFC team and the franchisees that are supporting us in this effort."

They have good relationships with their lenders, good relationships with their banks and they have good balance sheets. And that's where the deals are getting done. We're also bringing in new franchisees where they obviously -- to us they've gone through the process and we believe that they're going to be really great operators and they also have financing capabilities.

And in terms of 2009, I'll just repeat, even though same-store sales bounced around a little bit, we just sort felt the consumer was pretty level the whole time. It was bad and they never -- you had months when it looks better, worse, et cetera. But I would just sort of categories at least from our perspective, John, is the consumer was pretty much down a bit all year in 2009. I don't think we're going to get a good read, as we sort of said earlier, until after the Chinese New Year. And that's because Chinese New Year overall is always very event-driven and it's a little bit like Christmas in the U.S. You'll have some types of people who'll spend in holidays and they'll not spend in non-holiday period. So when we get into our second quarter, which is sort of starting at March in China, that's when we'll really have bad on bad [ph] economic numbers. Again, the economy in China started weakening really around the December time frame. But if you look at some of the measures around consumer confidence, et cetera, they really bottomed out really in the first quarter of 2009. So it will be interesting for us to see what happens when we sort of lap with the bad economy and we get the noise out of the Chinese New Year.

So we can have $2 million average unit volumes at KFC over time. We can have $2 million average unit volumes at Pizza Hut over time as we become even more dominant in casual dining. So to me, what do you have? What do you have with KFC and Pizza Hut in China? I think we have two consumer brands everybody wishes they had, with unbelievable sales and unbelievable unit economics. And I think we have a tremendous return that allows us to continue to grow with lots of confidence. And that's the real name in the game for us, it's to take advantage of the new unit, and the development opportunity and grow KFC into well over 10,000 units and grow Pizza Hut as well.

Year-over-year consumer confidence is down. It's starting to show year-over-year improvement. It looks like it. So that's a good sign.

So a couple of one-sy, two-sy types of issues, but for the most part very solid on Pizza Hut side. And in general, the large franchisees, we haven't seen problems."

Anything significant, of course, you'd have to worry about. I don't have a sort of a firm number in my head.

As we continue to execute against our global opportunities, our business model will increasingly be driven by China, Yum! Restaurants International and Taco Bell in the U.S. The restructuring of Pizza Hut and KFC in the U.S. continues, and this will ultimately improve our turns, as well as the stability and predictability of the cash flow in the U.S. business. We are very focused, very, very focused on addressing the strategic challenges of both those brands that we expect will ultimately provide upside from a profit perspective from our position that we have today. Overall, we believe that the execution of our strategies will lead us to a business model that will enable us to continue our track record of consistent performance and achieving at least 10% EPS growth each year. For 2010, we believe that all of our businesses are better off and better prepared to drive sales as the global consumer comes out as what you might characterize as a hunkered down mode. Importantly, keep in mind that more than half of our EPS growth will be driven by new units built last year and units to be opened in the next several months. In China, our business is well positioned for continued growth with its substantial infrastructure advantages, the strong brand positions I've talked about, the new unit investment returns that are as good as ever. So we are in the right place at the right time with the right brands. Yum! Restaurants International continues to drive solid growth each year and build its future runway for growth based on the strength of its broad geography, being in over 110 countries. We've got an extensive franchise growth machine and a leading position in emerging markets around the world. And in particular, we're very excited about what's going on in India and France as we highlighted at the annual conference. Finally, in the United States, we are making progress towards positioning Taco Bell as a significant growth engine, driven by both an increase in our average unit volumes, as well as the new unit growth that we expect to drive over time. With all this in mind, we continue to expect EPS growth of at least 10% for 2010, which would mark the ninth consecutive year we would meet our annual target of 10% growth. And we are confident that we will continue to build the value of our company not only in 2010 but well beyond. It's a great business and we love running it and building it and thanks for being on the call and I look forward now to talking to our employees around the world.

Given the tough macro environment, I'm especially pleased to announce that 2009 was another strong year of performance as we continue our quest to make Yum! Brands the defining global company that feeds the world.",1997,"Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everybody. Given the tough macro environment, I'm especially pleased to announce that 2009 was another strong year of performance as we continue our quest to make Yum! Brands the defining global company that feeds the world. We reported 13% EPS growth, marking the eighth straight year that we exceeded our annual target of at least 10% and achieved at least 13%. As I look back on the year, I'm really proud of what we accomplish in 2009. In a very tough year, we opened over 1,400 new restaurants outside the United States while making major progress on our incremental sales layers in each of our businesses. We improved our worldwide restaurant margins by 1.7 percentage points and operating profit grew by 9% prior to foreign currency translation. Importantly, we maintained our return on invested capital of 20% and continued to be an industry leader.In China, we grew our profits by a whopping 25% in 2009 on top of 28% in 2008. That's over 50% growth in two years. The good news is that we achieved these impressive results even though our same-store sales were slightly negative, as the consumer has lagged the recent economic trends. We added a record 509 new units and now have nearly 3,500 restaurants. KFC added 428 new locations and made progress adding home delivery and building breakfast. Pizza Hut Casual Dining added 55 new locations and is generating positive same-store sales results by adding a wide variety of appetizers, beverages, entrées and desserts. We also made progress with our two newest brands, Pizza Hut Home Service and East Dawning. Overall, 2009 was another great year of growth for our China business.Next, Yum! Restaurants International continues to produce solid results with 5% system sales and profit growth excluding foreign currency translation. Driven by our franchisee development machine, we opened nearly 900 new units in over 75 countries. Our strong network of around 1,000 franchisees opened over 90% of these new units. Importantly, we made major progress creating new growth vehicles by investing in France, India and Russia, and beginning to develop Taco Bell into a truly global brand. Yum! Restaurants International made significant progress on sales layers as well. KFC aggressively expanded our Krushers line of frozen beverages to over 1,500 units in over 25 countries, up from around 100 units in seven countries at the beginning of the year. Pizza Hut is following China's successful strategy of offering more casual dining variety.In the United States, Taco Bell delivered solid margin and profit growth, which was offset by weak performance of KFC and Pizza Hut. We continue to invest in and expand our sales layers even though the benefit of these efforts was not yet visible in our same-store sales performance. Taco Bell has fortified its value positioning and has a full arsenal of news ready for 2010. I am very optimistic we will have another good year at Taco Bell.Pizza Hut has recently addressed its biggest problem, value with the successfully tested $10 Anyway You Want It everyday promotion launched in earlier this year. KFC made an important long-term investment by adding Kentucky Grilled Chicken, providing a balanced option and eliminating the veto vote. All in all, the U.S. business generated significant margin improvement in a challenged sales environment that led to weaker-than-expected 2009 profit growth of 1%. And importantly, each U.S. brand goes into 2010 better prepared to beat year ago.For those of you that missed our annual investor  update meeting, we showcased our largest resources and profit: China, Yum! Restaurants international and Taco Bell U.S. These three businesses together generate 85% of our worldwide profits and will be the key drivers of our future growth. Now I'd like to thank all of you who attended for the positive feedback from that meeting, but I would like to address two of the biggest questions we have been asked since then. First, is Yum!'s weak same-store sales performance in Mainland China an early indicator that something is wrong with the business, or that Yum! is growing too fast? We believe the answer to the question is definitively no. First, let's look at 2009 and put the facts into perspective. We added over 500 new restaurants, we held our transactions flat for the year, and we have near-record restaurant level margins of 20%. Yes, same-store sales did decline 1%. Considering that, like I said earlier, we still grew our profits 25% on top of 28% growth in 2008. All in what most would call an off year for the Chinese consumer. Now as problems go, I'll take it. For a little more perspective, let me step back in 2005, a year where we saw same-store sales declined 3%. That year, we opened 379 new restaurants and made $211 million. Now I remember some people question our pace of development and the state of our business as a result of our negative same-store sales. Since 2005, we have added over 1,800 restaurants and have tripled our profits to over $600 million. We now have $1.4 million average unit volumes at KFC, with margins of over 20% and $1.2 million average unit volumes at Pizza Hut with margins of 19%. Our foundation for growth has never been stronger. Today, just like in 2005, China is and is predicted to be the fastest-growing major economy in the world. In fact, it's expected to grow its middle class from around 300 million today to 500 million to 2020. Like I said in the past, we will no doubt have some bumpy years. Unquestionably, we will have some ups and downs in China, but I wouldn't trade our position in China with any consumer company.Well, that's enough history. Suffice it to say, we still believe China holds great potential, and we're clearly in the early innings of building our business in this massive and growing economy. Having said this, we constantly, and I mean constantly, monitor our returns and are committed to never building ahead of our people capability and unit economics. Our goal is to build a quality long-term business, and that's exactly what we're going to do.Next, while investors seem to understand our long-term growth strategy around our three largest businesses, China, Yum! Restaurants International and Taco Bell U.S., they are asking, what are we doing to manage the short-term downside risks from our Pizza Hut and KFC U.S. brands? This is more than a fair question because we made the conscious decision to not even cover Pizza Hut and KFC U.S. at the December Analyst Meeting, as they represent only 15% of our Yum! worldwide profit. Instead, we intentionally chose to highlight the 85% of our profits generated in China, Yum! Restaurants International and Taco Bell U.S. And particularly, we wanted to drive home the fact that Taco Bell is our big U.S. growth engine, accounting for over 60% of our U.S. profits and is a net grower of new units with lots of potential. That said, I want you to know that we are absolutely passionate about addressing the challenges of both Pizza Hut and KFC in turning around those businesses.At Pizza Hut, our long-term strategy is to transform the brand from pizza to pizza, pasta and wings. However, our biggest short-term issue is the need to shore up and grow our pizza sales. Here, the consumer has told us that frankly that we are simply too expensive. Basically, they are saying, we love your pizza, we are America's favorite pizza but I can't afford you. Well, going into 2010, the vast majority of our system has responded by making carryout pricing more competitive and we have rolled out our successfully tested $10 Anyway You Want It promotion. We are pleased to say we have already seen a dramatic improvement in sales and traffic.More importantly, our system has seen the power of  being value competitive, and we will continue to focus on everyday value throughout the year. We also have more successfully tested value initiatives in our pipeline, along with premium pizza innovation that will command premium pricing. Simultaneously, we have successfully tested and will be rolling out new ways to drive incremental occasions with pasta and wings. Pizza Hut is also focused on improving the speed of service and executing its Heart of the Hut program designed to improve hospitality. With these strategies and programs under way, we are confident that Pizza Hut will have a much better year in 2010.Now KFC, there's no question, we have our work cut out for us. However, we have an absolutely great leadership team addressing issues our customers have been asking us to do for a long time. First, our customers have been telling us that we need to offer more balanced choices. And our answer here is Kentucky Grilled Chicken. This product receives rave reviews and represents around one quarter of our chicken-on-the-bone business. And the fact is, we hate to think of where we would be without it. In 2010, we will have more new product news and we'll be able to serve consumers Kentucky Grilled Chicken and our world famous Original Recipe Chicken. We no longer have the fried veto vote because we now are the only brand to offer real chicken-on-the-bone choice.Second, our KFC customers have told us we need to give them more value. So in 2009, for the first time in our history, we launched a nationwide value menu. We also brought the value message to our Kentucky Grilled Chicken launch with our $3.99 two-piece meals. Offering everyday value will continue to play a critical role in moving this brand forward in 2010.Third, our customers have asked us to improve our operations, particularly around product availability and speed of service. So we have actively pursued raising our standards, raising our game by aggressively pushing for higher standards by investing in more franchise field support, increasing operational audits and racking and stacking and publishing performance in our system, a tool used by all great operating companies. So in 2010, KFC is better prepared to offer the consumer more choice, better value and better service. But like I said, we have more to do. Our goal is to stay focused on building the business back the right way, and we are confident you will see steady progress. But I want to be clear, we have not yet turned the corner and we expect KFC sales will be tough in the first half.Now from a financial standpoint, remember, we are in the midst of a multi-year program to reduce our company ownership to around 5% from 21% ownership at Pizza Hut and 18% at KFC at the end of 2007. This will give us an even more significant and more predictable stream of franchise revenue. And simply by reducing the G&A from company operations, we expect to generate at least as much profit with no capital expenditure by putting these restaurants in the hands of our good franchise operators.When you look at all our efforts, we're confident our U.S. business is heading towards more reliable and a more predictable earnings and cash flow. So in 2010, here is what we expect our divisions to deliver. China will grow profits by 15%. Yum! Restaurants International will grow profits by 10%. The U.S. business will grow profits by 5%. These are all reasonable targets and not a stretch from our perspective.Now remember, international unit development of about 1,400 new units from China and Yum! Restaurants International drive six percentage points of our EPS growth. We expect the balance of our growth to come from our base business through overall global same-store sales growth of 2%, productivity initiatives and G&A leverage, along with an expected benefit from foreign currency translation. When you add it up, we intend to extend our track record to nine consecutive years of meeting or exceeding our target of at least 10% EPS growth. Now let me turn it over to Rick Carucci, our Chief Financial Officer."

In this section of our call, I'm going to comment on our key themes from our 2009 results, as well as our outlook for 2010.Yum! had another successful year in 2009. We grew earnings per share by 13% and for the first time achieved over $1 billion of net income. I would like to provide some context for our 2009 results around the following four themes: Continued strong international new unit development, weaker-than-usual sales, strong productivity gains and continued investment in growth initiatives. So I'll start with the first one, strong international development. We had a record year of development in China and another strong year of YRI franchise-led development. Our 2009 results again demonstrated that international new unit development is a significant and proven driver of Yum!'s profit growth.Second, weaker than usual sales. Our sales results were below our targets, as a globally weak consumer environment led to lower ticket averages. We had an especially weak second half of the year in 2009. There were some pockets of strength: Our U.K. business, YRI developing markets such as India and Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China, to name a few.Third, let's talk about productivity. Hats off to our teams in China and Taco Bell in the U.S. who drove substantial margin improvement in 2009. Both China and the U.S. saw dramatic commodity inflation in 2008 followed by deflation in 2009. For the China division, the 1.8 point increase in restaurant margin during 2009 more than offset the margin decrease in 2008 despite net commodity inflation of $17 million over the past two years. In the U.S., total net commodity inflation over the past two years has been about $90 million. During this time, we improved our margin from 13.3% in 2007 to 13.9% in 2009. We also dramatically reduced our U.S. G&A cost structure, generating a $65 million benefit in 2009, which exceeded our $60 million target.Fourth, we continued investment in growth initiatives. During 2009, we continued to invest in future growth through emerging concepts, developing countries and incremental sales layers. One example was our investment in breakfast. We tested breakfast in KFC in the U.K., as well as in Taco Bell in the U.S. In China, we expanded the number of units to serve breakfast and increased our breakfast hours. In our New York meeting, we highlighted the dramatic growth of our KFC France and KFC India businesses. We ended the year with new unit growth of 33% in France and 60% in India. We are nearing the 100-unit mark in these two countries, the point of which we have been able to scale our businesses in other markets. We grew in other developing countries as well. Almost 60% of our YRI new units were in developing countries in 2009. When you combine these results with our continued expansion in China, we are able to extend our global lead in growing developing economies.Next, I'd like to give you an update on refranchising. We continued to manage our business with the earned the right to own philosophy. When we don't see high growth or high returns, we offer refranchise units and hand them over to strong local operators. Refranchising brings greater stability to our earnings, reduces our capital and ultimately improves our returns. In 2009, we sold our KFC business in Taiwan to the Jardine Restaurant Group, one of our key franchise partners in Southeast Asia. In the U.S., we continued to make steady progress towards our goal of reducing U.S. company ownership to 10%. In 2009, we sold 541 units, exceeding our goal of 500 despite the challenges of a tight credit market. We made substantial progress at Pizza Hut, where we sold 427 units and reduced company ownership to 11%. In 2010, we expect to refranchise approximately 500 units in the U.S., mainly Pizza Huts and KFCs. In summary, we are proud of our teams for delivering in this environment. We have a demonstrated robust business model that delivered 13% EPS growth despite $45 million of foreign currency headwind. We raised our dividend by 11% and we improved our competitive position by investing in our future with new units, stronger brands and new sales layers.Now let's look ahead. In 2010, we do not expect a strong economic turn around and have built our plans accordingly. We are confident that we will deliver our target of at least 10% EPS growth. Here's why:  First, let's remember that international new unit development will remain a key driver of our growth. We expect to once again add 1,400 new units outside the U.S. in 2010. And as David mentioned, we expect international new units built in 2009 and 2010 to deliver about six points of EPS growth in 2010.Second, although it is especially difficult to predict sales right now, we do believe we are better prepared for a tough consumer environment than we were last year. First of all, we have another year of sales layer experience under our belt. For example, at YRI, we now have Krushers beverage line in over 1,500 stores in 25 countries. In China, KFC now offers delivery in 95 cities and has added protein variety with shrimp and beef as permanent menu items. At Taco Bell, in the U.S., we fortified our value position and continued product news around our Why Pay More value platform. We also have a strong pipeline of new products such as soft corn shell cantina tacos. Across all our Yum! businesses, we are focused on providing a stronger balance of innovation and value.Overall, we expect our first quarter sales to be below our normal growth rates and expect stronger growth in the back half of 2010. And yes, part of the reason for that is we lapped weaker results from the last half of 2009. Finally, we expect to see a tailwind from foreign currency translation, at least with the first half of 2010.For Yum!, our strength is coming from our three largest businesses: China, YRI and Taco Bell in the U.S. We believe that these businesses represent a powerful growth combination. In China, we have high return and rapid new unit development with excellent economics. At YRI, we have a multi-franchised business model with a strong track record for success that is poised to drive further growth around the globe. At Taco Bell in the U.S., we have a contemporary brand that is well positioned for sales layer growth.As David mentioned, we will continue down the steady path of refranchising at KFC and Pizza Hut. Once we complete our refranchising, we are confident that these brands combined will deliver at least as much profit as they did in 2009. Together, they will continue to deliver strong and steady cash flow for our shareholders.In summary, I am very proud of our financial results in 2009. I'm excited about our future as we fully expect to continue to generate consistent financial performance, global growth, strong free cash flow and substantial returns to shareholders in 2010 and beyond.

Two years ago, we launched pasta and we had very strong sales with the pasta launch. As we went into 2009, we all know we faced a much tougher economic environment. And what pasta really served for us in 2008 was almost like the launch of a major new pizza. And what we had difficulty doing in 2009 was overlapping the success of pasta, primarily because what the research tells us is that we're just more being value competitive. And so our pizza sales declined, and that typically happens in the Friday, Saturday, Sunday period of the week. And it was so clear, loud and clear, the reason why the decline is not because we are focused on pasta, because we had a mix of both pasta and pizza advertising, it was because we were uncompetitive. Consumers told us very clearly that we've got the pizza they want to eat but we were too premium priced and that we had to get more value competitive to win. So I think that as we go into 2010, the fact that we've won as a system, and I think our entire system has learned this, franchise, company together. We've learned that if you probably provide great competitive value, we can win. And what we're focused on doing is making sure that we provide that great competitive value on a pizza basis. And what we want to do is win the week indication with pizza. However, we also have an asset that's basically not being utilized during the week, and that's where we think we have the opportunity to drive incremental occasions with wings and pasta with Pizza Hut. So we think our strategy is right on the money. Last year, we did testing on how to deliver better value. We also did testing on both pizza or pasta and wings on how to make it more incremental for us and use our asset throughout the week, and you'll see that as we go into 2010. What we're really trying to do with Pizza Hut is change the game. Our business has basically been relatively flat from a sales perspective over the last decade. Our unit economics have been strong but we really haven't growing the business. And what we think we can do by being more value competitive on pizza, we can be more competitive, drive more pizza sales, and we can let them also leverage that asset throughout the week with pasta and wings. So we really think we've made substantial progress at Pizza Hut. And what we have now I think is a much better balance and understanding of how to drive pizza, which is more on the value front. And you will also see pizza innovation from us, which is what we're famous for and which we think we can get more premium pricing on. And in addition to driving pizza, we can leverage our new items, the pasta and wings to get incremental occasion during the week. The big thing in food services is can you stretch your brand and can you have credibility to go into new segments? Without question, Pizza Hut can clearly go into pasta. And wings is a basic add-on in almost every pizza chain in the United States because it just goes with pizza. So there are things that people see totally sink up to the pizza occasion. And we think that what we're trying to do with our business is -- we've had our biggest asset is that we've got 35,000 assets that are underutilized. And it's because we primarily just been focusing on one thing and one daypart. And our biggest opportunity is to take these brands and leverage our assets throughout the weeks and give consumers more meaningful variety. And there's no doubt in our mind that we are on the right track. Pizza Hut in China, for example, added significantly 30% more menu items to really compete in casual dining. And we saw a significant turnaround not only in terms of our same-store sales but also in terms of our margins improved as well. So if you're going to be casual dining, which by the way, Pizza Hut is the number one casual dining chain in the world and particularly outside the United States, it's the number one casual dining chain. If you're going to compete on casual dining, you have to provide variety. And our customers, they want to have pizza, they want to have pasta, they want to have chickens, they want to have salads. If you come in, just sit down, they want to be able to have some coffee and beverages, and they want to have desserts, and we've got that asset sitting there with the back of the house that certainly has a room to provide them, and we want to be the number one casual dining chain. And you're not going to be that by just selling pizza. So Mitch, we could not be more convinced that we are hunting in the right territory and we're moving in the right direction on Pizza Hut. And one of our big advantages with KFC is that we can stretch the brand. In the United States, we're primarily known as Kentucky Fried Chicken. Outside the United States, we're known as KFC. Just like McDonald's, McDonald's might have started out as McDonald's hamburgers. But outside the United States and inside the United States, they're McDonald's today. And they've been able to stretch that brand into eight different product categories, leveraging their assets throughout the day. That's our strategy. We think we can stretch KFC. It's easier to do it outside the United States because we don't stand so much for Kentucky Fried Chicken. In fact, our KFC business was built more with portable sandwiches, more a much bigger business, has much less focus on chicken-on-the-bone. And there's none of them that's closer to the egg than KFC. So if anybody ought to be able to do a breakfast, it ought to be KFC. And that's basically an opportunity that we think we can tap into. And by the way, our most successful business in the world is KFC in China. And KFC in China has taken the approach that we can do chicken, we can do beef, we can do fish, we can do breakfast, we can do beverages. That's the same approach that McDonald's is taking. And I think the fact that we have been preemptive and proactive in doing that in China has been a big competitive advantage for us. It's why we've got $1.4 million average unit volumes in China. It's why we're sitting there saying, we're like McDonald's is in United States and China is why we think we can have so many restaurants in China one day because right here, because McDonald's has leveraged this asset, they've got 14,000 restaurants in the United States. That's only with 300 million people. So 20-20, there's going to be 500 million in the middle class in China. We're going to have an asset that's going to leveraged. We're going to have higher sales. McDonald's has over $2 million average unit volumes in the United States. We've got plenty of runway for same-store sales with KFC, we're only at 1.4 million. Breakfast is only 5% of our mix right now. I mean, but the big thing that we're doing is, we're leveraging the power of our brands. We're leveraging the power that we have in these assets, and we're putting these building blocks in place. And yes, it's hard to see that right now in terms of the same-store sales growth that we're getting. But let's face it, this economy has not exactly been booming, but our strategy for the long term is so right on, it's unbelievable. So we are very excited about where we're at. I'm Sorry, I am going on  this, but this is why I'm talking to people about every single day. I mean, this is like we got opportunity, we got to go out with. I would be worried if we had all these categories and we've already done all these things, and we already had breakfast, and we already had late night. And we're not even open in some markets late. So we've got a big opportunity and we're all over it. And we can perform even in tough economies like we've just had last year and deliver. But the main thing is we're working on a long-term strategy here to leverage these assets, leverage our brands, use our assets throughout the say, get those sales up, improve our unit economics and just keep growing."

The same-store sales were up 3% in low export markets, while high export markets were basically down 5%. So what we're doing basically is we're focusing on developing in low-export markets in the Central and the Western parts of the country. I think there's some increased competition in Chinese QSR and catering service, particularly in the Tier 1 cities. I also remember, Yum! is in 650 cities, and where there really in the vast majority of those cities, we're the only quick-service restaurant there. So we don't know exactly when the Chinese consumer will come all the way back but when they do come back, we're better positioned for any kind of rebound than any other competitor due to our footprint in China. So that's basically all I can give you on that. As it relates Taco Bell, we are very pumped up about what's going on. Taco Bell, our value image, it's definitely been strengthened. In January, we had $0.89 value message out there in tandem with our Fresco advertising. The consumer today recognizes that no one gives you more value. And that perception is stronger today than it's ever been which bodes well in this climate. What we did with Fresco as we took the offense on nutrition because we think its important for the long-term to make sure that we communicate the fact that we've got a balanced options out there for our customer. We did that through the launch of the Drive-Thru Diet, which was featured and talked about on the Today Show just a couple of days ago where we got good mention on that. Our Fresco transactions will be and are climbing and we think it will be a sizable move for us over time. I think about when you look at Taco Bell, the reason why we're confident is that we do have this value image. Right now, we're continuing our $0.89 products, which give you a ton of food for $0.89, it's delicious. And we've got the best pipeline coming up that we've had in a long time. And longer term, our breakfast program continues to be promising. We plan to expand into more test markets this year. We're hopeful for a national launch of breakfast in 2011. And we have extremely good margins. Our margins are very healthy which allows us to grow new units. We had net new unit development last year. We think we have the potential to go from over 5,200 units to Burger King levels of over 7,500 units over time. And as we had breakfast, continue to develop new beverages, we think that that's going to strengthen our unit economics over time as well to facilitate that. And our goal is to -- we're already the second most profitable brand in the U.S. and our goal is to leverage our assets like McDonald's has done ultimately 24 hours a day. I'm thinking last year, we, and the fourth quarter was no exception, you had a very tight, tough economy and everybody offering all kinds of value. We're very placed that when you look at the consumer research today, we improved our value proposition in that environment. And we know that our brand is charismatic. We know we got tremendous upside in stretch so we're very optimistic that we can have a good year, another very good year, at Taco Bell."

What we said is we believe that amount will be around $20 million and will offset any profit trade down from the rest of the refranchising program. So we think that net, the refranchising will be roughly neutral to profits in 2010 because of a G&A reduction in the area of about $20 million."

You obviously let returns dictate your investment from year-to-year and you've obviously been refranchising and investing heavily in China. But I wonder if there's something that you can do to be even more aggressive in repositioning your investment. For instance, could you do something more dramatic about lightening up your company store investments in the U.S. and YRI equity markets? Does it make sense to perhaps think more aggressively, take one-time charges perhaps even to truly remove the earnings risk from a KFC U.S. and equity exposure in the YRI division, where the margins are frustratingly not getting better quickly? And then conversely, maybe it makes sense to even step up investment in China through what could prove to be a trough period as the old Yum! did in the past with China."

And I think this team has done a really good job at that. The way we look at capital, you probably notice. But for some of the others, we don't have a fixed number in the year, right? So we have a plan for China. If China can build more units, we don't turn them off. We could keep going. Similarly, if somebody else is not getting the returns that they need to get on new units, we will shut them off. They don't get to sort of spend their plant. So we try to be very disciplined on those decisions. Similar on the refranchising, and then you saw an example of that where we sold the Taiwan business this year. We'll always look at those opportunities and we'll continue to do that on a go-forward basis. We put a lot of attention about making sure we're investing in places that could get high-growth and high returns and similarly, pairing things back when we don't.

And I think one of the things that we've been doing at KFC is we've been addressing three issues that the KFC system has really avoided too long: Attacking the fried veto vote by offering customers choice of Kentucky Grilled Chicken, attacking our value problem, which is driven primarily by two high up local pricing, which our franchisees control but we do have a national value menu for the first time in our history; we also had very good pricing on Kentucky Grilled Chicken last year with our two-piece meal at $3.99. And then the third thing that we've been working that's been something that we've need to put more focus on and Roger Eaton, and the team in addition to launching Kentucky Grilled, in addition to attacking value, is to provide more reliable service. So we've increased our investment in operations by having more franchise coverage. We've increased our store level operational audits mark. We really started racking and stacking performance of our operators. And once we get good performance, we raise the standard. So we're constantly raising the bar on our performance. These are very tough issues. Not everybody, many of our more progressive franchisees have, but not everybody wanted to launch a grilled product. Not everybody wanted to do a value menu, but we did one. Not everybody wanted to do $3.99 for the two-piece meal but we did it. These were tough things. And certainly, not everybody enjoys seeing their operating performance racked and stacked, public-ed and published. And not everybody enjoys at-store audits, where you go in and you know that you can improve things. Now our best franchisees, they're cheering us on. They're saying, go get them, go get it. Let's build this system together. They're cheering us on. But these are tough issues that Roger Eaton and the team are working with our best franchisees to address. They're not popular with some of our franchisees. But I think the bulk of our franchisees know that it's important and that it's necessary. But running the KFC system is not for the fainthearted. The marketing control is owned by the franchisees. It takes tough-minded leadership to make meaningful progress. And our leadership, which by the way is some of the best leaders we have anywhere in the world and people I admire as much as I admire anybody in our company -- they know that winning in business is not about winning a popularity contest. What we are trying to do is win the hearts and minds of our customers and I'm confident that we have the know-how and more importantly, the perseverance to get this done. We want to be so proud of KFC in the United States. We want to be so proud. We want to be KFC in the United States to be like it is in Australia and the U.K. and we've even had significant progress in Japan which is a very, very immature and tough market. We want to have our chest pumping at KFC and I think the things that we're working on Mark, they're very tough issues to work through with any franchise system, but it's the way how you turn the business around for the good. And I couldn't be more proud of the KFC team and the franchisees that are supporting us in this effort."

But I would just sort of categories at least from our perspective, John, is the consumer was pretty much down a bit all year in 2009. I don't think we're going to get a good read, as we sort of said earlier, until after the Chinese New Year. And that's because Chinese New Year overall is always very event-driven and it's a little bit like Christmas in the U.S. You'll have some types of people who'll spend in holidays and they'll not spend in non-holiday period.

Again, I would say there's some analogies between what's happened in China GDP and in the U.S. A lot of their GDP growth is based on their government stimulus. A lot of that was incentives for people to buy specific goods and people went and did that. And I started to say similar to the U.S. but they didn't buy as much stuff that wasn't being offered an incentive. So if you look at the listed economic growth in the fourth quarter in the U.S,  [indiscernible] never greater than 5%. It didn't feel like a 5% from a consumer standpoint and I think you have the same thing right now happening in China. So we're going to look at broader measures and obviously, we're a pretty good bellwether because we're everywhere in China. So I think, well, we may see it before you see it in all the measures combined, anyway."

The only thing is, when you look at the Chinese economy, fundamentally, it's one of the strongest in the world. So it's just a matter of when it's going to come back. We feel pretty confident that it will. The amazing thing is, and Rick said, is that we follow the consumer confidence index, that's one we think is a pretty decent indicator. The amazing part about that is in the fourth quarter of this year, it was still down versus last year. We look at fourth quarter '09 versus fourth quarter '08. Year-over-year consumer confidence is down. It's starting to show year-over-year improvement. It looks like it. So that's a good sign. The export growth or exports turn from pretty negative most of the year to positive. So only in December. And there's a lot of people saying that's going to continue, which will definitely be good. And then also, we actually did see some improvement, as David gave you earlier the break in some of the segments of the market, that divergence between Central and West and export markets actually narrowed as the year progressed. So there's plenty of signs pointing in the right direction. It's just going to be a matter of time. And also, the Chinese consumer has always been a big saver. We all know that. We probably are a little bit more cautious. But like you said, all these signs are pointing in the right direction."

As we continue to execute against our global opportunities, our business model will increasingly be driven by China, Yum! Restaurants International and Taco Bell in the U.S. The restructuring of Pizza Hut and KFC in the U.S. continues, and this will ultimately improve our turns, as well as the stability and predictability of the cash flow in the U.S. business. We are very focused, very, very focused on addressing the strategic challenges of both those brands that we expect will ultimately provide upside from a profit perspective from our position that we have today. Overall, we believe that the execution of our strategies will lead us to a business model that will enable us to continue our track record of consistent performance and achieving at least 10% EPS growth each year. For 2010, we believe that all of our businesses are better off and better prepared to drive sales as the global consumer comes out as what you might characterize as a hunkered down mode. Importantly, keep in mind that more than half of our EPS growth will be driven by new units built last year and units to be opened in the next several months. In China, our business is well positioned for continued growth with its substantial infrastructure advantages, the strong brand positions I've talked about, the new unit investment returns that are as good as ever. So we are in the right place at the right time with the right brands. Yum! Restaurants International continues to drive solid growth each year and build its future runway for growth based on the strength of its broad geography, being in over 110 countries. We've got an extensive franchise growth machine and a leading position in emerging markets around the world. And in particular, we're very excited about what's going on in India and France as we highlighted at the annual conference. Finally, in the United States, we are making progress towards positioning Taco Bell as a significant growth engine, driven by both an increase in our average unit volumes, as well as the new unit growth that we expect to drive over time. With all this in mind, we continue to expect EPS growth of at least 10% for 2010, which would mark the ninth consecutive year we would meet our annual target of 10% growth. And we are confident that we will continue to build the value of our company not only in 2010 but well beyond. It's a great business and we love running it and building it and thanks for being on the call and I look forward now to talking to our employees around the world. We always have a talk to David call right after this and I can't wait to tell them about what's going on and convey the excitement that we have for 2010. Thank you very much."

Our first quarter worldwide ope",1530,"Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased that based on our strong first quarter performance, we are well on our way to achieving our ninth straight year of achieving our annual target of at least 10% EPS growth. Our first quarter worldwide operating profit grew by 17% and EPS increased 23%, before special items. We are particularly pleased with our business in China, which reported robust profit growth of 37%, driven by both strong unit development and same-store sales growth. In the United States, we were also pleased to see the significant sales improvement from the low point of the fourth quarter, particularly at Pizza Hut. However, U.S. profits were down 9% and same-store sales declined 1%.  At Yum! Restaurants International, we increased system sales by 1% and profits by 2% prior to foreign currency translation, primarily due to new unit development. While clearly, we have more work to do, overall, we were pleased with this start at 2010.Now let me take you through our key strategies and trends for each of our divisions. First, let's talk about China, where we continue to build leading brands in every significant restaurant category. We are particularly pleased with the performance in our China business. Same-store sales grew by 4% and units expanded 14%, while restaurant margins were at a record level of nearly 27%, all combined to generate robust profit growth of 37%. This is particularly impressive when you consider that we were lapping 30% profit growth in the first quarter of last year. New unit development continues to be the major driver of our growth, and we remain the largest U.S. retail developer in China. We opened up 96 new units this quarter, and our China new unit returns continue to be the best in our business. In terms of scale, we surpassed 3,500 units, strengthening our leading position in the world's largest growth market.KFC is our largest brand in China, with nearly 3,000 units in over 650 cities, with superior average unit volumes of $1.4 million per year. We are continuing to grow our business and leverage our assets. A key KFC initiative is delivery, which is now available in over 110 cities and nearly 1,000 units. This is proving to be a developing sales layer for us, now representing over 3% of sales. KFC breakfast is another way we are leveraging our assets, as we now have national distribution. KFC breakfast represents nearly 7% of transactions and continues to steadily grow. Importantly, KFC continues to build its leading image in China across key brand majors.Pizza Hut Casual Dining continues to be the leading western casual dining concept in China, with 467 units in 122 cities. Our new menu strategy continues to drive double-digit same-store sales growth. We offer a broad variety of entrées, including beef, chicken and rice dishes, along with appetizers, beverages and desserts. Amazingly, we are actually updating 25% of our menu every six months, with new products, to keep the concept fresh and relevant. We are having solid success, building a true casual dining concept, with everyday affordable value.We also continue to invest behind the development of our emerging brands. Pizza Hut Home Service in the Home Delivery category, now has over 100 units in 11 cities, and East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand, continues to progress, as we drive our scalable economics.Next, Yum! Restaurants International, where our strategy is to drive aggressive expansion and build strong brands everywhere outside of China. New unit development, which like China, is a key driver of growth for this business and continued with 109 openings this quarter in more than 40 countries. Approximately 90% of this growth came from our strong network of around 1,000 franchisees. We expect to deliver our goal of adding about 900 new units for the full year. Our first-quarter same-store sales declined 1%, after adjusting for timing of Chinese New Year's. Overall, we drove 2% operating profit growth, excluding foreign currency translation for the quarter.KFC is focusing its attention on driving value around the world to build sales momentum in what remains a somewhat challenging consumer environment. We're expanding our value menu to more markets, using proven strategies that have been very successful in markets like South Africa and the United Kingdom. Additionally, we continue to build our new incremental sales layers. Our Krushers line of frozen beverages continues to expand and is now available in over 2,000 units in over 25 countries. Our KFC breakfast initiative, we call it KFC a.m., also continues to grow with nearly 400 units in four markets.Pizza Hut continues to make progress, elevating its brand offering and strengthening its position as the leading Western casual dining concept, with everyday affordable prices. While we have weaker transaction trends due to Pizza Hut's higher average guest check, we're encouraged by the progress we're making with our expanded menu, including the wider variety of appetizers, beverages, entrées and desserts.Yum! Restaurants International's new growth markets, France, India and Russia, delivered 14% system sales growth, prior to foreign currency translation this quarter. KFC France opened its 100th unit and is moving towards having the scale to ultimately have national television advertisement. We expect this will drive further brand awareness, particularly in the provincial cities. In Russia, we continue to drive sales growth in KFC ROSTIK'S units and now have over 150 units in 22 cities. Our business in India continues to perform well, with solid same-store sales growth and new unit expansion. We now have 74 KFCs in 13 cities and 159 Pizza Huts in 33 cities. KFC is now leveraging television advertising to build brand awareness and promote new products in India. Taco Bell International continues to expand with our first unit in Bangalore, India, in that country's largest mall,  Mantri Mall. You might have read in the Wall Street Journal that our initial sales at the store has been extremely strong, and transactions have actually exceeded 1,000 per day.The results from other recent openings in Spain, Dubai, Cyprus and Panama have also been very encouraging, with our stores comparably exceeding sales targets. Looking ahead, we are on track to open two new Taco Bell units in London in the second quarter and expect to open new markets like Korea, Kuwait, Peru and Colombia, later this year.Next on to our U.S. business, where our focus is to improve our brand positions, consistency and returns. As we noted in our earnings release, performance in our U.S. business for the first quarter was relatively weak, with same-store sales down 1% and operating profit down 9%. But we were pleased with the significant improvement from the fourth quarter of 2009. Pizza Hut led the way with 5% same-store sales growth, driven by the success of the ""$10 any way you want it"" promotion. There is no doubt America loves Pizza Hut pizzas. So this has addressed our number one problem, we were simply too expensive. And now, we're working on ways to sustain this value. Going forward, we are also striving to transform Pizza Hut from just pizza to pizza, pasta and wings. Tuscani Tuesday offers consumers Pizza Hut's pastas at a great value of $10, and Wing Wednesday offers consumers Pizza Hut's award-winning chicken wings, also at great value. Pizza Hut has clearly turned the corner on sales trends.At Taco Bell, we were disappointed with a 2% decline in same-store sales but encouraged by the fact that our transactions were positive for the quarter. We had experienced some trade down with less drink and combo incidents. Taco Bell's pipeline of products is strong for the balance of the year, focusing on value to the consumer, in a market clearly focused on everyday low prices.KFC's performance improved sequentially, but we still have our work cut out for us. We are focused on three key areas, as we turn the brand around, balanced options, featuring Kentucky Grilled Chicken, portable product innovation, like the new Double Down sandwich, made from two boneless fillets, grilled or fried, and improved operations.Overall, our U.S. performance has improved from the low point of the fourth quarter. We expect this trend to continue, especially as we move into the second half of the year, both in terms of our top line sales and profit performance. One other note. I'm sure you also noticed from our release, that we took a non-cash charge that basically reflects the beginning of refranchising KFC to 5% ownership. That is also our goal for Pizza Hut, where we've already began the journey and are well on our way.So let me wrap up the first quarter, overall, by saying, we are off to a strong start in 2010. While the global operating environment remains challenging, we are especially pleased with the strong performance in our China business and the improving trends we are seeing in our U.S. business, which we expect to continue to build, as the year progresses. We're confident we are well on our way delivering another year of at least 10% earnings per share growth, which would be our ninth year in a row of meeting or exceeding this target. Now let me turn it over to Rick Carucci, our Chief Financial Officer."

In this section of our call, I'm going to comment on three areas: Our first quarter results, our outlook for the business during the balance of 2010 and our strategy in emerging markets.As David mentioned, we are very e",1245,"Thank you, David, and good morning. In this section of our call, I'm going to comment on three areas: Our first quarter results, our outlook for the business during the balance of 2010 and our strategy in emerging markets.As David mentioned, we are very excited about our first quarter results. I'm sure any CFO will tell you that they would much prefer a strong start than having to play catch-up.As we review a few of our highlights, let's start with China. We had a very strong Chinese New Year holiday. This led to first quarter system sales growth of 15%, including same-store sales growth of 4%. Sales were solid across the country, including the high export regions. While we are not yet ready to say that the Chinese consumer has fully recovered, we are starting to see signs that the consumer environment is improving. As an example, consumer confidence in China has increased year-over-year, the last three months.A big driver of sales continues to be our development results in China. New-unit economics remains strong, and we expect that we will continue to expand broadly across China. Our profit growth of 37% was also driven by record first quarter margins, as we benefited significantly from chicken cost deflation versus prior year and lower-than-trend wage inflation.Now on to Yum! Restaurants International. Overall, our sales results were relatively weak in our large developed markets like Japan and Canada, as well as equity businesses like Australia and Mexico. These markets dampened the overall sales results for YRI in the quarter. The good news is that YRI still benefited from broad-based new-unit development of 3% in the first quarter. However, this led to only 2% profit growth prior to currency translation. We did benefit from a $14 million ForEx upside in the first quarter, which resulted in YRI reported profit growth of 13%. Next in the U.S., we continued to battle high unemployment and industry focus on value. However, our U.S. business realized significantly better sales performance than we saw in the fourth quarter.On the whole, our U.S. restaurant margin declined 90 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to the decline in same-store sales. Commodity deflation of $5 million was offset by a modest impact from sales mix shift. For example, Taco Bell experienced the higher mix on the Why Pay More menu and had lower drink incidents.While trying to improve our value offerings, we also managed our business with tight cost management. In the U.S., we reduced our G&A by $6 million. When you pull it all together, we were pleased with where we stand after the first quarter.Now let me share with you some of our thoughts for the remainder of 2010. We expect our second quarter sales dynamics to be similar to the first quarter for our divisions. We expect moderate same-store sales growth in China in the second quarter. For the U.S., in the second half of the year, we expect positive sales growth. A key reason is that our comparisons versus prior year gets significantly easier. Remember, we're lapping at second half,  where U.S. sales were down 7% in 2009. We do not expect China's exceptional margin performance in the first quarter to continue. We expect some commodity inflation in the back half of the year, and we also forecast greater impact from wage inflation. Wage inflation was lower than normal in 2009 and is significantly picking up again in 2010. For the full year, we expect moderate year-over-year margin improvement over last year's 21% margins in mainland China.Our after-tax results in the second quarter will be challenged, as we roll over a 16.4% effective tax rate before special items from the second quarter of 2009. Special items are very difficult to predict and can be quite lumpy. However, this year, it appears that we have more downsides than upsides. During the first quarter, we took a special-items charge that included a $56 million expense from U.S. refranchising. This includes gains from the sale of 46 restaurants sold in the first quarter. This also reflects that we floated for sale, a significant number of KFC U.S. company units. Our accounting policy is to recognize a non-cash write off for potential losses from refranchising when units are offered for sale.In the second quarter, we will also lap a $68 million one-time non-cash gain in 2009 related to increasing our ownership in the KFC Shanghai joint venture. Overall, as David said, we are confident we're on track to meeting our objective of at least 10% earnings per share growth.As we've shared with you before, one of Yum!'s unique strengths is our presence in emerging markets. Today, I'd like to give you a few more insights into this significant growth opportunity. Emerging markets, as defined by World Bank's guidelines, generally includes countries whose gross national income per capita is less than $12,000. This group includes countries like China, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Russia, Vietnam and Brazil, all of which have near over 100 Yum! restaurants. The good news is that collectively, these emerging markets are growing their economies at a fast rate. With the booming middle-class population in emerging markets, we strongly believe there's a long runway for restaurant growth in those countries. As you may recall, I talked about our penetration of three units per million people internationally, versus the 60 units per million we have in the U.S. Further, in the top 10 emerging markets, we currently have 1.5 units per million people. These demonstrate that we are clearly, on the ground floor of this huge growth opportunity. Today, we have nearly 10,000 units in the emerging markets, or roughly 55% of our total YRI and China units. We are the largest restaurant company in emerging markets, and we are growing at a faster rate than our major QSR competition. For the five-year period ending in 2009, we added about 4,000 net new units in these markets, a 12% compound annual growth rate. This compares to a 1% compound annual growth rate in the balance of our international operations.As another benchmark, we currently have almost 2x the number of emerging market units as McDonald's. And we've added more net units than McDonald's at a 3:1 rate during the past five years. And here's another important point, most of our competitors aren't even trying to open restaurants in many of these emerging markets. Our experience is that it usually takes about 10 years to get to 100 units in a new country. This is a point at which you could begin to scale a concept, as you have a proven consumer proposition, a more efficient supply chain and access to mass media such as television. Overall, for emerging markets, Yum! enjoys a combination of an existing lead in penetration, a higher growth rate and the knowledge of the lead times it would take others to have a meaningful presence in these markets.  This provides Yum! with an opportunity to increase our competitive advantage that will likely last for a very long time. In the upcoming calls and investor meetings, we plan to provide more color commentary around our growth opportunities in emerging markets. In summary, given our plans and our first quarter results, we believe Yum! is well positioned to, once again, deliver solid financial performance in 2010. At the same time, we're equally excited about the foundation we are building in emerging markets to drive strong performance for many years to come. Back to you David."

Local governments are confident enough to start to increase wages again at a pretty high rate, which puts us on the margin side with indication that the people are starting to feel more bullish about the economy. You still have the push towards essentially in West, that we've talked about before, and those economies are still doing a bit better than the coastal economies, and we'll continue to move some of our development in that direction. But I'd say it's better than it was, but not what it was, let's say, before things started going South."

So we're still running the business as if things are going to be pretty tight with the consumer, and things are better than they were for us, obviously, in the third quarter or fourth quarter last year. But we still have several ways to go before we're going to say there's an economic recovery in the U.S. On the commodity side, we had a little bit of commodity deflation in the first quarter. Our current guess is it will be about flat for the full year. So we don't see a huge difference there. So we'll continue to try to do what we do in these types of times. It's one, we have value initiatives, two, try to have some great product initiatives, because, obviously, you need to have innovation as well. And then we'll manage across three types of -- we're looking at both productivity initiatives at all our brands. And I think the teams have done a pretty good job of managing those costs. In terms of the profits in the first quarter, our overall sales were down 1%. Our company sales we're down 2%.

Regarding refranchising, just to put that into context, again, for people who may not be as familiar, we run a three-year refranchising program that really started in the beginning of '08. And our goal was to go from over 20% of our U.S. restaurants, or company-owned to about 10%, which, as David said, about 5% at the KFC and Pizza Hut level. In the first two years of that, we finished Long John Silver's refranchising.  As David said, we're well on our way on Pizza Hut. And we think we'll be close to finishing that within  the original three-year time frame, which would've ended in 2010. And then what we said in December is that we're behind on KFC. We started late on KFC, and therefore, we think the total program will take a bit longer than we originally thought. So KFC, we just really started in earnest this quarter in terms of loading deals. So we'll have to see how -- we have a lot of work to do on that stuff. We're still just hearing from potential buyers. So we have a long way to go on that side, but we're going after it. So we now think it's the right time to market. We think the brand is performing better than it was a while back.

But we think the bigger idea is to try to create separate occasions. So I hope that's helpful.  All right, let me wrap things up briefly with just some closing comments here. We continue to execute against our global growth opportunities both in China as well as Yum! Restaurants International with our leading industry new unit expansion. Our focus is global, which is particularly strong in emerging markets like China and India. KFC is a leading western brand in many emerging markets and the fastest growing western brand. And we're very pleased to be so well-positioned in the fastest growing economies in the world with expanding middle class populations as Rick pointed out earlier. In the United States, we are making progress competing in a tough macro environment. We're encouraged by recent sales trends in each of our brands but know that we have plenty of opportunity to drive value and innovation as we improve operations. We are continuing to make solid progress against our goal of reducing U.S. company ownership to 10% or less, targeting ownership of 5% of both Pizza Hut and KFC. In closing, 2010 is off to a good start. We had a good quarter, and when we expect to deliver our target of at least 10% EPS this year. So thank you, all for participating in the call.

I'm pleased that based on our strong first quarter performance, we are well on our way to achieving our ninth straight year of achieving our annual target of at least 10% EPS growth. Our first quarter worldwide ope",1530,"Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased that based on our strong first quarter performance, we are well on our way to achieving our ninth straight year of achieving our annual target of at least 10% EPS growth. Our first quarter worldwide operating profit grew by 17% and EPS increased 23%, before special items. We are particularly pleased with our business in China, which reported robust profit growth of 37%, driven by both strong unit development and same-store sales growth. In the United States, we were also pleased to see the significant sales improvement from the low point of the fourth quarter, particularly at Pizza Hut. However, U.S. profits were down 9% and same-store sales declined 1%.  At Yum! Restaurants International, we increased system sales by 1% and profits by 2% prior to foreign currency translation, primarily due to new unit development. While clearly, we have more work to do, overall, we were pleased with this start at 2010.Now let me take you through our key strategies and trends for each of our divisions. First, let's talk about China, where we continue to build leading brands in every significant restaurant category. We are particularly pleased with the performance in our China business. Same-store sales grew by 4% and units expanded 14%, while restaurant margins were at a record level of nearly 27%, all combined to generate robust profit growth of 37%. This is particularly impressive when you consider that we were lapping 30% profit growth in the first quarter of last year. New unit development continues to be the major driver of our growth, and we remain the largest U.S. retail developer in China. We opened up 96 new units this quarter, and our China new unit returns continue to be the best in our business. In terms of scale, we surpassed 3,500 units, strengthening our leading position in the world's largest growth market.KFC is our largest brand in China, with nearly 3,000 units in over 650 cities, with superior average unit volumes of $1.4 million per year. We are continuing to grow our business and leverage our assets. A key KFC initiative is delivery, which is now available in over 110 cities and nearly 1,000 units. This is proving to be a developing sales layer for us, now representing over 3% of sales. KFC breakfast is another way we are leveraging our assets, as we now have national distribution. KFC breakfast represents nearly 7% of transactions and continues to steadily grow. Importantly, KFC continues to build its leading image in China across key brand majors.Pizza Hut Casual Dining continues to be the leading western casual dining concept in China, with 467 units in 122 cities. Our new menu strategy continues to drive double-digit same-store sales growth. We offer a broad variety of entrées, including beef, chicken and rice dishes, along with appetizers, beverages and desserts. Amazingly, we are actually updating 25% of our menu every six months, with new products, to keep the concept fresh and relevant. We are having solid success, building a true casual dining concept, with everyday affordable value.We also continue to invest behind the development of our emerging brands. Pizza Hut Home Service in the Home Delivery category, now has over 100 units in 11 cities, and East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand, continues to progress, as we drive our scalable economics.Next, Yum! Restaurants International, where our strategy is to drive aggressive expansion and build strong brands everywhere outside of China. New unit development, which like China, is a key driver of growth for this business and continued with 109 openings this quarter in more than 40 countries. Approximately 90% of this growth came from our strong network of around 1,000 franchisees. We expect to deliver our goal of adding about 900 new units for the full year. Our first-quarter same-store sales declined 1%, after adjusting for timing of Chinese New Year's. Overall, we drove 2% operating profit growth, excluding foreign currency translation for the quarter.KFC is focusing its attention on driving value around the world to build sales momentum in what remains a somewhat challenging consumer environment. We're expanding our value menu to more markets, using proven strategies that have been very successful in markets like South Africa and the United Kingdom. Additionally, we continue to build our new incremental sales layers. Our Krushers line of frozen beverages continues to expand and is now available in over 2,000 units in over 25 countries. Our KFC breakfast initiative, we call it KFC a.m., also continues to grow with nearly 400 units in four markets.Pizza Hut continues to make progress, elevating its brand offering and strengthening its position as the leading Western casual dining concept, with everyday affordable prices. While we have weaker transaction trends due to Pizza Hut's higher average guest check, we're encouraged by the progress we're making with our expanded menu, including the wider variety of appetizers, beverages, entrées and desserts.Yum! Restaurants International's new growth markets, France, India and Russia, delivered 14% system sales growth, prior to foreign currency translation this quarter. KFC France opened its 100th unit and is moving towards having the scale to ultimately have national television advertisement. We expect this will drive further brand awareness, particularly in the provincial cities. In Russia, we continue to drive sales growth in KFC ROSTIK'S units and now have over 150 units in 22 cities. Our business in India continues to perform well, with solid same-store sales growth and new unit expansion. We now have 74 KFCs in 13 cities and 159 Pizza Huts in 33 cities. KFC is now leveraging television advertising to build brand awareness and promote new products in India. Taco Bell International continues to expand with our first unit in Bangalore, India, in that country's largest mall,  Mantri Mall. You might have read in the Wall Street Journal that our initial sales at the store has been extremely strong, and transactions have actually exceeded 1,000 per day.The results from other recent openings in Spain, Dubai, Cyprus and Panama have also been very encouraging, with our stores comparably exceeding sales targets. Looking ahead, we are on track to open two new Taco Bell units in London in the second quarter and expect to open new markets like Korea, Kuwait, Peru and Colombia, later this year.Next on to our U.S. business, where our focus is to improve our brand positions, consistency and returns. As we noted in our earnings release, performance in our U.S. business for the first quarter was relatively weak, with same-store sales down 1% and operating profit down 9%. But we were pleased with the significant improvement from the fourth quarter of 2009. Pizza Hut led the way with 5% same-store sales growth, driven by the success of the ""$10 any way you want it"" promotion. There is no doubt America loves Pizza Hut pizzas. So this has addressed our number one problem, we were simply too expensive. And now, we're working on ways to sustain this value. Going forward, we are also striving to transform Pizza Hut from just pizza to pizza, pasta and wings. Tuscani Tuesday offers consumers Pizza Hut's pastas at a great value of $10, and Wing Wednesday offers consumers Pizza Hut's award-winning chicken wings, also at great value. Pizza Hut has clearly turned the corner on sales trends.At Taco Bell, we were disappointed with a 2% decline in same-store sales but encouraged by the fact that our transactions were positive for the quarter. We had experienced some trade down with less drink and combo incidents. Taco Bell's pipeline of products is strong for the balance of the year, focusing on value to the consumer, in a market clearly focused on everyday low prices.KFC's performance improved sequentially, but we still have our work cut out for us. We are focused on three key areas, as we turn the brand around, balanced options, featuring Kentucky Grilled Chicken, portable product innovation, like the new Double Down sandwich, made from two boneless fillets, grilled or fried, and improved operations.Overall, our U.S. performance has improved from the low point of the fourth quarter. We expect this trend to continue, especially as we move into the second half of the year, both in terms of our top line sales and profit performance. One other note. I'm sure you also noticed from our release, that we took a non-cash charge that basically reflects the beginning of refranchising KFC to 5% ownership. That is also our goal for Pizza Hut, where we've already began the journey and are well on our way.So let me wrap up the first quarter, overall, by saying, we are off to a strong start in 2010. While the global operating environment remains challenging, we are especially pleased with the strong performance in our China business and the improving trends we are seeing in our U.S. business, which we expect to continue to build, as the year progresses. We're confident we are well on our way delivering another year of at least 10% earnings per share growth, which would be our ninth year in a row of meeting or exceeding this target. Now let me turn it over to Rick Carucci, our Chief Financial Officer."

In this section of our call, I'm going to comment on three areas: Our first quarter results, our outlook for the business during the balance of 2010 and our strategy in emerging markets. As David mentioned, we are very excited about our first quarter results. I'm sure any CFO will tell you that they would much prefer a strong start than having to play catch-up.As we review a few of our highlights, let's start with China. We had a very strong Chinese New Year holiday. This led to first quarter system sales growth of 15%, including same-store sales growth of 4%. Sales were solid across the country, including the high export regions. While we are not yet ready to say that the Chinese consumer has fully recovered, we are starting to see signs that the consumer environment is improving. As an example, consumer confidence in China has increased year-over-year, the last three months.A big driver of sales continues to be our development results in China. New unit economics remains strong, and we expect that we will continue to expand broadly across China. Our profit growth of 37% was also driven by record first quarter margins, as we benefited significantly from chicken cost deflation versus prior year and lower-than-trend wage inflation.Now on to Yum! Restaurants International. Overall, our sales results were relatively weak in our large developed markets like Japan and Canada, as well as equity businesses like Australia and Mexico. These markets dampened the overall sales results for YRI in the quarter. The good news is that YRI still benefited from broad-based new unit development of 3% in the first quarter. However, this led to only 2% profit growth prior to currency translation. We did benefit from a $14 million ForEx upside in the first quarter, which resulted in YRI reported profit growth of 13%. Next, in the U.S., we continue to battle high unemployment and industry focus on value. However, our U.S. business realized significantly better sales performance than we saw in the fourth quarter.  On the whole, our U.S. restaurant margin declined 90 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to the decline in same-store sales. Commodity deflation of $5 million was offset by a modest impact from sales mix shift. For example, Taco Bell experienced the higher mix on the Why Pay More menu and had lower drink incidents. While trying to improve our value offerings, we also managed our business with tight cost management. In the U.S., we reduced our G&A by $6 million. When you pull it all together, we were pleased with where we stand after the first quarter.Now let me share with you some of our thoughts for the remainder of 2010. We expect our second quarter sales dynamics to be similar to the first quarter for our divisions. We expect moderate same-store sales growth in China in the second quarter. For the U.S., in the second half of the year, we expect positive sales growth. A key reason is that our comparisons versus prior year gets significantly easier. Remember, we're lapping at second half,  where U.S. sales were down 7% in 2009. We do not expect China's exceptional margin performance in the first quarter to continue. We expect some commodity inflation in the back half of the year, and we also forecast greater impact from wage inflation. Wage inflation was lower than normal in 2009 and is significantly picking up again in 2010. For the full year, we expect moderate year-over-year margin improvement over last year's 21% margins in mainland China.Our after-tax results in the second quarter will be challenged as we roll over a 16.4% effective tax rate before special items from the second quarter of 2009. Special items are very difficult to predict and can be quite lumpy. However, this year, it appears that we have more downsides and upsides. During the first quarter, we took a special-items charge that included a $56 million expense from U.S. refranchising. This includes gains from the sale of 46 restaurants sold in the first quarter. This also reflects that we floated for sale a significant number of KFC U.S. company units. Our accounting policy is to recognize a non-cash write-off for potential losses from refranchising when units are offered for sale. In the second quarter, we will also lap a $68 million onetime non-cash gain in 2009 related to increasing our ownership in the KFC Shanghai joint venture. Overall, as David said, we are confident we're on track to meeting our objective of at least 10% earnings per share growth.As we've shared with you before, one of Yum!'s unique strengths is our presence in emerging markets. Today, I'd like to give you a few more insights into this significant growth opportunity.  Emerging markets, as defined by World Bank's guidelines, generally includes countries whose gross national income per capita is less than $12,000. This group includes countries like China, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Russia, Vietnam and Brazil, all of which have near or over 100 Yum! restaurants. The good news is that, collectively, these emerging markets are growing their economies at a fast rate. With the booming middle-class population in emerging markets, we strongly believe there's a long runway for restaurant growth in those countries. As you may recall, I talked about our penetration of three units per million people internationally, versus the 60 units per million we have in the U.S. Further, in the top 10 emerging markets, we currently have 1.5 units per million people. This demonstrates that we are clearly, on the ground floor of this huge growth opportunity. Today, we have nearly 10,000 units in the emerging markets, or roughly 55% of our total YRI in China units. We are the largest restaurant company in emerging markets, and we are growing at a faster rate than our major QSR competition. For the five-year period ending in 2009, we added about 4,000 net new units in these markets, a 12% compound annual growth rate. This compares to a 1% compound annual growth rate in the balance of our international operations.As another benchmark, we currently have almost 2x the number of emerging market units as McDonald's. And we've added more net units than McDonald's at a 3:1 rate during the past five years. And here's another important point, most of our competitors aren't even trying to open restaurants in many of these emerging markets. Our experience is that it usually takes about 10 years to get to 100 units in a new country. This is the point at which you could begin to scale a concept as you have a proven consumer proposition, a more efficient supply chain and access to mass media, such as television. Overall, for emerging markets, Yum! enjoys the combination of an existing lead in penetration, a higher growth rate and the knowledge of the lead times it would take others to have a meaningful presence in these markets. This provides Yum! with an opportunity to increase our competitive advantage that will likely last for a very long time. In the upcoming calls and investor meetings, we plan to provide more color commentary around our growth opportunities in emerging markets. In summary, given our plans and our first quarter results, we believe Yum! is well positioned to, once again, deliver solid financial performance in 2010. At the same time, we're equally excited about the foundation we are building in emerging markets to drive strong performance for many years to come. Back to you David."

So we're not necessarily assuming a great economic recovery for ourselves to get better. We start lapping minus 7% in the second half of 2009. So we're still running the business as if things are going to be pretty tight with the consumer, and things are better than they were for us, obviously, in the third quarter or fourth quarter last year. But we still have several ways to go before we're going to say there's an economic recovery in the U.S. On the commodity side, we had a little bit of commodity deflation in the first quarter. Our current guess is it will be about flat for the full year. So we don't see a huge difference there. So we'll continue to try to do what we do in these types of times. It's one, we have value initiatives, two, try to have some great product initiatives, because, obviously, you need to have innovation as well. And then we'll manage across three types of -- we're looking at both productivity initiatives at all our brands. And I think the teams have done a pretty good job of managing those costs. In terms of the profits in the first quarter, our overall sales were down 1%. Our company sales we're down 2%. So that's probably why the profits, if you put that in perspective, is really why we were down 9%.

Regarding refranchising, just to put that into context, again, for people who may not be as familiar, we run a three-year refranchising program that really started in the beginning of '08. And our goal was to go from over 20% of our U.S. restaurants, or company-owned to about 10%, which, as David said, about 5% at the KFC and Pizza Hut level. In the first two years of that, we finished Long John Silver's refranchising. As David said, we're well on our way on Pizza Hut. And we think we'll be close to finishing that within  the original three-year time frame, which would've ended in 2010. And then what we said in December is that we're behind on KFC.

So clearly, we were down 2% in the first quarter. As you know, the overall industry trends have been negative since June of '09, and we do have the strongest value position in the category. What we saw in the first quarter was that our transactions were positive, but we did have a lower average guest check, less drinks and combo meals. And we also had -- most of our media spend was on the value, the $0.89 Beefy Five-Layer Burrito. So we did have the Why Pay More usage increase to about 20% of our mix versus the 15% of the mix. So this is what we were able to, obviously, maintain. Perhaps, we haven't seen the research yet, even four or five the value position which we know is going to be really essential as we go forward. And we were doing it. We're able to do it in a competitive category where basically, you point out the issue, more and more people are at the low end. What we really are pleased about is that we have positive transactions. So more people are coming into Taco Bell this year than last year so we can build off of that strength. Our biggest challenge is to get same-store sales growing again at Taco Bell. We're obviously happy that transactions picked up, but it's much easier to build your sales off positive transactions. So we believe as we look at our programs and our initiatives, that our value and our innovation's strong enough for us to get modest same-store sales growth for the balance of the year. And as we pointed out at the analyst meeting that we had in New York, we're also extremely enthusiastic about the results we're getting from our more longer-term initiatives: Breakfast, home meal replacement, beverages. These big sales layers, we have a lot of big ideas in test that we are feeling better and better about as we go forward. So we're very optimistic about the future of this brand. We think we can get modest same-store sales growth to about [ph] (59:00) balance of the year. But it's slug-it-out. I mean it's definitely a slug-it-out category right now.

What we're doing is we're taking a lot of the know-how that we have on permanent value menus from the success of like a market like in South Africa, which is we have a street-wise menu, and we're expanding that successfully into the U.K. where it now has like 14% of the mix and a significant amount of incremental sales. We're also revisiting our core signature items with new insights on products that are very unique in the marketplace, our Twister and our Zinger sandwiches, for example.

So we're trying to roll out and expand the proven winners into more geographies. We also are continuing the rollout of new incremental sales layers. So Krushers, which is our line of frozen beverages, is now in 2,000 units, and we're shooting to have it 4,000 units by the end of the year. So we expect that to give us a bit of a lift.

But we think the bigger idea is to try to create separate occasions. So I hope that's helpful.  All right, let me wrap things up briefly with just some closing comments here. We continue to execute against our global growth opportunities both in China as well as Yum! Restaurants International with our leading industry new unit expansion. Our focus is global, which is particularly strong in emerging markets like China and India. KFC is a leading western brand in many emerging markets and the fastest growing western brand. And we're very pleased to be so well-positioned in the fastest growing economies in the world with expanding middle class populations as Rick pointed out earlier. In the United States, we are making progress competing in a tough macro environment. We're encouraged by recent sales trends in each of our brands but know that we have plenty of opportunity to drive value and innovation as we improve operations. We are continuing to make solid progress against our goal of reducing U.S. company ownership to 10% or less, targeting ownership of 5% of both Pizza Hut and KFC. In closing, 2010 is off to a good start. We had a good quarter, and when we expect to deliver our target of at least 10% EPS this year. So thank you, all for participating in the call. I appreciate the good questions."

I'm pleased to report, we are raising our full year 2010 EPS growth forecast to 12% based on our strong second quarter and first half performance. Our second quarter EPS growth of 17% before special items was fu",1932,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report, we are raising our full year 2010 EPS growth forecast to 12% based on our strong second quarter and first half performance. Our second quarter EPS growth of 17% before special items was fueled by profit growth in each of our three divisions. 
We were particularly pleased with our business in China, which reported robust profit growth of 33%, driven by same-store sales growth, margin improvement and continued unit development. In the U.S., we were also pleased to see significant improvement in the operating profit despite flat same-store sales. Our primary focus is to drive same-store sales growth balance of the year, given the challenging consumer environment. 
At Yum! Restaurants International, we increased system sales 4% prior to foreign currency translation benefit. We expect stronger sales and profit growth through the balance of the year at YRI.
Now let me take you through our key strategies and trends for each of our divisions. First, I'm obviously very proud of our China team's performance. Same-store sales grew by 4% and units expanded 12%. Our China division generated operating profit growth of 33%. Through the first half of this year, our China division's profit growth has been 35%. New unit development continues to be the major driver of our growth, and we remain the largest U.S. retail developer in China. We've opened 155 new units in our first two quarters and expect to open about 475 this year. Our China new unit returns continue to be the best in our business.
Now let me share with you a few highlights from each of our leading brands in China. Let's start with KFC. We just opened our 3,000th KFC in June. And as you know, we're in over 600 cities with average unit volumes of $1.4 million. KFC continues to be the largest Western QSR concept in Mainland China. 
We have three key initiatives to grow our business and leverage our assets: First, KFC breakfast is in virtually all of our restaurants. We're opening at 6:00 a.m., and breakfast now makes up 10% of transactions. Next is delivery, which is now available in 126 cities and nearly 1,300 units. Last, our 24-hour operations initiative is generating incremental sales and is in now about 1,000 restaurants.
Pizza Hut Casual Dining continues to be the leading Western casual dining concept in China, with 469 units in 122 cities. We expect to open 63 Pizza Hut Casual Dining restaurants this year, which is up from 55 last year. You may recall that beginning last year, we slowed the growth of this concept substantially while we repositioned our menu. With the success we've had, we have begun to increase development in tier one to three cities. Our new menu strategy continues to drive double-digit same-store sales growth. We offer a broad variety of entrees, including beef, chicken and rice dishes, along with appetizers, beverages and desserts.  We are having solid success building a true casual dining concept with everyday affordable value.
We also continue to invest behind the development of our emerging brands. Pizza Hut Home Service in the Home Delivery category now has over 100 units in 11 cities. East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand, continues to progress as we drive for scalable economics. Additionally, we own 27% of Little Sheep, the leading brand in the Hot Pot category, which is the largest casual dining concept in China. 
In summary, we're very pleased with the progress we're making executing our China strategy to build leading brands in every significant restaurant category.
Next, Yum! Restaurants International, where our strategy is to drive aggressive expansion and build strong brands everywhere. Similar to our China business, new unit development is a key driver for growth. Our Yum! Restaurants International growth strategy differs from China in that nearly 90% of our 284 new units so far this year that we've developed have been developed by our strong network of franchisees. In fact, over 85% of the nearly 14,000 traditional restaurants in this division are franchise units, which generate a steady, growing stream of franchise royalties. We expect to add about 900 new units for the full year.
Our second quarter system sales grew 4%, excluding foreign currency translation, while same-store sales were up 1%. Overall, we drove 7% operating profit growth, excluding foreign currency translation for the quarter.
Based on the success we've had in China, we are aggressively going after sales layers at YRI. In particular, KFC, our largest concept in Yum! Restaurants International, is making major progress on driving value. Value menus are in place in all our key markets and will be expanding further this year. Our Krushers line of frozen beverages continues to expand and is now available in over 2,100 stores and over 35 countries. Our KFC breakfast initiative, which we call KFC a.m., also continues to grow.
Pizza Hut continues to make progress, elevating its brand offering and strengthening its position as the leading Western casual dining concept with everyday affordable prices. While we have weaker transaction trends due to Pizza Hut's higher average guest check, we are encouraged by the progress we are making with our expanded menu, including a wider variety of appetizers, beverages, entrees and desserts.
Yum! Restaurants International's new growth markets, France, India and Russia, delivered 13% system sales growth prior to foreign currency translation this quarter. For the first time, our KFC France business used national television in May, and as you would expect, saw a strong upward shift in sales. Scale that enables television advertising is the result of us now having 100 restaurants in France.
On July 1, the company also completed the exercise of our option with our Russian partner, and we now have full management control of the KFC ROSTIK'S brand in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States. This market includes more than 150 co-branded KFC ROSTIK'S across Russia and the CIS, which we now own approximately 50 with the remainder owned by our franchisees. We're excited about this market due to its large population and its appetite for chicken. 
Our business in India continues to perform well, with solid same-store sales growth and new unit expansion. We now have over 70 KFCs and 160 Pizza Huts in India.
Taco Bell International also continues to expand. We opened our first Taco Bell in the United Kingdom on June 28, and our first in Korea just last week. In fact, we've opened Taco Bells in seven new countries over the past two years. Early results are promising, and we're working very hard to make Taco Bell a global brand.
Overall, Yum! Restaurants International growth and development is on track. Importantly, we have a leading position and substantial runway for growth in emerging markets. I'd like to take a moment to thank our growth-oriented franchise partners for the investment that they continue to make and for partnering with us to build a global business we can all be proud of.
Next, on to our U.S. business, where our focus is to improve our brand positions, consistency and returns. Our U.S. business achieved solid operating profit growth of 10%, with substantial improvement in restaurant margin while posting flat same-store sales. We're happy with the improvement in the business and are pleased with the strategies we are executing across each brand. We look for sales growth to improve modestly at Taco Bell in the second half and stay strong at Pizza Hut. At KFC, we remain confident in our long-term strategy, but expect sales to be soft for the balance of the year.  
Taco Bell, our largest and most profitable brand in the U.S. and in fact, the second most profitable brand in our category in the U.S., continued its trend of growing transactions and grew same-store sales 1% for the quarter. Taco Bell's pipeline of products is strong for the balance of the year, focusing on value to the consumer and a market clearly focused on everyday value. We also continue to make progress testing breakfast, home meal replacement options and a new beverage platform. Taco Bell is performing well in this challenging market, and we've never been more confident than we are today about our future prospects for this great brand.
Pizza Hut led the way with 8% same-store sales growth for the quarter, and our $10 Any Pizza promotion continues to be a huge consumer hit. We continue to leverage this promotion, as well as discount of the day of the week specials such as Tuscany Tuesdays for our pasta line and Wing Wednesdays. 
People ask us about the sustainability of our $10 Any promotion. And well, one thing I certainly know is what's not sustainable, and that's maintaining the high menu prices we had in our restaurants previously. Pizza Hut is very focused on working with our franchisees to maintain everyday value. We're also very focused on leveraging our asset like we're doing with the Tuscany Tuesdays, where we introduced pasta. Now we're marketing on a Tuesday, and we're doing the same thing with Wings on Wednesday. So we've talked about leverage in our assets in the past. That strategy is definitely being executed and being done very well by the Pizza Hut team. Pizza Hut's performance is strong, and I want to assure you that we're working very hard to sustain it. 
Now let's me put KFC into perspective. As I said earlier, we expect sales to be soft for the balance of the year. Our focus remains on the following key areas: improving operations; value; balanced options featuring our grilled products; portable product innovation, like the Double Down; and asset  upgrades.  
As you would expect, each of these major initiatives will take time to implement. There is no quick fix. We are, however, making progress. Recently, KFC had the single largest year-over-year improvement of any major QSR brand in the American Customer Satisfaction Index. We take this as a positive sign that our efforts to launch Kentucky Grilled Chicken to complement our world-class, our world-famous fried chicken and simultaneously improve our operations are beginning to pay off. In spite of this progress, sales have been underperforming, and we expect continued weak sales in the third quarter, however.
That said, we are in the midst of a transformation to truly make KFC a more relevant and better-operated brand. And make no mistake, we have a great team that is providing the customer-focused leadership required to do just that. However, from a pure financials perspective, given our tremendous global growth and the success that we've had with Taco Bell in the United States, KFC represents less than 10% of the U.S. Division's profits and less than 3% of the company's overall profits. We expect 2010 profit at KFC to be higher than last year, and the execution of our refranchising strategy sets the brand up to make more money going forward with less capital investment.
Overall, our U.S. performance has improved, particularly with the operating profit growth in the second quarter. We are encouraged that same-store sales are now positive at Taco Bell, pleased with the continued success of Pizza Hut and confident in the long-term strategy at KFC.
So let me wrap this up. Quite simply, we've had a great first half of the year with strong operating profit growth. We are pleased with the profit growth in each of our business units, specifically our strong performance in China. We're confident in delivering our raised target of 12% EPS growth. Now let me hand it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Rick Carucci."
365997,109102198,67344,"Yum! Brands, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-14-2010",2010-07-14,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In this session of our call, I'm going to comment on three areas: our second quarter results, our outlook for the second half of 2010 and Yum!'s unique position in emerging markets.As we outlined on the last",1566,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In this session of our call, I'm going to comment on three areas: our second quarter results, our outlook for the second half of 2010 and Yum!'s unique position in emerging markets.
As we outlined on the last call, our second quarter results were similar to the first quarter. Worldwide system sales grew by 4%, and operating profit increased 21% prior to foreign currency translation benefits and special items. EPS before special items grew by 17%. We have now produced two solid quarters, thanks to impressive performance from our China business and the benefit of $37 million of global commodity deflation. Based on this first half performance, we raised our full year EPS growth target and are well on our way to delivering 12% growth.
Yum! had solid profit balance in the quarter. Despite having only 1% same-store sales growth at YRI and flat same-store sales in the U.S., we are able to generate profit growth in these segments. When you add it all up, China grew operating profits by 33%, YRI by 7% before forex and the U.S. by 10%. U.S. margins benefited from improved margin performance at KFC, refranchising, other costs favorability and modest commodity deflation.
Overall, we continue to employ tight cost management. For the second quarter, our G&A declined by $2 million in the U.S. and by $6 million at Yum! corporate.  
On the flip side, our EPS was negatively impacted by overlapping last year's very low tax rate in the quarter. Our reported EPS declined by 6% due to the lap of the significant onetime gain in the second quarter of 2009. We noted on our release last night that we had a $60 million non-cash gain in 2009 related to increasing our ownership in the KFC Shanghai joint venture.
Overall, with the strength of our global portfolio, we achieved really solid operating performance in a fairly tough climate. As we look ahead to the balance of 2010, we believe we will need to rely more and more on improving sales to drive profit growth.
Let's try to put the balance of the year in perspective by business segment. First, in China. During the first half of the year, we benefited from an improvement in the Chinese consumer, where consumer confidence has now been positive year-over-year the last six months. At the same time, we saw a substantial benefit of about $30 million from commodity deflation in the first half of the year. 
We do not expect this highly favorable cost environment to continue. We now expect very high labor inflation in the second half of the year. In addition, instead of the benefits of deflation, we expect significant commodity inflation in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we continue to expect restaurant margins to increase only modestly for the full year. That means while we expect very strong first full year margins, we'll give back some of the first half gains during the balance of the year. We also now expect that there will be some favorability from currency in the balance of 2010 as a result of the Chinese government's decision to loosen the peg of the yuan to the U.S. dollar.
This year, our development is back-end loaded, but we feel good about delivering on our 2010 development goal of about 475 units. We expect China to continue to be a high-growth and high-return market. We continue to like our position in this highly important market of the 21st century.
While our first half operating profit at YRI was 4%, excluding foreign currency translation, we are excited about the opportunities in the second half of the year. Markets around the world continue to launch Streetwise, our KFC-branded value menu, which we expect will benefit transactions in the balance of the year. We also plan to continue the launch of our Krushers beverage line. We will continue to test and build other sales layers, as David mentioned.
Please remember that our same-store sales comparisons will get easier, as the third and fourth quarter of last year's were flat and down 2%, respectively. On a reported basis, we expect the benefits of foreign currency to reverse as we anticipate headwinds from currency translation in the fourth quarter.
In the U.S., we are still facing sustained unemployment and a concerned U.S. consumer. Again, the good news is we are lapping minus 6% same-store sales in the third quarter and even weaker minus 8% in the fourth quarter, we believe that our focus on value across all brands will drive modest same-store sales growth in the second half of the year.
As I mentioned earlier, our margins benefited from commodity deflation and other cost variabilities in the first half. While we do not expect some of these upside to continue, we will remain focused on cost management to help deliver profit growth in the second half.
Our U.S. refranchising initiative remains on track. We have made significant progress against refranchising the past couple of years. Importantly, we have marketed substantially all remaining stores to be refranchised at  KFC and Pizza Hut, and we are actively pursuing us pipeline. We are not in a hurry, but we do remain focused on getting these stores in the hands of the best operators. While it is difficult to forecast the timing of refranchising with precision, we still expect to complete refranchising during 2011. Overall, we are very confident that Yum! is well positioned to achieve our revised target of 12% earnings per share growth.
On our last call, I shared with you our unique strength in emerging markets. We outlined that we are currently the largest and fastest-growing restaurant player in this arena. Today, I would like to give you more insight into the profit significance of this opportunity for Yum!. I will also briefly highlight a few emerging markets. 
To use a common reference point, we are following the World Bank's guidelines in defining emerging markets, which generally includes countries whose gross national income per capita is less than $12,000. This group includes countries like China, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Russia, Vietnam and Brazil. 
Our growing presence in emerging markets is adding to our bottom line. Back in 2006, about 30% of our overall operating profit came from emerging markets. But in three short years, it had grown to about 45% of our profit mix. By 2015, we expect about 50% of Yum!'s operating profits to be generated by emerging markets. This equates to 15% compounded annual growth for these markets.
People also often ask me, ""What is our next China?"" I don't know if we have another China out there, but in partnership with our franchisees, we're investing in a host of emerging markets that we expect to drive growth for many years to come. The two leaders in emerging markets are Yum! and McDonald's. Yum! is in about 70 emerging market countries, while McDonald's is in about 50. Obviously, we'd love to invest in countries that have large populations and strong GDP growth. 
Today, we're going to highlight a few of these markets: Vietnam, Bangladesh and Nigeria. Interestingly, these are three countries where even McDonald's doesn't have a presence today. Vietnam is the second fastest growing Asian economy, behind only China. The company's 86 million people are young, with 50% of the population under the age of 27. We opened our first KFC at the end of 1997, and we are now the most trusted QSR brand in the country with almost 80 KFCs. Pizza Hut has about 10 stores. We expect this country to have about 150 stores by 2015.
Bangladesh is another country with a young population that we have recently begun to develop. About 50% of the almost 150 million people are under the age of 25. Right now, we have 11 restaurants with no other Western restaurant brands in sight. We hope to have 50 restaurants by 2015 in this country.
In Nigeria, the largest country in Africa with over 150 million people, our franchisee just opened the first two KFCs this year. We're excited about Nigeria, and really the rest of the African continent is home to over one billion people. 
These three franchise markets are examples of the huge opportunity ahead of Yum!. Together, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Nigeria are the home of almost 400 million people. We are the market leaders, and we have only 100 restaurants. This represents less than 0.3 restaurants per million people compared to the international average of three or the U.S. level of 50 restaurants per million people. So clearly, we have a huge runway for growth. In the coming calls and investor meetings, we plan to provide more and more information around our position in emerging markets and the tremendous growth opportunity that these markets represent.
So in summary, we are very comfortable with where we stand financially. We have two quarters under our belt and very significant operating profit growth. We are confident that we'll again to deliver our target of at least 10% EPS growth, and we are pleased that we raised our 2010 guidance to 12% growth. At the same time, we are focused on building the foundation for future growth through sales layers and development in emerging markets. Our goal is to build the business that will drive strong performance for our shareholders for many years to come. Back to you, David."

Same-store sales growth were up 8% in the second quarter. So it's been a great success for us because what we've basically done by doing this is we addressed the single biggest problem that we've had. And frankly, in our history, we've always been perceived to be the most expensive pizzas. So now we've made our products, our pizzas very affordable, and the consumer response has been overwhelmingly positive, as you would expect. The good news for us is our comparable margins have held steady as we've have had the sales lift, and we've had good, strong flow-through to offset this kind of discounting. And our brand metrics are obviously improving certainly on the value side. So as we go forward, when we look at the overall category, we think everyday value is a fact of life, and that we're going to have to work very hard to make sure that we make everyday value a staple of Pizza Hut. And we will have some premium-priced pizzas, primarily those pizzas that we provide category breakthrough innovation around. But we're really working hard at attacking our cost structure and working with our franchisees to make sure that we continue a very strong everyday value proposition as we go forward. So I think you will continue to see great value coming from Pizza Hut, which is a terrific opportunity for us. And one thing we've learned is being premium priced in this kind of environment that we're in right now is certainly not the strategy anyone can pursue. And we think that we understand what we have to do in the pizza category and Scott Bergren and the Pizza Hut team are working hand in hand with our franchisees to come up with an enduring way to provide value."

First of all, as a follow-up to the question that Jeff raised, we've talked about forex. Forex in the first half of the year, we had about a $28 million upside, and we just sort of said in the second half of the year, that will slow to about a $5 million net upside. The cost dynamics in China are interesting, when you look at it on a first half, second half of the year basis. And that's probably the biggest shift that we'll see, is in the first half of the year, we had about $30 million of commodity deflation. And in the second half, we expect about $15 million of inflation, most of that in the fourth quarter. The second turnaround is labor. We expected labor inflation coming into the year. However, the labor inflation, some of the rates that have occurred were higher than our initial expectations. And so in the first half of the year, we had about $12 million year-over-year increase in labor. In the back half, we expect that to be about $32 million. So that's an extra $20 million of labor in the second half versus the first half. So if you add that up, there's a $45 million swing on commodities, $20 million swing on labor. And so that's what's sort of driving less profit growth in China in the second half than the first half. The last thing, which is just a hard thing to know, and as I said in my speech, we're more relying on sales in the second half of the year. This is just obviously an environment where sales are still fairly hard to come by. So that's sort of our expectations when we look at the balance of the year."

You mentioned food and labor inflation in China. But for instance, if labor costs go up 8%, you should be able to offset that with one point of price, given that labor is a relatively low percent of your sales. Meanwhile, that labor inflation theoretically is your consumers making more money. So you just had some pricing roll-off in the second quarter here in China.

Regarding the ebbs and flows, to your point, we had an unbelievable position in the second quarter, where we had sort of relatively low labor cost, negative commodities and obviously solid same-store sales growth. In the later part of this year, we are having the inflation we talked about. Clearly though, we believe we have the pricing ability in China. We have arguably the strongest consumer brand in China. We have to take in pricing before. And If everybody's got labor inflation, I expect there to be pricing throughout the market, right? So I think the timing of that, to your point, is likely to be sort of late this year. They won't benefit this year but should cover us in 2011."

We've looked at this a bunch of different ways internally, John, in terms of last year, two years. In this case, you almost have to go back three years because if you remember, the earthquake hit in the middle of 2008. So you had very strong growth in the first half of that year. So what we said at the end of the first quarter was that, I actually feel better now than I did at the end of the first quarter. First quarter, we had the same number, 4% growth. At that point, we actually said that's probably as good a number to use as any in the second quarter. But the first quarter was really just based on two months because of the way our calendar is set up in China, and some of that was a holiday period. So it's hard to get a read on it. At this point, we have three more months of information. We have three more months where the consumer confidence in China is higher than a year ago. And it's not off the charts yet, but it's slowly coming back. So I think that the Chinese consumer is improving sort of slowly but steadily.

So I think the team is doing a great job of positioning ourselves to take advantage of what's going to inevitably be growing buying power. I know you followed us for a long time. The number of middle-class consumers, the estimates just keep going up by the millions every year, and we don't see that getting any smaller. And then the average per capita income's getting higher and higher of that group. So this is all good news for us. We're very well-positioned at KFC. Also, Pizza Hut Casual Dining, which, remember now, we have 464 casual dining units. We're doing the same thing there. We've made our products more affordable. We're leveraging asset with tea time. We actually, during the tea time period, have a higher market share of beverage consumption than Starbucks would have in China. So I think all of the things that we're doing, I mean, are positioning us to take advantage of the growing buying power in this country. And separately, one of the big markets, there's no question, there isn't anybody that doesn't think that Pizza Hut Home Delivery isn't going to be a viable brand or category in China, and we're there. We also see the Chinese fast food category emerging, and we continue to make progress for East Dawning. So our strategy is to have the leading brands in every significant category. What we're trying to do is build every one of our brands into power brands so we can compete effectively. And as the buying power of the consumer increases, which it will inevitably do, we will be able to take advantage of it. One thing that's kind of interesting, I think if you guys were all in the call in the fourth quarter of last year, even the second quarter call last year, there's been concern as to whether we'd ever be able to grow our same-store sales again. So we're pretty pleased with the fact that we've actually grown our same-store sales this year, 4%. We're feeling very good that we've had two straight quarters of 15% system sales growth. And all of that, Joe, has been transaction driven with no pricing. We obviously have, with our brand, pricing power. And as you know, our profit target for China is 15%. Our profits year-to-date are up 35%. So we're pretty happy that we're ahead of schedule. And we're really happy that each one of our brands are stronger today than they were yesterday from a consumer perspective. So I think when you step back and look at where we're at with China, it would be pretty difficult to imagine a better scenario. We couldn't be happier. And we just keep growing talent like you can't believe there, and that's one of those intangibles that you can't see. But our talent level's better. Our operations continue to be best in class. We're leveraging the asset throughout the day. We're not even -- we're in 1,000 stores in home delivery, 1,000 stores in 24-hour service. We're just getting started. We expect to have at least 14,000 KFCs some day. So it's just a matter of time. I would say we'll have ebbs and flows in China. We'll have ups and downs and all that kind of good stuff, but we're really glad we're there. We're really glad we're there with the team that we have. We're really glad that we have the brands that we have. And this is a long-term proposition. And it's really great to get the short-term growth along the way."

On your Pizza Hut question, Pizza Hut has been several points behind KFC on a year-to-date basis, which isn't surprising given the environment. It's more casual dining and therefore premium priced. So that difference is there. I'm not sure if that will change much in the balance of the year. We've also struggled with Pizza Hut results in the U.K. year-to-date. And that's been some of the reason for the margin decline that you saw in the second quarter. We're working to make that better. And hopefully, that will be better in the second half of the year. So we expect margins to get a little bit better in the second half as well."

However, one of the things we did as we waited really until the first quarter of this year, the end of the first quarter, before we really marketed all of the KFCs. So the good news at least from the refranchising team's perspective is pretty much everything that we planned to refranchised is now in the market. So as I sort of said in my speech, we're really actively pursuing that. So we've got a lot of discussions on various size transactions. So it's really hard to predict when it will fall. So it's really hard. Even an annual estimate on this is tough, which is why and as I said in both our release and the speech that we plan to finish sometime in 2011.

As I mentioned to you earlier, the American Customer Satisfaction Index, we had an eight-point swing, which is the highest of any major brands. So clearly, the Kentucky Grilled Chicken has made KFC in the U.S. much more relevant than it would have otherwise been. I think as you look at the current performance, we have about 10% to 15% mix of Kentucky Grilled Chicken. I was just reading the AKFC Quarterly (sic) [AKFCF Quarterly], which is the franchise magazine that the franchisees publish, and they tell it as a success and feel good about it, and we've got a base that we can build from. So I think that we're very pleased that we launched it. I think some challenges that we have is we're working on better consistency just in key size. And we've got a project that help us work on that with our suppliers. I think that's one thing that we think will help us get even more sustainability over the long term, just from a product perspective. But this product, John, as you know and I'm sure you've read it has had rave reviews from food critics. I mean it's an outstanding product. I mean there's no question about it. It's five-star taste. And it's been named Product of the Year of people in the industry who develop -- people have recognized our people who developed the product. So I think it was a huge win. When I look at KFC's prospects here in the U.S., I think we're working on the things that will really matter: improving our chicken on the bone with better balance between the fried and the grilled; introducing portable products. We now have an outstanding filet, grilled fillet and fried fillet that's allowing us to do products like the Double Down and also move into the sandwich arena. So that's been a big move forward for the brand. One of our big challenges is that our pricing approach is casual dining pricing because we're a high-end business. And when you have pricing that gets into the casual dining arena or close to it, there aren't too many concepts that are growing robustly today. So our value proposition is a major challenge for us as we go forward. I think as it relates to investment, that's one of the challenges that I think we do have with the KFC system. It is a tough time right now. Future investments will -- we need to get the business healthier. But we have an operating platform and equipment package that gives us more variety than we've ever had from an opportunity, from an innovation perspective. If you recall, KFC in the U.S. is the only place in the, world where we've invested in back-of-the-house capability for the franchisees because we felt it was so important for us to get into grilled chicken. We helped fund and finance the ovens. I think this shows how committed we are to growing the business here in the U.S. because this is the origin of the brand. And so I think the team here we have is outstanding at working hard in a difficult situation. And we think we'll have steady, slow but steady progresses as we go forward. The great news is that KFC outside the United States is something for the U.S. franchise system to aspire towards being. And we've got a team here very dedicated to making that happen, and we're going to be relentless in terms of making that happen because we think we could be much more proud of the KFC brand here in the U.S. Even though we're very proud of it, very proud of the origin, we think we can be even better. And our job is to push the franchise system into doing the things that need to be done: Improving ops, improving assets, improving our value proposition."

McDonald's threw everything in the kitchen sink at us in terms of price discounting, and we're already at breakeven in Tucson. We're also in three other markets that we're working towards that same goal. I just met with the franchisees two weeks ago, meeting with Greg Creed. We all know that the single biggest thing we can do in Taco Bell is to develop another $100,000 to $300,000 sales layer, because we've got the best unit economics outside of McDonald's that I think, or in the industry, second most profitable brand. So in our mind, breakfast is not a question of whether, it's a question of when. And we feel like we're making more and more progress, and we know how we can get even better. The other thing that we're very excited about is we have a beverage platform at Taco Bell that will be going into a complete market in launching. And our objective, right now when you upgrade our assets with our new Bold assets, you get a 7% to 8% increase in sales. We're hoping that it will take it to 15% to 16% increase, which will help fund more reinvestment in the Taco Bell. So the breakfast and beverage platforms, we think, are really very positive developments for us. And the only thing I can say is we're further along now than we were when I talk to you about it last time. We continue to make progress. But we're committed to these sales layers because this is what's going to really invigorate the brand. We think we should have 8,000 Taco Bells in the U.S. I mean, why not? Burger King does. And you can't tell me that Burger King has a more charismatic brand, more loved brand than Taco Bell. Taco Bell is a brand that everybody talks about. So we've got a great franchise, but we need $100,000 to $300,000 more in sales. So these big platforms are what we're really committed to getting after. The other thing, even with our existing equipment, we can get into home meal replacement. So we're bundling up our home meal replacement ideas, taco meals, Tuesday tacos, things like that, that we're working on, that also give us a chance to get some maybe lower-hanging fruit, easier-to-do, significant sales growth as we go forward. So I'm very optimistic, I think you can tell, about the Taco Bell brand. Right now, we've got transaction growth, slightly positive sales. But when I think of the future, it's really bright."

I’m pleased to report we are raising our full-year 2010 EPS growth forecast to 12% based on our strong second quarter and first half performance. Our second quarter EPS growth of 17% before special items was fueled by profit growth in each of our three divisions.
We were particularly pleased with our business in China which reported robust profit growth of 33% driven by same-store sales growth, margin improvement and continued unit development. In the U.S. we were also pleased to see significant improvement in operating profit despite flat same-store sales.
Our primary focus is to drive same-store sales growth balance of the year given the challenging consumer environment. At Yum! Restaurants International we increased system sales 4% prior to foreign currency translation benefit. We expect stronger sales and profit growth for the balance of the year at YRI.
Now let me take you through our key strategies and trends for each of our divisions. First, I’m obviously very proud of our China team’s performance. Same-store sales grew by 4% and units expanded 12%. Our China division generated operating profit growth of 33%.
Through the first half of this year our China division’s profit growth has been 35%. New unit development continues to be the major driver of our growth and we remain the largest U.S. retail developer in China. We’ve opened 155 new units in our first two quarters and expect to open about 475 this year. Our China new unit returns continue to be the best in our business.
Now let me share with you a few highlights from each of our leading brands in China. Let’s start with KFC. We just opened our 3,000th KFC in June and as you know we’re in over 600 cities with average unit volumes of $1.4 million. KFC continues to be the largest western QSR concept in mainland China.
We have three key initiatives to grow our business and leverage our assets. First, KFC breakfast is in virtually all of our restaurants. We are opening at 6 A.M. and breakfast now makes up 10% of transactions. Next is delivery, which is now available in 126 cities and nearly 1,300 units. Last, our 24-hour operations initiative is generating incremental sales and is in now about 1,000 restaurants.
Pizza Hut Casual Dining continues to be the leading western casual dining concept in China with 469 units in a 122 cities. We expect to open 63 Pizza Hut Casual Dining restaurants this year, which is up from 55 last year.
You may recall that beginning last year we slowed the growth of this concept substantially while we repositioned our menu. With the success we’ve had we’ve begun to increase development in Tier 1 to 3 cities.
Our new menu strategy continues to drive double-digit same-store sales growth. We offer a broad variety of entrées including beef, chicken and rice dishes along with appetizers, beverages and deserts. We are having solid success building a true casual dining concept with everyday affordable value.
We also continue to invest behind the development of our emerging brands. Pizza Hut Home Service in the home delivery category now has over 100 units in 11 cities. East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand, continues to progress as we drive for scalable economics. Additionally, we own 27% of Little Sheep, the leading brand in the hotpot category, which is the largest casual dining concept in China.
In summary, we are very pleased with the progress we are making, executing our China strategy to build leading brands in every significant restaurant category.
Next, Yum! Restaurants International, where our strategy is to drive aggressive expansion and build strong brands everywhere. Similar to our China business, new unit development is a key driver for growth.
Our Yum! Restaurants International growth strategy differs from China and that nearly 90% of our 284 new units so far this year that we have developed, have been developed by our strong network of franchises. In fact over 85% of the nearly 14,000 traditional restaurants in this division are franchise units, which generate a steady growing stream of franchise royalties. We expect to add about 900 new units for the full year.
Our second quarter system sales grew 4% excluding foreign currency translation, while same store sales were up 1%. Overall, we drove 7% operating profit growth excluding foreign currency translation for the quarter.
Based on the success we’ve had in China, we are aggressively going after sales layers at YRI. In particular, KFC our largest concept in Yum! Restaurants International is making major progress on driving value. Value menus are in place in all our key markets and we’ll be expanding further this year.
Our Krushers line of frozen beverages continues to expand and is now available in over 2,100 stores and over 35 countries. Our KFC breakfast initiative, which we call KFC A.M., also continues to grow.
Pizza Hut continues to make progress elevating its brand offering and strengthening its position as the leading western casual dining concept with everyday affordable prices. While we have weaker transaction trends due to Pizza Hut’s higher average guest check, we are encouraged by the progress we are making with our expanded menu, including a wider variety of appetizers, beverages, entrées and desserts.
Yum! Restaurants International’s new growth markets, France, India and Russia, delivered 13% system sales growth prior to foreign currency translation this quarter. For the first time, our KFC France business used national television in May and as you would expect saw strong upward shift in sales. Scale then enables television advertising is the result of us now having 100 restaurants in France.
On July 1, the Company also completed the exercise of our option with our Russian partner and we now have full management control of the KFC-Rostik’s brand in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States. This market includes more than 150 co-branded KFC-Rostik’s across Russia and the CIS, of which we now own approximately 50 with the remainder owned by our franchises. We are excited about this market due to its large population and its appetite for chicken.
Our business in India continues to perform well with solid same-store sales growth and new unit expansion. We now have over 70 KFCs and 160 Pizza Huts in India. Taco Bell International also continues to expand.
We opened our first Taco Bell in the United Kingdom on June 28 and our first in Korea just last week. In fact, we’ve opened Taco Bells in seven new countries over the past two years. Early results are promising and we are working very hard to make Taco Bell a global brand.
Overall, Yum! Restaurants International growth and development is on track. Importantly, we have a leading position and substantial runway for growth in emerging markets. I’d like to take a moment to thank our growth-oriented franchise partners for the investment that they continue to make and for partnering with us to build a global business we can all be proud of.
Next, onto our U.S. business where our focus is to improve our brand positions, consistency and returns. Our U.S. business achieved solid operating profit growth of 10% with substantial improvement in restaurant margin while posting flat same-store sales.
We are happy with the improvement in the business and are pleased with the strategies we are executing across each brand. We look for sales growth to improve modestly at Taco Bell in the second half and stay strong at Pizza Hut. At KFC, we remain confident in our long-term strategy, but expect sales to be soft for the balance of the year.
Taco Bell, our largest and most profitable brand in the U.S. and in fact the second most profitable brand in our category in the U.S., continued its trend of growing transactions and grew same-store sales 1% for the quarter. Taco Bell’s pipeline of products is strong for the balance of the year focusing on value to the consumer in a market clearly focused everyday value.
We also continue to make progress testing breakfast, home meal replacement options and a new beverage platform. Taco Bell is performing well in this challenging market and we’ve never been more confident than we are today about our future prospects for this great brand.
Pizza Hut led the way with 8% same-store sales growth for the quarter and our ‘$10 Any Pizza’ promotion continues to be a huge consumer hit. We continue to leverage this promotion as well as discount a day of the week special such as Tuscani Tuesdays for our Pasta line and Wing Wednesdays.
People ask us about the sustainability of our ‘$10 Any’ promotion and one thing I certainly know is what’s not sustainable and that’s maintaining the high menu prices we had in our restaurants previously. Pizza Hut is very focused on working with our franchisees to maintain everyday value.
We are also very focused on leveraging our asset like we are doing with the Tuscani Tuesdays where we introduced pasta. Now we are marketing on Tuesdays and we are doing the same thing with the Wings on Wednesdays. So, we’ve talked about leveraging our assets in the past. That strategy is definitely being executed and being done very well by the Pizza Hut team. Pizza Hut’s performance is strong and I want to assure you that we are working very hard to sustain it.
Now let me put KFC into perspective. As I’ve said earlier, we expect sales to be soft for the balance of the year. Our focus remains on the following key areas; improving operations, value, balanced options, featuring our grilled products, portable product innovation like the Double Down and asset upgrades. As you would expect each of these major initiatives will take time to implement, there is no quick fix we are, however, making progress.
Recently KFC had the single largest year-over-year improvement of any major QSR brand in the American Customer Satisfaction Index. We take this as a positive sign that our efforts to launch Kentucky Grilled Chicken to complement our world-class, our world famous fried chicken and simultaneously improve our operations are beginning to pay off. In spite of this progress, sales have been underperforming and we expect continued weak sales in the third quarter, however.
That said, we are in the midst of a transformation to truly make KFC a more relevant and better operated brand and make no mistake, we have a great team that is providing the customer-focused leadership required to do just that.
However, from a pure financials perspective given our tremendous global growth and the success that we’ve had with Taco Bell in the United States, KFC represents less than 10% of the U.S. division’s profits and less than 3% of the Company’s overall profits.
We expect 2010 profit at KFC to be higher than last year and the execution of our refranchising strategy sets the brand up to make more money going forward with less capital investment.
Overall, our U.S. performance has improved, particularly with operating profit growth in the second quarter. We are encouraged that same-store sales are now positive at Taco Bell, pleased with the continued success of Pizza Hut and confident in the long-term strategy at KFC.
So let me wrap this up. Quite simply, we’ve had a great first half of the year with strong operating profit growth. We are pleased with the profit growth in each of our business units, specifically our strong performance in China. We’re confident in delivering our raised target of 12% EPS growth.
Now let me hand it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Rick Carucci.

Our second quarter results, our outlook for the second half of 2010 and Yum!’s unique position in emerging markets. As we outlined on the last call, our second quarter results were similar to the first quarter.
Worldwide system sales grew by 4% and operating profit increased 21% prior to foreign currency translation benefits and special items. EPS before special items grew by 17%. We have now produced two solid quarters, thanks to impressive performance from our China business and the benefit of $37 million of global commodity deflation. Based on this first half performance, we raised our full-year EPS growth target and are well on our way to delivering 12% growth.
Yum! had solid profit balance in the quarter. Despite having only 1% same-store sales growth at YRI and flat same-store sales in the U.S., we were able to generate profit growth in these segments. When you add it all up, China grew operating profits by 33%, YRI by 7% before forex and the U.S. by 10%. U.S. margins benefited from improved margin performance at KFC, re-franchising other cost favorability and modest commodity deflation.
Overall, we continue to employ tight cost management. For the second quarter, our G&A declined by $2 million in the U.S. and by $6 million at Yum! corporate. On the flipside, our EPS was negatively impacted by overlapping last year’s very low tax rate in the quarter. Our reported EPS declined by 6% due to the lap of the significant one-time gain in the second quarter of 2009.
We noted in our release last night that we had a $60 million non-cash gain in 2009 related to increasing our ownership in the KFC Shanghai joint venture. Overall, with the strength of our global portfolio, we achieved really solid operating performance in a fairly tough climate. As we look ahead to the balance of 2010, we believe we will need to rely more and more on improving sales to drive profit growth.
Let’s try to put the balance of the year in perspective by business segment. First in China, during the first half of the year, we benefited from an improvement in the Chinese consumer where consumer confidence has now been positive year-over-year in the last six months. At the same time, we saw a substantial benefit of about $30 million from commodity deflation in the first half of the year.
We do not expect this highly favorable cost environment to continue. We now expect very high labor inflation in the second half of the year. In addition, instead of the benefits of deflation, we expect significant commodity inflation in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we continue to expect restaurant margins to increase only modestly for the full year. That means while we expect very strong first full year margins, we’ll give back some of the first half gains during the balance of the year.
We also now expect that there will be some favorability from currency in the balance of 2010 as a result of the Chinese government’s decision to loosen the peg of the Yuan to the U.S. dollar. This year, our development is back end loaded, but we feel good about delivering on our 2010 development goal of about 475 units. We expect China to continue to be a high growth and high return market. We continue to like our position in this highly important market of the 21st century.
While our first half operating profit at YRI was 4% excluding foreign currency translation, we are excited about the opportunities in the second half of the year. Markets around the world continue to launch street-wise our KFC branded value menu, which we expect will benefit transactions in the balance of the year. We also have plans to continue to launch of our Krushers beverage line. We will continue to test and build others sales layers as David mentioned.
Please remember that our same-store sales comparisons will get easier as the third and fourth quarter of last year’s were down - or flat and down 2% respectively. On a reported basis, we expect the benefits of foreign currency to reverse as we anticipate headwinds from currency translations in the fourth quarter.
In the U.S., we are still facing sustained unemployment and a concerned U.S. consumer. Again, the good news is we are lapping minus 6% same-stores sales in the third quarter and even weaker minus 8% in the fourth quarter. We believe that our focus on value across all brands will drive modest same-store sales growth in the second half of the year.
As I mentioned earlier, our margins benefited from commodity deflation and other costs variabilities in the first half, while we do not expect some of this upside to continue, we will remain focused on cost management and help deliver profit growth in the second half.
Our U.S. refranchising initiative remains on track. We have made significant progress against refranchising in the past couple of years. Importantly, we have marketed substantially all remaining stores to be refranchised at KFC and Pizza Hut and we are actively pursuing this pipeline. We are not in a hurry, but we do remained focus on getting these stores in the hands of the best operators.
While it is difficult to forecast the timing of refranchising with precision, we still expect to complete refranchising during 2011. Overall, we are very confident that Yum! is well positioned to achieve our revised target of 12% earnings per share growth.
On our last call, I shared with you our unique strength in emerging markets. We outlined that we’re currently the largest and fastest growing restaurant player in this arena. Today, I would like to give you more insight into the profit significance of this opportunity for Yum!. I will also briefly highlight a few emerging markets.
To use a common reference point, we are following the World Bank’s guidelines in defining emerging markets, which generally includes countries whose gross national income per capita is less than $12,000. This group includes countries like China, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Russia, Vietnam and Brazil.
Our growing presence in emerging markets is adding to our bottom line. Back in 2006, about 30% of our overall operating profit came from emerging markets, but in three short years, it had grown to about 45% of our profit mix. By 2015, we expect about 60% of Yum!’s operating profits to be generated by emerging markets. This equates to 15% compounded annual growth for these markets.
People often ask me, what is our next China? I don’t know if we have another China out there, but in partnership with our franchisees, we’re investing in a host of emerging markets that we expect to drive growth for many years to come.
The two leaders in emerging markets are Yum! and McDonald’s. Yum! is in about 70 emerging market countries, while McDonald’s is in about 60. Obviously, we love to invest in countries that have large populations and strong GDP growth.
Dave is going to highlight a few of these markets, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Nigeria. Interestingly, these are three countries where even McDonald’s doesn’t have a presence today.
Vietnam is the second fastest growing Asian economy behind only China. The country’s 86 million people are young with 60% of the population under the age of 27. We opened our first KFC at the end of 1997 and we are now the most trusted QSR brand in the country with almost 80 KFCs. Pizza Hut has about 10 stores. We expect this country to have about 150 stores by 2015.
Bangladesh is another country with a young population that we have recently begun to develop. About 60% of the almost 160 million people are under the age of 25. Right now, we have 11 restaurants with no other western restaurant brands in site. We’ll have 50 restaurants by 2015 in this country.
In Nigeria, the largest country in Africa with over 150 million people, our franchisee just opened the first two KFCs this year. We’re excited about Nigeria and really the rest of the African continent is home to over one billion people.
These three franchised markets are examples of the huge opportunity ahead of Yum!. Together, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Nigeria, are the home of almost 400 million people. We are the market leaders and we have only 100 restaurants. This represents less than 0.3 restaurants per million people compared to the international average of three or the U.S. level of 60 restaurants per million people. So clearly, we have a huge runway for growth.
In the coming calls, investor meetings, we plan to provide more and more information around our position in emerging markets and the tremendous growth opportunity that these markets represent.
So in summary, we are very comfortable with where we stand financially. We have two quarters under our belt and very significant operating profit growth. We are confident that we will again deliver our target of at least 10% EPS growth and we are pleased that we raised our 2010 guidance to 12% growth.
At the same time, we are focused on building the foundation for future growth through sales layers and development in emerging markets. Our goal is to build a business that will drive strong performance for our shareholders for many years to come. Back to you, David.

Same-store sales growths were up 8% in the second quarter. So, it’s been a great success for us because what we’ve basically done by doing this is we addressed the single biggest problem that we’ve had and frankly in our history we’ve always been perceived to be the most expensive pizza.
So now we’ve made our products, our pizzas very affordable and the consumer response has been overwhelmingly positive as you would expect. The good news for us is, our comparable margins have held steady as we had the sales lift and we’ve had good strong flow through to offset this kind of discounting. And our brand metrics are obviously improving, certainly on the value side.
So as we go forward, we think when we look at the overall category, we think everyday value is a fact of life and that we’re going to have to work very hard to make sure that we make everyday value a staple of Pizza Hut. We will have some premium priced pizzas, primarily, those pizzas that we provide category breakthrough innovation around, but we’re really working hard at attacking our cost structure and working with our franchisees to make sure that we continue a very strong everyday value proposition as we go forward.
So I think you will continue to see great value coming from Pizza Hut, which is a terrific opportunity for us. One thing we’ve learned is being premium priced in this kind of environment that we’re in right now is certainly not the strategy anyone can pursue and we think that we understand what we have to do in the Pizza category and Scott Bergren and the Pizza team are working hand-in-hand with our franchisees to come up with an enduring way to provide value.

First was a follow-up to the question that Jeff raised. We talked about.  in the first half of the year, we had about $28 million upside and we just said in the second half of the year that will slow to about $5 million net upside. The cost dynamics in China are interesting when you look at it on a first half, second half of the year basis and that’s probably the biggest shift that we’ll see is in the first half of the year we had about $30 million of commodity deflation. In the second half we expect about $15 million of inflation, most of that in the fourth quarter.
The second turnaround is labor. We expected labor inflation coming into the year. However, the labor inflation, some of the rates that have occurred were higher than our initial expectations and so in the first half of the year we had about $12 million year-over-year increase in labor. In the back half we expect that to be about $32 million. So, that’s an extra $20 million of labor in the second half versus the first half. So if you add that up, it’s a $45 million swing on commodities, $20 million swing on labor. And so that’s what sort of driving less profit growth in China in the second half than the first half.
The last thing, which is just a hard thing to know, and as I said in my speech, we’re more relying on sales in the second half of the year and this is just obviously an environment where sales are still fairly hard to come by. So, that’s sort of our expectations when we look at the balance of the year.

You mentioned food and labor inflation in China, but for instance if labor costs go up 8%, you should be able to offset that with one point of price given that labor is a relatively low percent of your sales. Meanwhile, that labor inflation theoretically is your consumers making more money. So you just had some pricing roll off in the second quarter here in China. I’m thinking about your pricing how that will come into play. Maybe you are thinking pricing might come back late in the year not enough to help you but sets you up well for calendar ‘11. How should we think about that?

So, overall, we like where we stand. Regarding the ebbs and flows to your point, we had an unbelievable position in the second quarter, where we had sort of relatively low labor costs, negative commodities and obviously solid same-store sales growth. In the later part of this year, we are having the inflation we talked about.
Clearly though, we believe we have the pricing ability in China. We have arguably the strongest consumer brand in China. We have to take in pricing before and if everybody has got labor inflation, I expect it would be pricing throughout the market, right? So I think the timing of that, to your point, is likely to be sort of late this year that won’t benefit this year but should cover us in 2011.

Could you talk a little bit about sales trends during the quarter. I think coming out of the first quarter, there was some excitement about the 4% comp, because it was against a relatively difficult comparison relative to the rest of this year. This quarter, if you just use that two-year math, it wasn’t quite as robust and maybe two-year comparisons just don’t work anymore. So how do you think about ex-pricing the back half of the year in same-store sales in China? Have there been any material acceleration/deceleration patterns or is the 4% just a good number to plug in as we think about the back half of the year and if you want to talk about the last six weeks since the quarter ended in China that would always be helpful as well?

Short answer to your question, 5%, 4% is good as anything out there, but that’s your judgment to make. It’s really hard. We’ve looked at this in a bunch of different ways internally, John, in terms of last year, two-year. In this case, you almost have to go back three years, because if you remember, the earthquake hit in the middle of 2008. So you had very strong growth in the first half of that year.
So what we said at the end of the first quarter was, I actually feel better now than I did at the end of the first quarter. First quarter we had the same number, 4% growth. At that point, we actually said that’s probably a good number to use as any in the second quarter. But the first quarter was really just based on two months, because the way our calendar is set up in China and some of that was a holiday period. So it’s hard to get a read on it. At this point, we have three more months of information. We have three more months where the consumer confidence in China is higher than a year ago and it’s not off the charts yet, but it’s slowly coming back. So I think that the Chinese consumer is improving sort of slowly but steadily, isn’t all the way back yet, but it’s better than last year.

What really happened is that this year sort of they made up for last year being a light year, right? So you had higher than normal labor inflation. You would think that that’s going to help consumers. It’s hard to tell the timing of that.
So on the one way, obviously, if more people have money in their pockets, they’re going to spend some of that, but it’s really hard for us to quantify, but obviously, the growing middle class in China is a benefit to us from a sales perspective, but also from a development perspective as more trades come in. So it’s not necessarily a bad overall development, it’s just sort of impacts our profit from quarter-to-quarter.

So I think the team is doing a great job of positioning ourselves to take advantage of what’s going to inevitably be growing buying power. I know you’ve followed us for a long time. The number of middle class consumers, the estimates just keep going up by the millions every year and we don’t see that getting any smaller and then the average per capita income is getting higher and higher of that group. So this is all good news for us.
We are very well positioned at KFC. Also Pizza Hut Casual Dining, remember now we have 464 casual dining units and we’re doing the same thing and we’ve made our products more affordable. We’re leveraging assets with tea time. We actually, during the tea time period, have a higher market share of beverage consumption than Starbucks would have in China.
So I think all of the things that we’re doing are positioning us to take advantage of the growing buying power in this country and separately, one of the big markets, there is no question that there isn’t anybody that doesn’t think the Pizza Hut Home Delivery isn’t going to be a viable brand or category in China and we’re there. We also see the Chinese fast food category emerging and we continue to make progress for East Dawning. So our strategy is to have the leading brands in every significant category.
What we’re trying to do is build every one of our brands into power brand, so we can compete effectively and as the buying power of the consumer increases, which it will inevitably do, we will be able to take advantage of it. One thing that’s kind of interesting, I think you guys were all in the call in the fourth quarter of last year, even the second quarter call last year. There was a big concern as to whether we would ever be able to grow our same-store sales again. So, we’re pretty pleased with the fact that we’ve actually grown our same-store sales this year 4%.
We’re feeling very good that we’ve had two straight quarters of 15% system sales growth and all of that, Joe, has been transaction driven with no pricing. You know we obviously have with our brand pricing power and as you know, our profit target for China is 15% and our profits year-to-date are up 35%. So, we’re pretty happy that we are ahead of schedule and we’re really happy that each one of our brands are stronger today than they were yesterday from a consumer perspective. So, I think when you step back and look at where we’re at with China, it’s pretty difficult to imagine a better scenario. We couldn’t be happier and we just keep growing talent like you can’t believe there and that’s one of those intangibles that you can’t see, but our talent level is better.
Our operations continue to be best-in-class. We are leveraging the asset throughout the day. We’re in a 1,000 stores in home delivery, 1,000 stores in 24-hour service. We’re just getting started. We expect to have at least 14,000 KFCs someday. So, it’s just a matter of time. I always say we’ll have ebbs and flows in China as well, ups and downs and all that kind of good stuff, but we’re really glad we’re there. We’re really glad we’re there with the team we have. We’re really glad that we have the brands that we have and this is a long-term proposition and it’s really great to get the short-term growth along the way.

We’re going to continue to have the development growth that we always have. You saw that the second quarter results were little bit better than the first quarter. We start lapping easier numbers as we get into the back half of the year. So, we’re lapping negative same-store sales in the back half of 2009. So we feel good about our ability to do that.
On your pizza question, Pizza Hut has been several points behind KFC on a year-to-date basis, which isn’t surprising given the environment. It’s more casual dining and therefore premium price. So, that difference is there. I’m not sure if that will change much in the balance of the year. We’ve also struggled with Pizza Hut results in the U.K. year-to-date and that’s been some of the reason for the margin decline that you saw in the second quarter. We’re working to make that better and hopefully that will be better in the second half of the year. So, we expect margins to get a little bit better in the second half as well.

And then the second was in some Tier 3 cities, the second units that we’re putting in Tier 3 cities weren’t performing as well. The good news is that, we are still being pretty cautious on some of the Tier 1 cities. The Tier 3 are actually - the results we’ve had are looking better. So, we feel more confident in going into more and more Tier 3 cities and we slowly started to ramp back up the development in Tier 1. The returns on Pizza Hut are not significantly different than the KFC type of return, so we’re talking cash pay backs in less than three years.

Well, I think Kentucky Grilled Chicken, if you look at all the brand majors has done nothing but improve our position in the marketplaces. I mentioned to you earlier, the American Customer Satisfaction Index, we had a eight point swing, which is the highest of any major brand. So clearly the Kentucky Grilled Chicken has made KFC in the U.S. much more relevant than it would have otherwise have been.
I think as you look at the current performance, we have about 10% to 15% mix of Kentucky Grilled Chicken. I was just reading the KFC quarterly, which is the franchise magazine that the franchisees publish and they tab it as a success and feel good about it and we’ve got a base that we can build from. So, I think that we are very pleased that we launched it. I think some challenges that we have is we are working on better consistency just in P side and we’ve got a project that help us work on that with our suppliers.
I think that’s one thing that we think will help us get even more sustainability over the long-term just from a product perspective. This product, John, as you know and I’m sure you’ve read has had rave reviews from food critics. I mean, it’s an outstanding product. There is no question about it. It’s five-star taste and it has been named product of the year. People have recognized our people who developed the product. So, I think it was a huge win.
When I look at KFC’s prospects here in the U.S., I think we are working on the things that will really matter. Improving our chicken on the bone with a better balance between the fried and the grilled, introducing portable products. We now have outstanding filet, grilled filet and fried filet, that’s allowing us to do products like the Double Down and also move into the sandwich arena. So that’s been a big move forward for the brand.
One of our big challenges is that our pricing approaches casual dining pricing, because we are a high-end business. And when you have pricing that gets into that casual dining arena or close to it, there aren’t too many concepts that are growing robustly today. So our value proposition is a major challenge for us as we go forward. I think as it relates to investment, that’s one of the challenges that I think we do have with the KFC system. It is tough time right now. Future investments, we need to get the business healthier, but we have an operating platform, an equipment package that gives us more variety than we’ve ever had from an opportunity, from an innovation perspective.
If you recall, KFC in the U.S. is the only place in the world where we’ve invested in back-of-the house capability for the franchisees, because we felt it was so important for us to get into grilled chicken. We helped fund and finance the ovens. I think this shows how committed we are to growing the business here in the U.S., because this is the origin of the brand. So I think the team here we have is outstanding and working hard in a difficult situation and we think we’ll have slow but steady progress as we go forward.
The great news is that KFC outside the United States is something for the U.S. franchise system to aspire towards being. We’ve got a team here very dedicated to making that happen and we’re going to be relentless in terms of making that happen, because we think we can be much more proud of the KFC brand here in the U.S. Even though we are very proud of it, very proud of the origin, we think we can be even better and our job is to push the franchise system into doing the things that need to be done; improving ops, improving assets, improving our value proposition.

McDonalds threw everything in the kitchen sink at us in terms of price discounting and we’re already at breakeven in Tucson. We’re also in three other markets that we’re working towards that same goal. I just met with the franchisees two weeks ago, meeting with Greg Creed. We all know that the single biggest thing we can do at Taco Bell is to develop another $100,000 to $300,000 sales layer, because we’ve got the best unit economics outside of McDonalds that I think are in the industry second most profitable brand.
So, in our mind, breakfast is not a question of whether. It’s a question of when and we feel like we’re making more and more progress and we know how we can get even better. The other thing that we’re very excited about is we have a beverage platform at Taco Bell that we’ll be going into a complete market launching and right now when you just upgrade our assets with our new bold assets, you get a 7% to 8% increase in sales.
We’re hoping that will take it to 15% to 16% increase which will help fund more reinvestment into Taco Bell. So the breakfast and beverage platforms we think are really very positive developments for us and the only thing I can say is we’re further along now than we were when I talked to you about it last time.
We continue to make progress, where we’re committed to these sales layers, because this is what’s going to really invigorate the brand. We think we should have 8,000 Taco Bell in the U.S. I mean, why not? Burger King does and you can’t tell me that Burger King has a more charismatic brand, more loved brand than Taco Bell. Taco Bell is a brand that everybody talks about. So we’ve got a great franchise, but we need $100,000 to $300,000 more in sales. So these big platforms are what we’re really committed to getting after.
The other thing even with our existing equipment, we can get into home meal replacement. So we are bundling up our home meal replacement ideas, Taco meals, Tuesday Tacos, things like that that we’re working on that also give us a chance to give some may be lower hanging fruit easier to do with significant sales growth as we go forward. So I am very optimistic, I think you can tell about the Taco Bell brand. Right now, we’ve got transaction growth, slightly positive sales, but when I think of the future, it’s really bright.

For example like Pizza Hut, since the launch of ‘$10 any’ and some of these other things, are restaurant level margins, not op margins, but restaurant level margins, are they up year-on-year? Taco Bell was in the mid-18s last year. How is it trending? Is it up year-on-year? I mean it has to be some portion of those two in order to get to the totals, it can’t just KFC. So if you could help me a little bit understand the margins trends at Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, that’ll be great?

Nothing really major to report on the mix something happening within the Taco Bell portfolio, so we’re going to keep an eye on the sales and sales will probably be the biggest driver there. The only thing that’s unusual is KFC has benefited a little bit more because this year they’ve gotten a disproportionate amount of commodity benefit so far and we expect that probably to continue a little bit as well in the back half of the year.

We decided at the beginning of 2009 really to take a fairly significant G&A reduction. So right now with the reduction that occurs now is mostly, I’ll call it, store-related type of G&A. So area coaches and those types of moves, but when you put it together, we are still confident that we could at least offset the amount of trade down you get between restaurant margin and royalty. So that’s why we sort of said we can make at least as much money at KFC on a long-term basis as we are still confident that that math will work for us. With the G&A reduction and the royalty will be at least as high as that we are making in restaurant margin today.

I'm pleased to report we are raising our full year 2010 EPS growth forecast to 12% based on our strong second quarter and first half performance. Our second quarter EPS growth of 17% before special items was fueled by profit growth in each of our three divisions. 
We were particularly pleased with our business in China, which reported robust profit growth of 33%, driven by same-store sales growth, margin improvement and continued unit development. In the U.S., we were also pleased to see significant improvement in the operating profit despite flat same-store sales. Our primary focus is to drive same-store sales growth balance of the year, given the challenging consumer environment. 
At Yum! Restaurants International, we increased system sales 4% prior to foreign currency translation benefit. We expect stronger sales and profit growth through the balance of the year at YRI.
Now let me take you through our key strategies and trends for each of our divisions. First, I'm obviously very proud of our China team's performance. Same-store sales grew by 4% and units expanded 12%. Our China division generated operating profit growth of 33%. Through the first half of this year, our China division's profit growth has been 35%. New unit development continues to be the major driver of our growth, and we remain the largest U.S. retail developer in China. We've opened 155 new units in our first two quarters and expect to open about 475 this year. Our China new unit returns continue to be the best in our business.
Now let me share with you a few highlights from each of our leading brands in China. Let's start with KFC. We just opened our 3,000th KFC in June. And as you know, we're in over 600 cities with average unit volumes of $1.4 million. KFC continues to be the largest Western QSR concept in Mainland China. 
We have three key initiatives to grow our business and leverage our assets. First, KFC breakfast is in virtually all of our restaurants. We're opening at 6:00 a.m., and breakfast now makes up 10% of transactions. Next is delivery, which is now available in 126 cities and nearly 1,300 units. Last, our 24-hour operations initiative is generating incremental sales and is in now about 1,000 restaurants.
Pizza Hut Casual Dining continues to be the leading Western casual dining concept in China, with 469 units in 122 cities. We expect to open 63 Pizza Hut Casual Dining restaurants this year, which is up from 55 last year. You may recall that beginning last year, we slowed the growth of this concept substantially while we repositioned our menu. 
With the success we've had, we have begun to increase development in tier one to three cities. Our new menu strategy continues to drive double-digit same-store sales growth. We offer a broad variety of entrées, including beef, chicken and rice dishes, along with appetizers, beverages and desserts. We are having solid success building a true casual dining concept with everyday affordable value.
We also continue to invest behind the development of our emerging brands. Pizza Hut Home Service in the Home Delivery category now has over 100 units in 11 cities. East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand, continues to progress as we drive for scalable economics. Additionally, we own 27% of Little Sheep, the leading brand in the Hot Pot category, which is the largest casual dining concept in China. 
In summary, we're very pleased with the progress we're making executing our China strategy to build leading brands in every significant restaurant category.
Next, Yum! Restaurants International, where our strategy is to drive aggressive expansion and build strong brands everywhere. Similar to our China business, new unit development is a key driver for growth. Our Yum! Restaurants International growth strategy differs from China in that nearly 90% of our 284 new units so far this year that we've developed have been developed by our strong network of franchisees. In fact, over 85% of the nearly 14,000 traditional restaurants in this division are franchise units, which generate a steady, growing stream of franchise royalties. We expect to add about 900 new units for the full year.
Our second quarter system sales grew 4% excluding foreign currency translation, while same-store sales were up 1%. Overall, we drove 7% operating profit growth, excluding foreign currency translation for the quarter.
Based on the success we've had in China, we are aggressively going after sales layers at YRI. In particular, KFC, our largest concept in Yum! Restaurants International, is making major progress on driving value. Value menus are in place in all our key markets and will be expanding further this year. Our Krushers line of frozen beverages continues to expand and is now available in over 2,100 stores and over 35 countries. Our KFC breakfast initiative, which we call KFC a.m., also continues to grow.
Pizza Hut continues to make progress, elevating its brand offering and strengthening its position as the leading Western casual dining concept with everyday affordable prices. While we have weaker transaction trends due to Pizza Hut's higher average guest check, we're encouraged by the progress we're making with our expanded menu, including a wider variety of appetizers, beverages, entrees and desserts.
Yum! Restaurants International's new growth markets, France, India and Russia, delivered 13% system sales growth prior to foreign currency translation this quarter. For the first time, our KFC France business used national television in May and as you would expect, saw a strong upward shift in sales. Scale that enables television advertising is the result of us now having 100 restaurants in France.
On July 1, the company also completed the exercise of our option with our Russian partner, and we now have full management control of the KFC ROSTIK'S (sic) [ROSTIK’S-kfc] brand in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States. This market includes more than 150 co-branded KFC ROSTIK'S across Russia and the CIS which we now own approximately 50, with the remainder owned by our franchisees. We're excited about this market due to its large population and its appetite for chicken. 
Our business in India continues to perform well, with solid same-store sales growth and new unit expansion. We now have over 70 KFCs and 160 Pizza Huts in India.
Taco Bell International also continues to expand. We opened our first Taco Bell in the United Kingdom on June 28, and our first in Korea just last week. And in fact, we've opened Taco Bells in seven new countries over the past two years. Early results are promising, and we're working very hard to make Taco Bell a global brand.
Overall, Yum! Restaurants International growth and development is on track. Importantly, we have a leading position and substantial runway for growth in emerging markets. 
I'd like to take a moment to thank our growth-oriented franchise partners for the investment that they continue to make and for partnering with us to build a global business we can all be proud of.
Next, on to our U.S. business, where our focus is to improve our brand positions, consistency and returns. Our U.S. business achieved solid operating profit growth of 10%, with substantial improvement in restaurant margin while posting flat same-store sales. We are happy with the improvement in the business and are pleased with the strategies we are executing across each brand. We look for sales growth to improve modestly at Taco Bell in the second half and stay strong at Pizza Hut. At KFC, we remain confident in our long-term strategy, but expect sales to be soft for the balance of the year.  
Taco Bell, our largest and most profitable brand in the U.S. and in fact, the second most profitable brand in our category in the U.S., continued its trend of growing transactions and grew same-store sales 1% for the quarter. Taco Bell's pipeline of products is strong for the balance of the year, focusing on value to the consumer in a market clearly focused on everyday value. We also continue to make progress testing breakfast, home meal replacement options and a new beverage platform. Taco Bell is performing well in this challenging market, and we've never been more confident than we are today about our future prospects for this great brand.
Pizza Hut led the way with 8% same-store sales growth for the quarter, and our $10 Any Pizza promotion continues to be a huge consumer hit. We continue to leverage this promotion, as well as discounted day of the week specials, such as Tuscani Tuesdays for our pasta line and Wing Wednesdays. 
People ask us about the sustainability of our $10 Any promotion. And well, one thing I certainly know is what's not sustainable, and that's maintaining the high menu prices we had in our restaurants previously. Pizza Hut is very focused on working with our franchisees to maintain everyday value. We're also very focused on leveraging our asset, like we're doing with the Tuscani Tuesdays where we introduced pasta. Now we're marketing on a Tuesday, and we're doing the same thing with the wings on Wednesday. So we've talked about leverage in our assets in the past. That strategy is definitely being executed and being done very well by the Pizza Hut team. Pizza Hut's performance is strong, and I want to assure you that we're working very hard to sustain it. 
Now let me put KFC into perspective. As I said earlier, we expect sales to be soft for the balance of the year. Our focus remains on the following key areas: improving operations; value; balanced options featuring our grilled products; portable product innovation, like the Double Down; and asset  upgrades.  
As you would expect, each of these major initiatives will take time to implement. There is no quick fix. We are, however, making progress. Recently, KFC had the single largest year-over-year improvement of any major QSR brand in the American Customer Satisfaction Index. We take this as a positive sign that our efforts to launch Kentucky Grilled Chicken to complement our world-class, our world-famous fried chicken and simultaneously improve our operations are beginning to pay off. In spite of this progress, sales have been underperforming and we expect continued weak sales in the third quarter, however.
That said, we are in the midst of a transformation to truly make KFC a more relevant and better-operated brand. And make no mistake, we have a great team that is providing the customer-focused leadership required to do just that. However, from a pure financials perspective, given our tremendous global growth and the success that we've had with Taco Bell in the United States, KFC represents less than 10% of the U.S. Division's profits and less than 3% of the company's overall profits. We expect 2010 profit at KFC to be higher than last year, and the execution of our refranchising strategy sets the brand up to make more money going forward with less capital investment.
Overall, our U.S. performance has improved, particularly with the operating profit growth in the second quarter. We are encouraged that same-store sales are now positive at Taco Bell, pleased with the continued success at Pizza Hut and confident in the long-term strategy at KFC.
So let me wrap this up. Quite simply, we've had a great first half of the year with strong operating profit growth. We are pleased with the profit growth in each of our business units, specifically our strong performance in China. We're confident in delivering our raised target of 12% EPS growth. 
Now let me hand it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Rick Carucci."
365997,109102198,67372,"Yum! Brands, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-14-2010",2010-07-14,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In this session of our call, I'm going to comment on three areas: our second quarter results, our outlook for the second half of 2010 and Yum!'s unique position in emerging markets.As we outlined on the last",1565,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In this session of our call, I'm going to comment on three areas: our second quarter results, our outlook for the second half of 2010 and Yum!'s unique position in emerging markets.
As we outlined on the last call, our second quarter results were similar to the first quarter. Worldwide system sales grew by 4%, and operating profit increased 21% prior to foreign currency translation benefits and special items. EPS before special items grew by 17%. We have now produced two solid quarters, thanks to impressive performance from our China business and the benefit of $37 million of global commodity deflation. Based on this first half performance, we raised our full year EPS growth target and are well on our way to delivering 12% growth.
Yum! had solid profit balance in the quarter. Despite having only 1% same-store sales growth at YRI and flat same-store sales in the U.S., we're able to generate profit growth in these segments. When you add it all up, China grew operating profits by 33%, YRI by 7% before forex and the U.S. by 10%. U.S. margins benefited from improved margin performance at KFC, refranchising, other costs favorability and modest commodity deflation.
Overall, we continue to employ tight cost management. For the second quarter, our G&A declined by $2 million in the U.S. and by $6 million at Yum! corporate.  
On the flip side, our EPS was negatively impacted by overlapping last year's very low tax rate in the quarter. Our reported EPS declined by 6% due to the lap of the significant onetime gain in the second quarter of 2009. We noted in our release last night that we had a $60 million noncash gain in 2009 related to increasing our ownership in the KFC Shanghai joint venture.
Overall, with the strength of our global portfolio, we achieved really solid operating performance in a fairly tough climate. As we look ahead to the balance of 2010, we believe we will need to rely more and more on improving sales to drive profit growth.
Let's try to put the balance of the year in perspective by business segment. First, in China. During the first half of the year, we benefited from an improvement in the Chinese consumer, where consumer confidence has now been positive year-over-year in the last six months. At the same time, we saw a substantial benefit of about $30 million from commodity deflation in the first half of the year. 
We do not expect this highly favorable cost environment to continue. We now expect very high labor inflation in the second half of the year. In addition, instead of the benefits of deflation, we expect significant commodity inflation in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we continue to expect restaurant margins to increase only modestly for the full year. That means while we expect very strong full year margins, we'll give back some of the first half gains during the balance of the year. We also now expect that there will be some favorability from currency in the balance of 2010 as a result of the Chinese government's decision to loosen the peg of the yuan to the U.S. dollar.
This year, our development is back-end loaded, but we feel good about delivering on our 2010 development goal of about 475 units. We expect China continue to be a high growth and high-return market. We continue to like our position in this highly important market of the 21st century.
While our first half operating profit at YRI was 4% excluding foreign currency translation, we are excited about the opportunities in the second half of the year. Markets around the world continue to launch Streetwise, our KFC-branded value menu, which we expect will benefit transactions in the balance of the year. We also plan to continue the launch of our Krushers beverage line. We will continue to test and build other sales layers, as David mentioned.
Please remember that our same-store sales comparisons will get easier, as the third and fourth quarter of last year's were flat and down 2%, respectively. On a reported basis, we expect the benefits of foreign currency to reverse as we anticipate headwinds from currency translation in the fourth quarter.
In the U.S., we are still facing sustained unemployment and a concerned U.S. consumer. Again, the good news is we are lapping minus 6% same-store sales in the third quarter and even weaker minus 8% in the fourth quarter. We believe that our focus on value across all brands will drive modest same-store sales growth in the second half of the year.
As I mentioned earlier, our margins benefited from commodity deflation and other cost variabilities in the first half. While we do not expect some of this upside to continue, we will remain focused on cost management to help deliver profit growth in the second half.
Our U.S. refranchising initiative remains on track. We have made significant progress against refranchising in the past couple of years. Importantly, we have marketed substantially all remaining stores to be refranchised at KFC and Pizza Hut, and we are actively pursuing us pipeline. We are not in a hurry, but we do remain focused on getting the stores in the hands of the best operators. While it is difficult to forecast the timing of refranchising with precision, we still expect to complete refranchising during 2011. 
Overall, we are very confident that Yum! is well positioned to achieve our revised target of 12% earnings per share growth.
On our last call, I shared with you our unique strength in emerging markets. We outlined that we are currently the largest and fastest-growing restaurant player in this arena. Today, I would like to give you more insight into the profit significance of this opportunity for Yum!. I will also briefly highlight a few emerging markets. 
To use a common reference point, we are following the World Bank's guidelines in defining emerging markets, which generally includes countries whose gross national income per capita is less than $12,000. This group includes countries like China, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Russia, Vietnam and Brazil. 
Our growing presence in emerging markets is adding to our bottom line. Back in 2006, about 30% of our overall operating profit came from emerging markets. But in three short years, it had grown to about 45% of our profit mix. By 2015, we expect about 50% of Yum!'s operating profits to be generated by emerging markets. This equates to 15% compounded annual growth for these markets.
People also often ask me, ""What is our next China."" I don't know if we have another China out there, but in partnership with our franchisees, we're investing in a host of emerging markets that we expect to drive growth for many years to come. The two leaders in emerging markets are Yum! and McDonald's. Yum! is in about 70 emerging market countries, while McDonald's is in about 50. Obviously, we love to invest in countries that have large populations and strong GDP growth. 
Today, we're going to highlight a few of these markets: Vietnam, Bangladesh and Nigeria. Interestingly, these are three countries where even McDonald's doesn't have a presence today. Vietnam is the second fastest growing Asian economy, behind only China. The country's 86 million people are young, with 50% of the population under the age of 27. We opened our first KFC at the end of 1997, and we are now the most trusted QSR brand in the country with almost 80 KFCs. Pizza Hut has about 10 stores. We expect this country to have about 150 stores by 2015.
Bangladesh is another country with a young population that we have recently begun to develop. About 50% of the almost 150 million people are under the age of 25. Right now, we have 11 restaurants with no other Western restaurant brands in sight. We hope to have 50 restaurants by 2015 in this country.
In Nigeria, the largest country in Africa with over 150 million people, our franchisee just opened the first two KFCs this year. We're excited about Nigeria, and really the rest of the African continent is home to over one billion people. 
These three franchise markets are examples of the huge opportunity ahead of Yum!. Together, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Nigeria are the home of almost 400 million people. We are the market leaders, and we have only 100 restaurants. This represents less than 0.3 restaurants per million people compared to the international average of three, or the U.S. level of 50 restaurants per million people. So clearly, we have a huge runway for growth. 
In the coming calls and investor meetings, we plan to provide more and more information around our position in emerging markets and the tremendous growth opportunity that these markets represent.
So in summary, we are very comfortable with where we stand financially. We have two quarters under our belt and very significant operating profit growth. We are confident that we'll again deliver our target of at least 10% EPS growth, and we are pleased that we raised our 2010 guidance to 12% growth. At the same time, we are focused on building the foundation for future growth through sales layers and development in emerging markets. Our goal is to build the business that will drive strong performance for our shareholders for many years to come. 
Back to you, David."

Same-store sales growth were up 8% in the second quarter. So it's been a great success for us, because what we basically done by doing this is we addressed the single biggest problem that we've had. And frankly, in our history, we've always been perceived to be the most expensive pizzas. So now we've made our products, our pizzas very affordable, and the consumer response has been overwhelmingly positive, as you would expect. The good news for us is our comparable margins have held steady as we've had the sales lift, and we've had good, strong flow-through to offset this kind of discounting. And our brand metrics are obviously improving certainly on the value side. So as we go forward, when we look at the overall category, we think everyday value is a fact of life, and that we're going to have to work very hard to make sure that we make everyday value a staple of Pizza Hut. And we will have some premium-priced pizzas, primarily those pizzas that we provide category breakthrough innovation around. But we're really working hard at attacking our cost structure and working with our franchisees to make sure that we continue a very strong everyday value proposition as we go forward. So I think you will continue to see great value coming from Pizza Hut, which is a terrific opportunity for us. And one thing we've learned is being premium priced in this kind of environment that we're in right now is certainly not the strategy anyone can pursue. And we think that we understand what we have to do in the pizza category, and Scott Bergren and the Pizza Hut team are working hand in hand with our franchisees to come up with an enduring way to provide value."

First of all, as a follow-up to the question that Jeff raised, we talked about forex. Forex in the first half of the year, we had about a $28 million upside, and we just sort of said in the second half of the year that will slow to about a $5 million net upside. The cost dynamics in China are interesting when you look at it on a first half, second half of the year basis. And that's probably the biggest shift that we'll see, is in the first half of the year, we had about $30 million of commodity deflation. And in the second half, we expect about $15 million of inflation, most of that in the fourth quarter. The second turnaround is labor. We expected labor inflation coming into the year. However, the labor inflation, some of the rates that have occurred were higher than our initial expectations. And so in the first half of the year, we had about $12 million year-over-year increase in labor. In the back half, we expect that to be about $32 million. So that's an extra $20 million of labor in the second half versus the first half. So if you add that up, there's a $45 million swing on commodities, $20 million swing on labor. And so that's what's sort of driving less profit growth in China in the second half than the first half. The last thing, which is just a hard thing to know, and as I said in my speech, we're more relying on sales in the second half of the year. This is just obviously an environment where sales are still fairly hard to come by. So that's sort of our expectations when we look at the balance of the year."

In the later part of this year, we are having the inflation we talked about. Clearly though, we believe we have the pricing ability in China. We have arguably the strongest consumer brand in China. We had to take in pricing before. And If everybody's got labor inflation, I expect there to be pricing throughout the market, right? So I think the timing of that, to your point, is likely to be sort of late this year. That won't benefit this year but should cover us in 2011."

Because if you remember, the earthquake hit in the middle of 2008, so you had very strong growth in the first half of that year. So what we said at the end of the first quarter was that -- I actually feel better now than I did at the end of the first quarter. First quarter, we had the same number, 4% growth. At that point, we actually said that's probably as good a number to use as any in the second quarter. But the first quarter was really just based on two months because of the way our calendar is set up in China, and some of that was a holiday period. So it's hard to get a read on it. At this point, we have three more months of information. We have three more months where the consumer confidence in China is higher than a year ago.

The piece that we were surprised at the level of is last year, labor inflation was maybe a little less than typical. And we had thought this year would be back to normal. What really happened is that this year, sort of they made up for last year being a light year, right? So you had higher-than-normal labor inflation. You would think that, that's going to help consumers. It's hard to tell the timing of that. So in the long run, obviously, if more people have money in their pockets, they're going to spend some of that, but it's really hard for us to quantify. But obviously, the growing middle class in China is a benefit to us from a sales perspective but also from a development perspective as more trade zones come in. So it's not necessarily a bad overall development. It just sort of impacts our profit from quarter-to-quarter."

And I think what we're doing now is with breakfast, with 24-hour service, with home delivery, basically, we're positioning ourselves to make our brand, which is clearly one of the strongest consumer brands, if not the strongest consumer brand, in China available to customers any time they want. So I think the team is doing a great job of positioning ourselves to take advantage of what's going to inevitably be growing buying power. I know you followed us for a long time. The number of middle-class consumers, the estimates just keep going up by the millions every year and we don't see that getting any smaller. And then the average per capita income's getting higher and higher of that group. So this is all good news for us. We're very well positioned at KFC. Also, Pizza Hut Casual Dining which, remember now, we have 464 casual dining units. And we're doing the same thing there. We've made our products more affordable. We're leveraging asset with tea time. We actually, during the tea time period, have a higher market share of beverage consumption than Starbucks would have in China. So I think all of the things that we're doing are positioning us to take advantage of the growing buying power in this country. And separately, one of the big markets, there's no question, there isn't anybody that doesn't think that Pizza Hut Home Delivery isn't going to be a viable brand or category in China. And we're there. Well, we also see the Chinese fast food category emerging, and we continue to make progress for East Dawning. So our strategy is to have the leading brands in every significant category. What we're trying to do is build every one of our brands into power brands so we can compete effectively. And as the buying power of the consumer increases, which it will inevitably do, we will be able to take advantage of it. One thing that's kind of interesting, I think if you guys were all in the call in the fourth quarter of last year, even the second quarter call last year, there's a big concern as to whether we'd ever be able to grow our same-store sales again. So we're pretty pleased with the fact that we've actually grown our same-store sales this year, 4%. We're feeling very good that we've had two straight quarters of 15% system sales growth. And all of that, Joe, has been transaction driven with no pricing. We obviously have, with our brand, pricing power. And as you know, our profit target for China is 15%. Our profits year-to-date are up 35%. So we're pretty happy that we're ahead of schedule. And we're really happy that each one of our brands are stronger today than they were yesterday from a consumer perspective. So I think when you step back and look at where we're at with China, it would be pretty difficult to imagine a better scenario. We couldn't be happier. And we just keep growing talent like you can't believe there, and that's one of those intangibles that you can't see. But our talent level's better. Our operations continue to be best in class. We're leveraging the asset throughout the day. We're in 1,000 stores in home delivery, 1,000 stores in 24-hour service. We're just getting started. We expect to have at least 14,000 KFCs some day. So it's just a matter of time. You always say,  we'll have ebbs and flows in China, as well as ups and downs and all that kind of good stuff. But we're really glad we're there. We're really glad we're there with the team that we have. We're really glad that we have the brands that we have. And this is a long-term proposition, and it's really great to get the short-term growth along the way."

We're going to continue to have the development growth that we always have. You saw this. The second quarter results were a little bit better than the first quarter. We start lapping easier numbers as we get into the back half of the year. So we're lapping negative same-store sales in the back half of 2009. So we feel good about our ability to do that. On your Pizza Hut question, Pizza Hut has been several points behind KFC on a year-to-date basis which isn't surprising given the environment. It's more casual dining and therefore premium priced. So that difference is there. I'm not sure if that will change much in the balance of the year. We've also struggled with Pizza Hut results in the U.K. year-to-date. And that's been some of the reason for the margin decline that you saw in the second quarter. We're working to make that better. And hopefully, that will be better in the second half of the year.

And what was driving that is we were seeing two instances where we weren't getting the types of returns that we looked to get. One was what we call in-fill returns in tier one cities. So not in new trade area, but sort of trying to put one closer to an existing unit. And then the second was in some tier three cities. The second units that we're putting in tier three cities weren't performing as well. The good news is that we're still being pretty cautious on some of the tier one cities. The tier three are actually -- the results we've had are looking better. So we feel more confident in going into more and more tier three cities.

As I mentioned to you earlier, the American Customer Satisfaction Index, we had an eight-point swing, which is the highest of any major brands. So clearly, the Kentucky Grilled Chicken has made KFC in the U.S. much more relevant than it would have otherwise been. I think as you look at the current performance, we have about 10% to 15% mix of Kentucky Grilled Chicken. I was just reading the AKFC Quarterly (sic) [AKFCF Quarterly], which is the franchise magazine that the franchisees publish, and they tell it as a success and feel good about it and we've got a base that we can build from. So I think that we're very pleased that we launched it. I think some challenges that we have is we're working on better consistency just in key size. And we've got a project that help us work on that with our suppliers. I think that's one thing that we think will help us get even more sustainability over the long term, just from a product perspective. But this product, John, as you know and I'm sure you've read it has had rave reviews from food critics. I mean it's an outstanding product. I mean there's no question about it. It's five-star taste. And it's been named Product of the Year of people in the industry who develop -- people have recognized our people who developed the product. So I think it was a huge win. When I look at KFC's prospects here in the U.S., I think we're working on the things that will really matter: improving our chicken on the bone, with better balance between the fried and the grilled; introducing portable products. We now have an outstanding filet, grilled fillet and fried fillet that's allowing us to do products like the Double Down and also move into the sandwich arena. So that's been a big move forward for the brand. One of our big challenges is that our pricing approach is casual dining pricing because we're a high-end business. And when you have pricing that gets into the casual dining arena or close to it, there aren't too many concepts that are growing robustly today. So our value proposition is a major challenge for us as we go forward. I think as it relates to investment, that's one of the challenges that I think we do have with the KFC system. It is a tough time right now. Future investments will -- we need to get the business healthier. But we have an operating platform and equipment package that gives us more variety than we've ever had from an opportunity, from an innovation perspective. If you recall, KFC in the U.S. is the only place in the world where we've invested in back-of-the-house capability for the franchisees because we felt it was so important for us to get into grilled chicken. We helped fund and finance the ovens. I think this shows how committed we are to growing the business here in the U.S. because this is the origin of the brand. And so I think the team here we have is outstanding at working hard in a difficult situation. And we think we'll have steady, slow but steady progresses as we go forward. The great news is, is that KFC outside the United States is something for the U.S. franchise system to aspire towards being. And we've got a team here very dedicated to making that happen, and we're going to be relentless in terms of making that happen because we think we can be much more proud of the KFC brand here in the U.S. Even though we're very proud of it, very proud of the origin, we think we can be even better. And our job is to push the franchise system into doing the things that need to be done: improving ops, improving assets, improving our value proposition."

McDonald's threw everything in the kitchen sink at us in terms of price discounting, and we're already break-even in Tucson. We're also in three other markets that we're working towards that same goal. I just met with the franchisees two weeks ago, meeting with Greg Creed. We all know that the single biggest thing we can do in Taco Bell is to develop another $100,000 to $300,000 sales layer, because we've got the best unit economics outside of McDonald's that I think, or in the industry, second most profitable brand. So in our mind, breakfast is not a question of whether. It's a question of when. And we feel like we're making more and more progress, and we know how we can get even better. The other thing that we're very excited about is we have a beverage platform at Taco Bell that we'll be going into a complete market in launching. And our objective right now, when you upgrade our assets with our new Bold assets, you get a 7% to 8% increase in sales. We're hoping that it will take it to 15% to 16% increase, which will help fund more reinvestment into Taco Bell. So the breakfast and beverage platforms, we think are really very positive developments for us. And the only thing I can say is we're further along now than we were when I talked to you about it last time. We continue to make progress. But we're committed to these sales layers, because this is what's going to really invigorate the brand. We think we should have 8,000 Taco Bells in the U.S. I mean, why not? Burger King does. And you can't tell me that Burger King has a more charismatic brand, more loved brand than Taco Bell. Taco Bell is a brand that everybody talks about. So we've got a great franchise, but we need $100,000 to $300,000 more in sales. So these big platforms are what we're really committed to getting after. The other thing, even with our existing equipment, we can get into home meal replacement. So we're bundling up our home meal replacement ideas, taco meals, Tuesday tacos, things like that, that we're working on, that also give us a chance to get some maybe lower-hanging fruit, easier-to-do, significant sales growth as we go forward. So I'm very optimistic, I think you can tell, about the Taco Bell brand. Right now, we've got transaction growth, slightly positive sales. But when I talk of the future, it's really bright."

So we've got a head start on that though. We decided at the beginning of 2009 really to take a fairly significant G&A reduction. So right now, what the reduction that occurs now is mostly, I'll call it, store-related type of G&A, so area coaches and those types of moves. But when you put it together, we're still confident that we could at least offset the amount of trade down you get between restaurant margin and royalty. So that's why we have sort of said we could make at least as much money at KFC on a long-term basis because we're still confident that, that math will work for us, whether G&A reduction and the royalty will be at least the size of what we're making in restaurant margin today."

If you look at just the two biggest company-owned markets that are developed, are Australia and the U.K., and they were one point better in the second quarter than the first quarter.

I just do want to say, because we talked that the Pizza Hut U.K. business had been soft, but the KFC U.K. business, especially over the last several years, has performed really well. And they are performing, I think, pretty well in this environment. So I think that team's done a heck of a job, not just this year but in previous years. If you look at the developing markets again, you see that the trends -- the thing that was sort of noteworthy to me there was the Middle East number, where the macros there have improved somewhat, but not really to the extent at which we grew there as well.

Before I talk about our third quarter performance, I think it's interesting to note that tomorrow, October 7, is our company's Founder's Day and marks our 13th anniversary since we were spun off from Pep",1943,"Thank you very much Tim, and good morning everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter performance, I think it's interesting to note that tomorrow, October 7, is our company's Founder's Day and marks our 13th anniversary since we were spun off from PepsiCo. I especially want to thank all of our shareholders who have been with us since day one.
From the beginning, our formula for success has been people capability first. Satisfied customers and profitability follow. I'm proud of our ""how we win together"" ownership culture and the results that we've generated. In 13 years we've seen our stock price increase 600%, and I'm happy to say every one of our annual stock option grants are in the money for our team members.
Our people know the three keys to driving shareholder value, and believe me, we are focused on them - new unit development, same-store sales growth, and return on invested capital. We continue to believe we have the best new unit opportunity in China, India, Russia, and other emerging markets. We also have unparalleled opportunity to grow same-store sales with our 37,000 restaurants, by developing day parts and making our brands even more relevant. Meanwhile, our returns should continue to be the best in retail.
I often say the best thing about business is the unfinished business, and clearly we're in the early innings of our growth and quest to become the defining global company that feeds the world.
Now on to our results. I'm pleased to report we are raising our full-year EPS growth forecast to 14% from 12%, which will make 2010 the ninth consecutive year we meet or exceed our annual target of at least 10%. We take satisfaction that our year to date operating profit has increased 15%, excluding special items and the impact of foreign currency translation and is driving our strong EPS growth this year. 
Our third quarter operating profit growth of 14%, excluding special items, was fueled by new unit development in China and Yum! Restaurants International. We are particularly pleased with our China business, which reported robust profit growth of 23%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. 
At Yum! Restaurants International, we grew operating profit 16%, prior to foreign currency translation benefit. In the U.S. we saw modest same-store sales growth in what remains a tough environment. While our U.S. profit declined slightly for the quarter, we do expect growth for the full year.
Now let me take you through our key strategies and trends for each of our divisions. First, I'd like to thank all of you that attended our recent China conference in Shanghai and saw the leadership and tremendous operations teams we have in China. I'd like to thank Sam Su and our China team for hosting our guests at this great event.
I'm obviously very proud of our China team's continued strong performance. Units expanded 12% and same-store sales grew 6% for the quarter. Our China division's operating profit has grown 29% year to date, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. 
New unit development continues to be the major driver of our growth and we remain the largest U.S. retail developer in China. We've opened 245 new units through our first three quarters, and expect to open about 475 this year. Our China new unit returns remain a key focus for us, and continue to be the best in our business.
Now let me share with you a few highlights from each of our leading brands in China. Let's start with KFC. With over 3,000 restaurants, KFC is the largest restaurant QSR concept in mainland China. While we're certainly viewed as the chicken experts, our menu also includes beef and seafood, as well as other products with broad appeal to Chinese consumers. 
We are working on three key initiatives that will grow the business, leverage our assets, and build strong unit economics well into the future. First, KFC breakfast is in virtually all of our restaurants. Our breakfast day part has seen double-digit sales growth this year, and now makes up about 10% of transactions. This sales layer is positioned well, as more Chinese consumers are eating breakfast outside their homes. 
Next is delivery, which is now available in over 1400 units. The fast-growing delivery segment is primarily in higher-tier cities. Lastly, our 24-hour operations initiative is generating incremental sales and is now in about a third of our restaurants. These three big initiatives are leveraging our assets even more effectively and keeping our unit economics strong. 
Pizza casual dining goes beyond pizza and continues to be the leading Western casual dining concept in China, with nearly 500 units in over 120 cities. Our new menu strategy continues to drive double-digit same-store growth. The menu is revamped twice a year and continues to offer a broad variety of entrees including beef, chicken, and rice dishes, along with appetizers, beverages, and desserts. We are having solid success building a true casual dining concept with everyday, affordable value. 
We also continue to invest behind the development of our emerging brands. Pizza Hut home service in the home delivery category, now has over 100 units in 11 cities. East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand, continues to make progress as we drive for scalable economics. Additionally, we own 27% of Little Sheep, the leading brand in the hot pot category, which is the largest casual-dining category in China.
In summary, our China business is having a fantastic year. I couldn't be happier with the progress we're making in executing our China strategy to build leading brands in every significant restaurant category. 
Next, Yum! Restaurants International produced solid results in the quarter, with system sales growth of 5% and operating profit growth of 16%, prior to foreign currency translation benefits. Same-store sales increased 1% and restaurant margin improved 1.6 points. We continue to expect to have stronger sales performance in the fourth quarter. 
We have opened 478 new restaurants this year, with our strong network of growth-oriented franchisees opening about 90% of these units. In fact, over 85% of the 14,000 traditional restaurants in this division are franchise units, which generate a steady, growing stream of franchise royalties. We expect to add about 900 new units for the full year, most of which are in emerging markets with growing middle class populations.
It's the new unit development in these markets that sets Yum! apart and is positioning YRI for many successful years into the future. Rick will take you through more details on our emerging markets opportunity during his remarks.
Yum! Restaurants International's new growth markets, France, India, and Russia, delivered 21% system sales growth prior to foreign currency translation this quarter. We're very excited about the opportunities in these countries and look at these businesses as a future growth engine for Yum! Restaurants International. 
Taco Bell International continues to expand. Our first Taco Bell in India opened this year, and there are currently two more scheduled to open in the fourth quarter. I look forward to my trip to both India and China in the next couple of weeks. 
We opened our first Taco Bell in the U.K. in June, and another is scheduled to open in November. Overall, we've opened Taco Bells in seven new countries over the past two years, and expect to enter three additional countries by the end of the year. We're in very early stages, but could not be more delighted with how consumers are responding to the taste and value of our products. 
KFC, our largest concept in Yum! Restaurants International, is currently focused on value and asset utilization. Value menus are in place in all our key markets, and we'll be expanding further this year. Our Krushers line of frozen beverages continues to expand, and we remain in the early stages of testing our KFC breakfast initiative, which we call KFC a.m. Clearly, McDonald's has had great success in developing these day parts, and we intend to do the same.
Overall, Yum! Restaurants International growth and development is on track. Importantly, we have a leading position and substantial runway for growth in emerging markets. Our strategy remains to drive an aggressive expansion and build strong brands everywhere. 
Next, on to our U.S. business, where our focus is to improve our brands' positions, consistency, and returns. Combined, our U.S. brands grew same-store sales 1% in the quarter. Taco Bell, our largest and most profitable brand in the U.S., grew same-store sales 3%. Taco Bell continues to leverage its position as one of the industry's value leaders in a market clearly focused on everyday value. 
We also continued to make progress testing breakfast, home meal replacement options, and a new beverage platform. All these initiatives are designed to leverage our assets and build sustaining sales layers that enable accelerated growth. The Taco Bell team just had their annual franchise convention in Orlando, and our franchisees are pumped up about the future.
Pizza Hut U.S. led the way again, with 8% same-store sales growth for the quarter, driven by the huge success of our $10 any pizza promotion. We recently changed our menu pricing that reduced the price of medium and large pizzas to $8 and $10 respectively for up to three toppings. Our specialty meat pizzas like Meat Lovers or Supreme, cost $2 more. This simplified menu strategy provides consistent value to consumers and is expected to further increase our margins.
The best news for Pizza Hut is we now have everyday value and simplified pricing. We believe it is sustainable and a long-term strategy. We also continue to lead in innovation, with pizzas like the Big Italy. The combination of everyday value and new product innovation should position Pizza Hut for continued success, along with the arsenal we now have in pasta, with Tuscany Pastas, and wings, which we feature on Tuesday and Wednesday to leverage our asset.
Now, on to KFC in the U.S. As expected, same-store sales continued to be soft, and declined 8% for the quarter, driven in part by reduced media spending. As we expect media comparisons to improve in the fourth quarter, we also expect better sales.
Our focus remains on the following key areas: improved operations, value, balanced options featuring grilled products, portable product innovation, and asset upgrades. As you would expect, each of these major initiatives will take time to implement. There is no quick fix. We are absolutely committed to turning KFC around and we're seeing slow, but steady, progress. Overall, while our U.S. business profits are flat year to date, we do expect profit growth for the full year. 
Let me wrap up the total Yum! story. Overall, we're having a great year and that gives us even more confidence in the power of our business model. This model relies on new unit development to drive about half of our EPS growth target of at least 10% annually. In 2011, we're well-positioned to hit our operating profit growth targets of 15% in China, 10% at YRI, and 5% from our U.S. business.
The balance of our annual EPS growth comes from our base business through same-store sales, productivity initiatives, G&A leverage, and financial strategies. We have a track record that proves how powerful this growth model is. With the expected opening of 1400 international new units this year, and our strategies in the base business, we're in a good position for next year, and expect to make 2011 our 10th consecutive year we meet or exceed our target of at least 10% EPS growth.
Now let me hand it over to Rick Carucci, our chief financial officer, and a great partner of mine.

I'll start with our third quarter results and our outlook for the balance of 2010. Given the time of year, I will also cover some early thoughts on 2011, and finally I'll provide another chapter of information related to Yum's unique growth opportunity in emerging markets.
In the third quarter, Yum's diverse global portfolio generated operating profit growth of 14% prior to foreign currency and special items. This was led by 23% growth in China and 16% growth in Yum! Restaurants International, while U.S. operating profit decreased by 2%. 
As CFO, you're always happy to report double-digit operating profit growth. I'm particularly pleased that we are seeing this operating profit growth on top of 19% growth in the third quarter of last year. This is a very strong result, in what I would best characterize as a ""gray hair"" environment for CFOs over the past two years.
In the third quarter we grew EPS 5%, excluding special items. The strong operating profit results were partially offset by a higher tax rate in the quarter. Our tax rate prior to special items was 27.4% compared to an unusually low 19.9% rate in the third quarter last year. 
There were also two newsworthy financial events for Yum! this quarter. In September, our board of directors announced a 19% increase in our quarterly dividend. Our quarterly cash payout will increase from $0.21 a share to $0.25 a share.
Since its inception in 2004, we have increased the dividend each year and Yum's dividend per share is now five times higher than the 2004 level. In addition, over the past five years, our shareholder payout of dividends plus share repurchases puts us in the top 10% of S&P 500 companies.
In the past, we've also talked about improving our balance sheet and smoothing our debt skyline. In August, we issued a ten-year, $350 million note. We plan to use those proceeds to pay down debt coming due in 2011. Our 3 7/8 coupon was the lowest rate we've ever attained. It was also the lowest ten year bond rate on record for any BBB minus rated corporate. It is great to see the recognition of our financial strength by fixed income investors. 
Overall, we are quite pleased with the operational performance of our business, our financial strength, and our ability to drive shareholder value in the third quarter.
We have now delivered three strong quarters in 2010, and thanks to robust profits from China and based on the strong year-to-date performance, we raised our full-year EPS target growth to 14%, excluding special items. 
Let's try to put the balance of the year in perspective by business segment. First, in China we continued to benefit from the improvement of the Chinese consumer, where consumer confidence has now been positive year-over-year in the last nine months. This has helped generate year-to-date same-store sales results of 5% and we anticipate a similar sales performance for the fourth quarter.
As we said before, we expect the cost environment to get more challenging in the fourth quarter. We expect about $15 million in labor inflation in the quarter, bringing the full-year level to $40 million. 
On the commodities side, we've benefitted from year-to-date deflation of $35 million but we expect commodity inflation of about $15 million in the fourth quarter. While we don't expect pricing to have a significant impact on our 2010 results, we are confident that going forward, the strength of our brands will allow pricing to offset commodity and labor inflation. 
What this all means is that our fourth-quarter margins may be about even, or go down slightly versus prior year. For the full year of 2010, we expect very strong absolute margins and an increase over the strong numbers posted last year.
We are confident in our ability to continue our rapid new unit development in China and expect to reach our 2010 target of about 475 units. At the end of the third quarter, we've opened 245 restaurants, so our development pipeline is back-end loaded. Over the last three years, we've averaged over 200 units in the fourth quarter.
When you add it up, this has been a particularly strong year for China. We expect to exceed our targets for the year, and now expect system sales growth of at least 15% and profit growth of at least 20%. 
Yum! Restaurants International sales remained a bit sluggish in the third quarter, but sales comparisons continue to improve. Adjusting for the impact of the Chinese New Year, YRI same-store sales were down 1% in Q1, flat in Q2, and plus 1% in Q3. We expect same-store sales growth to continue to improve in the fourth quarter, as we overlap a 2% same-store sales decline in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Along with our franchise partners at YRI, we have developed 478 new units year to date and expect to build about 900 units for the full year. We have opened roughly 400 new units in the fourth quarter each of the last two years.
In the U.S., we see the same pattern of same-store sales. Same-store sales in the U.S. were also down 1% in Q1, flat in Q2, and plus 1% in Q3. We also expect further improvement in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, especially when you consider the 8% same-store sales decline in the fourth quarter last year.
As David mentioned, while our U.S. business profits are flat year to date, we do expect profit growth for the full year.
Now let me give you an update on our refranchising. Our refranchising in the U.S. will likely fall short of our 500 unit target for the year. Unfortunately, a potential transaction recently fell through that would have put us in position to meet this target. 
Keep in mind that we just started actively marketing most KFCs in the first quarter of this year. Remember, our overriding objective is to get the stores in the hands of the best operators. We do expect to nearly complete the refranchising of the Pizza Hut units by the end of this year, and we plan to complete our total U.S. refranchising program during 2011. 
On the YRI front, we expect to close a refranchising transaction of our Mexico business in the fourth quarter. In Mexico we are refranchising 224 KFCs and 123 Pizza Hut company-owned restaurants, and the buyer will also become the master franchisor of our 155-unit Mexican franchise business. The good news is that the buyer is already a Yum! franchisee in Central America and is currently one of the very best franchisees in the world. 
We anticipate a pre-tax refranchising loss of approximately $50 million that will be recorded in special items in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
As a reminder, we also refranchised Taiwan at the beginning of this year. Therefore, while we continue to make equity investments in growth countries like India, Russia, and France, we will also refranchise businesses that do not meet our financial and strategic ownership criteria and are better operated by franchise partners.
Overall, we are happy to raise our EPS growth forecast to 14%, excluding special items, and are very proud of the fact that 2010 will mark the ninth consecutive year we have delivered on our annual target of at least 10% growth.
Now let's look ahead to 2011. We wanted to provide you an early view of some of the key items we see in 2011. As always, we will provide a more detailed outlook at the investor update in December. 
First and foremost, I have confidence in our growth model. We expect 2011 to become the 10th straight year we achieve our target of at least 10% EPS growth. Similar to 2010, we expect over 80% of our profits to come from China, YRI, and U.S. Taco Bell. 
As David mentioned, we are very fortunate that a key foundation of Yum's growth is new-unit development in China and YRI. The development of about 1,400 new units outside the U.S. gives us a head start on providing profit growth in 2011. In addition, our development pipeline looks similar next year.
Now I'd like to briefly review some headwinds and tailwinds we believe we may face in 2011. First the headwinds. Based on what we are seeing today we expect some commodity inflation in 2011. In addition, with the growing number of speculators in this market, volatility is high right now. 
As an example, we have seen spot corn prices in the U.S. go from $4.20 a bushel, up to $5.22 a bushel, and then down to $4.71 a bushel in just the last two months.
Our China business has had a very strong year of profits in 2010. In addition to having an exceptionally strong year in margins to overlap, the 2010 results also will include a one-time benefit of about $15 million from our participation in the World Expo in Shanghai.
Fortunately, we also expect a few tailwinds. We expect interest expense to be lower next year. That's on top of the reduction of at least $10 million in 2010. We also anticipate that we will see some benefit from currency translation in our China business. Please also note that our 2011 reporting calendar will include a 53rd week. 
We will provide estimates of the magnitudes of these headwinds and tailwinds at our December meeting. We certainly expect 2011 to be another very strong year for Yum! 
Now let's talk about emerging markets. As we've said on previous calls, Yum! has a unique growth opportunity and particular strength in emerging markets. We previously have outlined that we are currently the largest and fastest growing restaurant player in this arena. 
We have also talked about the profit significance of this opportunity for Yum! and how we expect to generate about 60% of our profits from emerging markets in 2015. Last quarter, we provided Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Nigeria as examples of countries with high populations, where KFC has been a pioneer. Even as market leaders in those countries, we have a total of only about 100 restaurants, representing only 0.3 restaurants per million people. 
Today, we'll provide a contrast by highlighting a few emerging markets where we have a longer history and are reaching significantly higher penetrations. We have been developing KFC and Pizza Hut in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia for decades. These emerging markets are growing over 7% a year. 
In Indonesia there is a booming population of about 230 million people. We currently have 373 KFCs, 201 Pizza Huts, and 190 A&W restaurants. This has been a high growth business for us, as we have added 267 net units since the end of 2004. 
In the Philippines, we have 200 KFCs and 150 Pizza Huts. We have added 92 net units over the past five years. With a population of over 90 million, this translates to about four restaurants to a million people. 
Finally, our most substantial penetrations of these countries is in Malaysia. We have 475 KFCs and 217 Pizza Huts in Malaysia. We have achieved an estimated KFC market share of 45% of the branded fast food market and a Pizza Hut market share of 25% of the chain full-service market. With a population of almost 30 million, this represents 25 restaurants per million people, so clearly much higher penetrated. We have added 253 net units since the end of 2004.
When you look at Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia, you see examples of leadership in emerging markets. We have simply excellent franchisees in all three countries. Together with our YRI Asia team, they are doing a great job of developing our brands.
These countries demonstrate the power that emerging markets can have on our growth. In the past five years, these three countries alone have added a combined 712 net units. Just by themselves, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia have added about one point per year to YRI's new-unit growth rate.
These countries also provide examples of what could be achieved in less-developed markets. Together, these three countries are home to about 350 million people and Yum! now has about five restaurants per million people. If India, for example, were to achieve this penetration rate, it would represent a 6,000-unit opportunity for Yum!
Finally, while we have achieved a lot of growth in these countries, we are just as excited about our growth prospects in the years ahead. In summary, we are very comfortable with where we stand financially. We have three quarters of significant operating profit under our belt. We are pleased that we raised our 2010 guidance to 14% EPS growth excluding special items. 
At the same time, we are focused on building a foundation for future growth through development in emerging markets. Our goal is to build a business that will drive performance for our shareholders for many years to come.
Thank you, and back to you David.

So that was more of a strategic and financial decision and we remained focus on growth everywhere. 
China, as I've said before, our growth there is really tied to continued growth of the economy. We have the teams in place. We don't feel there's any limitation based on either our development team or our operations capability. 
And as the country grows, we expect it to continue in the areas that have helped us in the past, which is people moving from the country into the cities; greater infrastructure, which not only helps our distribution, but also gives us new trade zones in places like railroads, airports, etc.; and continued development in the central and west part of the country. 
Because we have a national presence we feel we're able to take advantage of economic growth pretty much throughout the country. So it's really just tied to continued economic growth in China.

Over time we've always had labor inflation and again, labor inflation now has grown to about 13% or so of our cost structure in China, so 13% of sales. If you have a healthy increase on that number, that's still - let's put it at 10% - that would require about 1.3% pricing. 
So we clearly think our brands have the ability to absorb that and any other increases you could or couldn't get in commodities. I personally think commodities are likely to fluctuate year to year as opposed to inflation, where our model has built in pretty steady increases over time. 
The labor thing to me is sort of a dual-edged sword. It clearly - we have to price or get cost efficiencies to cover it, but at the same time we like the fact that people have more money in their pockets and we have more consumers who could buy our products.

Just wondering how you determine the timing and perhaps the ultimate amount of repurchase with only it looks like $30 million in the third quarter, less than $300 million year to date. Just trying to size up the timing and how you determine the amount to repurchase. Thanks.

Before I talk about our third quarter performance, I think it's interesting to note that tomorrow, October 7, is our company's Founders' Day and marks our 13th anniversary since we were spun off from P",1937,"Thank you very much, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter performance, I think it's interesting to note that tomorrow, October 7, is our company's Founders' Day and marks our 13th anniversary since we were spun off from PepsiCo. I especially want to thank all of our shareholders who have been with us since day one.
From the beginning, our formula for success has been people capability, first; satisfied customers; and profitability follow. I'm proud of how we win together ownership culture and the results that we've generated. In 13 years, we've seen our stock price increase 600%, and I'm happy to say every one of our annual stock option grants are in the money for our team members.
Our people know the three keys to driving shareholder value and believe me, we are focused on them. New unit development, same-store sales growth and return on invested capital. We continue to believe we have the best new unit opportunity in China, India, Russia and other emerging markets. We also have unparalleled opportunity to grow same-store sales with our 37,000 restaurants by developing dayparts and making our brands even more relevant. Meanwhile, our returns should continue to be among the best in retail. I often say the best thing about business is the unfinished business. And clearly, we are in the early innings of our growth in quest to become the defining global company that feeds the world.
Now onto our results. I'm pleased to report we are raising our full year EPS growth forecast to 14% from 12%, which will make 2010 the ninth consecutive year we meet or exceed our annual target of at least 10%. We take satisfaction that our year-to-date operating profit has increased 15%, excluding special items and the impact of foreign currency translation, and is driving our strong EPS growth this year. 
Our third quarter operating profit growth of 14%, excluding special items, was fueled by new unit development in China and Yum! Restaurants International. We are particularly pleased with our China business, which reported robust profit growth of 23%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.
At Yum! Restaurants International, we grew operating profit 16% prior to foreign currency translation benefit. In the U.S., we saw modest same-store sales growth in what remained a tough environment. While our U.S. profit declined slightly for the quarter, we do expect growth for the full year.
Now let me take you through our key strategies and trends for each of our divisions. First, I'd like to thank all of you that attended our recent China conference in Shanghai and saw the leadership and tremendous operations teams we have in China. I'd like to thank Sam Su [Jing-Shyh Samuel Su] and our China team for hosting our guest at this great event. 
I'm obviously very proud of our China teams' continued strong performance. Units expanded 12%, and same-store sales grew 6% for the quarter. Our China Division's operating profit has grown 29% year-to-date, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. New unit development continues to be the major driver of our growth, and we remain the largest U.S. retail developer in China. We've opened 245 new units through our first three quarters and expect to open about 475 this year. Our China new unit returns remain a key focus for us and continue to be the best in our business.
Now let me share with you a few highlights from each of our leading brands in China. Let's start with KFC. With over 3,000 restaurants, KFC is the largest Western QSR concept in mainland China. While we're certainly viewed as the chicken experts, our menu also includes beef and seafood as well as other products with broad appeal to Chinese consumers. We are working on three key initiatives that will grow the business, leverage our assets and build strong unit economics well into the future. 
First, KFC breakfast is in virtually all of our restaurants. Our breakfast daypart has seen double-digit sales growth this year, and now makes up about 10% of transactions. This sales layer is positioned well as more Chinese consumers are eating breakfast outside their homes. 
Next is delivery, which is now available in over 1,400 units. The fast-growing delivery segment is primarily in higher-tier cities. 
Lastly, our  24-hour operations initiative is generating incremental sales and is now in about a third of our restaurants. These three big initiatives are leveraging our assets even more effectively and keeping our unit economics strong.
Pizza Casual Dining goes beyond pizza and continues to be the leading Western casual dining concept in China, with nearly 500 units in over 120 cities. Our new menu strategy continues to drive double-digit same-store sales growth. The menu is revamped twice a year and continues to offer a broad variety of entrées including beef, chicken and rice dishes, along with appetizers, beverages and desserts. We are having solid success building a good crude casual dining concept with everyday affordable value. 
We also continue to invest behind the development of our emerging brands. Pizza Hut Home Service in the home delivery category now has over 100 units in 11 cities. East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand, continues to make progress as we drive for scalable economics. Additionally, we own 27% of Little Sheep, the leading brand in the hot pot category, which is the largest casual dining category in China. 
In summary, our China business is having a fantastic year. I couldn't be happier with the progress we're making in executing our China strategy to build leading brands in every significant restaurant category. 
Next, Yum! Restaurants International produced solid results in the quarter with system sales growth of 5% and operating profit growth of 16%, prior to foreign currency translation benefit. Same-store sales increased 1% and restaurant margin improved 1.6 points. We continued to expect to have stronger sales performance in the fourth quarter. 
We've opened 478 new restaurants this year with our strong network of growth-oriented franchisees, opening about 90% of these units. In fact, over 85% of the 14,000 traditional restaurants in this division are franchised units, which generate a steady growing stream of franchise royalties. We expect to add about 900 new units for the full year, most of which are in emerging markets with growing middle-class populations. It's the new unit development in these markets that sets Yum! apart and is positioning YRI for many successful years into the future. Rick will take you through more details on our emerging markets opportunity during his remarks.
Yum! Restaurants International's new growth markets, France, India and Russia, delivered 21% system sales growth prior to foreign currency translation this quarter. We're very excited about the opportunities in these countries and look at these businesses as a future growth engine for Yum! Restaurants International. 
Taco Bell International continues to expand. Our first Taco Bell in India opened this year, and there are currently two more scheduled to open in the fourth quarter. I look forward to my trip to both India and China in the next couple of weeks. We opened our first Taco Bell in U.K. in June, and another scheduled to open in November. Overall, we've opened two Taco Bells in 7 new countries over the past two years and expect to enter three additional countries by the end of the year. We are in very early stages, but could not be more delighted with how consumers are responding to the taste and value of our products. 
KFC, our largest concept in Yum! Restaurants International, is currently focused on value and asset utilization. Value menus are in place in all of our key markets and will be expanding further this year. Our Krushers line of frozen beverages continues to expand, and we remain in the early stages of testing our KFC breakfast initiative we call KFC a.m. Clearly, McDonald's has had great success in developing these dayparts, and we intend to do the same.
Overall, Yum! Restaurants International growth and development is on track. Importantly, we have a leading position and substantial runway for growth in emerging markets. Our strategy remains to drive aggressive expansion and build strong brands everywhere.
Next, onto our U.S. business, where our focus is to improve our brands' positions, consistency and returns. Combined, our U.S. brands grew same-store sales 1% in the quarter. Taco Bell, our largest and most profitable brand in the U.S., grew same-store sales 3%. Taco Bell continues to leverage its position as one of the industry's value leaders in a market clearly focused on everyday value. 
We also continue to make progress testing breakfast, home meal replacement options and a new beverage platform. All these initiatives are designed to leverage our assets and build sustaining sales layers that enable accelerated growth. The Taco Bell team just had their Annual Franchise Convention in Orlando, and our franchisees are pumped up about the future. 
Pizza Hut U.S. led the way again with 8% same-store sales growth for the quarter, driven by the huge success of our $10 any pizza promotion. We recently changed our menu pricing to reduce the price of medium and large pizzas to $8 and $10, respectively, for up to three toppings. Our specialty pizzas like Meat Lovers or Supreme cost $2 more. This simplified menu strategy provides consistent values to consumers and is expected to further increase our margins.
The best news for Pizza Hut is we now have everyday value and simplified pricing. We believe it is sustainable and a long-term strategy. We also continue to lead in innovation with pizzas like the Big Italy. The combination of everyday value and new product innovation should position Pizza Hut for continued success, along with the arsenal that we now have in pasta with Tuscani pastas and wings, which we feature on Tuesday and Wednesday to leverage our asset.
Now on to KFC in the U.S. As expected, same-store sales continued to be soft and declined 8% for the quarter, driven in part by reduced media spending. As we expect media comparisons to improve in the fourth quarter, we also expect better sales. Our focus remains on the following key areas, improved operations, value, balanced options featuring grilled products, portable product innovation and asset upgrades. As you would expect, each of these major initiatives will take time to implement. There is no quick fix. We are absolutely committed to turning KFC around, and we're seeing slow but steady progress. Overall, while our U.S. business profits are flat year-to-date, we do expect profit growth for the full year.
Let me wrap up the total Yum! story. Overall, we're having a great year and that gives us even more confidence in the power of our business model. This model relies on new unit development to drive about half of our EPS growth target of at least 10% annually. In 2011, we're well positioned to hit our operating profit growth targets of 15% in China, 10% at YRI and 5% from our U.S. business. The balance of our annual EPS growth comes from our base business through same-store sales, productivity initiatives, G&A leverage and financial strategies.
We have a track record that proves how powerful this growth model is. With the expected opening of 1,400 international new units this year and our strategies in the base business, we're in a good position for next year and expect to make 2011 our 10th consecutive year we meet or exceed our target of at least 10% EPS growth. 
Now let me hand it over to Rick Carucci, our Chief Financial Officer and a great partner of mine."

In this section of our call, I'm going to comment on four areas. I'll start with our third quarter results and our outlook for the balance of 2010. Given the time of year, I will also cover some early th",2172,"Well, thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In this section of our call, I'm going to comment on four areas. I'll start with our third quarter results and our outlook for the balance of 2010. Given the time of year, I will also cover some early thoughts on 2011. And finally, I'll provide another chapter of information related to Yum!'s unique growth opportunity in emerging markets.
In the third quarter, Yum!'s diverse global portfolio generated operating profit growth of 14% prior to foreign currency and special items. This was led by 23% growth in China and 16% growth in Yum! Restaurants International, while U.S. operating profit decreased by 2%. As CFO, you're always happy to report double-digit operating profit growth. I'm particularly pleased that we are seeing this operating profit growth on top of 19% growth in the third quarter of last year. This is a very strong result and one what I would best categorize as a grey hair environment for CFOs over the past two years.
In the third quarter, we grew EPS 5%, excluding special items. The strong operating profit results were partially offset by a higher tax rate in the quarter. Our tax rate prior to special items was 27.4% compared to an unusually low 19.9% rate in the third quarter last year. There were also two newsworthy financial events for Yum! this quarter. In September, our Board of Directors announced a 19% increase in our quarterly dividend. Our quarterly cash payout will increase from $0.21 a share to $0.25 a share. Since its inception in 2004, we have increased the dividend each year and Yum!'s dividend per share is now 5x higher than the 2004 level.
In addition, over the past five years, our shareholder payout of dividends plus share repurchases puts us in the top 10% of S&P 500 companies. 
In the past, we've always talked about improving our balance sheet and smoothing our debt skyline. In August, we issued a 10-year $350 million note. We plan to use those proceeds to pay down debt coming due in 2011. Our 3 7/8 % coupon was the lowest rate we've ever attained. It was also the lowest 10-year bond rate on record for any BBB- rated corporate. It is great to see the recognition of our financial strength by fixed income investors.
Overall, we are quite pleased with the operational performance of our business, our financial strength and our ability to drive shareholder value in the third quarter.
We have now delivered three strong quarters in 2010. And thanks to robust profits from China and based on the strong year-to-date performance, we raised our full year EPS target growth to 14%, excluding special items. Let's try to put the balance of the year in perspective by business segment. 
First, in China. We continue to benefit from the improvement of the Chinese consumer, where consumer confidence has now been positive year-over-year in the last nine months. This has helped generate year-to-date same-store sales results of 5%, and we anticipate a similar sales performance for the fourth quarter. As we said before, we expect the cost environment to get more challenging in the fourth quarter. We expect about $15 million in labor inflation in the quarter, bringing the full year level to $40 million. On the commodity side, we benefited from year-to-date deflation of $35 million, but we expect commodity inflation of about $15 million in the fourth quarter.
While we don't expect pricing to have a significant impact on our 2010 results, we are confident that going forward, the strength of our brands will allow pricing to offset commodity and labor inflation. What this all means is that our fourth quarter margins may be about even or go down slightly versus prior year. For the full year of 2010, we expect very strong absolute margins and an increase over the strong numbers posted last year.
We are confident in our ability to continue our rapid new unit development in China and expect to reach our 2010 target of about 475 units. At the end of the third quarter, we've opened 245 restaurants so our development pipeline is back-end loaded. Over the last three years, we've averaged over 200 units in the fourth quarter. When you add it up, this has been a particularly strong year for China. We expect to exceed our targets for the year and now expect system sales growth of at least 15% and profit growth of at least 20%.
Yum! Restaurants International sales remained a bit sluggish in the third quarter, but sales comparisons continue to improve. Adjusting for the impact of the Chinese new year, YRI same-store sales were down 1% in Q1, flat in Q2 and plus 1% in Q3. We expect same-store sales growth to continue to improve in the fourth quarter as we overlap a 2% same-store sales decline in the fourth quarter of 2009. Along with our franchise partners at YRI, we have developed 478 new units year-to-date and expect to build about 900 units for the full year. We have opened roughly 400 new units in the fourth quarter each of the last two years.
In the U.S., we see the same pattern of same-store sales. Same-store sales in the U.S. were also down 1% in Q1, flat in Q2 and plus 1% in Q3. We also expect further improvement in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, especially when you consider the 8% same-store sales decline in the fourth quarter last year. As David mentioned, while our U.S. business profits are flat year-to-date, we do expect profit growth for the full year.
Now let me give you an update on our refranchising. Our refranchising in the U.S. will likely fall short of our 500-unit target for the year. Unfortunately, a potential transaction recently sell through that would've put us in position to meet this target. Keep in mind that we just started actively marketing most KFCs in the first quarter of this year. Remember, our overriding objective is to get the stores in the hands of the best operators. 
We do expect to nearly complete the refranchising of the Pizza Hut units by the end of this year, and we plan to complete our total U.S. refranchising program during 2011. 
On the YRI front, we expect to close the refranchising transaction of our Mexico business in the fourth quarter. In Mexico, we are refranchising 224 KFCs and 123 Pizza Hut company-owned restaurants. And the buyer will also become the master franchisor of our 155-unit Mexican franchise business.
The good news is that the buyer is already a Yum! franchisee in Central America and is currently one of the very best franchisees in the world. We anticipate a pretax refranchising loss of approximately $50 million that will be recorded in special items in the fourth quarter of 2010.
As a reminder, we also refranchised Taiwan at the beginning of this year. Therefore, while we continue to make equity investments in growth countries like India, Russia and France, we will also refranchise businesses that do not meet our financial and strategic ownership criteria and are better operated by franchise partners.
Overall, we are happy to raise our EPS growth forecast to 14%, excluding special items, and are very proud of the fact that 2010 will mark the ninth consecutive year we have delivered on our annual target of at least 10% growth. 
Now let's look ahead to 2011. We wanted to provide you an early view of some of the key items we see in 2011. As always, we'll provide a more detailed outlook at the investor update in December.
First and foremost, I have confidence in our growth model. We expect 2011 to become the 10th straight year as we achieve our target of at least 10% EPS growth. Similar to 2010, we expect over 80% of our profits to come from China, YRI and U.S. Taco Bell. As David mentioned, we are very fortunate that a key foundation of Yum!'s growth is new unit development in China and YRI. The development of about 1,400 new units outside the U.S. gives us a headstart on providing profit growth in 2011. In addition, our development pipeline looks similar next year.
Now I'd like to briefly review some headwinds and tailwinds we believe we may face in 2011. 
First, the headwinds. Based on what we are seeing today, we expect some commodity inflation in 2011. In addition, with the growing number of speculators in this market, volatility is high right now. As an example, we have seen spot corn prices in the U.S. go from $4.20 a bushel up to $5.22 a bushel, and then down to $4.71 a bushel in just the last two months.
Our China business has had a very strong year of profits in 2010. In addition to having an exceptionally strong year in margins to overlap, the 2010 results also will include a one-time benefit of about $15 million from our participation in the World Expo in Shanghai. 
Fortunately, we also expect a few tailwinds. We expect interest expense to be lower next year. That's on top of the reduction of at least $10 million in 2010. We also anticipate that we will see some benefit from currency translation in our China business. Please also note that our 2011 reporting calendar will include a 53rd week. We'll provide estimates of the magnitude of these headwinds and tailwinds at our December meeting. We certainly expect 2011 to be another very strong year for Yum!. 
Now let's talk about emerging markets. As we have said in previous calls, Yum! has a unique growth opportunity and particular strength in emerging markets. We previously have outlined that we are currently the largest and fastest growing restaurant player in this arena. We have also talked about the profit significance of this opportunity for Yum! and how we expect to generate about 60% of our profits for emerging markets in 2015. Last quarter, we provided Vietnam, Bangladesh and Nigeria as examples of countries with high populations, where KFC has been a pioneer.
Even as market leaders in those countries, we have a total of only about 100 restaurants, representing only 0.3 restaurants per million people. Today, we'll provide a contrast by highlighting a few of the emerging markets where we have a longer history and reaching significantly higher penetrations. 
We have been developing KFC and Pizza Hut in Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia for decades. These are emerging markets that are growing over 7% a year. In Indonesia, there is a booming population of about 230 million people. We currently have 373 KFCs, 201 Pizza Huts and 190 A&W restaurants. This has been a high-growth business for us, as we have added 367 net units since the end of 2004.
In the Philippines, we have 200 KFCs and 150 Pizza Huts. We have added 92 net units over the past five years. With a population of over 90 million, this translates to about four restaurants per million people. 
Finally, our most substantial penetrations of these countries is in Malaysia. We have 475 KFCs and 217 Pizza Huts in Malaysia. We have achieved an estimated KFC market share of 45% of the branded fast food market and a Pizza Hut market share of 25% of the chain full-service market. With a population of almost 30 million, this represents 25 restaurants per million people. So clearly, much higher penetrated. We have added 253 net units since the end of 2004. 
When you look at Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, you see examples of leadership in emerging markets. We have simply excellent franchisees in all three countries. Together with our YRI Asia team, they are doing a great job of developing our brands. These countries demonstrate the power that emerging markets can have on our growth. In the past five years, these three countries alone have added a combined 712 net units. Just by themselves, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia has added about one point per year to YRI's new unit growth rate. 
These countries also provide examples of what can be achieved in less developed markets. Together, these three countries are home to about 350 million people, and Yum! now has about five restaurants per million people. If India, for example, were to achieve this penetration rate, it would represent a 6,000 unit opportunity for Yum!.  Finally, while we have achieved a lot of growth in these countries, we are just as excited about our growth prospects in the years ahead. 
In summary, we are very comfortable with where we stand financially. We have three quarters of significant operating profit under our belt. We are pleased that we raised our 2010 guidance to 14% EPS growth, excluding special items. At the same time, we are focused on building foundations for future growth through development in emerging markets. Our goal is to build a business that will drive performance for our shareholders for many years to come. Thank you and back to you, David."

So that was more of a strategic and financial decision, and we'll remain focused on growth everywhere. China, as I said before, our growth there is really tied to continued growth of the economy. We have the teams in place. We don't have where we feel there's any limitation based on either our development team or our operations capability. As the country grows, we expect it to continue in the areas that have helped us in the past, which is people moving from the country into the cities, greater infrastructure, which not only helps our distribution but also gets us new trade zones in places like railroads, airports et cetera, and continued development in the central and west part of the country. Because we have a national presence, we feel we're able to take advantage of economic growth pretty much throughout the country. So it's really just tied to continued economic growth in China."

And again, labor inflation now has grown to about 13% or so of our cost structure in China, so 13% of sales. If you have a healthy increase on that number, that still -- let's put it at 10%, that would require about 1.3% pricing. So we clearly think our brands have the ability to absorb that and any other increases you could or couldn't get in commodities. I personally think commodities are likely to fluctuate year-to-year as opposed to inflation where our model has built in pretty steady increases over time.

Why isn't just bringing the price points down for KFC the right strategy to get people back in the door?"

365997,113978061,79600,"Yum! Brands, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 06, 2010",2010-10-06,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter performance, I think it's interesting to note that tomorrow, October 7, is our company's Founders' Day and marks our 13th anniversary since we were spun off from P",1936,"Thank you very much, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter performance, I think it's interesting to note that tomorrow, October 7, is our company's Founders' Day and marks our 13th anniversary since we were spun off from PepsiCo. I especially want to thank all of our shareholders who have been with us since day one.
From the beginning, our formula for success has been people capability first, satisfied customers and profitability follow. I'm proud of how we win together ownership culture and the results that we've generated. In 13 years, we've seen our stock price increase 600%, and I'm happy to say every one of our annual stock option grants are in the money for our team members.
Our people know the three keys to driving shareholder value, and believe me, we are focused on them. New unit development, same-store sales growth and return on invested capital. We continue to believe we have the best new unit opportunity in China, India, Russia and other emerging markets. We also have unparalleled opportunity to grow same-store sales with our 37,000 restaurants by developing dayparts and making our brands even more relevant. Meanwhile, our returns should continue to be among the best in retail. I often say the best thing about business is the unfinished business. And clearly, we are in the early innings of our growth and quest to become the defining global company that feeds the world.
Now onto our results. I'm pleased to report we are raising our full year EPS growth forecast to 14% from 12%, which will make 2010 the ninth consecutive year we meet or exceed our annual target of at least 10%. We take satisfaction that our year-to-date operating profit has increased 15%, excluding special items and the impact of foreign currency translation, and is driving our strong EPS growth this year. 
Our third quarter operating profit growth of 14%, excluding special items, was fueled by new unit development in China and Yum! Restaurants International. We are particularly pleased with our China business, which reported robust profit growth of 23%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.
At Yum! Restaurants International, we grew operating profits 16% prior to foreign currency translation benefit. In the U.S., we saw modest same-store sales growth in what remained a tough environment. While our U.S. profit declined slightly for the quarter, we do expect growth for the full year.
Now let me take you through our key strategies and trends for each of our divisions. First, I'd like to thank all of you that attended our recent China conference in Shanghai and saw the leadership and tremendous operations teams we have in China. I'd like to thank Sam Su [Jing-Shyh S. Su] and our China team for hosting our guest at this great event. 
I'm obviously very proud of our China team's continued strong performance. Units expanded 12% and same-store sales grew 6% for the quarter. Our China Division's operating profit has grown 29% year-to-date, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. New unit development continues to be the major driver of our growth, and we remain the largest U.S. retail developer in China. We've opened 245 new units through our first three quarters and expect to open about 475 this year. Our China new unit returns remain a key focus for us and continue to be the best in our business.
Now let me share with you a few highlights from each of our leading brands in China. Let's start with KFC. With over 3,000 restaurants, KFC is the largest Western QSR concept in mainland China. While we're certainly viewed as the chicken experts, our menu also includes beef and seafood as well as other products with broad appeal to Chinese consumers. We are working on three key initiatives that will grow the business, leverage our assets and build strong unit economics well into the future. 
First, KFC breakfast is in virtually all of our restaurants. Our breakfast daypart has seen double-digit sales growth this year and now makes up about 10% of transactions. This sales layer is positioned well as more Chinese consumers are eating breakfast outside their homes. 
Next is delivery, which is now available in over 1,400 units. The fast-growing delivery segment is primarily in higher-tier cities. 
Lastly, our  24-hour operations initiative is generating incremental sales and is now in about a third of our restaurants. These three big initiatives are leveraging our assets even more effectively and keeping our unit economics strong.
Pizza Casual Dining goes beyond pizza and continues to be the leading Western casual dining concept in China, with nearly 500 units in over 120 cities. Our new menu strategy continues to drive double-digit same-store sales growth. The menu is revamped twice a year and continues to offer a broad variety of entrées, including beef, chicken and rice dishes along with appetizers, beverages and desserts. We are having solid success building a true casual dining concept with everyday affordable value. 
We also continue to invest behind the development of our emerging brands. Pizza Hut Home Service in the home delivery category now has over 100 units in 11 cities. East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand, continues to make progress as we drive for scalable economics. Additionally, we own 27% of Little Sheep, the leading brand in the hot pot category, which is the largest casual dining category in China. 
In summary, our China business is having a fantastic year. I couldn't be happier with the progress we're making in executing our China strategy to build leading brands in every significant restaurant category. 
Next, Yum! Restaurants International produced solid results in the quarter, with system sales growth of 5% and operating profit growth of 16% prior to foreign currency translation benefit. Same-store sales increased 1%, and restaurant margin improved 1.6 points. We continued to expect to have stronger sales performance in the fourth quarter. 
We've opened 478 new restaurants this year with our strong network of growth-oriented franchisees, opening about 90% of these units. In fact, over 85% of the 14,000 traditional restaurants in this division are franchised units, which generate a steady growing stream of franchise royalties. We expect to add about 900 new units for the full year, most of which are in emerging markets with growing middle-class populations. It's the new unit development in these markets that sets Yum! apart and is positioning YRI for many successful years into the future. Rick will take you through more details on our emerging markets opportunity during his remarks.
Yum! Restaurants International's new growth markets, France, India and Russia, delivered 21% system sales growth prior to foreign currency translation this quarter. We're very excited about the opportunities in these countries and look at these businesses as a future growth engine for Yum! Restaurants International. 
Taco Bell International continues to expand. Our first Taco Bell in India opened this year, and there are currently two more scheduled to open in the fourth quarter. I look forward to my trip to both India and China in the next couple of weeks. We opened our first Taco Bell in U.K. in June, and another scheduled to open in November. Overall, we've opened two Taco Bells in 7 new countries over the past two years and expect to enter three additional countries by the end of the year. We are in very early stages but could not be more delighted with how consumers are responding to the taste and value of our products. 
KFC, our largest concept in Yum! Restaurants International, is currently focused on value and asset utilization. Value menus are in place in all of our key markets and will be expanding further this year. Our Krushers line of frozen beverages continues to expand, and we remain in the early stages of testing our KFC breakfast initiative we call KFC a.m. Clearly, McDonald's has had great success in developing these dayparts, and we intend to do the same.
Overall, Yum! Restaurants International growth and development is on track. Importantly, we have a leading position and substantial runway for growth in emerging markets. Our strategy remains to drive aggressive expansion and build strong brands everywhere.
Next, on to our U.S. business, where our focus is to improve our brands' positions, consistency and returns. Combined, our U.S. brands grew same-store sales 1% in the quarter. Taco Bell, our largest and most profitable brand in the U.S., grew same-store sales 3%. Taco Bell continues to leverage its position as one of the industry's value leaders in a market clearly focused on everyday value. 
We also continue to make progress testing breakfast, home meal replacement options and a new beverage platform. All these initiatives are designed to leverage our assets and build sustaining sales layers that enable accelerated growth. The Taco Bell team just had their Annual Franchise Convention in Orlando, and our franchisees are pumped up about the future. 
Pizza Hut U.S. led the way again, with 8% same-store sales growth for the quarter, driven by the huge success of our $10 any pizza promotion. We recently changed our menu pricing to reduce the price of medium and large pizzas to $8 and $10, respectively, for up to three toppings. Our specialty pizzas, like Meat Lovers or Supreme, cost $2 more. This simplified menu strategy provides consistent values to consumers and is expected to further increase our margins.
The best news for Pizza Hut is we now have everyday value and simplified pricing. We believe it is sustainable and a long-term strategy. We also continue to lead in innovation with pizzas like the Big Italy. The combination of everyday value and new product innovation should position Pizza Hut for continued success, along with the arsenal that we now have in pasta with Tuscani pastas and wings, which we feature on Tuesday and Wednesday to leverage our asset.
Now on to KFC in the U.S. As expected, same-store sales continued to be soft and declined 8% for the quarter, driven in part by reduced media spending. As we expect media comparisons to improve in the fourth quarter, we also expect better sales. Our focus remains on the following key areas:  improved operations, value, balanced options featuring grilled products, portable product innovation and asset upgrades. As you would expect, each of these major initiatives will take time to implement. There is no quick fix. We are absolutely committed to turning KFC around, and we're seeing slow but steady progress. Overall, while our U.S. business profits are flat year-to-date, we do expect profit growth for the full year.
Let me wrap up the total Yum! story. Overall, we're having a great year, and that gives us even more confidence in the power of our business model. This model relies on new unit development to drive about half of our EPS growth target of at least 10% annually. In 2011, we're well positioned to hit our operating profit growth targets of 15% in China, 10% YRI and 5% from our U.S. business. The balance of our annual EPS growth comes from our base business through same-store sales, productivity initiatives, G&A leverage and financial strategies.
We have a track record that proves how powerful this growth model is. With the expected opening of 1,400 international new units this year and our strategies in the base business, we're in a good position for next year and expect to make 2011 our 10th consecutive year we meet or exceed our target of at least 10% EPS growth. 
Now let me hand it over to Rick Carucci, our Chief Financial Officer and a great partner of mine."

Given the time of year, I will also cover some early th",2167,"Well, thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In this section of our call, I'm going to comment on four areas. I'll start with our third quarter results and our outlook for the balance of 2010. Given the time of year, I will also cover some early thoughts on 2011. And finally, I'll provide another chapter of information related to Yum!'s unique growth opportunity in emerging markets.
In the third quarter, Yum!'s diverse global portfolio generated operating profit growth of 14% prior to foreign currency and special items. This was led by 23% growth in China and 16% growth in Yum! Restaurants International, while U.S. operating profit decreased by 2%. As CFO, you're always happy to report double-digit operating profit growth. I'm particularly pleased that we are seeing this operating profit growth on top of 19% growth in the third quarter of last year. This is a very strong result and what I would best categorize as a grey-hair environment for CFOs over the past two years.
In the third quarter, we grew EPS 5%, excluding special items. The strong operating profit results were partially offset by a higher tax rate in the quarter. Our tax rate prior to special items was 27.4% compared to an unusually low 19.9% rate in the third quarter last year. There were also two newsworthy financial events for Yum! this quarter. In September, our Board of Directors announced a 19% increase in our quarterly dividend. Our quarterly cash payout will increase from $0.21 a share to $0.25 a share. Since its inception in 2004, we have increased the dividend each year, and Yum!'s dividend per share is now 5x higher than the 2004 level.  In addition, over the past five years, our shareholder payout of dividends plus share repurchases puts us in the top 10% of S&P 500 companies. 
In the past, we've also talked about improving our balance sheet and smoothing our debt skyline. In August, we issued a 10-year $350 million note. We plan to use those proceeds to pay down debt coming due in 2011. Our 3 7/8 % coupon was the lowest rate we've ever attained. It was also the lowest 10-year bond rate on record for any BBB- rated corporate. It is great to see the recognition of our financial strength by fixed-income investors.
Overall, we are quite pleased with the operational performance of our business, our financial strength and our ability to drive shareholder value in the third quarter.
We have now delivered three strong quarters in 2010. And thanks to robust profits from China and based on the strong year-to-date performance, we raised our full year EPS target growth to 14%, excluding special items. Let's try to put the balance of the year in perspective by business segment. 
First, in China. We continue to benefit from the improvement of the Chinese consumer, where consumer confidence has now been positive year-over-year in the last nine months. This has helped generate year-to-date same-store sales results of 5%, and we anticipate a similar sales performance for the fourth quarter. As we said before, we expect the cost environment to get more challenging in the fourth quarter. We expect about $15 million in labor inflation in the quarter, bringing the full year level to $40 million. On the commodity side, we benefited from year-to-date deflation of $35 million, but we expect commodity inflation of about $15 million in the fourth quarter.
While we don't expect pricing to have a significant impact on our 2010 results, we are confident that, going forward, the strength of our brands will allow pricing to offset commodity and labor inflation. What this all means is that our fourth quarter margins may be about even or go down slightly versus prior year. For the full year of 2010, we expect very strong absolute margins and an increase over the strong numbers posted last year.
We are confident in our ability to continue our rapid new unit development in China and expect to reach our 2010 target of about 475 units. At the end of the third quarter, we've opened 245 restaurants, so our development pipeline is back-end loaded. Over the last three years, we've averaged over 200 units in the fourth quarter. When you add it up, this has been a particularly strong year for China. We expect to exceed our targets for the year and now expect system sales growth of at least 15% and profit growth of at least 20%.
Yum! Restaurants International sales remained a bit sluggish in the third quarter, but sales comparisons continued to improve. Adjusting for the impact of the Chinese new year, YRI same-store sales were down 1% in Q1, flat in Q2 and plus 1% in Q3. We expect same-store sales growth to continue to improve in the fourth quarter as we overlap a 2% same-store sales decline in the fourth quarter of 2009. Along with our franchise partners at YRI, we have developed 478 new units year-to-date and expect to build about 900 units for the full year. We have opened roughly 400 new units in the fourth quarter each of the last two years.
In the U.S., we see the same pattern of same-store sales. Same-store sales in the U.S. were also down 1% in Q1, flat in Q2 and plus 1% in Q3. We also expect further improvement in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, especially when you consider the 8% same-store sales decline in the fourth quarter last year. As David mentioned, while our U.S. business profits are flat year-to-date, we do expect profit growth for the full year.
Now let me give you an update on our refranchising. Our refranchising in the U.S. will likely fall short of our 500-unit target for the year. Unfortunately, a potential transaction recently fell through that would've put us in position to meet this target. Keep in mind that we just started actively marketing most KFCs in the first quarter of this year. Remember, our overriding objective is to get the stores in the hands of the best operators. 
We do expect to nearly complete the refranchising of the Pizza Hut units by the end of this year, and we plan to complete our total U.S. refranchising program during 2011. 
On the YRI front, we expect to close the refranchising transaction of our Mexico business in the fourth quarter. In Mexico, we are refranchising 224 KFCs and 123 Pizza Hut company-owned restaurants. And the buyer will also become the master franchisor of our 155-unit Mexican franchise business.
The good news is that the buyer is already a Yum! franchisee in Central America and is currently one of the very best franchisees in the world. We anticipate a pretax refranchising loss of approximately $50 million that will be recorded in special items in the fourth quarter of 2010.
As a reminder, we also refranchised Taiwan at the beginning of this year. Therefore, while we continue to make equity investments in growth countries like India, Russia and France, we will also refranchise businesses that do not meet our financial and strategic ownership criteria and are better operated by franchise partners.
Overall, we are happy to raise our EPS growth forecast to 14%, excluding special items and are very proud of the fact that 2010 will mark the ninth consecutive year we have delivered on our annual target of at least 10% growth. 
Now let's look ahead to 2011. We wanted to provide you an early view of some of the key items we see in 2011. As always, we'll provide a more detailed outlook at the investor update in December.
First and foremost, I have confidence in our growth model. We expect 2011 to become the 10th straight year as we achieve our target of at least 10% EPS growth. Similar to 2010, we expect over 80% of our profits to come from China, YRI and U.S. Taco Bell. As David mentioned, we are very fortunate that a key foundation of Yum!'s growth is new-unit development in China and YRI. The development of about 1,400 new units outside the U.S. gives us a head start on providing profit growth in 2011. In addition, our development pipeline looks similar next year.
Now I'd like to briefly review some headwinds and tailwinds we believe we may face in 2011. 
First, the headwinds. Based on what we are seeing today, we expect some commodity inflation in 2011. In addition, with the growing number of speculators in this market, volatility is high right now. As an example, we have seen spot corn prices in the U.S. go from $4.20 a bushel up to $5.22 a bushel, and then down to $4.71 a bushel in just the last two months.
Our China business has had a very strong year of profits in 2010. In addition to having an exceptionally strong year in margins to overlap, the 2010 results also will include a one-time benefit of about $15 million from our participation in the World Expo in Shanghai. 
Fortunately, we also expect a few tailwinds. We expect interest expense to be lower next year. That's on top of the reduction of at least $10 million in 2010. We also anticipate that we will see some benefit from currency translation in our China business. Please also note that our 2011 reporting calendar will include a 53rd week. We'll provide estimates of the magnitude of these headwinds and tailwinds at our December meeting. We certainly expect 2011 to be another very strong year for Yum! 
Now let's talk about emerging markets. As we have said in previous calls, Yum! has a unique growth opportunity and particular strength in emerging markets. We previously have outlined that we are currently the largest and fastest-growing restaurant player in this arena. We have also talked about the profit significance of this opportunity for Yum! and how we expect to generate about 60% of our profits for emerging markets in 2015. Last quarter, we provided Vietnam, Bangladesh and Nigeria as examples of countries with high populations, where KFC has been a pioneer.
Even as market leaders in those countries, we have a total of only about 100 restaurants, representing only 0.3 restaurants per million people. Today, we'll provide a contrast by highlighting a few of the emerging markets where we have a longer history and are reaching significantly higher penetrations. 
We have been developing KFC and Pizza Hut in Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia for decades. These are emerging markets that are growing over 7% a year. In Indonesia, there is a booming population of about 230 million people. We currently have 373 KFCs, 201 Pizza Huts and 190 A&W restaurants. This has been a high-growth business for us, as we have added 367 net units since the end of 2004.
In the Philippines, we have 200 KFCs and 150 Pizza Huts. We have added 92 net units over the past five years. With a population of over 90 million, this translates to about four restaurants per million people. 
Finally, our most substantial penetrations of these countries is in Malaysia. We have 475 KFCs and 217 Pizza Huts in Malaysia. We have achieved an estimated KFC market share of 45% of the branded fast food market and a Pizza Hut market share of 25% of the chain full-service market. With a population of almost 30 million, this represents 25 restaurants per million people. So clearly, much higher penetrated. We have added 253 net units since the end of 2004. 
When you look at Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, you see examples of leadership in emerging markets. We have simply excellent franchisees in all three countries. Together with our YRI Asia team, they are doing a great job of developing our brands. These countries demonstrate the power that emerging markets can have on our growth. In the past five years, these three countries alone have added a combined 712 net units. Just by themselves, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia have added about one point per year to YRI's new unit growth rate. 
These countries also provide examples of what can be achieved in less-developed markets. Together, these three countries are home to about 350 million people, and Yum! now has about five restaurants per million people. If India, for example, were to achieve this penetration rate, it would represent a 6,000-unit opportunity for Yum!.  Finally, while we have achieved a lot of growth in these countries, we are just as excited about our growth prospects in the years ahead. 
In summary, we are very comfortable with where we stand financially. We have three quarters of significant operating profit under our belt. We are pleased that we raised our 2010 guidance to 14% EPS growth excluding special items. At the same time, we are focused on building foundations for future growth through development in emerging markets. Our goal is to build a business that will drive performance for our shareholders for many years to come. Thank you and back to you, David."

We have the teams in place. We don't have we feel there's any limitation based on either our development team or our operations capability. As the country grows, we expect it to continue in the areas that have helped us in the past, which is people moving from the countries into the cities, greater infrastructure, which not only helps our distribution but also gives us new trade zones in places like railroads, airports, et cetera, and continued development in the central and west part of the country. Because we have a national presence, we feel we're able to take advantage of economic growth pretty much throughout the country. So it's really just tied to continued economic growth in China."

But on an ongoing basis to me, I still expect 20-plus margins in China for the foreseeable future. Over time, we've always had labor inflation.

If you have a healthy increase on that number, that still -- let's put it at 10%, that would require about 1.3% pricing. So we clearly think our brands have the ability to absorb that and any other increases you could or couldn't get in commodities. I personally think commodities are likely to fluctuate year-to-year, as opposed to inflation where our model has built in pretty steady increases over time.

Pizza Hut is a different story, because there, we've actually had a net pricing decline.  Our transactions are significantly above our growth rate."

So on China, you said you've taken very little price, but it was noticed that the inflation data out of China are positive and have gotten a little bit more positive. So I guess I'm trying to think about, let's call it cross price elasticity. So what some of your competitors might be doing or what food at home might be doing, and does that give you a little bit more leeway in terms of if you don't take price, you've gained some of the traffic. Just trying to think about how your pricing compares in China to substitutes, like either away from home or at home? That's the first question."

We don't have a lot of great information, at least I haven't seen, on cross-elasticity between the take-homes and take-away markets in China. Clearly, it is going to be more sensitive on the economy, as people there generally have lower incomes. So usually, with something as a higher percentage of your ticket there, you're going to have more impact in the restaurant business when the economy is weaker than you probably would in the grocery side. That would be my guess, but I don't have data that would back that up."

So we will be signing some contracts on certain items soon for 2011. But part of the impact this year, Mitch, is that you're probably going to be less further out in hedging given the volatility, because it gets more expensive to hedge in that kind of situation. Plus with speculators in, a lot of people don't want to hedge when speculators are in, because the feeling is when they go out, the prices will go back down. So probably just the reality is we probably have a little bit more uncertainty than usual. And right now, if you looked at the numbers, we'd probably expect in an area of about a 3% increase in the U.S.  But a lot could happen between now and the start of the year."
