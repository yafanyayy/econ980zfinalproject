We got off to a great start in the first quarter. We had record earnings of 37% from a year ago, including double digit profit gains from four out of our five business segments. We are particularly glad to have registered $1 sales",936,"Good morning, everyone. We got off to a great start in the first quarter. We had record earnings of 37% from a year ago, including double digit profit gains from four out of our five business segments. We are particularly glad to have registered $1 sales gain of 2%, which is a significant turnaround from our fourth quarter last year. Our recent announcement of our new Hormel brand advertising campaign demonstrates our commitment to building our brand strength across both our Grocery Products and Meat Products product lines. The aim of this new campaign is to create synergies across all of our 15 categories, in which the Hormel brand is the major player. I will now take you through each of our operating segments.For Grocery Products, segment profit increased a substantial 37%. Segment profit was aided by lower raw material costs and increased sales of our core products. Our Grocery Products segment reported $1 sales increase of 8%, up 4% netting out the impact of the new MegaMex sales and the discontinued CARAPELLI Olive Oil sales. Sales of Hormel Chili, our SPAM family of products and Dinty Moore stew were all up nicely on top of double digit gains a year ago. We are already seeing the benefit of our MegaMex venture to sales and earnings. The added sales of Mexican products under this venture more than compensated for the discontinued CARAPELLI Olive Oil sales. We are encouraged to see stabilization in sales of our Hormel Compleats microwave meals line during the quarter. We recently opened our new plant in Dubuque, Iowa, and we look to that state-of-the-art facility to meet our long-term growth expectations for this product line.Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported a 53% increase in operating profit, helped in part by favorable cut-out margins. You may recall that cut-out margins were particularly unfavorable during our first quarter a year ago. Refrigerated Foods experienced flat dollar sales for the quarter. Overall, Meat Products sales were roughly even with a year ago as we experienced softer demand for fresh pork, hams and bacon. Foodservice sales remained down overall as the Foodservice trade continues to be soft though at a lesser rate of decline. Sales of our Natural Choice deli meats, Austin Blues barbecue products, Café H ethnic products and pizza toppings all grew during the quarter.We added the Country Crock chilled side dish business to the Refrigerated Foods portfolio at the end of the quarter. This product line generated $50 million in sales in 2009, and we expect it to be an excellent complement to our Hormel refrigerated entrées and Lloyd's Barbeque products. Our early efforts will be focused on working with retailers to restore momentum to this product line.Segment operating profit at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment increased 14%, largely driven by increased whole bird sales. We also benefited from stronger dark meat prices, as the result of decreased supply conditions and good export demand. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment posted a sales increase of 5% related primarily to the increased sales of whole birds during the quarter. Although harvest volume declined during the quarter, these sales included whole birds that were in cold storage. Importantly, value-added sales also grew supported by our advertising and promotional efforts. We achieved success during the quarter in the Foodservice channel and with certain retail products, including Jennie-O Turkey Store pan roast growth, franks and turkey burgers.Our Specialty Foods segment reported strong segment operating profit growth of 28% in the quarter with positive contributions by each of its three business units. The leading drivers of these improved results were sales of private label canned meat products and sugar substitutes. Sales by our Specialty Foods segment grew 5% during the quarter, again reversing prior trends. In our all other segment, operating profit declined by 6%, due primarily to weaker exports of fresh pork products. Sales by our International business were modestly higher as improved exports of the SPAM family of products helped offset the lower fresh pork exports.Reflective of our strong results in the first quarter, we announced this morning that we are raising our full year earnings guidance range from $2.63 to $2.73 per share to a range of $2.68 to $2.78 per share. We recognized that this was an extraordinary quarter. While we are optimistic about our operating earnings for the remainder of the year, we expect to generate more modest gains in subsequent quarters. In our November call, we said we expected higher hog costs in the second half of the year. Those higher costs have come sooner than we anticipated. We see this trend continuing as we get into warmer weather. We also enjoyed strong cut-out margins in the first quarter, particularly compared to a year ago, and we do not expect this comparison to be as favorable going forward.At the earnings per share level, the strong investment performance of our rabbi trust last year will result in a more difficult comparison, offset in part by our 53rd week this year. Jody will discuss this in more detail later. Notwithstanding the foregoing considerations, we believe we have a number of strengths that should allow us to continue to thrive. They include our strong portfolio of leading brands, featuring many products that consumer see is the good value proposition and our balanced business model between packaged foods and value-added protein products. We also expect to benefit from our increased advertising levels over the next few quarters, featuring the new Hormel brand ad campaign that I mentioned earlier.This time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the first quarter."

Earnings for the fiscal 2010 first quarter totaled $111.2 million, or $0.82 per share compared to $81.4 million, or $0.60 per share a year ago. Dollar sales for the first quarter totaled $1.73 billion compared to $1.69 billion last year, a 2% increase. Volume for the first quarter was 1.2 billion pounds, up 3% from fiscal 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were 8.4% of sales even with last year.Advertising expenses were 1.4% of sales for the quarter compared to 1.5% in 2009. We expect a year-over-year increase in advertising expenses in 2010, primarily related to the brand campaign Jeff referred to. Interest in investment income was $443,000 for the first quarter compared to $2.4 million in fiscal 2009. The majority of the difference is due to lower returns on our rabbi trust investments as well as lower interest income. As Jeff indicated, we expect to see lower comparable results for interest and investment income for the balance of fiscal 2010. If you remember, our 2009 results for the quarters 2 through 4 included a gain of $3.6 million on the sale of the CARAPELLI business, and a total of about $14 million in gains on our rabbi trust investment.Interest expense for the quarter was $6.6 million compared to $7.5 million last year. We expect interest expense to be about $27 million to $29 million for fiscal 2010. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 33.8% versus 34.5% in fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2010, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 35% and 36%.The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 134 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 135 million shares. We repurchased 421,000 shares of common stock during the first quarter, and we have 697,000 shares remaining to be purchased from the 10 million share authorization in place. Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $350 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31 million even with last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $127 million to $129 million in fiscal 2010.Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $19 million compared to $26 million last year. For fiscal 2010, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $135 million to $140 million.

We've also pointed out though in the past that we've done well in the higher markets as well, and so we don't see that as a fatal or dangerous condition for our business in and of itself. The second variable clearly is cut-out margins. Those had been somewhat more consistent, but these last couple of years, we've certainly seen some extremes in that. I mean they were terrible last year for the first quarter and they certainly were significantly improved in the first quarter this year. We were seeing more normalcy, I guess, albeit at a bouncing around level for what we're seeing so far into the second quarter. And then the third big variable, the one we really take most of our attention on which is driving growth in our value-added business and enhancing our product mix.

I would agree that our increase in sales within Specialty Foods and private label items certainly would be consistent with trends that retailers have seen of increases in private label. Obviously, our major emphasis is still on the branded side of the business. And again, referring to Grocery, where it's easier to get the share information. I mean we are seeing increases by private label, but they have not really been at our expense of our branded items, and we're doing I think a good job of driving our results as well."

We are pleased to report strong earnings and sales for the second quarter. Our Q2 earnings of $0.67 per share excluding the one time charges of $0.10 per share associated with the plant closing and the healthcare laws represent a 14% increase over our results of a year ago. Total dollar sales were also up 7% over a year ago.
This quarter once again demonstrates the benefit of our balanced business model as the strong performance of our Jennie-O Turkey Store and specialty food segments more than made up for the results of our grocery product and all other segments.
I will now take you through each segment. Our grocery product segment reported a dollar sales increase of 6% and a segment operating profit decrease of 2%, the latter after adjusting for the one time charges associated with our Valley Fresh plant closing. Net of the new item sales of Mexican products under the MegaMex foods venture and of the discontinued Carapelli Olive Oil sales, revenues for grocery products would have been flat for the quarter.
Stronger sales of our Mexican products and our Hormel Chili and Hormel Mary Kitchen hash products were not able to completely offset the pressure on margins and our Spam family of products and our Hormel Bacon bits items, prompted by higher raw material costs. The increased sales of Hormel Chili and Hormel Mary Kitchen hash resulted from increased distribution and from our new Hormel brand advertising campaign. The campaign is designed to leverage our leading brand strength in numerous categories to promote cross purchase intent.
We are pleased with the success of our MegaMex food venture so far as sales of over $120 million through the first half are on pace to easily exceed the base level sales of $200 million on an annualized basis.
Our refrigerated food segment reported operating profit up 7% aided by stronger cut out margins compared to a year ago. Sales were also up 7% for refrigerated foods. We enjoyed particularly strong sales of Hormel Party Trays and Hormel Pepperoni, helped in part by new products, in part by our Hormel brand advertising campaign, and in part by the great efforts of our sales organization in generating meaningful and store promotions.
We are pleased with the progress in the integration of our recent Country Crock side dish business. Our team has done a good job stabilizing this business during the quarter. We can now provide complete meal solutions to consumers in the refrigerated section of the store complementing our Hormel refrigerated entrees and Lloyd’s Barbeque products.
We have begun to see signs of improvement in the food service trade. Sales of our Natural Choice deli meats, Austin Blues Barbeque products and Café H Ethnic products all grew during the quarter.
Segment operating profit at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment increased by a noteworthy 93% with sales up 1%. Jennie-O results came from improved efficiency throughout the entire business. Export sales of dark turkey meat have given us an added boost as thigh meat pricing has remained very strong. Sales increased for Jennie-O in all three value added areas; retail, deli, and food service, led by retail tray pack fresh turkey and rotisserie deli products.
We continue to generate excellent exposure for the Jennie-O Turkey Store brand through our sponsorship of The Biggest Loser reality TV show.
Our Specialty Foods segment again posted improved segment operating profit and sales up 39% and 13% respectively, with contributions by all three sub-units of specialty foods. The leading drivers of these improved results were sports nutrition products, private label canned meat products, and sugar substitutes.
In our all other international segment, segment operating profit declined 18% while sales increased by 7%. We did generate excellent sales of our Spam family of products but this was not sufficient to offset the reduced returns we experienced related to lower fresh pork exports.
In our February call we mentioned that higher hog costs were on their way. These increased costs did indeed arrive and at a higher level than originally anticipated. We expect this trend to continue as we get into warmer weather. On the other hand, commodity turkey prices have firmed up as the result of industry production cuts and grain prices appear to be in a fairly stable position.
Taking these considerations into account, and in light of our strong results in Q2 we are again raising our full year guidance range from $2.68 to $2.78 per share to $2.75 to $2.85 per share excluding the one time charges of $0.10 per share associated with the plant closing and healthcare laws.
At this time I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen in Austin to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter.

These one time charges resulted in an adjustment to diluted net earnings of approximately $0.10 per share for the second quarter. A table reconciling our adjusted earnings calculation to earnings calculated under generally accepted accounting principles was included in our earnings release as well.
For the second quarter of 2010 adjusted net earnings totaled $91.3 million or $0.67 per share compared to $80.4 million or $0.59 per share a year ago. Adjusted net earnings for the first half of fiscal 2010 totaled $202.5 million or $1.50 per share compared to $161.8 million or $1.20 per share a year ago. On a GAAP basis net earnings for the second quarter 2010 totaled $77.9 million or $0.57 per share. GAAP net earnings for the first half of 2010 were $189.1 million or $1.40 per share.
Dollar sales for the second quarter totaled $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year a 7% increase. For the first half of the fiscal year dollar sales increased 4% to $3.4 billion. Volume for the second quarter was 1.1 billion pounds up 2% from fiscal 2009. Year to date, volume was 2.3 billion also up 2% from fiscal 2009.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 8.6% of sales compared to 8.8% last year. Year to date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 8.5% compared to 8.6% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8.8% of sales for the remainder of the year.
Advertising expenses were 1.5% of sales for the quarter compared to 1.6% in 2009, year to date; advertising expenses are 1.5% of sales even with last year. We saw an absolute dollar increase in advertising expense in the second quarter and expect that advertising dollars will exceed 2009 expenditures on a full year basis.
Interest and investment income was $1.4 million for the second quarter compared to $8.6 million in fiscal 2009. In the second quarter of fiscal 2009 we recorded a $3.6 million gain on the dissolution of the Carapelli joint venture. In addition, we experienced higher returns on our rabbi trust investments in 2009. We expect difficult comparisons in the back half of the year due to the strong performance of our rabbi rrust investments in 2009.
Interest expense for the quarter was $6.6 million compared to $6.9 million last year. Year to date, interest expense is $13.1 million compared to $14.4 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $27 to $28 million for fiscal 2010.
Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 40.7% versus 35.3% in fiscal 2009. The increase in 2010 was driven by the one time impact of recently enacted healthcare legislation and the reduction in the value of our deferred tax assets due to the change in the tax treatment of Medicare Part D reimbursement. Year to date, effective tax rate is 36.8% compared to 34.9% last year. For fiscal 2010 we expect the effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.
Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 134 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 136 million shares. We repurchased 330,000 shares of common stock during the second quarter and have 367,000 shares remaining to be repurchased from the $10 million share authorization in place.
Total debt at the end of the quarter was $350 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31 million even with last year. For the first half of the year, depreciation and amortization was $61 million compared to $62 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 to $127 million in fiscal 2010.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $22 million compared to $20 million last year. For the first six months of the year capital expenditures totaled $40 million compared to $46 million last year. For fiscal 2010 we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $105 to $115 million.
At this time I will turn the call over to the operator for the question and answer portion of the call.

Exports have been strong, if those continue there is a possibility for the cut out to move up as well. Then also you have the impact of the rising prices and what that does to consumer demand. I don’t see the cut out as clearly as I do on the hog price side.

We did feel the same impact in certain elements of the refrigerated foods portfolio but they had the offset of the hog cut outs to dissipate that somewhat. Items that are pork based items, particular Spam luncheon meat or Hormel bacon bits did certainly see increases in the raw material costs during the quarter and that did compress the margins then to a lower level than what we had been generating in the prior quarter and even the prior same quarter last year.
In terms of the sales, grocery products overall did generate positive sales for the quarter. As I mentioned, if you sort out the discontinued business of Carapelli and you put aside the new franchises that we joined to the company through the MegaMex ventures the net effect of those two would be to flatted out GP sales so it was kind of a mixed bag again within their portfolio. Chili did well, hash did well, the Mexican products did well, Complete was sort of back to even which is trending the direction we need it to trend but we did see softer sales of some of the other canned items such as Spam and Dinty Moore this quarter and the chunk meat items also were a little bit off.

If you look at total sales for Hormel Foodservice for example they were flat for the quarter. On the branded or more highly value added items we saw some gains and we had more territories up than were down and that was an encouraging sign versus prior years.
We would expect that trend to gradually accelerate. I guess we don’t feel, we’re not hearing from the foodservice marketplace that the clouds have all parted and everything is excellent now. If we do experience a shift where people start going out a little bit more often and businesses started attending a few more conferences, etc. we’re certainly well positioned to take advantage of that. We have foodservice elements in four of our five operating segments and they’re all poised with good sales organizations and with good products hopefully to deliver to that audience.
Within the grocery environment, not talking just grocery product but grocery stores, our impression has been that the recession has had mixed results. We clearly saw some benefit to the traditional canned franchises for a time there where almost all of those items were up. This quarter was more mixed in that regard with chili and hash and Dinty Moore and Spam down. We also did lose some momentum in our convenience items both Completes and our refrigerated entrees during last year and so if consumers gain more confidence and the economy starts looking better we do expect those franchises to improve.

The Diamond Crystal group has found ways to continue to grow their business even during the recession, they sold, in many cases to a different group of foodservice operators and then the meat side of our business traditionally focuses upon.
Then one other element that helped us this quarter was last year we had kind of a lag effect or negative effect from the Century Foods Operation as they had lost some significant business and they’ve done a nice job at replacing that business and getting back to more traditional margins for them.

Same would be true in terms of costs and pricing in the marketplace that if we attain a new level and it stays there for a while then in the long run prices are going to have to migrate up to that new level.

We are pleased to report strong earnings and sales for the second quarter. Our Q2 earnings of $0.67 per share, excluding the one-time charges of $0.10 per share associated with the plant closing and the health care laws, represent a 14% increase over our results of the year ago. Total dollar sales were also up 7% over a year ago. This quarter once again demonstrates the benefit of our balanced business model, as the strong performance of our Jennie-O Turkey Store and Specialty Foods segments more than made up for the results of our Grocery Product and all other segments. 
I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products segment reported a $1 sales increase of 6% and a segment operating profit decrease of 2%, the latter after adjusting for the one-time charges associated with our golf [ph] VALLEY FRESH plant closing. Net of the new item sales of Mexican products under the MegaMex Foods venture and of the discontinued CARAPELLI Olive Oil sales, revenues for Grocery Products would have been flat for the quarter.
Stronger sales of our Mexican products and our Hormel Chili and Hormel Mary Kitchen hash products were not able to completely offset the pressure on margins in our SPAM family of products and our Hormel Bacon Bits items, prompted by higher raw material costs. The increased sales of Hormel Chili and Hormel Mary Kitchen hash resulted from increased distribution and from our new Hormel brand advertising campaign. The campaign is designed to leverage our leading brand strength in numerous categories to promote cross purchase intent. We are pleased with the success of our MegaMex Foods venture so far, as sales of over $120 million through the first half are on pace to easily exceed the base level sales of $200 million on an annualized basis. 
Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported operating profit of 7%, aided by stronger cutout margins compared to a year ago. Sales were also up 7% for Refrigerated Foods. We enjoyed particularly strong sales of Hormel Party Trays and Hormel pepperoni, helped in part by new products and in part by our Hormel brand advertising campaign and in part by the great efforts of our sales organization in generating meaningful in-store promotions.
We are pleased with the progress in the integration of our recent Country Crock Side Dish business. Our team has done a good job stabilizing this business during the quarter. We can now provide complete meal solutions to consumers in the Refrigerated section of the store, complementing our Hormel refrigerated entrées and Lloyd's Barbecue products. We have begun to see signs of improvement in the Foodservice trades. Sales of our Natural Choice deli meats, Austin Blues barbecue products and Café H ethnic products all grew during the quarter.
Segment operating profit at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment increased by a noteworthy 93%, with sales up 1%. Jennie-O's results came from improved efficiencies throughout the entire business. Export sales of dark turkey meat have given us an added boost as thigh meat pricing has remained very strong. Sales increased for Jennie-O in all three value-added areas, retail, deli and Foodservice, led by retail tray pack fresh turkey and rotisserie deli products. We continue to generate excellent exposure for the Jennie-O Turkey Store brand through our sponsorship of the Biggest Loser reality TV show. 
Our Specialty Foods segment again posted improved segment operating profit and sales, up 39% and 13% respectively, with contributions by all three subunits of Specialty Foods. The leading drivers of these improved results were sports nutrition products, private-label canned meat products and sugar substitutes.
In our All Other International segment, segment operating profit declined 18%, while sales increased by 7%. We did generate excellent sales of our SPAM family of products, but this was not sufficient to offset the reduced returns we experienced related to lower fresh pork exports. In our February call, we mentioned that higher hog costs were on their way. These increased costs did indeed arrive and at a higher level than originally anticipated. We expect this trend to continue as we get into warmer weather. 
On the other hand, commodity turkey prices have firmed up as a result of industry production cuts and grain prices appear to be on a fairly stable position. Taking these considerations into account and in light of our strong results in Q2, we are again raising our full year guidance range from $2.68 to $2.78 per share to $2.75 to $2.85 per share, excluding the one-time charges of $0.10 per share associated with the plant closing and health care laws. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen in Austin to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter."

Good morning, everyone. As we announced in our earnings release issued this morning, our second quarter results were impacted by the one-time charges related to the closure of our plant in Turlock, California and tax charges primarily related to the newly enacted health care laws. These one-time charges resulted in an adjustment to diluted net earnings of approximately $0.10 per share for the second quarter. A table reconciling our adjusted earning calculations to earnings calculated under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles was included in our earnings release as well.
For the second quarter of 2010, adjusted net earnings totaled $91.3 million or $0.67 per share compared to $80.4 million or $0.59 per share a year ago. Adjusted net earnings for the first half of fiscal 2010 totaled $202.5 million or $1.50 per share compared to $161.8 million or $1.20 per share a year ago. On a GAAP basis, net earnings for the second quarter of 2010 totaled $77.9 million or $0.57 per share. GAAP net earnings for the first half of 2010 were $189.1 million or $1.40 per share.
Dollar sales for the second quarter totaled $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year, a 7% increase. For the first half of the fiscal year, dollar sales increased 4% to $3.4 billion. Volume for the second quarter was 1.1 billion pounds, up 2% from fiscal 2009. Year-to-date, volume was $2.3 billion, also up 2% from fiscal 2009. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 8.6% of sales compared to 8.8% last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 8.5% compared to 8.6% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8.8% of sales for the remainder of the year. Advertising expenses were 1.5% of sales for the quarter compared to 1.6% in 2009. Year-to-date, advertising expenses are 1.5% of sales, even with last year. We saw an absolute dollar increase in advertising expense in the second quarter and expect that advertising dollars will exceed 2009 expenditures on a full year basis.
Interest in investment income was $1.4 million for the second quarter compared to $8.6 million in fiscal 2009. In the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a $3.6 million gain on the dissolution of the CARAPELLI joint venture. In addition, we experienced higher returns on our rabbi trust investments in 2009. We expect difficult comparisons in the back half of the year due to the strong performance of our rabbi trust investments in 2009.
Interest expense for the quarter was $6.6 million compared to $6.9 million last year. Year-to-date, interest expense is $13.1 million compared to $14.4 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $27 million to $28 million for fiscal 2010. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 40.7% versus 35.3% in fiscal 2009. The increase in 2010 was driven by the one-time impact of recently enacted Health Care legislation and the reduction in the value of our deferred tax asset due to the change in the tax treatment of Medicare Part D reimbursements. Year-to-date, effective tax rate is 36.8% compared to 34.9% last year. For fiscal 2010, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.
Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 134 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 136 million shares. We repurchased 330,000 shares of common stock during the second quarter and have 367,000 shares remaining to be repurchased from the 10 million share authorization in place. 
Total debt at the end of the quarter was $350 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31 million, even with last year. For the first half of the year, depreciation and amortization was $61 million compared to $62 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million to $127 million in fiscal 2010.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $22 million compared to $20 million last year. For the first six months of the year, capital expenditures totaled $40 million compared to $46 million last year. For fiscal 2010, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $105 million to $115 million.

We did feel the same impact in certain elements on the Refrigerated Foods portfolio, but they have the offset of the hog cutouts to dissipate that somewhat. Now items that are pork-based items, particularly our SPAM luncheon meat or Hormel Bacon Bits, did see early steep increases in the raw material costs during the quarter and that have compressed the margins then to a lower level than what we have been generating in the prior quarter and even the prior same quarter last year. In terms of sales, Grocery Products overall, they generate positive sales for the quarter. As I mentioned, if you sort out the discontinued business, the CARAPELLI, and you put aside the new franchises that we joined to the company through the MegaMex venture, the net effect of those two would be to flatten out GP sales, so it was kind of a mixed bag again within their portfolio. Chili did well, hash did well, the Mexican products did well. Compleats was sort of back to even, which was just trending the direction we needed to trend. But we did see softer sales of some of the other canned items such as SPAM and Dinty Moore this quarter and the chunk meat items also were a little bit off."

But if we do experience a shift where people start going out a little bit more often and businesses start attending a few more conferences, et cetera, we're certainly well positioned to take advantage of that. We have Foodservice elements in four of our five operating segments, and they're all poised with good sales organizations and with good products hopefully to deliver against that audience. Within the grocery environment, not talking just grocery products, but grocery stores, our impression has been that the recession has had mixed results. I mean, we clearly saw some benefit to the traditional canned franchises for a time there where almost all of those items were up. This quarter was more mixed in that regard with Chili and hash up and Dinty Moore and SPAM down.

On our call today is Jeff Ettinger, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jody Feragen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

We appreciate your patience in that regard. 
Jeff will provide a review of the operating results for the quarter, then Jody will provide detailed financial results for the quarter. The line will be then open for questions following Jody's remarks.  An audio replay of this call will be available beginning at 10:30 a.m. Central Time today, May 19, 2010.

Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making. Among the factors that may affect the operating results of the company are fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and market conditions for finished products.

We are pleased to report strong earnings and sales for the second quarter. Our Q2 earnings of $0.67 per share, excluding the one-time charges of $0.10 per share associated with the plant closing and the health care laws, represent a 14% increase over our results of the year ago. Total dollar sales were also up 7% over a year ago. This quarter once again demonstrates the benefit of our balanced business model, as the strong performance of our Jennie-O Turkey Store and Specialty Foods segments more than made up for the results of our Grocery Product and all other segments. 
I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products segment reported a $1 sales increase of 6% and a segment operating profit decrease of 2%, the latter after adjusting for the one-time charges associated with our VALLEY FRESH plant closing. Net of the new item sales of Mexican products under the MegaMex Foods venture and of the discontinued CARAPELLI Olive Oil sales, revenues for Grocery Products would have been flat for the quarter.
Stronger sales of our Mexican products and our Hormel Chili and Hormel Mary Kitchen hash products were not able to completely offset the pressure on margins in our SPAM family of products and our Hormel Bacon Bits items, prompted by higher raw material costs. The increased sales of Hormel Chili and Hormel Mary Kitchen hash resulted from increased distribution and from our new Hormel brand advertising campaign. The campaign is designed to leverage our leading brand strength in numerous categories to promote cross purchase intent. We are pleased with the success of our MegaMex Foods venture so far, as sales of over $120 million through the first half are on pace to easily exceed the base level sales of $200 million on an annualized basis. 
Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported operating profit of 7%, aided by stronger cutout margins compared to a year ago. Sales were also up 7% for Refrigerated Foods. We enjoyed particularly strong sales of Hormel Party Trays and Hormel pepperoni, helped in part by new products and in part by our Hormel brand advertising campaign and in part by the great efforts of our sales organization in generating meaningful in-store promotions.
We are pleased with the progress in the integration of our recent Country Crock Side Dish business. Our team has done a good job stabilizing this business during the quarter. We can now provide complete meal solutions to consumers in the Refrigerated section of the store, complementing our Hormel refrigerated entrées and Lloyd's Barbecue products. We have begun to see signs of improvement in the Foodservice trades. Sales of our Natural Choice deli meats, Austin Blues barbecue products and Café H ethnic products all grew during the quarter.
Segment operating profit at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment increased by a noteworthy 93%, with sales up 1%. Jennie-O's results came from improved efficiencies throughout the entire business. Export sales of dark turkey meat have given us an added boost as thigh meat pricing has remained very strong. Sales increased for Jennie-O in all three value-added areas, retail, deli and Foodservice, led by retail tray pack fresh turkey and rotisserie deli products. We continue to generate excellent exposure for the Jennie-O Turkey Store brand through our sponsorship of the Biggest Loser reality TV show. 
Our Specialty Foods segment again posted improved segment operating profit and sales, up 39% and 13% respectively, with contributions by all three subunits of Specialty Foods. The leading drivers of these improved results were sports nutrition products, private-label canned meat products and sugar substitutes.
In our All Other International segment, segment operating profit declined 18%, while sales increased by 7%. We did generate excellent sales of our SPAM family of products, but this was not sufficient to offset the reduced returns we experienced related to lower fresh pork exports. In our February call, we mentioned that higher hog costs were on their way. These increased costs did indeed arrive and at a higher level than originally anticipated. We expect this trend to continue as we get into warmer weather. 
On the other hand, commodity turkey prices have firmed up, as a result of industry production cuts, and grain prices appear to be on a fairly stable position. Taking these considerations into account and in light of our strong results in Q2, we are again raising our full year guidance range from $2.68 to $2.78 per share to $2.75 to $2.85 per share, excluding the one-time charges of $0.10 per share associated with the plant closing and health care laws. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen in Austin to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter."

Good morning, everyone. As we announced in our earnings release issued this morning, our second quarter results were impacted by the one-time charges related to the closure of our plant in Turlock, California and tax charges primarily related to the newly enacted health care laws. These one-time charges resulted in an adjustment to diluted net earnings of approximately $0.10 per share for the second quarter. A table reconciling our adjusted earning calculation to earnings calculated under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles was included in our earnings release as well.
For the second quarter of 2010, adjusted net earnings totaled $91.3 million, or $0.67 per share, compared to $80.4 million, or $0.59 per share a year ago. Adjusted net earnings for the first half of fiscal 2010 totaled $202.5 million, or $1.50 per share, compared to $161.8 million, or $1.20 per share a year ago. On a GAAP basis, net earnings for the second quarter of 2010 totaled $77.9 million, or $0.57 per share. GAAP net earnings for the first half of 2010 were $189.1 million, or $1.40 per share.
Dollar sales for the second quarter totaled $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year, a 7% increase. For the first half of the fiscal year, dollar sales increased 4% to $3.4 billion. Volume for the second quarter was 1.1 billion pounds, up 2% from fiscal 2009. Year-to-date, volume was $2.3 billion, also up 2% from fiscal 2009. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 8.6% of sales compared to 8.8% last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 8.5% compared to 8.6% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8.8% of sales for the remainder of the year. 
Advertising expenses were 1.5% of sales for the quarter compared to 1.6% in 2009. Year-to-date, advertising expenses are 1.5% of sales, even with last year. We saw an absolute dollar increase in advertising expense in the second quarter and expect that advertising dollars will exceed 2009 expenditures on a full year basis.
Interest and investment income was $1.4 million for the second quarter compared to $8.6 million in fiscal 2009. In the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a $3.6 million gain on the dissolution of the CARAPELLI joint venture. In addition, we experienced higher returns on our rabbi trust investments in 2009. We expect difficult comparisons in the back half of the year, due to the strong performance of our rabbi trust investments in 2009.
Interest expense for the quarter was $6.6 million compared to $6.9 million last year. Year-to-date, interest expense is $13.1 million compared to $14.4 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $27 million to $28 million for fiscal 2010. 
Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 40.7% versus 35.3% in fiscal 2009. The increase in 2010 was driven by the one-time impact of recently enacted healthcare legislation and the reduction in the value of our deferred tax assets, due to the change in the tax treatment of Medicare Part D reimbursement. Year-to-date, effective tax rate is 36.8% compared to 34.9% last year. For fiscal 2010, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.
Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 134 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 136 million shares. We repurchased 330,000 shares of common stock during the second quarter and have 367,000 shares remaining to be repurchased from the 10 million share authorization in place. 
Total debt at the end of the quarter was $350 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31 million, even with last year. For the first half of the year, depreciation and amortization was $61 million compared to $62 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million to $127 million in fiscal 2010.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $22 million compared to $20 million last year. For the first six months of the year, capital expenditures totaled $40 million compared to $46 million last year. For fiscal 2010, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $105 million to $115 million.

As I mentioned, if you sort out the discontinued business, the CARAPELLI, and you put aside the new franchises that we joined to the company through the MegaMex venture, the net effect of those two would be to flatten out GP sales, so it was kind of a mixed bag again within their portfolio. Chili did well, hash did well, the Mexican products did well. Compleats was sort of back to even, which was just trending the direction we needed to trend. But we did see softer sales of some of the other canned items such as SPAM and Dinty Moore this quarter and the chunk meat items also were a little bit off."

We have Foodservice elements in four of our five operating segments, and they're all poised with good sales organizations and with good products hopefully to deliver against that audience. Within the grocery environment, not talking just grocery products, but grocery stores. Our impression has been that the recession has had mixed results. I mean, we clearly saw some benefit to the traditional canned franchises for a time there where almost all of those items were up. This quarter was more mixed in that regard with Chili and Hash up and Dinty Moore and SPAM down.

And so sort of baked into our second half number here is the expectation that it's going to be a more challenging environment for Grocery Products and Refrigerated Foods. We do think some of the other segments can offset that substantially but that is out there. Our best outlook right now for 2011 would be along the lines of what you're describing, which is I would expect our team to react to the environmental change and we're either going to have to address pricing if there is a new higher cost level that is going to stay in place or if some of those costs recede somewhat, we should be in a position in 2011 to achieve our normal long-term growth objectives."

We're pleased to report another excellent quarter building upon the momentum of our strong first half of the year. We were able to grow both earnings and sales by double digits in what is still a challenging consumer environment.",740,"Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another excellent quarter building upon the momentum of our strong first half of the year. We were able to grow both earnings and sales by double digits in what is still a challenging consumer environment.  Earnings per share increased to $0.63, up 11% from a year ago, fueled by segment profit gains in four of our five segments. Total dollar sales of $1.7 billion were up 10% from a year ago.
I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products group reported a segment profit decrease of 23% and a dollar sales increase of 12% for the third quarter. The majority of the sales increase can be attributed to increased sales of products by our MegaMex Foods business. We are pleased with the success of MegaMex thus far as we continue to gain additional distribution in the retail trade channels. 
At the Grocery Product segment profit level, however, the higher sales of Mexican products and increased sales of our Hormel Chili items were unable to offset the pressure from higher raw material costs on our SPAM family of products or Hormel bacon toppings and our chunk meat brands. 
Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported a segment profit increase of 11% aided by continued strong cutout margins and a sales increase of 12%. This year, strong cutout margins have given us the balance to continue growing earnings during a time of rising hog costs. Last year, our value-added products provided the lift we needed to continue to enhance segment profit. 
On the Retail side, we continue to generate strong sales growth from our Hormel Party Trays. In addition, our new items such as snack stix and minis continue to drive sales growth of our Hormel pepperoni line. We also achieved additional distribution of our Natural Choice deli meats. 
Our team is doing a nice job with the integration of our Country Crock Side Dish business, capturing synergies and co-marketing these products with our Hormel Refrigerated Entrees and with other products such as our Lloyd's Barbeque line. 
Our Foodservice group has also had success growing sales of branded value-added products during the quarter. Sales of our Natural Choice deli meat, Austin Blues barbeque products, Café H ethnic products and pizza toppings all grew during the quarter. Jennie-O Turkey Store increased segment profit a strong 93% on flat total sales. While higher commodity turkey meat prices and lower feed costs helped, the primary driver of our results at Jennie-O was improved efficiencies across the entire supply chain and in our operations. Strong export sales of turkey thigh meat also aided results. 
Sales of value-added products at Jennie-O Turkey Store grew in all three areas: Deli, Foodservice and Retail, led by Retail's tray pack fresh turkey and rotisserie deli products. We spent heavily on advertising on the Jennie-O Turkey Store brand in the third quarter, gaining additional exposure and building the strength of the brand.
Our Specialty Foods segments continued its momentum this quarter by growing segment profit in sales 19% and 12%, respectively. All three business units contributed to the results, led by sales of sports and nutrition products, private-label canned meat and sugar products. 
In our All Other International segment, segment profits increased 3% and sales grew 13%. Continued excellent sales of our SPAM family of products were sufficient to offset pressure on our export sales from higher raw material costs.
We expect higher hog costs to continue in the fourth quarter, negatively impacting margins in our value-added Refrigerated Foods businesses and in our pork-based Grocery Products items. We also expect to continue to invest in our Jennie-O Turkey Store brand during the quarter through significantly higher advertising spending. On the positive side, we expect our Jennie-O Turkey Store unit to continue to substantially outperform compared to a year ago. And so far, in the fourth quarter, cutout margins have remained strong in Refrigerated Foods.
Taking these considerations into account and in light of our strong performance in the third quarter, we are, again, raising our full year guidance range from $2.75 to $2.85 per share up to $2.85 to $2.91 per share on an adjusted basis.  It appears we are on track to achieve our long-term goal of growing earnings per share by at least 10% for the second consecutive year. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information related to the third quarter."

For the third quarter of fiscal 2010, net earnings totaled $85.4 million or $0.63 per share compared to a $77.2 million or $0.57 per share a year ago.

Adjusted net earnings for the nine months of fiscal 2010 totaled $287.8 million or $2.13 per share compared to $238.9 million or $1.76 per share a year ago. Adjusted net earnings exclude the one-time charges related to the plant closure and the tax impact that healthcare law changes that were incurred in the second quarter of this year. U.S. GAAP net earnings through the third quarter of 2010 were $274.4 million or $2.03 a share.
Dollar sales for the third quarter totaled $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year, a 10% increase. For the nine months, dollar sales increased 6% to $5.2 billion. Volume for the third quarter was 1.1 billion pounds, up 2% from 2009. Year-to-date, volume was 3.5 billion, also up 2% from fiscal 2009. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were 8.5% of sales compared to 9% last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 8.5% compared to 8.7% last year.
Advertising expenses were 1.8% of sales for the quarter compared to 1.6% in 2009. Year-to-date, advertising expenses are 1.6% of sales compared to 1.5% last year. As Jeff mentioned, we expect that advertising dollars will substantially exceed 2009 on a full year basis as we increase spending level from the fourth quarter.
Interest and investment income was $310,000 for the third quarter compared to $6.4 million in fiscal 2009. As we expected, lower returns in 2010 on our rabbi trust investments drove the decrease. We also expect difficult comparisons in the fourth quarter of this year due to the stronger returns on our investments in 2009.
Interest expense for the quarter was $6.5 million compared to $7 million last year. Year-to-date, interest expense is $19.6 million compared to $21.3 million last year. We expect interest expense to be about $26 million for fiscal 2010.
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 35.8% versus 34.4% in fiscal 2009. The year-to-date effective tax rate is 36.5% compared to 34.7% last year. For fiscal 2010, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was $133 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was $135 million. We repurchased 583,000 shares of common stock during the third quarter, and we have 4.8 million shares remaining to be purchased from the $5 million share authorization currently in place.
Total debt at the end of the quarter was $350 million and was reclassified into current maturities during the quarter. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31 million compared to $32 million last year. For the first nine months of the year, depreciation and amortization was $92 million compared to $94 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $124 million for fiscal 2010.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $24 million compared to $25 million last year. For the first nine months of the year, capital expenditures totaled $64 million compared to $71 million last year. For fiscal 2010, we expect CapEx to be approximately $90 million to $100 million.

In terms of an outlook, we expect better sales in some of the canned items as we head into the traditional can season for this fall. We expect the momentum to continue in Mexican. And really, the item I have my eye on the most that we really need to figure out a turnaround story on, would be the Compleats franchise, because we were, again, down slightly on Compleats this quarter. And you're aware of our investment in its Dubuque plant and how important that line is for the company, and so we're confident that we're going to find the right recipe to regain growth in that franchise."

Value-added meals, processed items, value-added fresh meat, particularly in Turkey and pork, and then, solution products for the Foodservice and deli. And we work with bankers, we work with businesses that we can identify on our own, and we certainly look for opportunities in any of those areas, and then we certainly have recognized that we're perhaps on the underleveraged side in terms of international versus domestic. And so we talked before that, that's a particular area of interest to us, would be to look for investments in the international area, particularly in Asia."

We are pleased to report another excellent quarter building upon the momentum of our strong first half of the year. We were able to grow both earnings and sales by double digits in what is still a challenging consumer environment.",740,"Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another excellent quarter building upon the momentum of our strong first half of the year. We were able to grow both earnings and sales by double digits in what is still a challenging consumer environment.
Earnings per share increased to $0.63, up 11% from a year ago, fueled by segment profit gains in four of our five segments. Total dollar sales of $1.7 billion were up 10% from a year ago.
I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products group reported a segment profit decrease of 23% and a dollar sales increase of 12% for the third quarter.
The majority of the sales increase can be attributed to increased sales of products by our MegaMex Foods business. We are pleased with the success of MegaMex thus far as we continue to gain additional distribution in the retail trade channels.
The Grocery Products segment profit level, however, the higher sales of Mexican products and increased sales of our Hormel chili items were unable to offset the pressure from higher raw material costs on our SPAM family of products, our Hormel bacon toppings and our chunk meat brands.
Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported a segment profit increase of 11% aided by continued strong cut out margins and a sales increase of 12%. This year, strong cutout margins have given us the balance to continue growing earnings during a time of rising hog cost. Last year, our value-added products provided the lift we needed to continue to enhance segment profit.
On the retail side, we continue to generate strong sales growth from our Hormel party trays. In addition, our new item such as snack sticks and minis continue to drive sales growth of our Hormel pepperoni line.
We also achieved additional distribution of our Natural Choice deli meats. Our team is doing a nice job with the integration of our Country Crock side dish business, capturing synergies and co-marketing these products with our Hormel refrigerated entrée and with other product, such as our Lloyd’s barbeque line.
Our Foodservice group has also had success growing sales of branded value-added products during the quarter. Sales of our Natural Choice deli meats, Austin Blues barbeque products and Café H ethnic products, and pizza-toppings all grew during the quarter.
Jennie-O Turkey Store increased segment profit a strong 93% on flat total sales, while higher commodity turkey meat prices and lower feed cost helped, the primary driver of our results at Jennie-O was improved efficiencies across the entire supply chain and in our operations. Strong export sales of turkey thigh meat also aided results.
Sales of value-added products at Jennie-O Turkey Store grew in all three areas; deli, foodservice and retail, led by retail tray pack fresh turkey and rotisserie deli product. We spent heavily on advertising on the Jennie-O Turkey Store brand in the third quarter gaining additional exposure and building the strength of the brand.
Our Specialty Food segment continued its momentum this quarter by growing segment profit and sales 19% and 12% respectively. All three business units contributed to the results led by sales of sports nutrition products, private label canned meats and sugar products.
In our all other international segment, segment profit increased 3% and sales grew 13%. Continued excellent sales of our SPAM family of products were sufficient to offset pressure on our export sales from higher raw material costs.
We expect higher hog cost to continue in the fourth quarter, negatively impacting margins in our value-added Refrigerated Foods businesses and in our pork-based grocery products items. We also expect to continue to invest in our Jennie-O Turkey Store brand during the quarter through significantly higher advertising spending.
On the positive side, we except our Jennie-O Turkey Store unit to continue to substantially outperform compared to a year ago, and so far in the fourth quarter, cutout margins have remained strong in Refrigerated Foods.
Taking these considerations into account and in light of our strong performance in the third quarter, we are, again, raising our full-year guidance range from $2.75 to $2.85 per share, up to $2.85 to $2.91 per share on an adjusted basis. It appears we are on track to achieve our long-term goal of growing earnings per share by at least 10% for the second consecutive year.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information related to the third quarter.

For the third quarter of fiscal 2010, net earnings totaled $85.4 million or $0.63 per share compared to $77.2 million or $0.57 per share a year ago.

For the third quarter of fiscal 2010, net earnings totaled $85.4 million or $0.63 per share compared to $77.2 million or $0.57 per share a year ago. Adjusted net earnings for the nine months of fiscal 2010 totaled $287.8 million or $2.13 per share compared to $238.9 million or $1.76 per share a year ago.
Adjusted net earnings exclude the one-time charges related to the plant closure and the tax impact of health care law changes that were incurred in the second quarter of this year. US GAAP net earnings for this year-to-date through the third quarter of 2010 were $274.4 million or $2.03 a share.
Dollar sales for the third quarter totaled $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year, a 10% increase. For the nine-month, dollar sales increased 6% to $5.2 billion. Volume for the third quarter was 1.1 billion pounds, up 2% from 2009. Year-to-date, volume was 3.5 billion, also up 2% from fiscal 2009.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were 8.5% of sales compared to 9% last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 8.5% compared to 8.7% last year.
Advertising expenses were 1.8% of sales for the quarter compared to 1.6% in 2009. Year-to-date, advertising expenses are 1.6% of sales compared to 1.5% last year. As Jeff mentioned, we expect that advertising dollars will substantially exceed 2009 on a full year basis as we increase spending levels in the fourth quarter.
Interest and investment income was $310,000 for the third quarter compared to $6.4 million in fiscal 2009. As we expected, lower returns in 2010 on our rabbi trust investments drove the decrease. We also expect difficult comparisons in the fourth quarter of this year due to the stronger returns on our investments in 2009.
Interest expense for the quarter was $6.5 million compared to $7 million last year. Year-to-date, interest expense is $19.6 million compared to $21.3 million last year. We expect interest expense to be about $26 million for fiscal 2010.
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 35.8% versus 34.4% in fiscal 2009. The year-to-date effective tax rate is 36.5% compared to 34.7% last year. For fiscal 2010, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 133 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 135 million.
We repurchased 583,000 shares of common stock during the third quarter and we have 4.8 million shares remaining to be purchased from the 5 million share authorization currently in place.
Total debt at the end of the quarter was $350 million and was reclassified into current maturities during the quarter.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31 million compared to $32 million last year. For the first nine months of the year, depreciation and amortization was $92 million compared to $94 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $124 million for fiscal 2010.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $24 million compared to $25 million last year. For the first nine months of the year, capital expenditures totaled $64 million compared to $71 million last year. For fiscal 2010, we expect CapEx to be approximately $90 million to $100 million.

In terms of an outlook, we expect better sales from some of the canned items as we head into the traditional can season for this fall. We expect the momentum to continue in Mexican. Really, the item I have my eye on the most that we really need to figure out a turnaround story on would be the Compleats franchise because we were again down slightly on Compleats this quarter.

Jeff, you sounded mindful of balancing price increases to cover margins against a sluggish consumer demand backdrop, it seems.

We're pleased to report another excellent quarter building upon the momentum of our strong first half of the year. We were able to grow both earnings and sales by double digits in what is still a challenging consumer environment.",740,"Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another excellent quarter building upon the momentum of our strong first half of the year. We were able to grow both earnings and sales by double digits in what is still a challenging consumer environment.  Earnings per share increased to $0.63, up 11% from a year ago, fueled by segment profit gains in four of our five segments. Total dollar sales of $1.7 billion were up 10% from a year ago.
I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products group reported a segment profit decrease of 23% and a dollar sales increase of 12% for the third quarter. The majority of the sales increase can be attributed to increased sales of products by our MegaMex Foods business. We are pleased with the success of MegaMex thus far as we continue to gain additional distribution in the retail trade channels. 
At the Grocery Product segment profit level, however, the higher sales of Mexican products and increased sales of our Hormel Chili items were unable to offset the pressure from higher raw material costs on our SPAM family of products or Hormel bacon toppings and our chunk meat brands. 
Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported a segment profit increase of 11% aided by continued strong cutout margins and a sales increase of 12%. This year, strong cutout margins have given us the balance to continue growing earnings during a time of rising hog costs. Last year, our value-added products provided the lift we needed to continue to enhance segment profit. 
On the Retail side, we continue to generate strong sales growth from our Hormel Party Trays. In addition, our new items such as snack stix and minis continue to drive sales growth of our Hormel pepperoni line. We also achieved additional distribution of our Natural Choice deli meats. 
Our team is doing a nice job with the integration of our Country Crock Side Dish business, capturing synergies and co-marketing these products with our Hormel Refrigerated Entrees and with other products such as our Lloyd's Barbeque line. 
Our Foodservice group has also had success growing sales of branded value-added products during the quarter. Sales of our Natural Choice deli meat, Austin Blues barbeque products, Café H ethnic products and pizza toppings all grew during the quarter. Jennie-O Turkey Store increased segment profit a strong 93% on flat total sales. While higher commodity turkey meat prices and lower feed costs helped, the primary driver of our results at Jennie-O was improved efficiencies across the entire supply chain and in our operations. Strong export sales of turkey thigh meat also aided results. 
Sales of value-added products at Jennie-O Turkey Store grew in all three areas: Deli, Foodservice and Retail, led by Retail's tray pack fresh turkey and rotisserie deli products. We spent heavily on advertising on the Jennie-O Turkey Store brand in the third quarter, gaining additional exposure and building the strength of the brand.
Our Specialty Foods segments continued its momentum this quarter by growing segment profit in sales 19% and 12%, respectively. All three business units contributed to the results, led by sales of sports and nutrition products, private-label canned meat and sugar products. 
In our All Other International segment, segment profits increased 3% and sales grew 13%. Continued excellent sales of our SPAM family of products were sufficient to offset pressure on our export sales from higher raw material costs.
We expect higher hog costs to continue in the fourth quarter, negatively impacting margins in our value-added Refrigerated Foods businesses and in our pork-based Grocery Products items. We also expect to continue to invest in our Jennie-O Turkey Store brand during the quarter through significantly higher advertising spending. On the positive side, we expect our Jennie-O Turkey Store unit to continue to substantially outperform compared to a year ago. And so far, in the fourth quarter, cutout margins have remained strong in Refrigerated Foods.
Taking these considerations into account and in light of our strong performance in the third quarter, we are, again, raising our full year guidance range from $2.75 to $2.85 per share up to $2.85 to $2.91 per share on an adjusted basis.  It appears we are on track to achieve our long-term goal of growing earnings per share by at least 10% for the second consecutive year. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information related to the third quarter."

For the third quarter of fiscal 2010, net earnings totaled $85.4 million or $0.63 per share compared to a $77.2 million or $0.57 per share a year ago.  Adjusted net earnings for the nine months of fiscal 2010 total",575,"Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of fiscal 2010, net earnings totaled $85.4 million or $0.63 per share compared to a $77.2 million or $0.57 per share a year ago.  Adjusted net earnings for the nine months of fiscal 2010 totaled $287.8 million or $2.13 per share compared to $238.9 million or $1.76 per share a year ago. Adjusted net earnings exclude the one-time charges related to the plant closure and the tax impact of healthcare law changes that were incurred in the second quarter of this year. U.S. GAAP net earnings year-to-date through the third quarter of 2010 were $274.4 million or $2.03 a share.
Dollar sales for the third quarter totaled $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year, a 10% increase. For the nine months, dollar sales increased 6% to $5.2 billion. Volume for the third quarter was 1.1 billion pounds, up 2% from 2009. Year-to-date, volume was 3.5 billion, also up 2% from fiscal 2009. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were 8.5% of sales compared to 9% last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 8.5% compared to 8.7% last year.
Advertising expenses were 1.8% of sales for the quarter compared to 1.6% in 2009. Year-to-date, advertising expenses are 1.6% of sales compared to 1.5% last year. As Jeff mentioned, we expect that advertising dollars will substantially exceed 2009 on a full year basis as we increase spending levels in the fourth quarter.
Interest and investment income was $310,000 for the third quarter compared to $6.4 million in fiscal 2009. As we expected, lower returns in 2010 on our rabbi trust investments drove the decrease. We also expect difficult comparisons in the fourth quarter of this year due to the stronger returns on our investments in 2009.
Interest expense for the quarter was $6.5 million compared to $7 million last year. Year-to-date, interest expense is $19.6 million compared to $21.3 million last year. We expect interest expense to be about $26 million for fiscal 2010.
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 35.8% versus 34.4% in fiscal 2009. The year-to-date effective tax rate is 36.5% compared to 34.7% last year. For fiscal 2010, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 133 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 135 million. We repurchased 583,000 shares of common stock during the third quarter, and we have 4.8 million shares remaining to be purchased from the 5 million share authorization currently in place.
Total debt at the end of the quarter was $350 million and was reclassified into current maturities during the quarter. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31 million compared to $32 million last year. For the first nine months of the year, depreciation and amortization was $92 million compared to $94 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $124 million for fiscal 2010.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $24 million compared to $25 million last year. For the first nine months of the year, capital expenditures totaled $64 million compared to $71 million last year. For fiscal 2010, we expect CapEx to be approximately $90 million to $100 million.

We've seen some backing off, that's on year-over-year, and we're still, if you go back a couple of years, even the current SPAM numbers are pretty darn good. Those franchises should continue to do well. As we pointed out though, I mean, we have items that are far from bottom-dollar items that are doing very well in this economy. Our party trays are doing great. Our Pepperoni minis are doing great, and the Pepperoni stix, our Natural Choice items continue to gain distribution. And so, it really seems to be category-by-category and what are you offering to the consumer who was looking for that category item that makes the difference here. The only other secular trend, I guess, that I can point to in our business is, we are seeing continued improvement in the Foodservice part, particularly with the branded value-added items. They had a nice quarter with those."

We are pleased to report another excellent quarter building upon the momentum of our strong first half of the year. We were able to grow both earnings and sales by double digits in what is still a challenging consumer environment.",740,"Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another excellent quarter building upon the momentum of our strong first half of the year. We were able to grow both earnings and sales by double digits in what is still a challenging consumer environment.  
Earnings per share increased to $0.63, up 11% from a year ago, fueled by segment profit gains in four of our five segments. Total dollar sales of $1.7 billion were up 10% from a year ago.
I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products group reported a segment profit decrease of 23% and a dollar sales increase of 12% for the third quarter. The majority of the sales increase can be attributed to increased sales of products by our MegaMex Foods business. 
We are pleased with the success of MegaMex thus far, as we continue to gain additional distribution in the retail trade channels. At the Grocery Product segment profit level, however, the higher sales of Mexican products and increased sales of our Hormel Chili items were unable to offset the pressure from higher raw material costs on our SPAM family of products or Hormel bacon toppings and our chunk meat brands. 
Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported a segment profit increase of 11% aided by continued strong cutout margins and a sales increase of 12%. This year, strong cutout margins have given us the balance to continue growing earnings during a time of rising hog costs. Last year, our value-added products provided the lift we needed to continue to enhance segment profit. 
On the Retail side, we continue to generate strong sales growth from our Hormel Party Trays. In addition, our new items, such as snack sticks and minis, continue to drive sales growth of our Hormel Pepperoni line. We also achieved additional distribution of our Natural Choice deli meats. 
Our team is doing a nice job with the integration of our Country Crock Side Dish business, capturing synergies and co-marketing these products with our Hormel Refrigerated Entrees and with other products such as our Lloyd's Barbeque line. 
Our Foodservice group has also had success growing sales of branded value-added products during the quarter. Sales of our Natural Choice deli meat, AUSTIN BLUES BBQ products, Café H ethnic products and pizza toppings all grew during the quarter. 
Jennie-O Turkey Store increased segment profit a strong 93% on flat total sales. While higher commodity turkey meat prices and lower feed costs helped, the primary driver of our results at Jennie-O was improved efficiencies across the entire supply chain and in our operations. Strong export sales of Turkey Thigh Meat also aided results. 
Sales of value-added products at Jennie-O Turkey Store grew in all three areas: Deli, Foodservice and Retail, led by Retail's tray-pack fresh turkey and rotisserie deli products. We spent heavily on advertising on the Jennie-O Turkey Store brand in the third quarter, gaining additional exposure and building the strength of the brand.
Our Specialty Foods segments continued its momentum this quarter by growing segment profit in sales 19% and 12%, respectively. All three business units contributed to the results, led by sales of sports and nutrition products, private-label canned meat and sugar products. 
In our All Other International segment, segment profit increased 3% and sales grew 13%. Continued excellent sales of our SPAM family of products were sufficient to offset pressure on our export sales from higher raw material costs.
We expect higher hog costs to continue in the fourth quarter, negatively impacting margins in our value-added Refrigerated Foods businesses and in our pork-based Grocery Products items. We also expect to continue to invest in our Jennie-O Turkey Store brand during the quarter through significantly higher advertising spending. 
On the positive side, we expect our Jennie-O Turkey Store unit to continue to substantially outperform compared to a year ago. And so far, in the fourth quarter, cutout margins have remained strong in Refrigerated Foods.
Taking these considerations into account and in light of our strong performance in the third quarter, we are, again, raising our full year guidance range from $2.75 to $2.85 per share up to $2.85 to $2.91 per share on an adjusted basis.  It appears we are on track to achieve our long-term goal of growing earnings per share by at least 10% for the second consecutive year. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information related to the third quarter."

For the third quarter of fiscal 2010, net earnings totaled $85.4 million or $0.63 per share compared to a $77.2 million or $0.57 per share a year ago. Adjusted net earnings for the nine months of fiscal 2010 totaled $287.8 million or $2.13 per share compared to $238.9 million or $1.76 per share a year ago. Adjusted net earnings exclude the one-time charges related to the plant closure and the tax impact of healthcare law changes that were incurred in the second quarter of this year. U.S. GAAP net earnings year-to-date through the third quarter of 2010 were $274.4 million or $2.03 a share.
Dollar sales for the third quarter totaled $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year, a 10% increase. For the nine months, dollar sales increased 6% to $5.2 billion. Volume for the third quarter was 1.1 billion pounds, up 2% from 2009. Year-to-date, volume was 3.5 billion, also up 2% from fiscal 2009. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were 8.5% of sales compared to 9% last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 8.5% compared to 8.7% last year.
Advertising expenses were 1.8% of sales for the quarter compared to 1.6% in 2009. Year-to-date, advertising expenses are 1.6% of sales compared to 1.5% last year. As Jeff mentioned, we expect that advertising dollars will substantially exceed 2009 on a full year basis as we increase spending levels in the fourth quarter.
Interest and investment income was $310,000 for the third quarter compared to $6.4 million in fiscal 2009. As we expected, lower returns in 2010 on our rabbi trust investments drove the decrease. We also expect difficult comparisons in the fourth quarter of this year due to the stronger returns on our investments in 2009.
Interest expense for the quarter was $6.5 million compared to $7 million last year. Year-to-date, interest expense is $19.6 million compared to $21.3 million last year. We expect interest expense to be about $26 million for fiscal 2010.
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 35.8% versus 34.4% in fiscal 2009. The year-to-date effective tax rate is 36.5% compared to 34.7% last year. For fiscal 2010, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 133 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 135 million. We repurchased 583,000 shares of common stock during the third quarter, and we have 4.8 million shares remaining to be purchased from the 5 million share authorization currently in place.
Total debt at the end of the quarter was $350 million and was reclassified into current maturities during the quarter. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31 million compared to $32 million last year. For the first nine months of the year, depreciation and amortization was $92 million compared to $94 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $124 million for fiscal 2010.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $24 million compared to $25 million last year. For the first nine months of the year, capital expenditures totaled $64 million compared to $71 million last year. For fiscal 2010, we expect CapEx to be approximately $90 million to $100 million.

Our sales momentum from the previous two quarters accelerated in the fourth quarter. Total company sales for the quarter were $2.1 billion, up a substantial 23% from a year ago. As a result, we exceeded the $7 billion level in sales for the first time in our company's history, and all five segments contributed to the sales gain. 
I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products group reported a segment profit decrease of 6% and a sales gain of 24% for the fourth quarter. For the year, segment operating profit was down 4%, and sales were up 13%. Segment profit during the quarter and for the year was adversely impacted by higher raw material cost and the Q2 charge related to the VALLEY FRESH plant closing. Notwithstanding this profit decrease, we were pleased to see the solid sales results delivered by the Grocery Products unit and our consumer products sales organization. Sales was driven higher by Hormel Chili and hash, Compleats microwave meals and strong sales growth across much of our MegaMex Foods product portfolio. 
Last quarter, I said I would provide more clarity around the impact of MegaMex Foods on the Grocery Products operating margins. Our operating margins for the year was 15%. Without MegaMex Foods sales, it would have been 18%. The Absence of Tara Kelly sales also improved operating margins for Grocery Products. Going forward, because Don Miguel sales initially will not be reflected in our segment top line results, the profits on those sales should improve the reported operating margin for Grocery Products.
Our Refrigerated Foods group delivered an outstanding quarter, with operating profit of 22% and sales up 26%. For the full year, segment profit was up 22% and sales increased by 11%. We continue to benefit from the unusually high pork operating margins in Q4, offsetting the margin squeeze on our value-added products due to higher raw material costs. 
Our Meat Products group posted large sales gains across much of their product portfolio, led by sales of Hormel Party Tray sales and Pepperoni and Natural Choice deli meats. Our Foodservice group also contributed to the strong top line picture, led by sales of Café H Mcmeats, Natural Choice deli meats and AUSTIN BLUES BBQ products. 
I continue to be pleased with the job our team has done with the integration of the Country Crock line of side dishes. This acquisition has contributed nicely to our results.
Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment completed a very strong year with an excellent quarter, with segment profits growing 90%, and sales up 19% for the quarter. For the full year, segment profit was up 65% and sales increased 7%. Results of Jennie-O were driven by efficiencies throughout the supply chain and in their operations. Jennie-O also benefited from higher commodity turkey meat prices and lower feed costs. Included in the large Q4 segment profit increase was a much larger than usual hedging gain, amounting to an incremental $7.3 million, about which Jody will provide more explanation.
You will recall we chose to roll out an enhanced advertising campaign for the Jennie-O brand during the second quarter half of 2010. We believe the campaign contributed to the double-digit sales growth throughout our value-added businesses at Jennie-O Turkey Store, led by retail turkey burgers and tray pack products.
The Specialty Foods unit reported a segment profit decline of 6% on a sales increase of 12% for the quarter. Improved sales of sugar, sugar substitutes, nutritional jars and dysphasia products were unable to offset higher raw material costs impacting our Specialty Products business. Notwithstanding the off quarter from a segment profit standpoint, for the full year segment profit for Specialty Foods is up 18%, and sales grew 10%, contributing nicely to our overall company success in 2010. 
In our All Other segment, which consists primarily of our Hormel Foods International business, Q4 segment profit was down 3%, and sales were up 33%. Higher sales of our SPAM family of products were unable to offset higher raw material costs, impacting export product margins. For the full year, segment profit was down 5% and sales were up 13%.
Looking at fiscal 2011, we should continue to benefit from the solid top line momentum shown in the past three quarters. For example, strong sales of our Hormel Party Trays and Hormel Pepperoni items and our Refrigerated Foods segment will grow our presence in the home occasion and snack categories. We have many other growth platforms that we believe will help drive our results in fiscal 2011. All told, we expect to achieve sales gains in all five segments in fiscal 2011.
We also expect to generate segment profit gains in all five segments in fiscal 2011, though our current expectation is that both Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store may see much more modest segment profit growth in 2011 after such substantial gains in 2010. We will start fiscal 2011 with the continued benefit of historically high pork operating margins in our Refrigerated Foods segment, but we do not presently expect these historically high margins to continue.  On the other hand, we believe that our initiatives with Mexican food and the addition of Don Miguel will help drive strong results in our Grocery Products segment in 2011.
Headwinds to our outlook for 2011 include continued higher raw material cost, significantly higher grain costs and the absence late in the year of both the extra 53rd week and the hedge gain at Jennie-O Turkey Store. In reaction to the higher raw material costs, we are embarking upon a program of strategic and modest price increases with a number of our products. After taking into account all of these significant factors, we are setting our fiscal 2011 earnings guidance range at $3.10 to $3.20 per share. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2010."

Earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 totaled $121.1 million or $0.90 per share compared to $103.9 million or $0.77 per share a year ago. U.S. GAAP earnings for the 12 months of fiscal 2010 totaled $395.6",665,"Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 totaled $121.1 million or $0.90 per share compared to $103.9 million or $0.77 per share a year ago. U.S. GAAP earnings for the 12 months of fiscal 2010 totaled $395.6 million or $2.92 per share compared to $342.8 million or $2.53 per share a year ago. 
Adjusted earnings for the full year totaled $409 million or $3.02 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude one-time charges in the second quarter relating to the closure of the VALLEY FRESH plant and the tax charges primarily related to the new healthcare laws. 
Dollar sales for the fourth quarter totaled $2.1 billion compared to $1.7 billion last year, a 23% increase. For the full year, dollar sales were $7.2 billion, an 11% increase from last year. Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.3 billion pounds up 14% from fiscal 2009. Year-to-date, volume was 4.8 billion pounds, up 5% from fiscal 2009.
As Jeff mentioned earlier, we reported an incremental gain of $7.3 million in our Jennie-O segment relating to our open hedge position. We enter into futures contracts and swaps to hedge our grain cost. As required by hedge accounting rules, we've periodically measured the effectiveness of these instruments. The effective gains and losses are deferred, but the ineffective portion becomes a current gain or loss. The recent rapid increase in corn and soybean prices caused the ineffective gain to be much larger than we've typically experienced.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were 8.1% of sales compared to 8.5% last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 8.4% of sales compared to 8.7% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8.5% of sales for next year. 
Interest and investment income was $2.4 million for the fourth quarter compared to $2.2 million last year. Year-to-date, interest and investment income was $4.6 million compared to $19.6 million last year when favorable market returns on our rabbi trust investments drove our investment income higher. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $7 million compared to $6.7 million last year. Year-to-date, interest expense was $26.6 million, down from $28 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $20 million to $23 million for fiscal 2011. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 34.8% versus 34% in fiscal 2009. The year-to-date effective tax rate is 36% compared to 34.5% last year. For fiscal 2011, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 35% and 36%.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year was 133 million shares. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year was 135 million shares. We repurchased 370,000 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter, and we have 4.4 million shares remaining to be purchased from the 5 million share authorization in place. 
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33.5 million compared to $33.1 million last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization was $126 million compared to $127 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $125 million in fiscal 2011. Our $350 million bond due in June of 2011 is classified as a current obligation, so we carried no long-term debt at the end of the quarter. 
During the quarter, we made a $50.2 million contribution to our pension plan for a total of $70.3 million for the year. We invested $76 million in our MegaMex joint venture in the fourth quarter to facilitate the Don Miguel acquisition. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $26 million flat with last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $90 million compared with $97 million last year. For fiscal 2011, we expect CapEx to be approximately $120 million to $130 million.

We're expecting a gradual improvement in that picture for them and then their momentum in these value-added items can drive the day for them. In terms of China, our China focuses primarily in-country with our two facilities, and we're really not seeing any impact on the business in there."

We are pleased to report another excellent quarter. Earnings per share for Q4 increased to $0.90, up a solid 17% from a year ago. For the full year, our U.S. GAAP earnings per share were $2.92, up 15% from last year. We did benefit",1071,"Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another excellent quarter. Earnings per share for Q4 increased to $0.90, up a solid 17% from a year ago. For the full year, our U.S. GAAP earnings per share were $2.92, up 15% from last year. We did benefit from having 14 weeks in the quarter compared to 13 weeks a year ago. 
Our goal for fiscal 2010, coming off a very strong earnings year but on declining sales, was to restore our top line growth. Our sales momentum from the previous two quarters accelerated in the fourth quarter. Total company sales for the quarter were $2.1 billion, up a substantial 23% from a year ago. As a result, we exceeded the $7 billion level in sales for the first time in our company's history, and all five segments contributed to the sales gain. 
I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products group reported a segment profit decrease of 6% and a sales gain of 24% for the fourth quarter. For the year, segment operating profit was down 4%, and sales were up 13%. Segment profit during the quarter and for the year was adversely impacted by higher raw material cost and the Q2 charge related to the VALLEY FRESH plant closing. Notwithstanding this profit decrease, we were pleased to see the solid sales results delivered by the Grocery Products unit and our consumer products sales organization. Sales were driven higher by Hormel Chili and hash, Compleats microwave meals and strong sales growth across much of our MegaMex Foods product portfolio. 
Last quarter, I said I would provide more clarity around the impact of MegaMex Foods on the Grocery Products operating margins. Our operating margins for the year was 15%. Without MegaMex Foods sales, it would have been 18%. The absence of CARAPELLI sales also improved operating margins for Grocery Products. Going forward, because Don Miguel sales initially will not be reflected in our segment top line results, the profits on those sales should improve the reported operating margin for Grocery Products.
Our Refrigerated Foods group delivered an outstanding quarter with operating profit of 22% and sales up 26%. For the full year, segment profit was up 22% and sales increased by 11%. We continue to benefit from the unusually high pork operating margins in Q4, offsetting the margin squeeze on our value-added products due to higher raw material costs. 
Our Meat Products group posted large sales gains across much of their product portfolio, led by sales of Hormel Party Tray and Pepperoni and Natural Choice deli meats. Our Foodservice group also contributed to the strong top line picture, led by sales of Café H ethnic meats, Natural Choice deli meats and AUSTIN BLUES BBQ products. I continue to be pleased with the job our team has done with the integration of the Country Crock line of side dishes. This acquisition has contributed nicely to our results.
Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment completed a very strong year with an excellent quarter, with segment profits growing 90% and sales up 19% for the quarter. For the full year, segment profit was up 65% and sales increased 7%. Results of Jennie-O were driven by efficiencies throughout their supply chain and in their operations. Jennie-O also benefited from higher commodity turkey meat prices and lower feed costs. Included in the large Q4 segment profit increase was a much larger than usual hedging gain, amounting to an incremental $7.3 million, about which Jody will provide more explanation.
You will recall we chose to roll out an enhanced advertising campaign for the Jennie-O brand during the second quarter half of 2010. We believe the campaign contributed to the double-digit sales growth throughout our value-added businesses at Jennie-O Turkey Store, led by retail turkey burgers and tray pack products.
The Specialty Foods unit reported a segment profit decline of 6% on a sales increase of 12% for the quarter. Improved sales of sugar, sugar substitutes, nutritional jars and dysphasia products were unable to offset higher raw material costs impacting our Specialty Products business. Notwithstanding the off quarter from a segment profit standpoint, for the full year segment profit for Specialty Foods is up 18% and sales grew 10%, contributing nicely to our overall company success in 2010. 
In our All Other segment, which consists primarily of our Hormel Foods International business, Q4 segment profit was down 3%, and sales were up 33%. Higher sales of our SPAM family of products were unable to offset higher raw material costs, impacting export product margins. For the full year, segment profit was down 5% and sales were up 13%.
Looking at fiscal 2011, we should continue to benefit from the solid top line momentum shown in the past three quarters. For example, strong sales of our Hormel Party Trays and Hormel Pepperoni items and our Refrigerated Foods segment will grow our presence in the home occasion and snack categories. We have many other growth platforms that we believe will help drive our results in fiscal 2011. All told, we expect to achieve sales gains in all five segments in fiscal 2011.
We also expect to generate segment profit gains in all five segments in fiscal 2011, though our current expectation is that both Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store may see much more modest segment profit growth in 2011 after such substantial gains in 2010. We will start fiscal 2011 with the continued benefit of historically high pork operating margins in our Refrigerated Foods segment, but we do not presently expect these historically high margins to continue. On the other hand, we believe that our initiatives with Mexican food and the addition of Don Miguel will help drive strong results in our Grocery Products segment in 2011.
Headwinds to our outlook for 2011 include continued higher raw material cost, significantly higher grain costs and the absence late in the year of both the extra 53rd week and the hedge gain at Jennie-O Turkey Store. In reaction to the higher raw material costs, we are embarking upon a program of strategic and modest price increases with a number of our products. After taking into account all of these significant factors, we are setting our fiscal 2011 earnings guidance range at $3.10 to $3.20 per share. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2010."

Earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 totaled $121.1 million or $0.90 per share compared to $103.9 million or $0.77 per share a year ago. U.S. GAAP earnings for the 12 months of fiscal 2010 totaled $395.6",663,"Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 totaled $121.1 million or $0.90 per share compared to $103.9 million or $0.77 per share a year ago. U.S. GAAP earnings for the 12 months of fiscal 2010 totaled $395.6 million or $2.92 per share compared to $342.8 million or $2.53 per share a year ago. 
Adjusted earnings for the full year totaled $409 million or $3.02 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude onetime charges in the second quarter relating to the closure of the VALLEY FRESH plant and the tax charges primarily related to the new healthcare laws. 
Dollar sales for the fourth quarter totaled $2.1 billion compared to $1.7 billion last year, a 23% increase. For the full year, dollar sales were $7.2 billion, an 11% increase from last year. Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.3 billion pounds up 14% from fiscal 2009. Year-to-date, volume was 4.8 billion pounds, up 5% from fiscal 2009.
As Jeff mentioned earlier, we reported an incremental gain of $7.3 million in our Jennie-O segment relating to our open hedge position. We enter into futures contracts and swaps to hedge our grain cost. As required by hedge accounting rules, we've periodically measured the effectiveness of these instruments. The effective gains and losses are deferred, but the ineffective portion becomes a current gain or loss. The recent rapid increase in corn and soybean prices caused the ineffective gain to be much larger than we've typically experienced.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were 8.1% of sales compared to 8.5% last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 8.4% of sales compared to 8.7% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8.5% of sales for next year. 
Interest and investment income was $2.4 million for the fourth quarter compared to $2.2 million last year. Year-to-date, interest and investment income was $4.6 million compared to $19.6 million last year when favorable market returns on our rabbi trust investments drove our investment income higher. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $7 million compared to $6.7 million last year. Year-to-date, interest expense was $26.6 million, down from $28 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $20 million to $23 million for fiscal 2011. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 34.8% versus 34% in fiscal 2009. The year-to-date effective tax rate is 36% compared to 34.5% last year. For fiscal 2011, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 35% and 36%.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year was 133 million shares. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year was 135 million shares. We repurchased 370,000 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter, and we have 4.4 million shares remaining to be purchased from the 5 million share authorization in place. 
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33.5 million compared to $33.1 million last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization was $126 million compared to $127 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $125 million in fiscal 2011. Our $350 million bond due in June of 2011 is classified as a current obligation, so we carried no long-term debt at the end of the quarter. 
During the quarter, we made a $50.2 million contribution to our pension plan for a total of $70.3 million for the year. We invested $76 million in our MegaMex joint venture in the fourth quarter to facilitate the Don Miguel acquisition. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $26 million flat with last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $90 million compared with $97 million last year. For fiscal 2011, we expect CapEx to be approximately $120 million to $130 million.

So it's a significant investment for us and piece of our portfolio. As I tried to articulate it earlier in the comments, I mean you're not going to see all those sales roll through Grocery Products sales because the Don Miguel portion is not going to be going through at least in the first year and we'll have to talk with a partner over time as to what's the best way is to manage that aspect of the business. That's in part to allow us to get our hands around Don Miguel. And in part it's in recognition of the fact that nearly half of Don Miguel sales are in the C-store channel, and that's not been our typical forte of our consumer products sales organization. And so we may have a hybrid approach or we may have to bolster our skills within CPS for recovering C-stores. But that's something we'll chat with the current Don Miguel management and with our partner going forward."

Our emphasis is in part on continuing to build the brand. We've had a steady effort against the Hormel brand over the last two to three years, and we'll continue that into 2011. We had an extra strong effort against the Jennie-O Turkey Store brand in the second half of 2010 and we're going to take on the wait-and-see approach as to the level of advertising we go after the Jennie-O brand within 2011. But our initial read on that advertising was we saw some very nice sales increases. Otherwise, continuing to be innovative with the products is important, and that ranges from brand-new products such as Kids Compleats or new versions of party trays to just kind of simple innovations even with an existing franchises like on our Hormel Chili franchise. Simple things like putting easy-open ends on it and reducing the sodium level of the core product.

We are pleased to report another excellent quarter.  Earnings per share for Q4 increased to $0.90, up a solid 17% from a year ago.  For the full year, our U.S. GAAP earnings per share were $2.92, up 15% from last year.  We did bene",1070,"Good morning everyone.  We are pleased to report another excellent quarter.  Earnings per share for Q4 increased to $0.90, up a solid 17% from a year ago.  For the full year, our U.S. GAAP earnings per share were $2.92, up 15% from last year.  We did benefit from having 14 weeks in the quarter compared to 13 weeks a year ago.
Our goal for fiscal 2010 coming off a very strong earnings year but on declining sales was to restore our top line growth.  Our sales momentum from the previous two quarter accelerated in the fourth quarter.  Total Company sales for the quarter were $2.1 billion, up a substantial 23% from a year ago.  As a result, we exceeded the $7 billion level in sales for the first time in our Company’s history, and all five segments contributed to the sales gain.  
I will now take you through each segment.  Our grocery products groups reported a segment profit decrease of 6% and a sales gain of 24% for the fourth quarter.  For the year, segment operating profit was down 4% and sales were up 13%.  Segment profit during the quarter and for the year was adversely impacted by higher raw material costs and the Q2 charge related to the Valley Fresh plant closing.  Notwithstanding this profit decrease, we were pleased to see the solid sales results delivered by the grocery products unit and our consumer product sales organization.  Sales were driven higher by Hormel Chili and Hash, Compleats microwave meals, and strong sales growth across much of our MegaMex foods product portfolio.
Last quarter I said I would provide more clarity around the impact of MegaMex food on the grocery products operating margins.  Our operating margins for the year was 15%.  Without MegaMex food sales, it would have been 18%.  The absence of Carapelli sales also improved operating margins for grocery products.  Going forward, because Don Miguel sales initially will not be reflected in our segment top line results, the profits on those sales should improve the reported operating margin for grocery products.
Our refrigerated foods group delivered an outstanding quarter with operating profit up 22% and sales up 26%.  For the full year, segment profit was up 22% and sales increased by 11%.  We continued to benefit from the unusually high pork operating margins in Q4, offsetting the margin squeeze on our value-added products due to higher raw material costs.
Our meat products group posted large sales gains across much of their product portfolio, led by sales of Hormel party trays and pepperoni, and Natural Choice deli meats.  Our food service group also contributed to the strong top line picture led by sales of Café H ethnic meats, Natural Choice deli meats, and Austin Blues barbecue products.  
I continue to be pleased with the job our team has done with the integration of the Country Crock line of side dishes.  This acquisition has contributed nicely to our results.
Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment completed a very strong year with an excellent quarter with segment profits growing 90% and sales up 19% for the quarter.  For the full year, segment profit was up 65% and sales increased 7%.  Results at Jennie-O were driven by efficiency throughout the supply chain and in their operations.  Jennie-O also benefited from higher commodity turkey meat prices and lower feed costs.
Included in the large Q4 segment profit increase was a much larger than usual hedging gain amounting to an incremental $7.3 million, about which Jody will provide more explanation.
You will recall we chose to roll out an enhanced advertising campaign for the Jennie-O brand during the second half of 2010.  We believe the campaign contributed to the double digit sales growth throughout our value-added businesses at Jennie-O Turkey Store, led by retail turkey burgers and tray packed products.  
The specialty foods unit reported a segment profit decline of 6% on a sales increase of 12% for the quarter.  Improved sales of sugar, sugar substitutes, nutritional jars and dysphagia products were unable to offset higher raw material costs impacting our specialty products business.  Notwithstanding the off quarter from a segment profit standpoint, for the full year segment profit for specialty foods was up 18% and sales grew 10%, contributing nicely to our overall Company success in 2010.
In our all-other segment, which consists primarily of our Hormel Foods International business, Q4 segment profit was down 3% and sales were up 33%.  Higher sales of our Spam family of products were unable to offset higher raw material costs impacting export product margins.  For the full year, segment profit was down 5% and sales were up 13%.  
Looking at fiscal 2011, we should continue to benefit from the solid top line momentum shown in the past three quarters.  For example, strong sales of our Hormel party trays and Hormel pepperoni items in our refrigerated food segment will grow our presence in the home occasion and snack categories.  We have many other growth platforms that we believe will help drive our results in fiscal 2011.  All told, we expect to achieve sales gains in all five segments in fiscal 2011.
We also expect to generate segment profit gains in all five segments in fiscal 2011, though our current expectation is that both refrigerated foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store may see much more modest segment profit growth in 2011 after such substantial gains in 2010.  We will start fiscal 2011 with the continued benefit of historically high pork operating margins in our refrigerated food segment, but we do not presently expect these historically high margins to continue.  On the other hand, we believe that our initiatives with Mexican foods and the addition of Don Miguel will help drive strong results in our grocery product segment in 2011.  
Headwinds to our outlook for 2011 include continued higher raw material costs, significantly higher grain costs, and the absence late in the year of both the extra 53rd week and the hedge gain at Jennie-O Turkey Store.  In reaction to the higher raw material costs, we are embarking upon a program of strategic and modest price increases with a number of our products.  After taking into account all of these significant factors, we are setting our fiscal 2011 earnings guidance range at $3.10 to $3.20 per share.  
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2010.

U.S. GAAP earnings for the 12 months of fiscal 2010 totaled $39",631,"Thank you, Jeff.  Good morning everyone.  Earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 totaled $121.1 million or $0.90 per share compared to $103.9 million or $0.77 per share a year ago.  U.S. GAAP earnings for the 12 months of fiscal 2010 totaled $395.6 million or $2.92 per share, compared to 342.8 million or $2.53 per share a year ago.  Adjusted earnings for the full year totaled $409 million or $3.02 per share.  Adjusted earnings exclude one-time charges in the second quarter relating to the closure of the Valley Fresh plant and the tax charges primarily related to the new healthcare laws.
Dollar sales for the fourth quarter totaled 2.1 billion compared to $1.7 billion last year, a 23% increase.  For the full year, dollar sales were 7.2 billion, an 11% increase from last year.  Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, up 14% from fiscal 2009.  Year-to-date volume was 4.8 billion pounds, up 5% from fiscal 2009.
As Jeff mentioned earlier, we reported an incremental gain of $7.3 million in our Jennie-O segment relating to our open hedge positions.  We enter into futures contracts and swaps to hedge our grain costs.  As required by hedge accounting rules, we periodically measure the effectiveness of these instruments.  The effect gains and losses are deferred, but the ineffective portion becomes a current gain or loss.  The recent rapid increase in corn and soybean prices caused the ineffective gain to be much larger than we’ve typically experienced.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were 8.1% of sales compared to 8.5% last year.  Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 8.4% of sales compared to 8.7% last year.  We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8.5% of sales for next year.
Interest and investment income was 2.4 million for the fourth quarter compared to $2.2 million last year.  Year-to-date, interest and investment income was $4.6 million compared to 19.6 million last year when favorable market returns on our Rabbi Trust investment drove our investment income higher.
Interest expense for the quarter was $7 million compared to $6.7 million last year.  Year-to-date, interest expense was $26.6 million, down from $28 million last year.  We expect interest expense to be approximately 20 to 23 million for fiscal 2011.
Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 34.8% versus 34% in fiscal 2009.  The year-to-date effective tax rate is 36% compared to 34.5% last year.  For fiscal 2011, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 35 and 36%.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year was 133 million shares.  The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year was 135 million shares.  We repurchased 370,000 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter and we have 4.4 million shares remaining to be purchased from the 5 million share authorization in place.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33.5 million compared to $33.1 million last year.  For the full year, depreciation and amortization was $126 million compared to $127 million last year.  We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $125 million in fiscal 2011.
Our $350 million bond due in June of 2011 is classified as a current obligation, so we carried no long-term debt at the end of the quarter.
During the quarter, we made a $50.2 million contribution to our pension plan for a total of $70.3 million for the year.  We invested $76 million in our MegaMex joint venture in the fourth quarter to facilitate the Don Miguel acquisition.  
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $26 million, flat with last year.  For the full year, capital expenditures total $90 million compared with $97 million last year.  For fiscal 2011, we expect CAPEX to be approximately 120 to $130 million.
At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question and answer portion of the call.  Operator?

In the long run, again, it’s just all gets back to when we try to figure out what the likely input costs are going to be and then turn loose our food service and meat products groups to sell value-added products against that cost environment.

To your second question, without a doubt there is a difference from brand to brand as to how much of our business is in a reported channel versus non-reported channels.  I don’t want to get too specific with it but you did happen to bring up—both the examples you brought up have higher than normal sales in the unreported channels.

But that’s just something they need to do in terms of managing their customer relationships and consumer reaction to that.  
In terms of the commodity markets, I mean clearly they are quite high right now.

I think we’re looking at a fairly typical gain from specialty foods based on our long-term guidance, so it’s normally 10% but they’re short a week and that’s roughly 2%, so high single digits for them.  Our expectations for international are solid double-digit growth and they had a very strong set of years for about four or five years in a row and then the last couple years have not been as strong; and so we’re expecting them to get back on track and be able to generate that.  And then grocery, we’re expecting a good year out of grocery.  We think they have decent solid momentum in their core portfolio anyways, and then you add to that the Kids Compleat, you add to that the momentum we have in MegaMex, you add our portion of the Don Miguel earnings.  And then on top of that we do expect to benefit from the move of the Valley Fresh canned chicken production into our Dubuque facility.  That was a part of the write-down we took in the second quarter but we are now producing.  We just started that at the end of the fourth quarter and that will improve our cost picture for our chunk chicken line.  So all of those things put together should mean the grocery products should be able to have a very strong year in 2011.

We had an extra-strong effort against the Jennie-O Turkey Store brand in the second half of 2010, and we’re going to kind of take a little more of a wait and see approach as to the level of advertising we go after the Jennie-O brand with in 2011; but our initial read on that advertising was we saw some very nice sales increases.  Otherwise, continuing to be innovative with the products is important and that ranges from brand-new products such as Kids Compleats or new versions of party trays to just kind of simple innovations even within existing franchises like our Hormel Chili franchise, simple things like putting easy-open ends on it and reducing the sodium level of the core product.  We had a very strong year with Hormel Chili last year just even with simple innovations like that.

We are pleased to report another excellent quarter. Earnings per share for Q4 increased to $0.90, up a solid 17% from a year ago. For the full year, our U.S. GAAP earnings per share were $2.92, up 15% from last year. We did benefit",1070,"Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another excellent quarter. Earnings per share for Q4 increased to $0.90, up a solid 17% from a year ago. For the full year, our U.S. GAAP earnings per share were $2.92, up 15% from last year. We did benefit from having 14 weeks in the quarter compared to 13 weeks a year ago. 
Our goal for fiscal 2010, coming off a very strong earnings year but on declining sales, was to restore our top line growth. Our sales momentum from the previous two quarters accelerated in the fourth quarter. Total company sales for the quarter were $2.1 billion, up a substantial 23% from a year ago. As a result, we exceeded the $7 billion level in sales for the first time in our company's history, and all five segments contributed to the sales gain. 
I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products group reported a segment profit decrease of 6% and a sales gain of 24% for the fourth quarter. For the year, segment operating profit was down 4% and sales were up 13%. Segment profit during the quarter and for the year was adversely impacted by higher raw material costs and the Q2 charge related to the VALLEY FRESH plant closing. Notwithstanding this profit decrease, we were pleased to see the solid sales results delivered by the Grocery Products unit and our consumer products sales organization. Sales were driven higher by Hormel Chili and hash, Compleats microwave meals and strong sales growth across much of our MegaMex Foods product portfolio. 
Last quarter, I said I would provide more clarity around the impact of MegaMex Foods on the Grocery Products operating margins. Our operating margins for the year was 15%. Without MegaMex Foods sales, it would have been 18%. The absence of CARAPELLI sales also improved operating margins for Grocery Products. Going forward, because Don Miguel sales initially will not be reflected in our segment top line results, the profits on those sales should improve the reported operating margin for Grocery Products.
Our Refrigerated Foods group delivered an outstanding quarter with operating profit up 22% and sales up 26%. For the full year, segment profit was up 22% and sales increased by 11%. We continue to benefit from the unusually high pork operating margins in Q4, offsetting the margin squeeze on our value-added products due to higher raw material costs. 
Our Meat Products group posted large sales gains across much of their product portfolio, led by sales of Hormel Party Trays and pepperoni and Natural Choice deli meats. Our Foodservice group also contributed to the strong top line picture, led by sales of Café H ethnic meats, Natural Choice deli meats and AUSTIN BLUES BBQ products. I continue to be pleased with the job our team has done with the integration of the Country Crock line of side dishes. This acquisition has contributed nicely to our results.
Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment completed a very strong year with an excellent quarter, with segment profits growing 90% and sales up 19% for the quarter. For the full year, segment profit was up 65% and sales increased 7%. Results of Jennie-O were driven by efficiencies throughout their supply chain and in their operations. Jennie-O also benefited from higher commodity turkey meat prices and lower feed costs. Included in the large Q4 segment profit increase was a much larger than usual hedging gain, amounting to an incremental $7.3 million, about which Jody will provide more explanation.
You will recall we chose to roll out an enhanced advertising campaign for the Jennie-O brand during the second half of 2010. We believe the campaign contributed to the double-digit sales growth throughout our value-added businesses at Jennie-O Turkey Store, led by retail turkey burgers and tray pack products.
The Specialty Foods unit reported a segment profit decline of 6% on a sales increase of 12% for the quarter. Improved sales of sugar, sugar substitutes, nutritional jars and dysphasia products were unable to offset higher raw material costs impacting our Specialty Products business. Notwithstanding the off quarter from a segment profit standpoint, for the full year, segment profit for Specialty Foods was up 18% and sales grew 10%, contributing nicely to our overall company success in 2010. 
In our All Other segment, which consists primarily of our Hormel Foods International business, Q4 segment profit was down 3% and sales were up 33%. Higher sales of our SPAM family of products were unable to offset higher raw material costs, impacting export product margins. For the full year, segment profit was down 5% and sales were up 13%.
Looking at fiscal 2011, we should continue to benefit from the solid top line momentum shown in the past three quarters. For example, strong sales of our Hormel Party Trays and Hormel pepperoni items in our Refrigerated Foods segment will grow our presence in the Home Occasion and Snack categories. We have many other growth platforms that we believe will help drive our results in fiscal 2011. All told, we expect to achieve sales gains in all five segments in fiscal 2011.
We also expect to generate segment profit gains in all five segments in fiscal 2011, though our current expectation is that both Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store may see much more modest segment profit growth in 2011 after such substantial gains in 2010. We will start fiscal 2011 with the continued benefit of historically high pork operating margins in our Refrigerated Foods segment, but we do not presently expect these historically high margins to continue. On the other hand, we believe that our initiatives with Mexican Foods and the addition of Don Miguel will help drive strong results in our Grocery Products segment in 2011.
Headwinds to our outlook for 2011 include continued higher raw material cost, significantly higher grain costs and the absence late in the year of both the extra 53rd week and the hedge gain at Jennie-O Turkey Store. In reaction to the higher raw material costs, we are embarking upon a program of strategic and modest price increases with a number of our products. After taking into account all of these significant factors, we are setting our fiscal 2011 earnings guidance range at $3.10 to $3.20 per share. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2010."

As Jeff mentioned earlier, we reported an incremental gain of $7.3 million in our Jennie-O segment relating to our open hedge position. We enter into futures contracts and swaps to hedge our grain costs. As required by hedge accounting rules, we've periodically measured the effectiveness of these instruments. The effective gains and losses are deferred, but the ineffective portion becomes a current gain or loss. The recent rapid increase in corn and soybean prices caused the ineffective gain to be much larger than we've typically experienced.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were 8.1% of sales compared to 8.5% last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 8.4% of sales compared to 8.7% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8.5% of sales for next year. 
Interest and investment income was $2.4 million for the fourth quarter compared to $2.2 million last year. Year-to-date, interest and investment income was $4.6 million compared to $19.6 million last year when favorable market returns on our rabbi trust investment drove our investment income higher. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $7 million compared to $6.7 million last year. Year-to-date, interest expense was $26.6 million, down from $28 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $20 million to $23 million for fiscal 2011. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 34.8% versus 34% in fiscal 2009. The year-to-date effective tax rate is 36% compared to 34.5% last year. For fiscal 2011, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 35% and 36%.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year was 133 million shares. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year was 135 million shares. We repurchased 370,000 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter, and we have 4.4 million shares remaining to be purchased from the 5 million share authorization in place. 
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33.5 million compared to $33.1 million last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization was $126 million compared to $127 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $125 million in fiscal 2011. Our $350 million bond due in June of 2011 is classified as a current obligation, so we carried no long-term debt at the end of the quarter. 
During the quarter, we made a $50.2 million contribution to our pension plan for a total of $70.3 million for the year. We invested $76 million in our MegaMex joint venture in the fourth quarter to facilitate the Don Miguel acquisition. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $26 million, flat with last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $90 million compared with $97 million last year. For fiscal 2011, we expect CapEx to be approximately $120 million to $130 million.

Our expectations for international are solid double-digit growth and that they had a very strong set of years for about four or five years in a row and then the last couple years have not been as strong. And so we're expecting them to get back on track and be able to generate that. And then Grocery, we're expecting a good year out of Grocery. We think they have decent solid momentum in their core portfolio anyways. And then you add to that the Kid's Compleats, you add to the momentum we have in MegaMex, you add our portion of the Don Miguel earnings. And then on top of that, we do expect to benefit from the move of the VALLEY FRESH canned chicken production into our Dubuque facility. That was part of the write-down we took in the second quarter but we are now producing. We just started that at the end of the fourth quarter and that will improve our cost picture for our chunk chicken line.

Otherwise, continuing to be innovative with the products is important, and that ranges from brand-new products such as Kid's Compleats or new versions of party trays to just kind of simple innovations even within existing franchises.

The line will be then open for questions following Jody's remarks. An audio replay of this call will be available beginning at 10:30 a.m. Central Time today, May 19, 2010.

We are pleased to report strong earnings and sales for the second quarter. Our Q2 earnings of $0.67 per share, excluding the one-time charges of $0.10 per share associated with the plant closing and the healthcare laws represent a 14% increase over our results of a year ago. Total dollar sales were also up 7% over a year ago. 
This quarter once again demonstrates the benefit of our balanced business model as the strong performance of our Jennie-O Turkey Store and Specialty Foods segments more than made up quarter results of our Grocery Products and All Other segments. I will now take you through each segment.
Our Grocery Products segment reported a dollar sales increase of 6% and a segment operating profit decrease of 2%, the latter after adjusting for the one-time charges associated with our VALLEY FRESH plant closing. Net of the new item sales of Mexican products under the MegaMex Foods venture and of the discontinued CARAPELLI Olive Oil sales, revenues for Grocery Products would've been flat for the quarter. 
Stronger sales of our Mexican products and our Hormel Chili and Hormel Mary Kitchen hash products were not able to completely offset the pressure on margins in our SPAM family of products and our Hormel Bacon Bits items, prompted by higher raw material costs. The increased sales of Hormel Chili and Hormel Mary Kitchen hash resulted from increased distribution and from our new Hormel brand advertising campaign. The campaign is designed to leverage our leading brand strength in numerous categories to promote cross purchase intent. We are pleased with the success of our MegaMex Foods venture so far, as sales of over $120 million through the first half are on pace to easily exceed the base level sales of $200 million on an annualized basis.
Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported operating profit of 7% aided by stronger cutout margins compared to a year ago. Sales were also up 7% for Refrigerated Foods. We enjoyed particularly strong sales of Hormel Party Trays and Hormel pepperoni helped in part by new products, in part by our Hormel brand advertising campaign and in part by the great efforts of our sales organization in generating meaningful in-store promotions. 
We are pleased with the progress in the integration of our recent Country Crock Side Dish business. Our team has done a good job stabilizing this business during the quarter. We can now provide complete meal solutions to consumers in the refrigerated section of the store, complementing our Hormel refrigerated entrées and Lloyd's Barbeque products.
We have begun to see signs of improvement in the Foodservice tray. Sales of our Natural Choice deli meats, AUSTIN BLUES BBQ products and Café H ethnic products all grew during the quarter.
Segment operating profit at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment increased by a noteworthy 93% with sales up 1%. Jenny-O's results came from improved efficiencies throughout the entire business. Export sales of dark turkey meat have given us an added boost as thigh meat pricing has remained very strong. Sales increased for Jennie-O in all three value-added areas: retail, deli and Foodservice, led by retail tray pack fresh turkey and rotisserie deli products. We continue to generate excellent exposure for the Jennie-O Turkey Store brand through our sponsorship of the Biggest Loser reality TV show.
Our Specialty Foods segment again posted improved segment operating profit and sales, up 39% and 13%, respectively, with contributions by all three subunits of Specialty Foods. The leading drivers of these improved results were sports nutrition products, private-label canned meat products and sugar substitutes. 
In our All Other International segment, segment operating profit declined 18%, while sales increased by 7%. We did generate excellent sales of our SPAM family of products, but this was not sufficient to offset reduced returns we experienced related to lower fresh pork exports.
In our February call, we mentioned that higher hog costs were on their way. These increased costs did indeed arrive and at a higher level than originally anticipated. We expect this trend to continue as we get into warmer weather. On the other hand, commodity turkey prices have firmed up as a result of industry production cuts, and grain prices appear to be in a fairly stable position. Taking these considerations into account, and in light of our strong results in Q2, we are again raising our full-year guidance range from $2.68 to $2.78 per share to $2.75 to $2.85 per share, excluding the one-time charges of $0.10 per share associated with the plant closing and healthcare laws.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen in Austin to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter."

Good morning, everyone. As we announced in our earnings release issued this morning, our second quarter results were impacted by the one-time charges related to the closure of our plant in Turlock, California and tax charges primarily related to the newly enacted healthcare laws. These one-time charges resulted in an adjustment to diluted net earnings of approximately $0.10 per share for the second quarter. A table reconciling our adjusted earning calculation to earnings calculated under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles was included in our earnings release as well.
For the second quarter of 2010, adjusted net earnings totaled $91.3 million or $0.67 per share compared to $80.4 million or $0.59 per share a year ago. Adjusted net earnings for the first half of fiscal 2010 totaled $202.5 million or $1.50 per share, compared to $161.8 million or $1.20 per share a year ago. On a GAAP basis, net earnings for the second quarter of 2010 totaled $77.9 million or $0.57 per share. GAAP net earnings for the first half of 2010 were $189.1 million or $1.40 per share. 
Dollar sales for the second quarter totaled $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year, a 7% increase. For the first half of the fiscal year, dollar sales increased 4% to $3.4 billion. Volume for the second quarter was 1.1 billion pounds, up 2% from fiscal 2009. Year-to-date, volume was 2.3 billion, also up 2% from fiscal 2009. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 8.6% of sales compared to 8.8% last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 8.5% compared to 8.6% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8.8% of sales for the remainder of the year.
Advertising expenses were 1.5% of sales for the quarter compared to 1.6% in 2009. Year-to-date, advertising expenses are 1.5% of sales, even with last year. We saw an absolute dollar increase in advertising expense in the second quarter and expect that advertising dollars will exceed 2009 expenditures on a full year basis. 
Interest and investment income was $1.4 million for the second quarter compared to $8.6 million in fiscal 2009. In the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a $3.6 million gain on the dissolution of the CARAPELLI joint venture. In addition, we experienced higher returns on our rabbi trust investments in 2009. We expect difficult comparisons in the back half of the year due to the strong performance of our rabbi trust investments in 2009. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $6.6 million compared to $6.9 million last year. Year-to-date, interest expense is $13.1 million compared to $14.4 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $27 million to $28 million for fiscal 2010.
Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 40.7% versus 35.3% in fiscal 2009. The increase in 2010 was driven by the one-time impact of recently enacted healthcare legislation and the reduction in the value of our deferred tax assets due to the change in the tax treatment of Medicare Part D reimbursement. Year-to-date effective tax rate is 36.8% compared to 34.9% last year. For fiscal 2010, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.
Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 134 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 136 million shares. We repurchased 330,000 shares of common stock during the second quarter and have 367,000 shares remaining to be repurchased from the 10 million share authorization in place. 
Total debt at the end of the quarter was $350 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31 million, even with last year. For the first half of the year, depreciation and amortization was $61 million compared to $62 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million to $127 million in fiscal 2010.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $22 million compared to $20 million last year. For the first six months of the year, capital expenditures totaled $40 million compared to $46 million last year. For fiscal 2010, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $105 million to $115 million.

We did feel the same impact in certain elements of the Refrigerated Foods portfolio, but they have the offset of the hog cutouts to dissipate that somewhat. Items that are pork-based items, particularly our SPAM luncheon meat or Hormel Bacon Bits did see early steep increases in the raw material costs during the quarter and that did compress the margins then to a lower level than what we had been generating in the prior quarter and even the prior same quarter of last year. In terms of sales, Grocery Products overall did generate positive sales for the quarter. As I mentioned, if you sort out the discontinued business, the CARAPELLI, and you put aside the new franchises that we joined to the company through the MegaMex venture, the net effect of those two would be to flatten out GP [Grocery Products] sales, so it was kind of a mixed bag again within their portfolio. Chili did well. Hash did well. The Mexican products did well.

I mean, if you look at kind of total sales for Hormel Foodservice for example, they were flat for the quarter. On the branded or more highly valued-added items, we saw some gains.

I guess we don't feel that -- we're not hearing from the Foodservice marketplace that the clouds have all parted and everything is excellent now. But if we do experience a shift where people start going out a little bit more often and businesses start attending a few more conferences, et cetera, we're certainly well-positioned to take advantage of that. We have Foodservice elements in four of our five operating segments, and they're all poised with good sales organizations and with good products hopefully to deliver against that audience. Within the grocery environment -- we’re not talking just Grocery Products, but grocery stores -- our impression has been that the recession has had mixed results. I mean we clearly saw some benefit to the traditional canned franchises, for a time there where almost all of those items were up. This quarter was more mixed in that regard, with Chili and Hash up and Dinty Moore and SPAM down. But we also did lose some momentum in our convenience items, both Compleats and our refrigerated entrées during last year. And so if consumers gain more confidence and the economy starts looking better, we do expect those franchises to improve."

The Diamond Crystal group has found ways to continue to grow their business even during the recession. They sell in many cases to a different group of Foodservice operators than the meat side of our business traditionally focuses upon. And then one other element that helped us this quarter was last year we had kind of a lag effect or a negative effect from the Century Foods operation as they had lost some significant business, and they've done a nice job of replacing that business and getting back to a more traditional margins for them. So all three components are working well right now, and our outlook for the second half would be for that to continue."

We are pleased to report strong earnings and sales for the second quarter. Our Q2 earnings of $0.67 per share, excluding the one-time charges of $0.10 per share associated with the plant closing and the healthcare laws represent a 14% increase over our results of a year ago. Total dollar sales were also up 7% over a year ago. 
This quarter once again demonstrates the benefit of our balanced business model as the strong performance of our Jennie-O Turkey Store and Specialty Foods segments more than made up quarter results of our Grocery Products and All Other segments. I will now take you through each segment.
Our Grocery Products segment reported a dollar sales increase of 6% and a segment operating profit decrease of 2%, the latter after adjusting for the one-time charges associated with our VALLEY FRESH plant closing. Net of the new item sales of Mexican products under the MegaMex Foods venture and of the discontinued CARAPELLI Olive Oil sales, revenues for Grocery Products would've been flat for the quarter. 
Stronger sales of our Mexican products and our Hormel Chili and Hormel Mary Kitchen hash products were not able to completely offset the pressure on margins in our SPAM family of products and our Hormel Bacon Bits items, prompted by higher raw material costs. The increased sales of Hormel Chili and Hormel Mary Kitchen hash resulted from increased distribution and from our new Hormel brand advertising campaign. The campaign is designed to leverage our leading brand strength in numerous categories to promote cross purchase intent. We are pleased with the success of our MegaMex Foods venture so far, as sales of over $120 million through the first half are on pace to easily exceed the base level sales of $200 million on an annualized basis.
Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported operating profit of 7% aided by stronger cutout margins compared to a year ago. Sales were also up 7% for Refrigerated Foods. We enjoyed particularly strong sales of Hormel Party Trays and Hormel pepperoni helped in part by new products, in part by our Hormel brand advertising campaign and in part by the great efforts of our sales organization in generating meaningful in-store promotions. 
We are pleased with the progress in the integration of our recent Country Crock Side Dish business. Our team has done a good job stabilizing this business during the quarter. We can now provide complete meal solutions to consumers in the refrigerated section of the store, complementing our Hormel refrigerated entrées and Lloyd's Barbeque products.
We have begun to see signs of improvement in the Foodservice tray. Sales of our Natural Choice deli meats, AUSTIN BLUES BBQ products and Café H ethnic products all grew during the quarter.
Segment operating profit at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment increased by a noteworthy 93% with sales up 1%. Jenny-O's results came from improved efficiencies throughout the entire business. Export sales of dark turkey meat have given us an added boost as thigh meat pricing has remained very strong. Sales increased for Jennie-O in all three value-added areas: retail, deli and Foodservice, led by retail tray pack fresh turkey and rotisserie deli products. We continue to generate excellent exposure for the Jennie-O Turkey Store brand through our sponsorship of the Biggest Loser reality TV show.
Our Specialty Foods segment again posted improved segment operating profit and sales, up 39% and 13%, respectively, with contributions by all three subunits of Specialty Foods. The leading drivers of these improved results were sports nutrition products, private-label canned meat products and sugar substitutes. 
In our All Other International segment, segment operating profit declined 18%, while sales increased by 7%. We did generate excellent sales of our SPAM family of products, but this was not sufficient to offset reduced returns we experienced related to lower fresh pork exports.
In our February call, we mentioned that higher hog costs were on their way. These increased costs did indeed arrive and at a higher level than originally anticipated. We expect this trend to continue as we get into warmer weather. On the other hand, commodity turkey prices have firmed up as a result of industry production cuts, and grain prices appear to be in a fairly stable position. Taking these considerations into account, and in light of our strong results in Q2, we are again raising our full-year guidance range from $2.68 to $2.78 per share to $2.75 to $2.85 per share, excluding the one-time charges of $0.10 per share associated with the plant closing and healthcare laws.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen in Austin to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter."

Good morning, everyone. As we announced in our earnings release issued this morning, our second quarter results were impacted by the one-time charges related to the closure of our plant in Turlock, California and tax charges primarily related to the newly enacted healthcare laws. These one-time charges resulted in an adjustment to diluted net earnings of approximately $0.10 per share for the second quarter. A table reconciling our adjusted earning calculation to earnings calculated under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles was included in our earnings release as well.
For the second quarter of 2010, adjusted net earnings totaled $91.3 million or $0.67 per share compared to $80.4 million or $0.59 per share a year ago. Adjusted net earnings for the first half of fiscal 2010 totaled $202.5 million or $1.50 per share, compared to $161.8 million or $1.20 per share a year ago. On a GAAP basis, net earnings for the second quarter of 2010 totaled $77.9 million or $0.57 per share. GAAP net earnings for the first half of 2010 were $189.1 million or $1.40 per share. 
Dollar sales for the second quarter totaled $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year, a 7% increase. For the first half of the fiscal year, dollar sales increased 4% to $3.4 billion. Volume for the second quarter was 1.1 billion pounds, up 2% from fiscal 2009. Year-to-date, volume was 2.3 billion, also up 2% from fiscal 2009. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 8.6% of sales compared to 8.8% last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 8.5% compared to 8.6% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8.8% of sales for the remainder of the year.
Advertising expenses were 1.5% of sales for the quarter compared to 1.6% in 2009. Year-to-date, advertising expenses are 1.5% of sales, even with last year. We saw an absolute dollar increase in advertising expense in the second quarter and expect that advertising dollars will exceed 2009 expenditures on a full year basis. 
Interest and investment income was $1.4 million for the second quarter compared to $8.6 million in fiscal 2009. In the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a $3.6 million gain on the dissolution of the CARAPELLI joint venture. In addition, we experienced higher returns on our rabbi trust investments in 2009. We expect difficult comparisons in the back half of the year due to the strong performance of our rabbi trust investments in 2009. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $6.6 million compared to $6.9 million last year. Year-to-date, interest expense is $13.1 million compared to $14.4 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $27 million to $28 million for fiscal 2010.
Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 40.7% versus 35.3% in fiscal 2009. The increase in 2010 was driven by the one-time impact of recently enacted healthcare legislation and the reduction in the value of our deferred tax assets due to the change in the tax treatment of Medicare Part D reimbursement. Year-to-date effective tax rate is 36.8% compared to 34.9% last year. For fiscal 2010, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.
Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 134 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 136 million shares. We repurchased 330,000 shares of common stock during the second quarter and have 367,000 shares remaining to be repurchased from the 10 million share authorization in place. 
Total debt at the end of the quarter was $350 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31 million, even with last year. For the first half of the year, depreciation and amortization was $61 million compared to $62 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million to $127 million in fiscal 2010.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $22 million compared to $20 million last year. For the first six months of the year, capital expenditures totaled $40 million compared to $46 million last year. For fiscal 2010, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $105 million to $115 million.

We did feel the same impact in certain elements of the Refrigerated Foods portfolio, but they have the offset of the hog cutouts to dissipate that somewhat. Items that are pork-based items, particularly our SPAM luncheon meat or Hormel Bacon Bits did see early steep increases in the raw material costs during the quarter and that did compress the margins then to a lower level than what we had been generating in the prior quarter and even the prior same quarter of last year. In terms of sales, Grocery Products overall did generate positive sales for the quarter. As I mentioned, if you sort out the discontinued business, the CARAPELLI, and you put aside the new franchises that we joined to the company through the MegaMex venture, the net effect of those two would be to flatten out GP [Grocery Products] sales, so it was kind of a mixed bag again within their portfolio. Chili did well. Hash did well. The Mexican products did well. Compleats was sort of back to even, which was just trending the direction we need it to trend, but we did see softer sales of some of the other canned items, which is SPAM and Dinty Moore this quarter, and the chunk meat items also were a little bit off."

But if we do experience a shift where people start going out a little bit more often and businesses start attending a few more conferences, et cetera, we're certainly well-positioned to take advantage of that. We have Foodservice elements in four of our five operating segments, and they're all poised with good sales organizations and with good products hopefully to deliver against that audience. Within the grocery environment -- we’re not talking just Grocery Products, but grocery stores -- our impression has been that the recession has had mixed results. I mean we clearly saw some benefit to the traditional canned franchises, for a time there where almost all of those items were up.

And then I think in your prepared comments, Jeff, you talked about very strong exports in the dark turkey export market, the dark parts market, which if you get some good pricing and some good demand in that derivative market, that's really going to help your profitability for Jennie-O. So can you give me a feel of what's going on in these export markets and really the protein markets that -- are these unusual events? Or are these sustainable? And what's driving those things?"

How long we expect that to continue, boy, it depends on the economic conditions in those countries, actually, that are going to drive the export as prices continue to stay firm.
