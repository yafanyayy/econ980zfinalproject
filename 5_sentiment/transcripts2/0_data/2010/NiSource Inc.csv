We have several important matters to address this morning after which, we'll open the call to your questions. In my prepared remarks, I'll be addressing Nisource's fourth quarter and full year 2009",2799,"Thanks, Glen. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We have several important matters to address this morning after which, we'll open the call to your questions. In my prepared remarks, I'll be addressing Nisource's fourth quarter and full year 2009 earnings. A number of highlights and key accomplishments across our businesses during 2009. And finally, our earnings outlook for 2010.Let's start with Nisource's 2009 financial results, which were solidly in line with our full year operating earnings outlook of $1 to $1.10 per share. I'd that year-over-year cash flows from operating activities increased by more than $1 billion. In short-term borrowings at year-end 2009, we're more than $1 billion lower than the year-end 2008. We'll touch more on our liquidity position in a few moments.Given the unprecedented dislocations in the financial markets and challenging economic environment across our markets by virtually any measure, Nisource not only weathered the storm during 2009, we emerged as a stronger and more robust company. For 2009, we achieved non-GAAP net operating earnings of approximately $295 million or $1.07 per share. Operating earnings for the year were approximately $880 million. For the fourth quarter, our net operating earnings again non-GAAP were approximately $99 million or $0.35 per share. I'd submit that our team's ability to deliver on our financial commitments in the face of the great recession underscores the resilience of our co-regulated businesses and is a testament to the team's disciplined execution.In addition to aggressive cost management across all our business units during 2009, we increased net revenues in both our Gas Distribution and Gas Transmission and Storage businesses. At Nisource Gas Distribution, net revenues excluding regulatory trackers increased about $70 million during 2009, primarily attributable to the team's extensive array of regulatory initiatives.In our Gas Transmission and Storage unit, the team delivered approximately $56 million in the increased net revenues, excluding regulatory trackers resulting from growth projects, short-term transportation and storage services and mineral right leasing.  As expected, these improvements were more than offset by three key items we discussed with you throughout the year; increased pension expense, reduced electric industrial demand and incremental interest expense. With respect to pension expense, we experienced an increase of $85 million of our 2008 levels. This increase is net of the impact of the deferral of about $11 million in pension expense by Columbia Gas of Ohio, which we've discussed in prior earnings updates.Although we saw a modest uptick in electric industrial demand in the fourth quarter, for the year, electric industrial demand was lower by 17% compared to 2008 levels. As for interest cost, they increased by about $24 million over it 2008 levels, primarily resulting from the pre-funding of debt maturities under our liquidity plans. So to wrap up, despite a tough economic climate across our markets, the Nisource team delivered a strong earnings performance in 2009, one that we'll build on as we move forward in 2010.Now let me turn to our liquidity and refinancing activities. Throughout 2009, we emphasized that maintaining adequate liquidity and successfully managing upcoming debt maturities were key priorities. We outlined an aggressive and comprehensive liquidity plan. And our business units and our finance teams did an outstanding job of executing that plan.Capital expenditure levels were recalibrated. Operating expenses and working capital were managed aggressively. And we successfully completed approximately $2 billion in debt refinancing with a caps on [ph] being our $500 million long-term debt issuance during the fourth quarter. As a result of those efforts, we've now addressed our long-term financing need through to 2011. And we enter 2010 with the significantly stronger liquidity profile. As shown on the supplemental slides, Nisource closed 2009 with excess liquidity of more than $1 billion and we expect to have excess liquidity of more than $500 million at year-end 2010.Plus, you'll recall that we have a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that extends to July 2011. All of these activities were essential elements of Nisource's commitment to maintaining our investment grade credit rating in a manner that also preserves shareholder value.And on that front, we are pleased when in December, Moody's acknowledged the significant progress the team has made over the course of the last few years by affirming Nisource's investment grade credit rating and raising its outlook to stable. Few weeks later, Fitch affirmed its rating of BBB- with a stable outlook. We now have stable investment grade ratings from each of the three rating agencies. And we're committed to maintaining and strengthening those ratings over time in a manner that also enhances shareholder value.Now let me turn to our business update and look at how the team is delivering our balanced strategy for delivering long-term sustainable growth. Our four-part strategy continues to center on the expansion and commercial growth in our Natural Gas Pipeline and Storage business, regulatory and commercial initiatives at our utilities and strong financial process and expense management across the corporation.First, let me turn to our Gas Distribution business where we continue to see strong results from our regulatory and infrastructure investment initiatives. During the fourth quarter, Bay State Gas Company received a favorable rate case order from the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities authorizing an increase in annual base revenues of approximately $19 million or 3.7%. Also approved was a revenue-decoupling mechanism, the first of its kind in Massachusetts, along with a tracking mechanisms to recover costs associated with Bay State's infrastructure replacement program.  Truly, a breakthrough effort by the Bay State team.Columbia Gas Kentucky also received approval from the Kentucky Public Service Commission of the unanimous rate case settlement during 2009. The settlement provided for an overall annual increase in revenues of approximately $6 million or 3.7%, while authorizing an increase to the monthly customer charge, the implementation of an accelerated main replacement program tracker and the introduction of a residential energy efficiency program. Also, Columbia Gas Virginia received approval from the State Corporation Commission for its Conservation and Ratemaking Efficiency or CARE Plan for three-year period through 2012. The CARE Plan which became effective last month establishes a decoupled-rate mechanism, along with customer energy conservation incentive.And late last week, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania sought a base rate increase request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. That following proposes new home energy efficiency programs and a more progressive rate design along with an increase in base rates of $32 million annually that reflects our ongoing infrastructure replacement program. The case also reflects a tracker proposal in the event enabling legislation is enacted. New rates in Pennsylvania are expected in the fourth quarter of 2010. And last, but certainly not least, as we indicated on prior calls, our Northern Indiana Utility, NIPSCO plans to file a natural gas rate case, the company's first since 1987 as early as March of this year with new rates anticipated in late 2010.From an earnings standpoint, our Gas Distribution businesses reported 2009 operating earnings of about $329 million, slightly above its $328 million in operating earnings for 2008. As I mentioned earlier, net revenues excluding the impact of regulatory and tax trackers increased about $70 million. Those gains include offsets from decreased customer usage and lower off-system sales revenue.Operating expenses excluding trackers were up about $69 million for the year reflecting higher employee and administrative costs, depreciation costs and uncollectible accounts. The higher employee and administrative costs were primarily due to increases in pension expense of almost $32 million net of the Columbia Gas of Ohio deferral, I mentioned earlier.Throughout 2009, our Gas Distribution teams continue to build on their excellent track record of execution. This ongoing progress is a testament to our commitment to building creative and collaborative regulatory solutions that benefit customers and ensure a safe and reliable distribution systems.Turning to our Gas Transmission and Storage business, the team is continuing to make significant progress in maximizing the value of our strategically-position pipeline and storage assets. With a particular focus on advancing projects that support the unprecedented supply growth taking place in the Marcellus Shale play in Appalachian.  The NGT&S team is working closely with key natural gas producers, processors and other industry players to develop the infrastructure needed to bring Marcellus supplies to market.By the close of the year, NGT&S was advancing more than $155 million of projects in the Marcellus Shale region, with the potential to provide an additional 700,000 decatherms per day of market access. And as we move forward in 2010, we'll be announcing additional expansion projects in the Marcellus area.One of our key Marcellus projects in 2009 was the Appalachian Expansion Project, which was place in to service in the second half of the year. The project leverage our existing infrastructure to provide about 100,000 decatherms per day of new transportation service to three key Appalachian producers. Another important Marcellus initiative launched by the NGT&S team in 2009 is the Majorsville project that's located in the Southwestern Pennsylvania, West Virginia Region, a Marcellus sweet spot.Over the next several years, this project will be providing gathering, processing and transmission services to several leading Marcellus producers anchoring the project. NGT&S is partnering with MarkWest Energy Partners, which is making significant investments to provide midstream services for those Marcellus producers.And yet another 2009 highlight was the allowed storage expansion project, which increased market area storage capacity by almost 7 billion cubic feet. Notably, NGT&S received FERC authorization for market-based rates for the project, the first time we've received such approval for our traditionally cost-based storage operations.With our strategic NGT&S footprint, our system capabilities and our disciplined investment strategies, Nisource is capitalizing on the unprecedented producer investment in the Marcellus region, as well as the addition of new Storage and Transportation business opportunities across our system.From an earnings standpoint, Gas Transmission and Storage reported operating earnings of $408.8 million in 2009 compared to $376.7 million in 2008. The increase resulted primarily from the $56 million in increased net revenues I mentioned earlier. Those revenues were primarily attributable to increases in firm capacity reservation fees, from growth projects and new Appalachian supply contracts, as well as increases in shorter-term transportation and storage services and mineral rights leasing revenues.Equity earnings were up $3.7 million attributable to increased earnings from Millennium Pipeline. Those increased earnings more than offset an $8.1 million reduction in equity earnings resulting from interest rate hedges related to Millennium's decision to delay permanent financing until 2010.Operating expenses increased by about $28 million, excluding trackers due to a higher capacity lease costs, employee and administrative costs, maintenance costs and environmental expenses. In addition, 2008 operating expenses were favorably impacted by the reduction of legal reserves.Now let's turn to our Electric Operations. As I noted earlier, our Northern Indiana Electric market has been under continuing pressure from the economic downturn. In face of those challenges, NIPSCO has nevertheless continued to make steady progress on its aggressive regulatory and business agenda. Notably, our operational efforts have been gaining traction. In particular, I'd note that NIPSCO's electric generation reliability metrics improved significantly during 2009. And for the year, we are above industry average levels.Regulatory wise, as you note throughout 2009, our NIPSCO teams continued to advance the company's 2008 electric rate case. Parties to the case completed the briefing process last month. And the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission or IURC is expected to issue an order in the case during the first half of this year.On this previously announced, NIPSCO intends to follow subsequent electric base rate case during 2010. The filing will reflect the effective increased pension expense, as well as demand levels based on more recent market conditions. New rates from this case are expected to be effective in 2011.From an earnings standpoint, Electric Operations reported operating earnings of about $162 million for 2009 compared to about $220 million in 2008. Lower net revenues and higher operating expenses both contributed to the lower operating earnings.Excluding regulatory trackers, net revenues as mentioned in previously decreased by $70 million, primarily as a result of lower industrial usage, off-system sales, emission allowance sales and Sugar Creek revenues. These revenue decreases were partially offset by lower non-recoverable purchase power cost.  Operating expenses increased by $40.7 million, excluding trackers, due primarily to higher pension expense at $42.6 million. Although 2009 was a challenging year for NIPSCO, as we look forward 2010 and beyond, I'm convinced that we have a solid regulatory and business plan to restore NIPSCO's earnings space and position it for sustainable long-term growth. Executing on that plan is a key priority for NiSource this year.Interest expense, as I noted earlier, increased by about $24 million primarily due to the issuance of $700 million of long-term debt in May of 2008, $600 million of long-term debt in March of 2009 and a $385 million two-year term loan issued in April of 2009. Those increases were partially offset by our $100 million open market debt repurchase in January, our $250 million tender offered debt repurchase in April and by lower short-term interest rates.Our effective tax rate was 38.6% compared to 35.8% for the same period in 2008. For 2009, tax rate is higher due to deferred income tax adjustments related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes and an increase in tax expense related to AFUDC equity.On a GAAP basis, NiSource reported income from continuing operations for 2009 of $231.2 million or $0.84 per share compared with $370.6 million or $1.35 per share in 2008. Operating income was $801.9 million for 2009 versus $918.7 million in the year-ago period.Schedules one and two to our earnings release lists items included in GAAP income from continuing operations, but excluded from net operating earnings for NiSource in each of the segments reported today. As you will see, weather adjustments and restructuring costs in our NGT&S operations are the primary reconciling items.Turning to our 2010 earnings outlook, as noted in this morning's earnings release, we expect to deliver sustainable earnings growth of 3% to 5% on  a long-term basis, driven by our core strategy of synchronizing ongoing infrastructure investments with appropriate regulatory and commercial activities. If you refer to the key markers slot included in our supplemental materials, you'll see the key points of execution for our companies over the course of 2010.In general, we will be focusing on three areas: First, advancing growth projects in our Gas Transmission & Storage business. Second, executing our infrastructure replacement programs and related regulatory initiatives in our Gas Distribution unit. And third, completing the NIPSCO repositioning process.In terms of financial performance for 2010, we are projecting non-GAAP net operating earnings to be within a range of $1.10 to $1.20 per share. Some of the key drivers for our outlook reflected in the first slide of the supplemental materials. Among other things, you'll note that the outlook assumes a gradual and modest pace of economic recovery across the markets we serve building on the trend we experienced during the latter half of 2009.I'll also note that thanks to the successful execution of our liquidity plan during 2009 and our deep inventory of revenue-producing investment opportunities, we're increasing our capital expenditure level to $900 million in 2010. That's about $100 million increase over the 2009 level, but below the $1.3 billion plus level of 2008, which if you recall, included our $330 million purchase of the Sugar Creek gas-fired generating plant in Indiana.We are certainly pleased that we are in the position to begin increasing our capital investment program this year. However, as I've mentioned in the past, I believe that the optimal CapEx level for NiSource is about $1 billion annually given the array of attractive investments available to our business. To achieve that investment level on a sustainable basis, as well as maintain our dividend and our commitment to our investment grade credit rating will require continued execution of our business plan and ongoing strengthening of our balance sheet.To wrap up, NiSource's overall business and financial performance remains squarely in line with our business plan. And although we have much more to accomplish, our teams continue to demonstrate their commitment and ability to execute on that plan. The landscape we face today is much more stable and less treacherous than the one we encountered a year ago. That said, 2010 will undoubtedly present its share of challenges as we confront those challenges and continue to work at building and growing NiSource, I'm convinced that we do so as a stronger company, one with a business plan that's compelling, balanced and tested.As always, we remain committed to communicating with our investors in a transparent and timely manner regarding these and in all of our efforts. Ongoing updates will be provided through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com. Thank you for participating today and for your continued interest and support of NiSource. At this point, I'd like to open the call to questions."

And again, I mentioned that we will be announcing additional Marcellus projects as the year unfolds. At the moment, we see the 300 as being good for 2010. Clearly though it's a competitive business, projects do surface, opportunities do arise that could move that number up, but it's very situational. And again, we will be disciplined and thoughtful when we look at those opportunities."

We have several important matters to address this morning after which, we'll open the call to your questions. In my prepared remarks, I'll be addressing Nisource's fourth quarter and full year 2009",2799,"Thanks, Glen. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We have several important matters to address this morning after which, we'll open the call to your questions. In my prepared remarks, I'll be addressing Nisource's fourth quarter and full year 2009 earnings. A number of highlights and key accomplishments across our businesses during 2009. And finally, our earnings outlook for 2010.Let's start with Nisource's 2009 financial results, which were solidly in line with our full year operating earnings outlook of $1 to $1.10 per share. I'd add that year-over-year cash flows from operating activities increased by more than $1 billion. In short-term borrowings at year-end 2009, we're more than $1 billion lower than the year-end 2008. We'll touch more on our liquidity position in a few moments.Given the unprecedented dislocations in the financial markets and challenging economic environment across our markets by virtually any measure, Nisource not only weathered the storm during 2009, we emerged as a stronger and more robust company. For 2009, we achieved non-GAAP net operating earnings of approximately $295 million or $1.07 per share. Operating earnings for the year were approximately $880 million. For the fourth quarter, our net operating earnings again non-GAAP were approximately $99 million or $0.35 per share. I'd submit that our team's ability to deliver on our financial commitments in the face of the great recession underscores the resilience of our co-regulated businesses and is a testament to the team's disciplined execution.In addition to aggressive cost management across all our business units during 2009, we increased net revenues in both our Gas Distribution and Gas Transmission and Storage businesses. At Nisource Gas Distribution, net revenues excluding regulatory trackers increased about $70 million during 2009, primarily attributable to the team's extensive array of regulatory initiatives.In our Gas Transmission and Storage unit, the team delivered approximately $56 million in the increased net revenues, excluding regulatory trackers resulting from growth projects, short-term transportation and storage services and mineral right leasing.  As expected, these improvements were more than offset by three key items we discussed with you throughout the year; increased pension expense, reduced electric industrial demand and incremental interest expense. With respect to pension expense, we experienced an increase of $85 million of our 2008 levels. This increase is net of the impact of the deferral of about $11 million in pension expense by Columbia Gas of Ohio, which we've discussed in prior earnings updates.Although we saw a modest uptick in electric industrial demand in the fourth quarter, for the year, electric industrial demand was lower by 17% compared to 2008 levels. As for interest cost, they increased by about $24 million over 2008 levels, primarily resulting from the pre-funding of debt maturities under our liquidity plans. So to wrap up, despite a tough economic climate across our markets, the Nisource team delivered a strong earnings performance in 2009, one that we'll build on as we move forward in 2010.Now let me turn to our liquidity and refinancing activities. Throughout 2009, we emphasized that maintaining adequate liquidity and successfully managing upcoming debt maturities were key priorities. We outlined an aggressive and comprehensive liquidity plan. And our business units and our finance teams did an outstanding job of executing that plan.Capital expenditure levels were recalibrated. Operating expenses and working capital were managed aggressively. And we successfully completed approximately $2 billion in debt refinancing with a caps on [ph] being our $500 million long-term debt issuance during the fourth quarter. As a result of those efforts, we've now addressed our long-term financing need through to 2011. And we enter 2010 with the significantly stronger liquidity profile. As shown on the supplemental slides, Nisource closed 2009 with excess liquidity of more than $1 billion and we expect to have excess liquidity of more than $500 million at year-end 2010.Plus, you'll recall that we have a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that extends to July 2011. All of these activities were essential elements of Nisource's commitment to maintaining our investment grade credit rating in a manner that also preserves shareholder value.And on that front, we are pleased when in December, Moody's acknowledged the significant progress the team has made over the course of the last few years by affirming Nisource's investment grade credit rating and raising its outlook to stable. Few weeks later, Fitch affirmed its rating of BBB- with a stable outlook. We now have stable investment grade ratings from each of the three rating agencies. And we're committed to maintaining and strengthening those ratings over time in a manner that also enhances shareholder value.Now let me turn to our business update and look at how the team is delivering our balanced strategy for delivering long-term sustainable growth. Our four-part strategy continues to center on the expansion and commercial growth in our Natural Gas Pipeline and Storage business, regulatory and commercial initiatives at our utilities and strong financial process and expense management across the corporation.First, let me turn to our Gas Distribution business where we continue to see strong results from our regulatory and infrastructure investment initiatives. During the fourth quarter, Bay State Gas Company received a favorable rate case order from the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities authorizing an increase in annual base revenues of approximately $19 million or 3.7%. Also approved was a revenue-decoupling mechanism, the first of its kind in Massachusetts, along with a tracking mechanisms to recover costs associated with Bay State's infrastructure replacement program.  Truly, a breakthrough effort by the Bay State team.Columbia Gas Kentucky also received approval from the Kentucky Public Service Commission of the unanimous rate case settlement during 2009. The settlement provided for an overall annual increase in revenues of approximately $6 million or 3.7%, while authorizing an increase to the monthly customer charge, the implementation of an accelerated main replacement program tracker and the introduction of a residential energy efficiency program. Also, Columbia Gas Virginia received approval from the State Corporation Commission for its Conservation and Ratemaking Efficiency or CARE Plan for three-year period through 2012. The CARE Plan which became effective last month establishes a decoupled-rate mechanism, along with customer energy conservation incentive.And late last week, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania sought a base rate increase request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. That following proposes new home energy efficiency programs and a more progressive rate design along with an increase in base rates of $32 million annually that reflects our ongoing infrastructure replacement program. The case also reflects a tracker proposal in the event enabling legislation is enacted. New rates in Pennsylvania are expected in the fourth quarter of 2010. And last, but certainly not least, as we indicated on prior calls, our Northern Indiana Utility, NIPSCO plans to file a natural gas rate case, the company's first since 1987 as early as March of this year with new rates anticipated in late 2010.From an earnings standpoint, our Gas Distribution businesses reported 2009 operating earnings of about $329 million, slightly above its $328 million in operating earnings for 2008. As I mentioned earlier, net revenues excluding the impact of regulatory and tax trackers increased about $70 million. Those gains include offsets from decreased customer usage and lower off-system sales revenues.Operating expenses excluding trackers were up about $69 million for the year reflecting higher employee and administrative costs, depreciation costs and uncollectible accounts. The higher employee and administrative costs were primarily due to increases in pension expense of almost $32 million net of the Columbia Gas of Ohio deferral, I mentioned earlier.Throughout 2009, our Gas Distribution teams continue to build on their excellent track record of execution. This ongoing progress is a testament to our commitment to building creative and collaborative regulatory solutions that benefit customers and ensure a safe and reliable distribution system.Turning to our Gas Transmission and Storage business, the team is continuing to make significant progress in maximizing the value of our strategically-position pipeline and storage assets. With a particular focus on advancing projects that support the unprecedented supply growth taking place in the Marcellus Shale play in Appalachian.  The NGT&S team is working closely with key natural gas producers, processors and other industry players to develop the infrastructure needed to bring Marcellus supplies to market.By the close of the year, NGT&S was advancing more than $155 million of projects in the Marcellus Shale region, with the potential to provide an additional 700,000 decatherms per day of market access. And as we move forward in 2010, we'll be announcing additional expansion projects in the Marcellus area.One of our key Marcellus projects in 2009 was the Appalachian Expansion Project, which was place in to service in the second half of the year. The project leverage our existing infrastructure to provide about 100,000 decatherms per day of new transportation service to three key Appalachian producers. Another important Marcellus initiative launched by the NGT&S team in 2009 is the Majorsville project that's located in the Southwestern Pennsylvania, West Virginia Region, a Marcellus sweet spot.Over the next several years, this project will be providing gathering, processing and transmission services to several leading Marcellus producers anchoring the project. NGT&S is partnering with MarkWest Energy Partners, which is making significant investments to provide midstream services for those Marcellus producers.And yet another 2009 highlight was the allowed storage expansion project, which increased market area storage capacity by almost 7 billion cubic feet. Notably, NGT&S received FERC authorization for market-based rates for the project, the first time we've received such approval for our traditionally cost-based storage operations.With our strategic NGT&S footprint, our system capabilities and our disciplined investment strategies, Nisource is capitalizing on the unprecedented producer investment in the Marcellus region, as well as the addition of new Storage and Transportation business opportunities across our system.From an earnings standpoint, Gas Transmission and Storage reported operating earnings of $408.8 million in 2009 compared to $376.7 million in 2008. The increase resulted primarily from the $56 million in increased net revenues I mentioned earlier. Those revenues were primarily attributable to increases in firm capacity reservation fees, from growth projects and new Appalachian supply contracts, as well as increases in shorter-term transportation and storage services and mineral rights leasing revenues.Equity earnings were up $3.7 million attributable to increased earnings from Millennium Pipeline. Those increased earnings more than offset an $8.1 million reduction in equity earnings resulting from interest rate hedges related to Millennium's decision to delay permanent financing until 2010.Operating expenses increased by about $28 million, excluding trackers due to a higher capacity lease costs, employee and administrative costs, maintenance costs and environmental expenses. In addition, 2008 operating expenses were favorably impacted by the reduction of legal reserves.Now let's turn to our Electric Operations. As I noted earlier, our Northern Indiana Electric market has been under continuing pressure from the economic downturn. In face of those challenges, NIPSCO has nevertheless continued to make steady progress on its aggressive regulatory and business agenda. Notably, our operational efforts have been gaining traction. In particular, I'd note that NIPSCO's electric generation reliability metrics improved significantly during 2009. And for the year, we are above industry average levels.Regulatory wise, as you note throughout 2009, our NIPSCO teams continued to advance the company's 2008 electric rate case. Parties to the case completed the briefing process last month. And the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission or IURC is expected to issue an order in the case during the first half of this year.On this previously announced, NIPSCO intends to follow subsequent electric base rate case during 2010. The filing will reflect the effective increased pension expense, as well as demand levels based on more recent market conditions. New rates from this case are expected to be effective in 2011.From an earnings standpoint, Electric Operations reported operating earnings of about $162 million for 2009 compared to about $220 million in 2008. Lower net revenues and higher operating expenses both contributed to the lower operating earnings.Excluding regulatory trackers, net revenues as mentioned in previously decreased by $70 million, primarily as a result of lower industrial usage, off-system sales, emission allowance sales and Sugar Creek revenues. These revenue decreases were partially offset by lower non-recoverable purchase power cost.  Operating expenses increased by $40.7 million, excluding trackers, due primarily to higher pension expense at $42.6 million. Although 2009 was a challenging year for NIPSCO, as we look forward 2010 and beyond, I'm convinced that we have a solid regulatory and business plan to restore NIPSCO's earnings space and position it for sustainable long-term growth. Executing on that plan is a key priority for NiSource this year.Interest expense, as I noted earlier, increased by about $24 million primarily due to the issuance of $700 million of long-term debt in May of 2008, $600 million of long-term debt in March of 2009 and a $385 million two-year term loan issued in April of 2009. Those increases were partially offset by our $100 million open market debt repurchase in January, our $250 million tender offered debt repurchase in April and by lower short-term interest rates.Our effective tax rate was 38.6% compared to 35.8% for the same period in 2008. For 2009, tax rate is higher due to deferred income tax adjustments related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes and an increase in tax expense related to AFUDC equity.On a GAAP basis, NiSource reported income from continuing operations for 2009 of $231.2 million or $0.84 per share compared with $370.6 million or $1.35 per share in 2008. Operating income was $801.9 million for 2009 versus $918.7 million in the year-ago period.Schedules one and two to our earnings release lists items included in GAAP income from continuing operations, but excluded from net operating earnings for NiSource in each of the segments reported today. As you will see, weather adjustments and restructuring costs in our NGT&S operations are the primary reconciling items.Turning to our 2010 earnings outlook, as noted in this morning's earnings release, we expect to deliver sustainable earnings growth of 3% to 5% on  a long-term basis, driven by our core strategy of synchronizing ongoing infrastructure investments with appropriate regulatory and commercial activities. If you refer to the key markers slot included in our supplemental materials, you'll see the key points of execution for our companies over the course of 2010.In general, we will be focusing on three areas: First, advancing growth projects in our Gas Transmission & Storage business. Second, executing our infrastructure replacement programs and related regulatory initiatives in our Gas Distribution unit. And third, completing the NIPSCO repositioning process.In terms of financial performance for 2010, we are projecting non-GAAP net operating earnings to be within a range of $1.10 to $1.20 per share. Some of the key drivers for our outlook reflected in the first slide of the supplemental materials. Among other things, you'll note that the outlook assumes a gradual and modest pace of economic recovery across the markets we serve building on the trend we experienced during the latter half of 2009.I'll also note that thanks to the successful execution of our liquidity plan during 2009 and our deep inventory of revenue-producing investment opportunities, we're increasing our capital expenditure level to $900 million in 2010. That's about $100 million increase over the 2009 level, but below the $1.3 billion plus level of 2008, which if you recall, included our $330 million purchase of the Sugar Creek gas-fired generating plant in Indiana.We are certainly pleased that we are in the position to begin increasing our capital investment program this year. However, as I've mentioned in the past, I believe that the optimal CapEx level for NiSource is about $1 billion annually given the array of attractive investments available to our business. To achieve that investment level on a sustainable basis, as well as maintain our dividend and our commitment to our investment grade credit rating will require continued execution of our business plan and ongoing strengthening of our balance sheet.To wrap up, NiSource's overall business and financial performance remains squarely in line with our business plan. And although we have much more to accomplish, our teams continue to demonstrate their commitment and ability to execute on that plan. The landscape we face today is much more stable and less treacherous than the one we encountered a year ago. That said, 2010 will undoubtedly present its share of challenges as we confront those challenges and continue to work at building and growing NiSource, I'm convinced that we do so as a stronger company, one with a business plan that's compelling, balanced and tested.As always, we remain committed to communicating with our investors in a transparent and timely manner regarding these and in all of our efforts. Ongoing updates will be provided through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com. Thank you for participating today and for your continued interest and support of NiSource. At this point, I'd like to open the call to questions."

In the spirit of continuous improvement, our format for today's call will be somewhat different than our prior calls. Instead of simply reviewing the contents of our quarterly earnings release, which hopefully you had an opportunity to read by now, we're going to streamline things and focus on our financial results and the progress the team is making in our 2010 business and regulatory priorities. As part of our new approach, you'll see we've added additional supplemental slides that you can refer to on nisource.com. We hope that you find the new format helpful, and we certainly welcome your feedback. 
Referring to Slide 3, you can see that we've delivered first quarter net operating earnings non-GAAP of about $200 million or $0.72 per share compared to $0.62 per share last year. Operating earnings for the quarter were almost $405 million compared to $370 million for the same period last year. We're encouraged by these results and believe that they demonstrate the team's continuing success in executing our balanced, low-risk investment-driven strategy for building sustainable growth and shareholder value. With this solid start to the year, we remain on track to deliver our 2010 earnings outlook of $1.10 to $1.20 per share, again non-GAAP. 
Part of reviewing our business unit results, I'll take a moment to reiterate our four-part strategy to position, build and grow NiSource. The strategy, one we've been consistently articulating and pursuing for the last five years, is summarized on Slide 4.
Specifically, we continue to expand our Gas Transmission and Storage business particularly in Marcellus Shale region of Appalachian. We continue to sync our long-term utility infrastructure programs with complimentary regulatory initiatives. We continue to manage our financials in a disciplined and thoughtful manner with an unwavering focus on delivering long-term value to our shareholders and other financial stakeholders. And finally, we continue to manage costs and processes across the corporation. 
Let's now take a look at our NiSource Gas Distribution unit or NGD on Slide 5. You'll see NGD delivered operating earnings for the quarter of nearly $235 million, essentially flat to 2009. I'd note that this is a bit of an apples-to-oranges comparison, in particular, NGD's 2010 first quarter revenues were reduced by about $20 million compared to last year, as the result of Columbia Gas of Ohio's full implementation of the so-called levelized rate design or some might say straight-fixed variable.
This change effectively means that all of COH's fixed cost will be recovered on a fixed monthly basis going forward versus the traditional model under which a significant portion of its cost were recovered on a volume-metric basis. Because the new methodology results in a more even spread of revenues over the course of the year, the revenue decrease experienced in the first quarter will be offset over the balance of the year. 
I'd also note that the increased revenue from our other utilities, including the impact of recent rate cases, helped offset some of the reduced Columbia of Ohio revenue in the quarter. Looking forward to the remainder of 2010 will be quite active for NGD, as we continue to synchronize our infrastructure programs with various customer and regulatory initiatives. Let's start with Indiana.
As you know, Jimmy Staten is now also leading our Indiana utilities as Group CEO. Jimmy has a strong track record of developing and executing regulatory and business strategies designed to benefit customers and other key stakeholders. In Indiana he has literally hit the ground sprinting. Just yesterday, NIPSCO filed a gas base rate case, which among other things, proposes to restore the company's earnings to an appropriate level as well as to extend low-income and energy efficiency programs for customers. 
Notably, the following proposals of reduction and of depreciation expenses, which will result in improved earnings profile with virtually no impact on customers. If the case were to be resolved by the formal hearing process, it could take up to a year to do so. That said, our objective is to resolve the case via settlement by early 2011 or perhaps even sooner. More or less simultaneously with the Indiana filing, we filed a rate case for Columbia Gas of Virginia, which is seeking about $13 million in additional revenues. The anticipated effective date of new rates is January 1, 2011. As discussed in our last earnings call, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Columbia Gas of Maryland both filed rate cases in late January. The Pennsylvania case seeks an increase in base rates of approximately $32 million, while the Maryland case is seeking an adjustment of $2.2 million. New rates for these two cases were expected to be in place in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Let's now take a look at our NiSource Gas Transmission and Storage business or NGT&S. That's on Slide 6. In the first quarter, our NGT&S team achieved operating earnings of $125 million, an increase of nearly $15 million over the first quarter of 2009. Net revenues increased about $15 million. A significant portion of the improvement is attributable to increased firm capacity reservation fees from previously announced capital projects, including the Eastern Market Expansion, the Ohio Storage Expansion and projects to provide transportation for new Appalachian productions. 
Net revenues also increased as the result of the recognition of NGT&S's transfer of certain native gas volumes to our Hardy Storage partnership. NGT&S's Appalachian projects continue to advance, including the approximately $15 million Cobb Compressor Station expansion that's to be placed in service later this quarter as well as a series of Majorsville growth projects totaling about $80 million, which are expected to have a total capacity of 325,000 decatherms per day when they're placed into service during the third quarter. 
Beyond these specific projects, the NGT&S team continues to develop an extensive portfolio with additional growth projects in the Marcellus region, designed to meet the needs of the market at the same time delivering attractive returns on invested capital.
Turning to our Electric business on Slide 7. As you know this is a pivotal year for our Electric Operations, as we develop and roll out important customer programs, continue to improve the reliability of our operations and pursue our core regulatory agenda, which collectively will position this business for long-term growth. Our Electric Operations reported first quarter operating earnings of approximately $46 million, an increase of about $20 million over the same period in 2009. 
During the quarter, we experienced lower operating expenses as well as increased net revenues from increased usage and off-system sales, reflecting an uptick in industrial and residential demand. Although this is certainly a welcome development, we believe it's too early to identify the definitive trend. Our plan reflects a gradual economic recovery. 
Shifting to our rate cases. We expect to receive an order in our 2008 electric rate case in the next few months. As we have discussed in prior calls, the case has in a sense been overtaken by the impact of the economic downturn. We, nevertheless, are eagerly awaiting the Indiana Commission's order in the case, as it should resolve a number of cost allocation, rate design and other issues that we hopefully can incorporate in our second electric rate case. 
Speaking of which, the second electric rate case is expected to be filed in the third quarter of 2010. The filing will reflect recent demand and cost levels, and will propose energy efficiency and customer systems programs. I also note that we're investing more than $200 million during 2010 in our electric-generating fleet and distribution infrastructure to ensure the Northwest Indiana region maintains reliable access to modern, environmentally compliant and affordable energy. Without minimizing the challenge, I'm convinced we have the correct ingredients in place to execute on our Indiana business and regulatory agenda. I look forward to providing ongoing updates on future calls.
Before we close, I'd like to direct your attention to one slide in the supplemental package. It's Slide 8 entitled Building Investment-Driven Growth. This slide provides a thumbnail sketch of the regulated low-risk, fee-based platform we're building here at NiSource, and it summarizes the strategic approach and projected growth rates for each of our key business units, again, all premised on a disciplined, long-term infrastructure investment program.
As I mentioned in past calls, we believe that the optimal investment low for our stable of companies is about $1 billion annually, perhaps a bit more in some years and a bit less in others. The key consideration for us is how to best respond to these compelling growth opportunities. 
Although we haven't reached a definitive conclusion, I can say that we're committed to doing so in a manner that creates shareholder value, maintains the dividend and preserves our investment-grade credit rate.
To wrap up with Slide 9. Number one, NiSource's overall business and financial performance for the quarter was strong and firmly in line with the business plan. We remain committed to our 2010 non-GAAP guidance into a long-term growth rate of 3% to 5%.
Second, our aggressive regulatory and business plan at NIPSCO, while we'll take some additional time and considerable effort, remains on track. 
Third, the infrastructure investment, our Gas Distribution Operations, continues as planned with significant benefits for customers and shareholders alike. 
Fourth, we're focused on exploiting our competitive advantage in the Marcellus Shale play, which includes identifying, developing and deploying infrastructure investments to meet the needs of the producers who are developing this exciting new supply resource. 
And finally, we're focused on building the necessary balance sheet flexibility to fund an ongoing capital investment level at roughly $1 billion per year.
Before turning to questions, I want to plug our plans to hold an Investor Day in New York on July 22. More details will be shared in the coming months. We hope that all of you can attend in person or virtually to learn more about our businesses. Your executives will discuss their near- and long-term strategies and review our exciting array of investment opportunities.
As always, we remain committed to communicating with our investors in a transparent and timely manner regarding these and all of our efforts. Ongoing updates will be provided through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com. Thank you for participating today and for your continued interest and support of NiSource. Latasha, at this point, we can open the call to questions."

Today, we will cover several key points before opening the line to your questions. First, I will touch on the team’s strong performance thus far in 2010, which has enabled us to increase our full-year earnings outlook for 2010. I will also speak to our third quarter results, which very closely in line with our business plan, and finally, I will highlight several areas, where our team continues to execute our plan to build shareholder value and long-term investment driven earnings growth.
So first, let us turn to our 2010 non-GAAP earnings guidance. If you recall that at the beginning of 2010, we provided net operating earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 per share, the midpoint of which represented about 7% growth from our 2009 earnings level. We are pleased to announce that we now anticipate full-year net operating earnings to fall within a range of $1.20 to $1.25 per share, again non-GAAP. This improved earnings outlook reflects the core strength of our team’s 2010 performance, as well as continued signs of resilience in some of our key markets.
I am confident the team will deliver on our updated outlook by executing on our business strategy, meeting the needs of our customers and enhancing shareholder value through long-term infrastructure investment driven growth. As noted in today’s news release, we also remain strongly committed to growing annual earnings by 3% to 5% on a long term, sustainable basis. To that point, during the third quarter we significantly improved our flexibility to fund our deep inventory of infrastructure investment opportunities by successfully executing $400 million common stock equity offering.
The offering was fully subscribed under favorable pricing plans, and aligned very nicely with our infrastructure investment profile. Notably, we are now in a position to fund our capital investment opportunities at the run rate level of about $1 billion annually. As I have noted in the past, we expect that in some years our CapEx level will be more than $1 billion, and in some it may be less. But the key takeaway is that we are now poised to spend at our optimal investment level on a year in and year out basis, fundamental breakthrough for the team as well as for all of our stakeholders.
And on that note, throughout this process, we have remained mindful of our (inaudible) of stakeholders’ commitments. One, to create long-term shareholder value; two, to maintain and eventually grow our dividend; and three, to preserve our investment grade credit rating. Our equity offering meets these key criteria, and positions NiSource to sustainably grow long-term earnings at the upper end of our corrected range.
As we have discussed, we do have opportunities to grow at a higher rate over the next couple of years as we establish a new baseline earnings level in 2012 as a result of executing on our Indiana regulatory strategy. Finally, I can’t leave this subject without expressing our deep appreciation to all of NiSource’s financial stakeholders for your support as we’ve traveled the long and sometimes bumpy road to strengthening the company’s financial profile, and enhancing our investment capabilities. I can assure you that the entire team is as focused and energized as ever as we move forward and continue to build long-term sustainable growth.
Now let’s turn to our third quarter results, and the supplemental slides that are available on NiSource.com. On slide 3, you can see that we delivered third quarter net operating earnings non-GAAP of about $10 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to $0.07 per share last year. Operating earnings for the quarter were about $110 million, compared to about $135 million for the same period last year.
As mentioned in our release, the third-quarter numbers reflect a slight decrease from our 2009 results due to anticipated increases in certain operating expenses, as well as taxes and depreciation.
Turning to slide five, let us look at our business unit results. Our Gas Distribution group, as anticipated, experienced an operating earnings loss for the current quarter of about $41 million compared to a loss of $30 million during the same period in 2009. Net revenues for the quarter were up about $9 million, excluding trackers, primarily due to ongoing regulatory initiatives and infrastructure investments, as well as the effect of rate increases at a number of our utilities.
Increased revenues were offset by higher operating expenses of $19 million, including higher pension expenses, due to the recording of a catch-up in pension deferrals during the third quarter of 2009 at Columbia Gas of Ohio, as well as other employee and administration costs.
On the investment front, our gas distribution teams continue to pursue aggressive long-term infrastructure enhancement and replacement programs, as well as a complementary agenda of revenue producing regulatory and commercial initiatives. On the regulatory front, in August we received approval from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for a settlement of Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania base rate case with new rates effective on October 1. That settlement positions the company to increase base revenues, while providing a suite of new customer programs.
Meanwhile, our $13 million Columbia Gas of Virginia rate case also is moving forward with hearing scheduled for November, and new rates anticipated to be in effect January 1, 2011. And lastly I would note that we anticipate approval in the fourth quarter of Northern Indiana Public Service Company's unanimous gas rate case settlement. The NIPSCO’s settlement, which was filed with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, IURC, in late August. It holds the line on residential customer rates, while providing for increased earnings for the company. We expect a favorable IURC order and new rates to take effect within a matter of weeks.
Just to recap, our gas distribution teams continue to deliver solid results on our straight forward infrastructure investment driven business strategy. Let us now take a look at our NiSource’s Gas Transmission & Storage business unit highlighted on slide 6. Here the team’s focus continues to be on market driven growth projects with particular emphasis on our extensive opportunities in the Marcellus Shale region. From an earnings standpoint, the NGT&S generated operating earnings of about $76 million in the third quarter, compared to $100 million in 2009. Net revenues were down about $8 million due to lower short-term transportation and storage services, which is being impacted by the extreme lack of price volatility in the market, as well as reduced mineral rights leasing revenues in light of some fairly significant upfront payments last year.
Operating expenses were up about $14 due to planned expenditures for pipeline integrity management, as well as certain employee and administrative costs. From a growth standpoint, which we targeted 4% to 6% for the NGT&S business unit, the team is continuing to develop its inventory of infrastructure investment projects, ranging from traditional transportation and storage services to supply aggregation in other Marcellus production related projects.
This quarter marked several milestones for this strategy, the result of which will be reflected in our earnings going forward. In September, we commence services on our keystone Majorsville expansion, developed jointly with MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources. This project which came in on time and on budget is the first integrated web gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in northern West Virginia. The expansion, reflecting an investment of approximately $80 million, is fully contracted and delivers more than 325,000 Dth/d of Marcellus production to a new MarkWest processing plant.
Also in the third quarter, we announced a partnership with UGI Energy Services to develop a new natural gas pipeline providing improved market access to Marcellus Shale producers in Pennsylvania. The project, currently in the development stage, could provide as much as 500,000 Dth/d of additional transportation capacity for production in north-central Pennsylvania and southern New York. We are excited about this project and pleased to be working with such a fine company as UGI in developing the opportunity.
The NGT&S team also is moving forward several additional Marcellus area projects designed to move this growing supply source to downstream market centers and other points of liquidity. Among the projects being worked by the team are the Line WB Expansion, expect to be completed in January of 2011; and the Clendenin Project, targeted to be in service by the second quarter of 2011. And one additional NGT&S note, just yesterday Columbia Gulf Transmission, which represents about 15% of our pipeline in storage business mix, filed a base rate case with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, its first in more than 14 years.
The filing proposes an annual increase of about $50 million, reflecting updated reliability investments, integrity management and other costs, as well as current operating conditions. We anticipate new rates to be in effect subject to refund in mid-2011. I would note that earlier this year, we were pursuing a number of creative ideas for Columbia Gulf, such as an incentive fixed fuel arrangement that had they been implemented would have eliminated the need for a general rate filing. Because we were unable to implement those arrangements on acceptable terms, we took a hard look at our numbers, and decided to proceed with this Gulf rate case.
In summary, the NGT&S team continues to execute on its strategy of maximizing the value of its current asset base, and making disciplined investments in customer driven, value creating infrastructure projects.
Let us now turn to NiSource’s electric business unit on slide 7. At NIPSCO, we have seen significant progress on our core regulatory agenda, as well as continued material improvement in reliability, responsiveness and customer service. From a financial standpoint, NIPSCO electric reported third-quarter operating earnings of $80 million, an increase of about $10 million over the same period in 2009. NIPSCO saw an increase in industrial margins, in addition to an increase in off-system sales that helped drive a net revenue increase of about $17 million.
Operating expenses increased about $7 million above last year’s levels due primarily to anticipated increases in employee and administration costs, taxes and electric generation costs. On the operations front, I note that NIPSCO generation fleet set an all-time total generation record during August with 1.7 million megawatt hours, a great testament to the NIPSCO team’s progress in improving the raw [ph] ability and efficiency of our generating assets.
Moving to our regulatory agenda, the third quarter marked a milestone in NIPSCO’s 2008 electric rate case, as we received an order from the IURC on August 25. The order which is subject to rehearing in an appeals process is solidly in line with our expectations, and sets the stage for restoring NIPSCO’s electric earnings to an appropriate level by 2012.
As we have discussed over the last year, NIPSCO is in the process of developing a follow up electric rate case scheduled to be filed in the fourth quarter of this year. That filing is intended to address items that have changed since the company’s 2008 rate filing, including changes in customer usage and operating conditions, and efforts to enhance customer programs and rate design.
The core objective of the second-rate case is to restore NIPSCO electric’s earnings to an appropriate level, and do so in a manner that is responsive to the interests of its customers and other key stakeholders. I would note that we’re actively engaged with various stakeholder groups in discussions that could lead to a settlement of the first electric rate case, and it is conceivable and I would underscore the word conceivable that such an arrangement could even obviate the need to file a second case this year.
Although it is too early to tell if a settlement will be achievable, and if so what the precise contours and timing might be, I can tell you that Jimmy Staton and his team are actively engaged in a constructive dialogue with NIPSCO’s key regulatory stakeholders, and are determined to resolve these cases in a manner that is responsive to the needs of all parties. So as they say [ph], stay tuned.
Parenthetically, and perhaps anticipating your question a bit, I would note that although there have been some recent high-profile leadership changes at the IURC, we don’t expect they will have an adverse affect on our ability to execute NIPSCO’s regulatory agenda in Indiana. As many of you know, Indiana has a long-standing reputation for balanced and thoughtful regulatory policies and practices, and we see no signs to suggest that will change going forward.
Before moving on, it is clear that our Indiana team continues to build momentum. They are delivering solid and materially improved business and operational results, while demonstrating the value of constructive and positive engagements with key stakeholders. Bottom line, I am confident we can restore NIPSCO’s earnings to an appropriate sustainable level, while also continuing to invest in a reliable and efficient energy infrastructure that is vital to Indiana’s long-term success.
To wrap up with slide 8, several observations, first, as we sprint to the end of the year, I’m confident the team will deliver on today’s increased earnings outlook for 2010 and build on that performance in 2011. Second, our successful equity offering aligns with and provides fundamental support for our business plan going forward, and positions NiSource to fund the deep inventory, attractive infrastructure investment opportunities available at each of our business units.
I can assure you that our investment approach will remain disciplined and straightforward focused on meeting our customer needs, while building long-term value for our shareholders. Third, as always, we remain committed to communicating with our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner regarding these and all of our efforts. Ongoing updates will be provided through our analyst calls and new releases posted on NiSource.com.
Thank you for your participation today. Thank you for your continued interest and support of NiSource. With that Tijuana, I would open the call to questions.

Our return on assets has been what we had anticipated and protected it would be based on our assumptions. You are right to point out that the discount rate has dropped from year-end 2009, but again I would point out that what really matters is where the discount rate is at the end of the year.
And as the discount rate moves around, if it is lower at the end of the year, it will drive a higher liability, if it is higher it will drive a lower liability. So we won’t know exactly where we end up. We have to wait until the end of the year before we can run all the analyses to figure out where our pension expense will be for 2011, and where our cash funding will be for 2011. But I will point out and emphasize that based on where we are relative to our asset performance, it is in line with our expectations.

We also have sensitivities around our optimization business, both at pipeline and at gas distribution, although we don’t rely on that business, it is a big earnings generator.
