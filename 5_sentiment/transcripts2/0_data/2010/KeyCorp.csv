Good morning, everyone, and welcome to KeyCorp's Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is our CFO, Jeff Weeden; and available for the Q&A portion of our call are Vice Chairs, Beth Mooney and Peter Hancock; Chief Risk Officer, Chuck Hyle; and our Treasurer, Joe Vayda.Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure statement. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call today.Now if you would turn to Slide #3. Today, we announced a net loss from continuing operations of $258 million or $0.30 per common share. Although this remains a challenging environment, we are encouraged by the continued stabilization of the economy and some positive trends in our fourth quarter results. Our net interest margin increased 24 basis points from the prior quarter, as a result of reduced funding costs and better earning asset yields. And although net charge-offs remained elevated, we saw a meaningful improvement in the fourth quarter in most of our credit metrics, including decreases in delinquencies, criticized and classified assets, non-performing loans and non-performing assets.Slide 3 shows the strategic priorities that guided our actions in 2009 and continue to be the primary areas of focus in 2010. These priorities are built around three strategic imperatives: Maintaining a strong balance sheet, reducing risk and positioning the company for growth. While 2009 was one of the most challenging years in our company's history, I'm pleased with the progress that we've made on these priorities.The first priority is balance sheet strength, which is one of the foundational elements on which all of our business strategies are built. We believe that strong capital, reserves and liquidity are critical, not only in today's environment, but also to support future growth opportunities. During the year, we took a number of actions to strengthen our balance sheet, including generating approximately $2.4 billion of new Tier 1 common equity and continuing to build our loan loss reserve. At December 31, our Tier 1 common equity ratio was a strong 7.46% and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12.68%. Both measures are up significantly from the year-ago period.Over the past year, we also increased our allowance for loan losses by over $900 million to $2.5 billion. At the end of the fourth quarter, our loan loss allowance represented 4.31% of total loans and 116% of non-performing loans. Both of these ratios should place us in or very near the top quartile of our peer group. And we made significant progress on strengthening our liquidity and funding positions. Our average loan and deposit ratio at year end was below 100% compared to several years ago when we were in the 140% range. This improvement was accomplished by growing deposits, which reduced our reliance on wholesale funding. We also exited non-relationship businesses while increasing the portion of earning assets invested in highly liquid securities.Proactively addressing credit quality and reducing our risk profile has been and continues to be one of our top priorities. One of our primary areas of focus has been to reduce our exposure to the high-risk segments of our commercial real estate portfolio. Since the first quarter of 2008, we have reduced our commercial real estate residential properties exposure by over $2.5 billion or 69% to $1.1 billion, which includes a significant reductions in our California and Florida exposures.We have also continued to address other parts of our commercial real estate portfolio, including working with our developer clients to provide interim financing on viable projects when long-term take-out financing is not available. We have been successful in reunderwriting many of these credits, while strengthening Key's collateral position and adjusting pricing to reflect current market conditions. And we have been aggressive in the disposition of high-risk loans and assets. Key was one of the first banks to initiate the sale of a large portfolio of at-risk commercial real estate homebuilder loans. And since that time, we have continued to sell both loans and other real estate owned.A strong balance sheet and improved risk profile positioned us to leverage the investments that we have made and continue to make in our core relationship businesses. And despite the difficult operating environment, we have made progress in creating some distinctive businesses with attractive growth opportunities.In Community Banking, we are continuing to invest in our people, infrastructure and technology. In 2009, we opened 38 new branches in eight different markets and we plan to open an additional 40 branches this year. We have also completed 160 branch renovations over the past two years and expect to renovate another 100 branches in 2010.In addition, we've created 157 business-intensive branches last year, which are staffed to serve our small business clients. And while many of our competitors have reduced their commitment to this segment, Key is taking a longer-term view and will be uniquely positioned in our markets as the economy improves.We are also investing in product enhancements and innovation, driven by client insights in each of our Community Banking Client segments. Recent initiatives include our KeyBank rewards offering, mobile online banking through iPhones and Blackberries and upgrades in our treasury management capabilities. And we believe that our real competitive distinction is our people and the sales and service culture that we have built. This difference was recognized last year, with Key being the top-rated bank in BusinessWeek's Customer Service Champ survey.In National Banking, we have continued to focus on reducing risks and sharpening our focus on specific client segments, where we have a sustainable competitive advantage. Businesses that do not need our risk-adjusted return hurdles have been moved to the exit portfolio. As I mentioned, we have reduced our exposure to commercial real estate and continue to look for opportunities to leverage our commercial real estate servicing capabilities.We have also sharpened the focus of our institutional business by aligning around four specific client segments and investing in the people that can capitalize on attractive opportunities, again, as the economy improves. And we are emphasizing areas that have synergy with client segments in the Community Bank, such as Equipment Leasing and certain product offerings through KeyBanc Capital Markets. In our Equipment Leasing business, we are leveraging our scale and expertise to meet the needs of our clients across the organization from small business all the way up to the large corporate clients.And finally, we have continued to make progress on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization. Our staffing levels are down by over 2,500 FTEs over the past two years, and we continue to implement initiatives that will better align our cost structure with our relationship-focused business strategies. And we want to ensure that we have effective business models that are sustainable and flexible, so that we are well positioned to capture new market opportunities. We clearly have work remaining, but as we turned our sights to 2010, I remain confident that we are taking the right steps to emerge from this extraordinary period as a strong competitive company. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff Weeden for a view of our financial results. Jeff?"

For the fourth quarter, the company incurred",1424,"Thank you, Henry. Slide 4 provides a summary of the company's fourth quarter 2009 results from continuing operations. Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to our continuing operations. For the fourth quarter, the company incurred a net loss of $0.30 per common share. Several items impacted our fourth quarter results, including continuing elevated credit costs and realized and unrealized losses on CMBS holdings and other direct or co-managed fund investments in our real estate capital line of business.  These realized and unrealized losses totaled $92 million or $0.07 per common share.After the fourth quarter write-downs, we have a remaining carrying value of $29 million in our CMBS portfolio and $63 million in our other real estate related investments within the Real Estate Capital line of business. A significant positive item realized during the fourth quarter was the final settlement with the IRS of the tax years 1997 through 2006, which resulted in recording a credit to income taxes of $106 million or $0.12 per common share.Turning to Slide 5. For the fourth quarter of 2009, the company's taxable equivalent net interest income was $637 million compared to an adjusted $613 million in the third quarter. The net interest margin expanded 17 basis points to 3.04% for the fourth quarter compared to the adjusted margin for the third quarter of 2009. The company benefited from an improved funding mix as CDs, which were booked in 2008, continue to mature and reprice at current market rates or moved into lower cost deposit products such as NOW and money market accounts. We expect this trend to continue into 2010 as we experience additional maturities of CDs booked in 2008 or earlier. This repricing opportunity will continue to benefit the net interest margin in 2010. And with respect to the first quarter, we anticipate a five to 10 basis point further expansion of the net interest margin.Turning to Slide 6. During the fourth quarter, the company experienced a $4.3 billion decrease in average total loan balances compared to the third quarter of 2009 and a $12.8 billion decline compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. The decline in average balances continues to reflect soft loan demand for credit from consumers and businesses as they continue to delever, given the uncertain economic environment. The impact of our exit portfolios as we continue to reduce risk in the company and the elevated net charge-off levels we have experienced.The significant decline from last year is due in part to the build-up in balances experienced in the second half of 2008 as clients drew on their lines of credit given the uncertainties in the markets, only to repay them in 2009 as the financial markets improve. Until clients gain more confidence in the strength of the economic recovery, we expect loan demand to remain soft going into 2010. In addition, we will still face headwinds from the runoff of our exit portfolios and elevated net charge-offs. On a more encouraging point, over the past quarter within the Community Banking part of our operation, we have seen a pickup in our commercial loan pipeline reports from very depressed levels observed earlier in 2009.Turning to Slide 7. Average deposits were down approximately $600 million from the third quarter and up $3.6 billion from the same period one year ago. With respect to the individual deposit categories, we experienced an increase in DDA balances as commercial clients continue to hold higher balances to offset analyzed deposit service charges, and alternative short-term investment opportunities are less attractive, given the low rate environment.NOW and money market deposit account balances grew as money from maturing CDs shifted back into these accounts, as current CD rates look less attractive to clients. We also saw some of these funds leave our deposit categories as individuals look for higher yields elsewhere or invested the money in other products such as annuities.We expect this trend to continue into 2010, with a significant portion of money for maturing CDs either moving back into NOW and money market deposit accounts or moving to other forms of investment. As I mentioned earlier, the repricing of the CD book will also continue to benefit the net interest margin.Slide 8 shows the progress we have made over the past year to improve the liquidity position of the company. On this slide, you can see the change in assets and the improved funding mix of the company over the past year. As shown on this slide, for the fourth quarter of 2009, the loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 98%, a significant decrease from one year ago when it was 125%. In this loan-to-deposit ratio, we have also included our discontinued operations' balances.Turning to Slide 9. Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter increased to $708 million and represented 4.64% of average total loans compared to $587 million or 3.59% experienced in the third quarter of 2009. The increase from the third quarter was the result of charge-offs recorded on two specific customer relationships in the real estate capital line of business. The charge-offs on these two relationships accounted for $131 million of the total net charge-offs for the fourth quarter.We also continue to build reserves during the fourth quarter; however, at the lowest pace in over two years. At December 31, 2009, our reserve balance stood at a little over $2.5 billion and represented 4.31% of total loans. In addition, our reserve for unfunded commitments increased by $27 million during the fourth quarter to $121 million, and when combined with our loan loss reserve, total reserve for credit losses represented 4.52% of total loans at December 31, 2009.Turning to Slide 10. Our non-performing loans stood at $2.2 billion at December 31, 2009, and our non-performing assets were $2.5 billion. These totals represented decreases of $103 million and $298 million in non-performing loans and non-performing assets respectively from September 30, 2009. As shown in the summary of changes in non-performing loans on Page 27 of the earnings release today, the net inflow of non-performing loans continued to decrease in the fourth quarter, and while still running high, was at its lowest level of 2009. Also shown on Page 27 of the earnings release are our 30- to 89-day and 90-day or more past due loans, which continue to show improvement in the fourth quarter. These past due loans declined to their lowest level since the third quarter of 2008.Our coverage ratio of our loan loss reserves to non-performing loans increased to 116% at December 31, 2009. And when combined with our reserve for unfunded commitments to our total loan losses reserve, our total allowances for credit losses represented 121% coverage of non-performing loans at December 31, 2009. In addition, non-performing loans are carried at approximately 76% of their original face values and other real estate owned and other non-performing assets are carried at approximately 53% of their original face values. In total, we have recognized approximately $1 million in charge-offs and write-downs against these assets as of December 31, 2009.Slide 11 is a breakdown of the commercial loan portfolio by line of business. A couple of points to draw your attention to here are: First, you can see clearly the large increase in average commercial loan balances outstanding in 2008 and the subsequent decline that occurred in 2009. Also, on a quarterly basis, average balances declined significantly in the second half of 2009 as business liquidity improved and companies use this as an opportunity to refinance in the capital markets or simply use excess liquidity to pay down debt.Next, non-performing loans and net charge-offs in 2009 were driven by the Real Estate Capital line of business within National Banking. This line of business accounted for approximately 31% of the outstanding average commercial loan balances, 55% of the commercial non-performing loans and 66% of the commercial loan net charge-offs experienced in 2009. In the appendix, we have included additional schedules with respect to our various loan portfolios for your review.And now concluding with our capital ratios on Slide 12. At December 31, 2009, our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio was 7.56%. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 7.46% and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12.68%. All of our capital ratios remained strong. This, along with the company's improved liquidity, positions us well to weather the current credit cycle and to continue to serve our clients' needs. That concludes our remarks. And now I will turn the call back over to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A segment of our call. Operator?"

We've talked about that, we won't be at the full run rate of that until 2012. But clearly, given the shift in the business mix and the continued refocusing of the company to have a more efficient and effective balance sheet and organization, I think in terms of the industry and for Key, we're probably looking at a one to one and a quarter type percent return on assets."

But we do think that there are going to be opportunities here beyond working through the FDIC troubled list. I happen to believe that there's going to be consolidation in the banking industry. And I think strong capital positions and good business models are going to be the winners there. As we have said, we're shifting our business mix a little bit away from the National Banking Group, primarily some of the National Consumer businesses that don't give us the hurdle rate returns that we need and investing that in the Community Bank, not only in the efforts to continue to be better self-funded, which we are now under 100% loan to deposit. But also, in the small business and middle market areas and looking at the synergies across the Key franchise, including using some of the products and services that the National Bank provides. So we don't think we're limited in terms of where those growth opportunities are. We do think that we've got this transition period where we're working way out of the exit portfolio and continuing to focus on growth, in effect, running to stay even. But as that exit portfolio winds its way down, we'll be able to see that kind of growth, primarily around our core relationship businesses, that again, we think is going to put us in a good position."

So I think if you look at, for example, in the fourth quarter, professional fees shot up as we address the number of issues that we faced in some of these assets, [Audio Gap] there are probably about $20 million higher here in the fourth quarter than what they were running, the reserve for unfunded commitments. In the fourth quarter we actually made an adjustment based upon our prior three-year history here with respect to just loss given default ratio rates. And as a result of that, even though commitments really didn't change that much, and as Henry commented on earlier, criticized and classified actually improved during the fourth quarter. But our updated loss given default rates increased given that most recent history. So that drove some of that increase in the reserve fund type [ph] of commitments. Now of course as we have continued migration of credit going the other direction, at some point, that will actually bring down that reserve. So that was $27 million in the fourth quarter. And then I think if we look at some other things we've made some adjustments with respect to our pension here in the company. So the pension plan was froze effective as of January 1. So there won't be anymore new entrants. It's a cash balance plan so there still be interest credited to the balances that are out there. But that will also save us, going forward, anywhere $5 million to $10 million per quarter. And then I think if you look at just the other real estate costs, going back through time, we basically used to run in the $5 million-a-quarter range. That's been up as high as $50 million, it was $25 million in the fourth quarter. So over time, that will also normalize."

The issue is how it ramps up during the rental intake. And we've been encouraged by a couple of things. One, the primary one is that absorption rates in virtually all states, even the four states that have been most materially impacted by the residential downturn have, held up pretty well. The negative is that concessions or free rent months or whatever, have clearly been a part of this process. So our expectation is that while we see some drift into NPL and delinquency, over time, our expectation is that most of this will reverse itself. So it's really more of a timing issue. The other comment I would make is, and this accounts for a portion of the increase in the NPL side for this quarter, is that we have done a number of TDRs troubled debt restructurings, and a good portion of our TDRs, which I would say you can find it in the press release but it's about 360 million for the fourth quarter, is an uptick in the NPLs. But our expectation as we have restructured those deals is they will come back into accruing over the next one, two or three quarters.

Looking at the various portfolios that are there, obviously, on the residential property side, which is down now to about $431 million at the end of the year, that one we're continuing to work our way down, sell properties, get cash and continue just liquidating on out of that particular book. The Marine and RV floor plan, that's one that's going to be dependent upon some refinancing taking place in the industry. So that will kind of go in ebbs and flows. We had good activity in the third quarter. It slows down typically this time of year, so fourth quarter. And then you should see some pickup obviously as we get into 2010 later in the spring. The commercial lease portfolio, there's a portion of that, this was over $1 billion that's going to be our leverage lease book. Those are very long lives. The rest of it has a shorter duration on it and will continue to pay down. But the leverage lease part of it is going to kind of go in ebbs and flows on that. Home equity - National Banking is just going to -- there's really so much of a market for these particular credits so you're talking about some of this just going to take a longer period of time to pay down. The same with the Marine. So if Marine activity picks up, if the economy picks up, we would expect that people would trade in boats and look for new boats and that would cause that prepayment speed to pick up.

The calculation of our allowance is very quantitative, although clearly, there is some judgment in it but it's largely quantitative. Jeff referenced earlier, some of our methodological changes as we review loss rates, particularly through this very difficult cycle, and we do a lot of back testing on our models, trying to get as close to quantifying the risk in our portfolio as we possibly can. So we look at all those factors. We look at, and as I said earlier, the upgrade/downgrade ratios and flows and migratory patterns. And that's how we reach our conclusions on how large the allowance should be. But most of those trends, as we said earlier, are moving in the right direction now, particularly through the fourth quarter for us. And therefore, we are certainly getting closer to a point where provision will be pretty close to charge offs. And we just need to keep working our way through that. Each month gets a little bit better and so much really does depend on how the economic cycle is going to pan out. We're still looking at it to be relatively modest improvement, but we're watching it very closely like everyone else is."

Joining me for today's presentation is our CFO, Jeff Weeden; and available for the Q&A portion of our call are Vice Chairs, Beth Mooney and Peter Hancock; Chief Risk Officer, Chuck Hyle; and our Treasurer, Joe Vayda.Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure statement. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call today.Now if you would turn to Slide #3. Today, we announced the net loss from continuing operations of $258 million or $0.30 per common share. Although this remains a challenging environment, we are encouraged by the continued stabilization of the economy and some positive trends in our fourth quarter results. Our net interest margin increased 24 basis points from the prior quarter, as a result of reduced funding costs and better earning asset yields. And although net charge-offs remained elevated, we saw a meaningful improvement in the fourth quarter in most of our credit metrics, including decreases in delinquencies, criticized and classified assets, non-performing loans and non-performing assets.Slide 3 shows the strategic priorities that guided our actions in 2009 and continue to be the primary areas of focus in 2010. These priorities are built around three strategic imperatives: Maintaining a strong balance sheet, reducing risk and positioning the company for growth. While 2009 was one of the most challenging years in our company's history, I'm pleased with the progress that we've made on these priorities.The first priority is balance sheet strength, which is one of the foundational elements on which all of our business strategies are built. We believe that strong capital, reserves and liquidity are critical, not only in today's environment, but also to support future growth opportunities. During the year, we took a number of actions to strengthen our balance sheet, including generating approximately $2.4 billion of new Tier 1 common equity and continuing to build our loan loss reserve. At December 31, our Tier 1 common equity ratio was a strong 7.46% and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12.68%. Both measures are up significantly from the year-ago period.Over the past year, we also increased our allowance for loan losses by over $900 million to $2.5 billion. At the end of the fourth quarter, our loan loss allowance represented 4.31% of total loans and 116% of non-performing loans. Both of these ratios should place us in or very near the top quartile of our peer group. And we made significant progress on strengthening our liquidity and funding positions. Our average loan and deposit ratio at year end was below 100% compared to several years ago when we were in the 140% range. This improvement was accomplished by growing deposits, which reduced our reliance on wholesale funding. We also exited non-relationship businesses while increasing the portion of earning assets invested in highly liquid securities.Proactively addressing credit quality and reducing our risk profile has been and continues to be one of our top priorities. One of our primary areas of focus has been to reduce our exposure to the high-risk segments of our commercial real estate portfolio. Since the first quarter of 2008, we have reduced our commercial real estate residential properties exposure by over $2.5 billion or 69% to $1.1 billion, which includes significant reductions in our California and Florida exposures.We have also continued to address other parts of our commercial real estate portfolio, including working with our developer clients to provide interim financing on viable projects when long-term take-out financing is not available. We have been successful in re-underwriting many of these credits, while strengthening Key's collateral position and adjusting pricing to reflect current market conditions. And we have been aggressive in the disposition of high-risk loans and assets. Key was one of the first banks to initiate the sale of a large portfolio of at-risk commercial real estate homebuilder loans. And since that time, we have continued to sell both loans and other real estate owned.A strong balance sheet and improved risk profile position us to leverage the investments that we have made and continue to make in our core relationship businesses. And despite the difficult operating environment, we have made progress in creating some distinctive businesses with attractive growth opportunities.In Community Banking, we are continuing to invest in our people, infrastructure and technology. In 2009, we opened 38 new branches in eight different markets and we plan to open an additional 40 branches this year. We have also completed 160 branch renovations over the past two years and expect to renovate another 100 branches in 2010. In addition, we created 157 business-intensive branches last year, which are staffed to serve our small business clients. And while many of our competitors have reduced their commitment to this segment, Key is taking a longer-term view and will be uniquely positioned in our markets as the economy improves.We are also investing in product enhancements and innovation, driven by client insights in each of our Community Banking Client segments. Recent initiatives include our KeyBank rewards offering, mobile online banking through iPhones and Blackberries and upgrades in our treasury management capabilities. And we believe that our real competitive distinction is our people and the sales and service culture that we have built. This difference was recognized last year, with Key being the top-rated bank in BusinessWeek's Customer Service Champ survey.In National Banking, we have continued to focus on reducing risk and sharpening our focus on specific client segments where we have a sustainable competitive advantage. Businesses that do not need our risk-adjusted return hurdles have been moved to the exit portfolio. As I mentioned, we have reduced our exposure to commercial real estate and continue to look for opportunities to leverage our commercial real estate servicing capabilities.We have also sharpened the focus of our institutional business by aligning around four specific client segments and investing in the people that can capitalize on attractive opportunities, again, as the economy improves. And we are emphasizing areas that have synergy with client segments in the Community Bank, such as Equipment Leasing and certain product offerings through KeyBanc Capital Markets. In our Equipment Leasing business, we are leveraging our scale and expertise to meet the needs of our clients across the organization from small business all the way up to the large corporate clients.And finally, we have continued to make progress on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization. Our staffing levels are down by over 2,500 FTEs over the past two years, and we continue to implement initiatives that will better align our cost structure with our relationship-focused business strategies. And we want to ensure that we have effective business models that are sustainable and flexible, so that we are well positioned to capture new market opportunities. We clearly have work remaining, but as we turn our sights to 2010, I remain confident that we are taking the right steps to emerge from this extraordinary period as a strong competitive company. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff Weeden for a view of our financial results. Jeff?"

Slide 4 provides a summary of the company's fourth quarter 2009 results from continuing operations. Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to our continuing operations. For the fourth quarter, the company incurred",1424,"Thank you, Henry. Slide 4 provides a summary of the company's fourth quarter 2009 results from continuing operations. Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to our continuing operations. For the fourth quarter, the company incurred a net loss of $0.30 per common share. Several items impacted our fourth quarter results, including continuing elevated credit costs and realized and unrealized losses on CMBS holdings and other direct or co-managed fund investments in our real estate capital line of business.  These realized and unrealized losses totaled $92 million or $0.07 per common share.After the fourth quarter write-downs, we have a remaining carrying value of $29 million in our CMBS portfolio and $63 million in our other real estate related investments within the Real Estate Capital line of business. A significant positive item realized during the fourth quarter was the final settlement with the IRS of the tax years 1997 through 2006, which resulted in recording a credit to income taxes of $106 million or $0.12 per common share.Turning to Slide 5, for the fourth quarter of 2009, the company's taxable equivalent net interest income was $637 million compared to an adjusted $613 million in the third quarter. The net interest margin expanded 17 basis points to 3.04% for the fourth quarter compared to the adjusted margin for the third quarter of 2009. The company benefited from an improved funding mix as CDs, which were booked in 2008, continue to mature and reprice at current market rates or moved into lower cost deposit products such as NOW and money market accounts. We expect this trend to continue into 2010 as we experience additional maturities of CDs booked in 2008 or earlier. This repricing opportunity will continue to benefit the net interest margin in 2010. And with respect to the first quarter, we anticipate a five to 10 basis point further expansion of the net interest margin.Turning to Slide 6. During the fourth quarter, the company experienced a $4.3 billion decrease in average total loan balances compared to the third quarter of 2009 and a $12.8 billion decline compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. The decline in average balances continues to reflect soft loan demand for credit from consumers and businesses as they continue to delever, given the uncertain economic environment. The impact of our exit portfolios as we continue to reduce risk in the company and the elevated net charge-off levels we have experienced.The significant decline from last year is due in part to the build-up in balances experienced in the second half of 2008 as clients drew on their lines of credit given the uncertainties in the markets, only to repay them in 2009 as the financial markets improve. Until clients gain more confidence in the strength of the economic recovery, we expect loan demand to remain soft going into 2010. In addition, we will still face headwinds from the runoff of our exit portfolios and elevated net charge-offs. On a more encouraging point, over the past quarter within the Community Banking part of our operation, we have seen a pickup in our commercial loan pipeline reports from very depressed levels observed earlier in 2009.Turning to Slide 7. Average deposits were down approximately $600 million from the third quarter and up $3.6 billion from the same period one year ago. With respect to the individual deposit categories, we experienced an increase in DDA balances as commercial clients continue to hold higher balances to offset analyzed deposit service charges, and alternative short-term investment opportunities are less attractive, given the low rate environment.NOW and money market deposit account balances grew as money from maturing CDs shifted back into these accounts, as current CD rates look less attractive to clients. We also saw some of these funds leave our deposit categories as individuals look for higher yields elsewhere or invested the money in other products such as annuities.We expect this trend to continue into 2010, with a significant portion of money for maturing CDs either moving back into NOW and money market deposit accounts or moving to other forms of investment. As I mentioned earlier, the repricing of the CD book will also continue to benefit the net interest margin.Slide 8 shows the progress we have made over the past year to improve the liquidity position of the company. On this slide, you can see the change in assets and the improved funding mix of the company over the past year. As shown on this slide, for the fourth quarter of 2009, the loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 98%, a significant decrease from one year ago when it was 125%. In this loan-to-deposit ratio, we have also included our discontinued operations' balances.Turning to Slide 9. Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter increased to $708 million and represented 4.64% of average total loans compared to $587 million or 3.59% experienced in the third quarter of 2009. The increase from the third quarter was the result of charge-offs recorded on two specific customer relationships in the real estate capital line of business. The charge-offs on these two relationships accounted for $131 million of the total net charge-offs for the fourth quarter.We also continue to build reserves during the fourth quarter; however, at the lowest pace in over two years. At December 31, 2009, our reserve balance stood at a little over $2.5 billion and represented 4.31% of total loans. In addition, our reserve for unfunded commitments increased by $27 million during the fourth quarter to $121 million, and when combined with our loan loss reserve, total reserve for credit losses represented 4.52% of total loans at December 31, 2009.Turning to Slide 10. Our non-performing loans stood at $2.2 billion at December 31, 2009, and our non-performing assets were $2.5 billion. These totals represented decreases of $103 million and $298 million in non-performing loans and non-performing assets respectively from September 30, 2009. As shown in the summary of changes in non-performing loans on Page 27 of the earnings release today, the net inflow of non-performing loans continued to decrease in the fourth quarter, and while still running high, was at its lowest level of 2009. Also shown on Page 27 of the earnings release are our 30- to 89-day and 90-day or more past due loans, which continue to show improvement in the fourth quarter. These past due loans declined to their lowest level since the third quarter of 2008.Our coverage ratio of our loan loss reserves to non-performing loans increased to 116% at December 31, 2009. And when combined with our reserve for unfunded commitments to our total loan losses reserve, our total allowances for credit losses represented 121% coverage of non-performing loans at December 31, 2009. In addition, non-performing loans are carried at approximately 76% of their original face values and other real estate owned and other non-performing assets are carried at approximately 53% of their original face values. In total, we have recognized approximately $1 million in charge-offs and write-downs against these assets as of December 31, 2009.Slide 11 is a breakdown of the commercial loan portfolio by line of business. A couple of points to draw your attention to here are: First, you can see clearly the large increase in average commercial loan balances outstanding in 2008 and the subsequent decline that occurred in 2009. Also, on a quarterly basis, average balances declined significantly in the second half of 2009 as business liquidity improved and companies use this as an opportunity to refinance in the capital markets or simply use excess liquidity to pay down debt.Next, non-performing loans and net charge-offs in 2009 were driven by the Real Estate Capital line of business within National Banking. This line of business accounted for approximately 31% of the outstanding average commercial loan balances, 55% of the commercial non-performing loans and 66% of the commercial loan net charge-offs experienced in 2009. In the appendix, we have included additional schedules with respect to our various loan portfolios for your review.And now concluding with our capital ratios on Slide 12. At December 31, 2009, our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio was 7.56%. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 7.46% and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12.68%. All of our capital ratios remained strong. This, along with the company's improved liquidity, positions us well to weather the current credit cycle and to continue to serve our clients' needs. That concludes our remarks. And now I will turn the call back over to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A segment of our call. Operator?"

We continue to look at the returns that we get from different geographies and lines of business. We're constantly reviewing that. But we do think that there are going to be opportunities here beyond working through the FDIC troubled list. I happen to believe that there's going to be consolidation in the banking industry. And I think strong capital positions and good business models are going to be the winners there. As we have said, we're shifting our business mix a little bit away from the National Banking Group, primarily some of the National Consumer businesses that don't give us the hurdle rate returns that we need and investing that in the Community Bank, not only in the efforts to continue to be better self-funded, which we are now under 100% loan to deposit. But also, in the small business and middle market areas and looking at the synergies across the Key franchise, including using some of the products and services that the National Bank provides. So we don't think we're limited in terms of where those growth opportunities are. We do think that we've got this transition period where we're working way out of the exit portfolio and continuing to focus on growth, in effect, running to stay even. But as that exit portfolio winds its way down, we'll be able to see that kind of growth, primarily around our core relationship businesses, that again, we think is going to put us in a good position."

So I think if you look at, for example, in the fourth quarter, professional fees shot up as we address the number of issues that we faced in some of these assets, [Audio Gap] there are probably about $20 million higher here in the fourth quarter than what they were running, the reserve for unfunded commitments. In the fourth quarter, we actually made an adjustment based upon our prior three-year history here with respect to just loss given default ratio rates. And as a result of that, even though commitments really didn't change that much, and as Henry commented on earlier, criticized and classified actually improved during the fourth quarter. But our updated loss given default rates increased given that most recent history. So that drove some of that increase in the reserve fund part of commitments. Now of course as we have continued migration of credit going the other direction, at some point, that'll actually bring down that reserve. So that was $27 million in the fourth quarter. And then I think if we look at some other things, we've made some adjustments with respect to our pension here in the company, so the pension plan was froze effective as of January 1. So there won't be anymore new entrants. Still, it's a cash balance plan so there'll still be interest credited to the balances that are out there. But that'll also save us, going forward, anywhere $5 million to $10 million per quarter. And then I think if you look at just the other real estate costs, going back through time, we basically used to run in the $5 million-a-quarter range. That's been up as high as $50 million, it was $25 million in the fourth quarter. So over time, that will also normalize."

The underlying cash flows were actually holding up relatively well, but the structure was the Achilles' heel, and so we recognized that loss. The other transaction was a very large multi-bank, essentially residential, real estate transaction that was sort of a late-stage transaction. And we all know what's happened in the residential real estate side of things. A lot of the land associated with this deal is in the Southeast, and as we've said before, we've pretty aggressively attacked our residential real estate business and shrunk that portfolio.

The issue is how it ramps up during the rental intake. And we've been encouraged by a couple of things. One, the primary one is that absorption rates in virtually all states, even the four states that have been most materially impacted by the residential downturn have, held up pretty well. The negative is that concessions or free rent months or whatever, have clearly been a part of this process. So our expectation is that while we see some drift into NPL and delinquency, over time, our expectation is that most of this will reverse itself. So it's really more of a timing issue. The other comment I would make is, and this accounts for a portion of the increase in the NPL side for this quarter, is that we have done a number of TDRs troubled debt restructurings, and a good portion of our TDRs, which I would say you can find it in the press release but it's about 360 million for the fourth quarter, is an uptick in the NPLs. But our expectation as we have restructured those deals is they will come back into accruing over the next one, two or three quarters. So I think that's a little bit of a temporary aberration on the NPL site."

Looking at the various portfolios that are there, obviously, on the residential property side, which is down now to about $431 million at the end of the year, that one we're continuing to work our way down, sell properties, get cash and continue just liquidating on out of that particular book. The Marine and RV floor plan, that's one that's going to be dependent upon some refinancing taking place in the industry. So that will kind of go in ebbs and flows. We had good activity in the third quarter. It slows down typically this time of year, so fourth quarter. And then you should see some pickup obviously as we get into 2010 later in the spring. The commercial lease portfolio, there's a portion of that, this was over $1 billion that's going to be our leverage lease book. Those are very long lives. The rest of it has a shorter duration on it and will continue to pay down. But the leverage lease part of it is going to kind of go in ebbs and flows on that. Home equity - National Banking is just going to -- there's really so much of a market for these particular credits so you're talking about some of this just going to take a longer period of time to pay down. The same with the Marine. So if Marine activity picks up, if the economy picks up, we would expect that people would trade in boats and look for new boats and that would cause that prepayment speed to pick up. But this is certainly kind of the slow time of the year for that. And the other is just miscellaneous RV and other consumer loans and that's got a longer tail on it."

Jeff referenced earlier, some of our methodological changes as we review loss rates, particularly through this very difficult cycle, and we do a lot of back testing on our models, trying to get as close to quantifying the risk in our portfolio as we possibly can. So we look at all those factors. We look at, and as I said earlier, the upgrade/downgrade ratios and flows and migratory patterns. And that's how we reach our conclusions on how large the allowance should be. But most of those trends, as we said earlier, are moving in the right direction now, particularly through the fourth quarter for us.

Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp's First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is our CFO, Jeff Weeden; and available for the Q&A portion of our call are our leaders of community banking and national banking, Beth Mooney and Chris Gorman; our chief credit officer, Chuck Hyle; and our treasurer, Joe Vayda.
Now if you turn to the next slide. Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure statement. It covers both our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call today. 
Turning to slide 3, this morning, we announced the net loss from continuing operations of $98 million or $0.11 per common share. A stronger net interest margin, lower loan-loss provision and continued expense control resulted in a narrowing of KeyCorp's first quarter loss when compared to both the fourth quarter and the year-ago period.
Our net interest margin increased 15 basis points from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower funding costs and improved yields on loans. Expenses declined as a result of lower personnel expense, our efficiency initiative and a decrease in the provision for losses on lending-related commitments.
We also saw improvements in our key credit metrics, including net charge-offs, which declined $186 million, and non-performing loans, which were down $122 million from the prior quarter. Both benefited from continuous stabilization of the commercial loan portfolio. This was the second consecutive quarterly decrease in non-performing loans.
Our balance sheet continues to reflect strong capital, liquidity and reserve levels. At March 31, our Tier 1 common equity ratio was a strong 7.53%, and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12.96%. Both measures are up significantly from the year-ago period.
At the end of the first quarter, our loan-loss allowance was $2.4 billion and represented 4.34% of total loans and 117% of non-performing loans. Both of these ratios should maintain our position at or near the top quartile of our peer group. And as Jeff will discuss shortly, we have continued to maintain a strong liquidity and funding profile. 
Also, good progress was made on several other strategic fronts during the quarter. First, we filled a key role in our management team. Chris Gorman was promoted to head our National Banking business. Chris has been with the company for 19 years and was previously president of KeyBank Capital Markets, where he was instrumental in integrating Key's corporate and investment banking businesses. His breadth of experience, business acumen and leadership ability make him ideally suited for this role. 
And we've continued to invest in our core relationship businesses, including our 14-state branch network. We opened eight new branches in the first quarter and expect to open an additional 32 branches during the remainder of 2010. We also have plans to renovate approximately 85 existing branches this year, which is in addition to the 160 completed over the past two years. The new and modernized branches support Key's relationship strategy by leveraging the branch network to offer the full breadth of solutions, expertise, products and services that Key has to offer.
We have also been transforming our operations through programs and technology designed to enhance the plan experience and operate more effectively. One measure of success that we've seen in our customer satisfaction scores, including being named Customer Service Champ by BusinessWeek last year and the recent results from the American Customer Service Index, our customer satisfaction survey conducted by the University of Michigan. Key also received recognition from Corporate Insight's 2009 Bank Monitor which highlights firms that excel in online banking.
During the past year, we also created 157 business-intensive branches, which are staffed to serve our small business clients. Key's focus on the small business segment has resulted in our moving to number 15 in 2009 from 21 the previous year, among the country's major lenders in the SBA 7A small business financing program. This means that we have contributed to job creation in our communities and are well-positioned to serve our small business clients as the economy improves.
In national banking, we have continued to concentrate on reducing risks and sharpening our focus on specific segments and clients where we can be relevant. In our institutional business, we have aligned around four specific client segments and continue to invest in the people that can leverage our capabilities. We've reduced our exposure to commercial real estate and continue to look for opportunities to leverage our commercial real estate servicing capabilities. And we are emphasizing areas that have synergy with the client segments in the community bank such as equipment leasing and certain products offered through KeyBank Capital Markets. In our equipment leasing business, we are leveraging our scale and expertise to meet the needs of our clients across the organization from small business all the way up to our large corporate clients. 
And finally, in both business groups, as well as our support areas, we have continued to make progress on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization. Our staffing levels are down by over 2,600 FTEs over the past two years and we continue to implement initiatives that will better align our cost structure with our relationship-focused business strategies.
On Slide 4, we show our 2010 strategic priorities. The first is returning the company to profitability and setting the stage for long-term growth and stability. Maintaining a strong balance sheet also remains one of our top priorities, including having strong capital, reserves and liquidity. This gives us the flexibility to invest in our businesses and make new loans as the economy improves. We will also continue to strengthen our risk culture by fine-tuning our risk tolerances and increasing risk awareness throughout the organization.
And finally, we are positioning the company for growth by investing in our franchise and our people. Our first quarter results were encouraging and reflect the work that has been done to strengthen and reposition our company. I remain confident that we are emerging from this extraordinary period as a strong competitive company. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for review of our financial results. Jeff?"
329376,99508755,56858,"KeyCorp, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","KeyCorp","Executives","Thank you, Henry. Slide 5 provides a summary of the company's first quarter 2010 results from continuing operations. Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to our continuing operations. As Henry mentioned in his comments, for the",1720,"Thank you, Henry. Slide 5 provides a summary of the company's first quarter 2010 results from continuing operations. Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to our continuing operations. 
As Henry mentioned in his comments, for the first quarter, the company incurred a net loss of $0.11 per common share. This loss is significantly lower than the loss of $1.03 per common share for the same period one year ago and the $0.30 loss per common share for the fourth quarter of last year. The improvement in our results was driven by a lower provision for loan losses and improvement in our net interest margin and lower expenses. 
Turning to slide 6, for the first quarter of 2010, the company's taxable equivalent net interest income was $632 million, compared to $637 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $595 million for the same period one year ago. The net interest margin expanded 15 basis points to 3.19% for the first quarter, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, and is up 40 basis points from the same period one year ago. The company continues to benefit from an improved funding mix as maturing CDs continue to reprice to current market rates or move to lower cost deposit products such as NOW and money market accounts.
We expect this trend to continue during the balance of 2010 as we experience additional maturities of CDs booked in 2008 or earlier. These repricing opportunity, along with improved spreads on loan renewals, will continue to benefit the net interest margin. For the second quarter of 2010, we anticipate approximately five basis points of improvement in the net interest margin with additional improvement anticipated in the third and fourth quarters of this year. Keeping some pressure on the margin is the higher level of short-term liquidity and the general lack of loan demand.
Turning to Slide 7, during the first quarter, the company experienced an additional $2.9 billion decrease in average total loan balances compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The decline in average balances continues to reflect soft loan demand for clients, for credit for consumers and businesses as they continue to deleverage. Also impacting average loan balances is the impact of our exit portfolios as we continue to reduce risk in the company.
In addition, larger clients have had access to the public debt and equity capital markets in the past several months and are using this access as an opportunity to issue debt and/or equity, thus reducing bank lending demand. As a result of this and other items noted before, we expect average loan balances to continue to decline until business lending demand picks up.
Turning to Slide 8, average deposits were down approximately $2.3 billion from the fourth quarter and up $6.6 billion from the same period one year ago. The first quarter of the year is typically the softest period of time for deposit growth due to seasonal factors. Further impacting us in the first quarter of 2010 is our repricing of certificates of deposit, where we experienced a decline in balances of $2.4 billion.
With loan demand remaining soft and our liquidity remaining strong, we have adjusted our pricing on many of our deposit offerings during this low-rate period environment, the net effect of which has led to an improvement in the net interest margin. As I discussed when reviewing the net interest margin earlier, we expect to see further changes in the mix of our deposits over the balance of 2010, with a significant portion of the money from maturing CDs either moving back into NOW and money market deposit accounts or moving to other forms of investments such as annuities.
Slide 9 shows the much improved liquidity position of the company. For the time period shown on this slide, we have increased the size of the investment portfolio and the percentage of the balance sheet that is funded with deposits. For the first quarter of 2010, the loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 93%, a significant decrease from one year ago when it was 115%. In this loan-to-deposit ratio, we have also included our discontinued operations balances not funded with the securitization trust, which were placed on the balance sheet as of January 1, 2010. This securitization trust grossed up the balance sheet but did not have an impact on the liquidity of the company.
Turning to Slide 10, net charge-offs in the first quarter were $522 million and represented 3.67% of average total loans compared to $708 million or 4.64% of average total loans in the fourth quarter of 2009. Net charge-offs declined in the C&I and commercial real estate portfolios in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter net charge-offs included two large credits representing $131 million of the total for that period. As we have stated before, while we see net charge-offs remaining elevated in 2010, we do expect that they will trend downward as we progress throughout the year. 
The first quarter represented the first time since the second quarter of 2007 we have not increased the reserve for loan losses. During the first quarter, the reserve for loan losses declined by $109 million to a little over $2.4 billion. Even with this reduction, the reserve as a percentage of total loans increased to 4.34% at March 31, 2010, up from 4.31% at December 31, 2009. In addition, our reserve for unfunded commitments decreased by $2 million during the first quarter to $119 million. And when combined with our loan-loss reserve, total reserve for credit losses represented 4.55% of total loans at March 31, 2010.
Given our current reserve levels and our outlook for lower trending levels of net charge-offs, we see the potential for our reserve for credit losses to continue to trend downward. However, we would also caution that if the economic recovery should falter, which we are not currently forecasting, then this could change our outlook with respect to future reserve levels.
Turning to Slide 11, our non-performing loans stood at $2.1 billion at March 31, 2010, and our non-performing assets were $2.4 billion. These totals represented decreases of $122 million and $82 million in non-performing loans and non-performing assets, respectively from December 31, 2009. As shown in the summary of changes of non-performing loans on Page 25 of the earnings release today, we experienced another decrease in net inflows of non-performing loans during the first quarter, which represented our third consecutive quarterly decline in new inflows and the lowest level of new inflows since the fourth quarter of 2008.
Also shown on Page 24 of the earnings release are our 90-day or more past due and our 30- to 89-day past due loans. While the 90-day or more past due loans increased $103 million from December 31, 2009, the 30- to 89-day past due loans decreased by $294 million to its lowest level since the second quarter of 2007. Our coverage ratio of our loan loss reserve to non-performing loans increased to 117% at March 31, 2010, and when we combine our reserve for unfunded commitments to our loan-loss reserve, our total allowance for credit losses represented 123% coverage of non-performing loans at March 31, 2010. In addition, non-performing loans are carried at approximately 73% of the original face values and other real estate owned and other non-performing assets are carried at approximately 54% of their original face values.
Turning to Slide 12, our capital ratios remained strong at March 31, 2010. Our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio was 7.37%. Our tier 1 common equity ratio was 7.53% and our tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12.96%. 
On page 16 of our earnings release, we provide a reconciliation of our GAAP equity to our regulatory equity and the respective ratios. For regulatory capital purposes, $651 million of deferred tax assets are disallowed as of March 31, 2010, the effect of which reduced our regulatory capital ratios by approximately 78 basis points.
And before we go to our Q&A segment of our call, I want to review a new Slide with respect to how we are thinking about Key's business model and the targets we are setting for success at Key. On Slide 13, you will see the long-term targets we have set. We are already achieving some of these targets. Others will take additional time and work. For example, we have established that we will be a core-funded institution and target a loan-to-deposit ratio of 90% to 100%. At March 31, 2010, we were within this range. Another objective is to return to a more moderate risk profile. The metric that we are using here is targeting a net charge-off ratio of 40 to 50 basis points. Clearly, we are high on this measure and it will take some time before we achieve this objective.
On growing a high-quality diverse revenue stream, we have established two objectives here. First, achieve a net interest margin greater than 3.50%, and the other is maintaining non-interest income to total revenue of greater than 40%. While we are above the 40% level today of non-interest income to total revenue, we are below with respect to the net interest margin. Our trend with respect to the margin is positive and we expect to make further progress throughout 2010 on this front. 
A potential headwind on the non-interest income side is the changes to Reg E slated for the second half of the year. We estimate this could further reduce deposit service charges, once fully in effect by the end of the year, in the range of $50 million on an annualized basis. We are working on solutions to help offset part of this revenue loss.
Creating positive operating leverage will take our continued focus on achieving our Keyvolution savings, as well as growing our revenue streams. As of March 31, 2010, we have implemented $191 million of the targeted run rate savings towards our goal of achieving $300 million to $375 million in 2012. The end result of these goals should be a targeted return on average assets in the range of 1.0% to 1.25% for Key. That concludes our remarks and now I will turn the call back over to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A segment of our call. Operator?"

I find it difficult to comment on where the regulators are going to be. Our number one priority that we think will ensure that smooth transition to the right time to pay the TARP money back is to really be focused on sustainable profitability. And obviously, our improvement from the fourth quarter to the first quarter is setting up a trendline that, if things continue, will get us there sooner rather than later. But we still lost money in the first quarter. I'm very encouraged by the trendline, but we've stayed away from predicting when we would pay TARP back. To some degree, the better the company does and if that is reflected in our stock price, whatever the requirements are, will be less dilutive as the company performs better. So we're focusing on trying to put all of those things together as we look forward."

So the increase of the differential may be in small additional amounts, but it will be based on the performance of the company. So it's not one of those things that is fixed in nature. 
I think the other areas that we continue to look at, just like we outlined on that slide 13, is how do we make more of our cost variablized within the company? So we're really looking at those particular initiatives. I think some of the other things we're looking at is we have fewer people today so there are other costs that we're very focused on. While we're making investments in the community bank in the branch network that we have there, corporate space is being reduced. And so there are specific goals over the next three years to bring down corporate space fairly significantly. Those are other initiatives that are taking place, also, deploying technology more efficiently and effectively. 
So how do we leverage technology within the organization? I guess an example I would point to there, is what we were able to do with Teller 21 in the organization, bringing down a lot of our courier cost and improving our service quality to our customers. So those are things that we are continuing to focus on. Environmental costs, I think you can look at what our costs are associated, with other real estate expense, is still elevated within the organization. Typically, we use to run, say, in the $5 million range on the other real estate in any given quarter. That's been as high as $50 million, and this last quarter, it was $32 million. So those particular costs will be out there, and professional fees, collection-related costs, et cetera. So we'll continue to look at all of those particular areas."

So we look at that in totality as being not a negative, but actually a positive for us. We are asset-sensitive. We've had a number of AL swaps that have matured. We've got more that will mature, the receive fix-pay variable. So those are things that just continue to make us more asset-sensitive as we look out into the future. Again, we've stayed on our bond portfolio to Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie in the CMO area, so we stayed with the high quality. We tried to target, as Joe was talking about, a two-and-a-half to three-year duration is what we're putting on -- and yes, those will extend out. If the rates go up dramatically, they will go on out to four, four-and-a-half years. I think they cap out at up another 300 basis points at around five years in total. So we take all of that into account. We've modeled it on out. We do not believe that we are, in fact, making that ""trade-off"" that you're talking about. And yet all of us in the financial services have to look at how we're going to deploy the liquidity that we have at this particular point in time without doing anything ridiculous."

Joining me for today’s presentation is our CFO Jeff Weeden and available for the Q&A portion of our call, are our leaders of Community Banking and National Banking, Beth Mooney and Chris Gorman, our Chief Credit Officer Chuck Hyle and our Treasurer Joe Vayda.
Now if you turn to the next slide. Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure statement. It covers presentation materials and comments as well as the question and answer segment of our call today.
Turning to Slide 3, this morning we announced a net loss from continuing operations of $98 million or $0.11 per common share. A stronger net interest margin, lower loan loss provision and continued expense control resulted in a narrowing of KeyCorp’s first quarter loss when compared to both the fourth quarter and the year ago period.
Our net interest margin increased 15 basis points from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower funding costs and improved yields on loans. Expenses declined as a result of lower personnel expense, our efficiency initiative and a decrease in the provision for losses on lending related commitments.
We also saw improvements in our key credit metrics, including net charge offs, which declined $186 million and non-performing loans, which were down $122 million from the prior quarter. Both benefited from continued stabilization in the commercial loan portfolio. This was the second consecutive quarterly decrease in non-performing loans.
Our balance sheet continues to reflect strong capital with liquidity and reserve levels. At March 31, our tier one common equity ratio was a strong 7.53% and our tier one risk based capital ratio was 12.96%. Both measures are up significantly from the year ago period.
At the end of the first quarter, our loan loss allowance was $2.4 billion and represented 4.34% of total loss and 117% of non-performing loans. Both of these ratios should maintain our position at or near the top quartile of our peer group.
As Jeff will discuss shortly, we have continued to maintain a strong liquidity and funding profile. Also, good progress was made on several other strategic fronts during the quarter. First, we filled a key role in our management team. Chris Gorman was promoted to head our National Banking business.
Chris has been with the company for 19 years and was previously President of KeyBank Capital Markets where he was instrumental in innovating Key’s corporate and investment banking businesses. His breadth of experience, business acumen and leadership ability make him ideally suited for this role.
And we continue to invest in our core relationship businesses including our 14 state branch network. We opened eight new branches in the quarter and expect to open an additional 32 branches during the remainder of 2010.
We also have plans to renovate approximately 85 existing branches this year, which is in addition to the 160 completed over the past two years. The new and modernized branches support Key’s relationship strategy by leveraging the branch network to offer the full breadth of solutions, expertise, products and services that Key has to offer.
We’ve also been transforming our operations for programs and technology designed to enhance the client experience and operate more effectively. One measure of success that we’ve seen in our customer satisfaction scores including being named customer service champ by Business Week last year, and the recent results from the American Customer Service Index, a customer satisfaction survey conducted by the University of Michigan.
Key also received recognition from Corporate Insight’s 2009 Bank Monitor, which highlights firms that excel in online banking.
During the past year, we also created 157 business intensive branches, which are staffed to serve our small business clients. Key’s focus on the small business segment has resulted in our moving to number 15 in 2009 from 21 the previous year among the country’s major lenders in the SBA 7A Small Business Financing program.
This means that we have contributed to job creation in our communities and are well positioned to serve our small business clients as the economy improves.
In National Banking, we have continued to concentrate on reducing risk and sharpening our focus on specific segments and clients where we can be relevant. In our Institutional business, we’ve aligned around four specific planned segments and continue to invest in the people that can leverage our capabilities.
We reduced our exposure to commercial real estate and continue to look for opportunities to leverage our commercial real estate servicing capabilities. And, we are emphasizing areas that have synergy with the clients segments in the Community Bank such as equipment leasing, and certain products offered through KeyBank Capital Markets.
In our equipment leasing business, we are leveraging our scale and expertise to meet the needs of our clients across the organization from small business all the way up to our large corporate clients.
And finally, in both business groups, as well as our support areas, we have continued to make progress on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization. Our staffing levels are down by over 2,600 FTE’s over the past two years, and we continue to implement initiatives that will better align our cost structure with our relationship focused business strategies.
On Slide 4, we show our 2010 strategic priorities. The first is returning the company to profitability and setting the stage for long-term growth and stability. Maintaining a strong balance sheet also remains one of our top priorities including have strong capital reserves and liquidity. This give us the flexibility to invest in our businesses and make new loans as the economy improves.
We will also continue to strengthen our risk culture by fine-tuning our risk tolerances and increasing risk awareness throughout the organization.  And finally, we’re positioning the company for growth by investing in our franchise and our people. 
Our first quarter results were encouraging and reflect the work that has been done to strengthen and reposition our company. I remain confident that we are emerging from this extraordinary period as a strong, competitive company.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff for a review of our financial results.

Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to our continuing operations.As Henry mentioned in his comments, for the first quarter th",1747,"Slide 5 provides a summary of the company’s first quarter 2010 results from continuing operations. Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to our continuing operations.
As Henry mentioned in his comments, for the first quarter the company incurred a net loss of $0.11 per common share. This loss is significantly lower than the loss of $1.03 per common share for the same period one year ago, and the $0.30 loss per common share for the fourth quarter of last year.
The improvement in our results was driven by a lower provision for loan losses, an improvement in our net interest margin and lower expenses.
Turning to Slide 6, for the first quarter of 2010, the company’s taxable equivalent net interest income was $632 million compared to $637 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $595 million for the same period one year ago. The net interest margin expanded 15 basis points to 3.19% for the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, and is up 40 basis points from the same period one year ago.
The company continues to benefit from an improved funding mix as the maturing CD’s continue to re-price to current market rates or move to lower cost deposit products such as Now and Money Market accounts.
We expect this trend to continue during the balance of 2010 as we experience additional maturities of CD’s booked in 2008 or earlier. This re-pricing opportunity, along with improved spreads on loan renewals will continue to benefit the net interest margin.
For the second quarter of 2010, we anticipate approximately five basis points of improvement in the net interest margin with additional improvement anticipated in the third and fourth quarters of this year. Keeping some pressure on the margin is the higher level of short-term liquidity and the general lack of loan demand.
Turning to Slide 7, during the first quarter the company experienced an additional $2.9 billion decrease in average total loan balances compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The decline in average balances continues to reflect soft loan demand for consumers and business as they continue to de-leverage.
Also impacting average loan balances is the impact of our exit portfolio’s as we continue to reduce risk in the company. In addition, larger clients have had access to the Public Debt and Equity Capital markets in the past several months and are using this access an opportunity to issue debt and/or equity, thus reducing bank lending demand.
As a result of this and other items noted before, we expect average loan balances to continue to decline until business lending demand picks up.
Turning to Slide 8, average deposits were down approximately $2.3 billion from the fourth quarter and up $.6 billion from the same period one year ago. The first quarter of the year is typically the softest period of time for deposit growth due to seasonal factors. Further impacting us in the first quarter of 2010 is our re-pricing of Certificates of Deposits where we experienced a decline in balances of $2.4 billion.
With loan demand remaining soft and our liquidity remaining strong, we have adjusted our pricing on many of our deposit offerings during this low rate period environment, the net effect of which has led to an improvement in the net interest margin.
As I discussed when reviewing the net interest margin earlier, we expect to see further changes in the mix of our deposits over the balance of 2010 with a significant portion of the money from maturing CD’s either moving back into Now and Money Market deposit accounts or moving to other forms of investments such as annuities.
Slide 9 shows the much improved liquidity position of the company. Over the time period shown on this slide, we have increased the size of the investment portfolio and the percentage of the balance sheet that is funded with deposits. For the first quarter of 2010, the loan to deposit ratio stood at 93%, a significant decrease from one year ago when it was 115%.
In this loan to deposit ratio, we have also included our discontinued operations balances not funded with the securitization trust which were placed on the balance sheet as of January 1, 2010. These securitizations trusts grossed up the balance sheet but did not have an impact on the liquidity of the company.
Turning to Slide 10, net charge offs in the first quarter were $522 million and represented 3.67% of average total loans compared to $708 million or 4.64% of average total loans in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Net charge offs declined in the CNI and commercial real estate portfolios in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter net charge offs included two large credits representing $131 million of the total for that period.
As we have stated before, while we see net charge offs remaining elevated in 2010, we do expect that they will trend downward as we progress throughout the year.
In the first quarter, represented the first time since the second quarter of 2007 we have not increased the reserve for loan losses. During the first quarter, the reserve for loan losses declined by $109 million to a little over $2.4 billion. Even with this reduction, the reserve as a percentage of total loans increased to 4.34% at March 31, 2010, up from 4.31% at December 31, 2009.
In addition, our reserve for unfunded commitments decreased by $2 million during the first quarter to $119 million, and when combined with our loan loss reserve, total reserve for credit losses represented 4.55% of total loans at March 31, 2010.
Given our current reserve levels and our outlook for lower trending levels of net charge offs, we see the potential for our reserve for credit losses to continue to trend downward. However, we would also caution that if the economic recovery should falter, which we are not currently forecasting, then this could change our outlook with respect to future reserve levels.
Turning to Slide 11, our non performing loans stood at $2.1 billion at March 31, 2010 and our non performing assets were $2.4 billion. These totals represent a decrease of $122 million and $82 million in non performing loans and non performing assets respectively from December 31, 2009.
As shown in the summary of changes in non performing loans on Page 25 of the earnings release today, we experienced another decrease in net in-flows of non performing loans during the first quarter, which represented our third consecutive quarterly decline in new in-flows and the lowest level of new in-flows since the fourth quarter of 2008.
Also shown on Page 24 of the earnings release, are our 90 day or more past due and our 30 to 89 day past due loans. While the 90 day or more past due loans increased $103 million from December 31, 2009, the 30 to 89 days past due loans decreased by $294 million to its lowest level since the second quarter of 2007.
Our coverage ratio of our loan loss reserve to non performing loans increased to 117% at March 31, 2010 and when we combine our reserve for unfunded commitments to our loan loss reserve, our total allowance for credit losses represented 123% coverage of non performing at March 31, 2010.
In addition, non performing loans are carried at approximately 73% of their original face values and other real estate owned and other non performing assets are carried at approximately 54% of their original face values.
Turning to Slide 12, our capital ratios remain strong at March 31, 2010. Our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio was 7.37%. Our tier one common equity ratio was 7.53% and our tier one risk based capital ratio was 12.96%.
On Page 16 of our earnings release, we provided a reconciliation of our GAAP equity to our regulatory equity and the respective ratios.
For regulatory capital purposes, $651 million of deferred tax assets are disallowed as of March 31, 2010, the effect of which reduced our regulatory capital ratios by approximately 78 basis points.
Before we go to our Q&A segment of our call, I want to review a new slide with respect to how we are thinking about Key’s business model and the targets we are setting for success at Key.
On Slide 13, you will see the long term targets we have set. We are already achieving some of these targets. Others will take additional time and work. For example, we have established that we will be a core funded institution and target a loan to deposit ratio of 90% to 100%. At March 31, 2010, we were within this range.
Another objective is to return to a more moderate risk profile. The metric we are using here is targeting a net charge off ratio of 40 to 50 basis points. Clearly, we are high on this measure and it will take some time before we achieve this objective.
On growing a high quality diverse revenue stream, we have established two objectives here. First, achieve a net interest margin greater than 3.50% and the other is maintaining non interest income to total revenue to greater than 40%.
While we are above the 40% level today of non interest income to total revenue, we are below with respect to the net interest margin. Our trend with respect to the margin is positive and we expect to make further progress throughout 2010 on this front. A potential headwind on the non interest income side is the changes to Reg E slated for the second half of the year.
We estimate this could further reduce deposit service charges once fully in effect by the end of the year in the range of $50 million on an annualized basis. We are working on solutions to help offset part of this revenue loss.
Creating positive operating leverage will take our continued focus on achieving our Key savings as well as growing our revenue streams. As of March 31, 2010, we have implemented $191 million of the targeted run rate savings towards our goal of achieving $300 million to $375 million in 20112.
The end result of those should be a targeted return on average assets in the range of 1.0% to 1.25% for Key.
That concludes our remarks, and now I will turn the call back over to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A segment of our call.

The other thing that we’re going to do is, we’re going to take that business and migrate it even more to a middle market mid cap kind of business that will then interface really well with what Beth is doing in the Community Bank.

Traditional borrowers and companies and middle sized corporations that will have borrowing needs as the economy to expand, but as part of this economic cycle we’ve seen de-leveraging, a building up of liquidity and cash and are borrowing in our compliant base.
So as the economy improves and as those cash reserves get drawn down, I would see, although none of us now when to call that inflection point, as our economy expands I think borrowing will expand within our existing client base because we’ve  had pretty significant pay downs.
And then we obviously will work with Chris and our market to continue to acquire and expand our client relationships.

And obviously our improvement from the fourth quarter to the first quarter is setting up a trend line that if things continue will get us there sooner rather than later. But we still lost money in the first quarter. 
I’m very encouraged by the trend line, but we’ve stayed away from predicting when we would pay TARP back. To some degree, the better the company does, and if that is reflected in our stock price, whatever the requirements are, we’ll be less dilutive as the company performs better.

I think the other areas that we continue to look at, just like we outlined on Slide 13, is how do we make more of our cost variablized within the company. So we’re really looking at those particular initiatives.
I think some of the other things we’re looking at is, we have fewer people today, so there are other costs that we’re very focused on. We’re making investments in the Community Bank and the branch network that we have there, corporate space is being reduced. So there are specific goals over the next three years to bring down corporate space fairly significantly.
Those are other initiatives that are taking place. Also deploying technology more efficiently and effectively, so how do we leverage technology within the organization. I guess an example I would point to there is what we were able to do with Teller 21 in the organization, bringing down a lot of our courier costs and improving our service quality to our customers.
So those are things that we are continuing to focus on. Environmental costs, I think you can look at what our costs are associated with, other real estate expense is still elevated within the organization. Typically it used to run say in the $5 million range on other real estate in any given quarter. That’s been as high as $50 million and this last quarter it was $32 million.
So those particular costs will be out there. Professional fees, collection related costs, etc. so we’ll continue to look at all those particular areas.

The one that Jeff mentioned earlier, looks like it might be moving slightly in the other direction, not 90 plus delinquency.

Have we traded off, and not just KeyCorp, but a lot of banks, have we traded off credit risk for interest rate risk, because you look at your securities portfolio now from a year ago it’s doubled in size. It seems likely that if this economy remains healthy and strong, rates will go higher. No one knows for sure how high, but what if we had a 5% loan rate next spring or Timco was looking for something I think even more dramatic. Do we run the risk of having to deal with interest rate problems to the bond portfolio a year from now so we’ve traded off credit risk for interest rate risk? Can you alleave our fears of that somehow?

We’ve had a number of AL swaps that have matured. We’ve got more that will mature, that receive fixed pay variable. So those are things that just continue to make us more asset sensitive as we look out into the future.
Again, we stayed on our bond portfolio to Fanny, Freddie and Jennie in the CMO area, so we stay with high quality. We try to target as Joe was talking about at two and a half to three year duration, is what we’re quoting on, and yes those will all extend out if the rates go up dramatically.
They will go on out to four to four and a half years. I think they cap out at up another 300 basis points at around five years in total. So we take all of that into account. We model it on out. We do not believe that we are in fact making that ‘trade off’ that you’re talking about. And yet, all of us in financial services have to look at how we’re going to deploy liquidity that we have at this particular point in time without doing anything ridiculous.

Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp's First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is our CFO, Jeff Weeden; and available for the Q&A portion of our call are our leaders of Community Banking and National Banking, Beth Mooney and Chris Gorman; our Chief Credit Officer, Chuck Hyle; and our Treasurer, Joe Vayda.
Now if you turn to the next slide. Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure statement. It covers both our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call today. 
Turning to slide 3, this morning, we announced the net loss from continuing operations of $98 million or $0.11 per common share. A stronger net interest margin, lower loan-loss provision and continued expense control resulted in a narrowing of KeyCorp's first quarter loss when compared to both the fourth quarter and the year-ago period.
Our net interest margin increased 15 basis points from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower funding costs and improved yields on loans. Expenses declined as a result of lower personnel expense, our efficiency initiative and a decrease in the provision for losses on lending-related commitments.
We also saw improvements in our key credit metrics, including net charge-offs, which declined $186 million, and non-performing loans, which were down $122 million from the prior quarter. Both benefited from continuous stabilization of the commercial loan portfolio. This was the second consecutive quarterly decrease in non-performing loans.
Our balance sheet continues to reflect strong capital, liquidity and reserve levels. At March 31, our Tier 1 common equity ratio was a strong 7.53%, and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12.96%. Both measures are up significantly from the year-ago period.
At the end of the first quarter, our loan-loss allowance was $2.4 billion and represented 4.34% of total loans and 117% of non-performing loans. Both of these ratios should maintain our position at or near the top quartile of our peer group. And as Jeff will discuss shortly, we have continued to maintain a strong liquidity and funding profile. 
Also, good progress was made on several other strategic fronts during the quarter. First, we filled a key role in our management team. Chris Gorman was promoted to head our National Banking business. Chris has been with the company for 19 years and was previously president of KeyBanc Capital Markets, where he was instrumental in integrating Key's corporate and investment banking businesses. His breadth of experience, business acumen and leadership ability make him ideally suited for this role. 
And we've continued to invest in our core relationship businesses, including our 14-state branch network. We opened eight new branches in the first quarter and expect to open an additional 32 branches during the remainder of 2010. We also have plans to renovate approximately 85 existing branches this year, which is in addition to the 160 completed over the past two years. The new and modernized branches support Key's relationship strategy by leveraging the branch network to offer the full breadth of solutions, expertise, products and services that Key has to offer.
We have also been transforming our operations through programs and technology designed to enhance the plan experience and operate more effectively. One measure of success that we've seen in our customer satisfaction scores, including being named Customer Service Champ by BusinessWeek last year and the recent results from the American Customer Service Index, our customer satisfaction survey conducted by the University of Michigan. Key also received recognition from Corporate Insight's 2009 Bank Monitor which highlights firms that excel in online banking.
During the past year, we also created 157 business-intensive branches, which are staffed to serve our small business clients. Key's focus on the small business segment has resulted in our moving to number 15 in 2009 from 21 the previous year, among the country's major lenders in the SBA 7A small business financing program. This means that we have contributed to job creation in our communities and are well-positioned to serve our small business clients as the economy improves.
In national banking, we have continued to concentrate on reducing risks and sharpening our focus on specific segments and clients where we can be relevant. In our institutional business, we have aligned around four specific client segments and continue to invest in the people that can leverage our capabilities. We've reduced our exposure to commercial real estate and continue to look for opportunities to leverage our commercial real estate servicing capabilities. And we are emphasizing areas that have synergy with the client segments in the community bank such as equipment leasing and certain products offered through KeyBanc Capital Markets. In our equipment leasing business, we are leveraging our scale and expertise to meet the needs of our clients across the organization from small business all the way up to our large corporate clients. 
And finally, in both business groups, as well as our support areas, we have continued to make progress on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization. Our staffing levels are down by over 2,600 FTEs over the past two years and we continue to implement initiatives that will better align our cost structure with our relationship-focused business strategies.
On Slide 4, we show our 2010 strategic priorities. The first is returning the company to profitability and setting the stage for long-term growth and stability. Maintaining a strong balance sheet also remains one of our top priorities, including having strong capital, reserves and liquidity. This gives us the flexibility to invest in our businesses and make new loans as the economy improves. We will also continue to strengthen our risk culture by fine-tuning our risk tolerances and increasing risk awareness throughout the organization.
And finally, we are positioning the company for growth by investing in our franchise and our people. Our first quarter results were encouraging and reflect the work that has been done to strengthen and reposition our company. I remain confident that we are emerging from this extraordinary period as a strong competitive company. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for review of our financial results. Jeff?"
329376,99508755,57095,"KeyCorp, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","KeyCorp","Executives","Thank you, Henry. Slide 5 provides a summary of the company's first quarter 2010 results from continuing operations. Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to our continuing operations. As Henry mentioned in his comments, for the",1720,"Thank you, Henry. Slide 5 provides a summary of the company's first quarter 2010 results from continuing operations. Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to our continuing operations. 
As Henry mentioned in his comments, for the first quarter, the company incurred a net loss of $0.11 per common share. This loss is significantly lower than the loss of $1.03 per common share for the same period one year ago and the $0.30 loss per common share for the fourth quarter of last year. The improvement in our results was driven by a lower provision for loan losses and improvement in our net interest margin and lower expenses. 
Turning to Slide 6, for the first quarter of 2010, the company's taxable equivalent net interest income was $632 million, compared to $637 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $595 million for the same period one year ago. The net interest margin expanded 15 basis points to 3.19% for the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, and is up 40 basis points from the same period one year ago. The company continues to benefit from an improved funding mix as maturing CDs continue to reprice to current market rates or move to lower cost deposit products such as NOW and money market accounts.
We expect this trend to continue during the balance of 2010 as we experience additional maturities of CDs booked in 2008 or earlier. These repricing opportunity, along with improved spreads on loan renewals, will continue to benefit the net interest margin. For the second quarter of 2010, we anticipate approximately five basis points of improvement in the net interest margin with additional improvement anticipated in the third and fourth quarters of this year. Keeping some pressure on the margin is the higher level of short-term liquidity and the general lack of loan demand.
Turning to Slide 7, during the first quarter, the company experienced an additional $2.9 billion decrease in average total loan balances compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The decline in average balances continues to reflect soft loan demand for clients, for credit for consumers and businesses as they continue to deleverage. Also impacting average loan balances is the impact of our exit portfolios as we continue to reduce risk in the company.
In addition, larger clients have had access to the public debt and equity capital markets in the past several months and are using this access as an opportunity to issue debt and/or equity, thus reducing bank lending demand. As a result of this and other items noted before, we expect average loan balances to continue to decline until business lending demand picks up.
Turning to Slide 8, average deposits were down approximately $2.3 billion from the fourth quarter and up $6.6 billion from the same period one year ago. The first quarter of the year is typically the softest period of time for deposit growth due to seasonal factors. Further impacting us in the first quarter of 2010 is our repricing of certificates of deposits, where we experienced a decline in balances of $2.4 billion.
With loan demand remaining soft and our liquidity remaining strong, we have adjusted our pricing on many of our deposit offerings during this low-rate period environment, the net effect of which has led to an improvement in the net interest margin. As I discussed when reviewing the net interest margin earlier, we expect to see further changes in the mix of our deposits over the balance of 2010, with a significant portion of the money from maturing CDs either moving back into NOW and money market deposit accounts or moving to other forms of investments such as annuities.
Slide 9 shows the much improved liquidity position of the company. For the time period shown on this slide, we have increased the size of the investment portfolio and the percentage of the balance sheet that is funded with deposits. For the first quarter of 2010, the loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 93%, a significant decrease from one year ago when it was 115%. In this loan-to-deposit ratio, we have also included our discontinued operations balances not funded with the securitization trust, which were placed on the balance sheet as of January 1, 2010. This securitization trust grossed up the balance sheet but did not have an impact on the liquidity of the company.
Turning to Slide 10, net charge-offs in the first quarter were $522 million and represented 3.67% of average total loans compared to $708 million or 4.64% of average total loans in the fourth quarter of 2009. Net charge-offs declined in the C&I and commercial real estate portfolios in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter net charge-offs included two large credits representing $131 million of the total for that period. As we have stated before, while we see net charge-offs remaining elevated in 2010, we do expect that they will trend downward as we progress throughout the year. 
The first quarter represented the first time since the second quarter of 2007 we have not increased the reserve for loan losses. During the first quarter, the reserve for loan losses declined by $109 million to a little over $2.4 billion. Even with this reduction, the reserve as a percentage of total loans increased to 4.34% at March 31, 2010, up from 4.31% at December 31, 2009. In addition, our reserve for unfunded commitments decreased by $2 million during the first quarter to $119 million. And when combined with our loan-loss reserve, total reserve for credit losses represented 4.55% of total loans at March 31, 2010.
Given our current reserve levels and our outlook for lower trending levels of net charge-offs, we see the potential for our reserve for credit losses to continue to trend downward. However, we would also caution that if the economic recovery should falter, which we are not currently forecasting, then this could change our outlook with respect to future reserve levels.
Turning to Slide 11, our non-performing loans stood at $2.1 billion at March 31, 2010, and our non-performing assets were $2.4 billion. These totals represented decreases of $122 million and $82 million in non-performing loans and non-performing assets, respectively from December 31, 2009. As shown in the summary of changes of non-performing loans on Page 25 of the earnings release today, we experienced another decrease in net inflows of non-performing loans during the first quarter, which represented our third consecutive quarterly decline in new inflows and the lowest level of new inflows since the fourth quarter of 2008.
Also shown on Page 24 of the earnings release are our 90-day or more past due and our 30- to 89-day past due loans. While the 90-day or more past due loans increased $103 million from December 31, 2009, the 30- to 89-day past due loans decreased by $294 million to its lowest level since the second quarter of 2007. Our coverage ratio of our loan loss reserve to non-performing loans increased to 117% at March 31, 2010, and when we combine our reserve for unfunded commitments to our loan-loss reserve, our total allowance for credit losses represented 123% coverage of non-performing loans at March 31, 2010. In addition, non-performing loans are carried at approximately 73% of the original face values and other real estate owned and other non-performing assets are carried at approximately 54% of their original face values.
Turning to Slide 12, our capital ratios remained strong at March 31, 2010. Our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio was 7.37%. Our tier 1 common equity ratio was 7.53% and our tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12.96%. 
On page 16 of our earnings release, we provide a reconciliation of our GAAP equity to our regulatory equity and the respective ratios. For regulatory capital purposes, $651 million of deferred tax assets are disallowed as of March 31, 2010, the effect of which reduced our regulatory capital ratios by approximately 78 basis points.
And before we go to our Q&A segment of our call, I want to review a new Slide with respect to how we are thinking about Key's business model and the targets we are setting for success at Key. On Slide 13, you will see the long-term targets we have set. We are already achieving some of these targets. Others will take additional time and work. For example, we have established that we will be a core-funded institution and target a loan-to-deposit ratio of 90% to 100%. At March 31, 2010, we were within this range. Another objective is to return to a more moderate risk profile. The metric that we are using here is targeting a net charge-off ratio of 40 to 50 basis points. Clearly, we are high on this measure and it will take some time before we achieve this objective.
On growing a high-quality diverse revenue stream, we have established two objectives here. First, achieve a net interest margin greater than 3.50%, and the other is maintaining non-interest income to total revenue of greater than 40%. While we are above the 40% level today of non-interest income to total revenue, we are below with respect to the net interest margin. Our trend with respect to the margin is positive and we expect to make further progress throughout 2010 on this front. 
A potential headwind on the non-interest income side is the changes to Reg E slated for the second half of the year. We estimate this could further reduce deposit service charges, once fully in effect by the end of the year, in the range of $50 million on an annualized basis. We are working on solutions to help offset part of this revenue loss.
Creating positive operating leverage will take our continued focus on achieving our Keyvolution savings, as well as growing our revenue streams. As of March 31, 2010, we have implemented $191 million of the targeted run rate savings towards our goal of achieving $300 million to $375 million in 2012. The end result of these goals should be a targeted return on average assets in the range of 1.0% to 1.25% for Key. That concludes our remarks and now I will turn the call back over to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A segment of our call. Operator?"

So we're really looking at those particular initiatives. I think some of the other things we're looking at is we have fewer people today so there are other costs that we're very focused on. While we're making investments in the community bank in the branch network that we have there, corporate space is being reduced. And so there are specific goals over the next three years to bring down corporate space fairly significantly. Those are other initiatives that are taking place, also, deploying technology more efficiently and effectively.  So how do we leverage technology within the organization? I guess an example I would point to there, is what we were able to do with Teller 21 in the organization, bringing down a lot of our courier cost and improving our service quality to our customers. So those are things that we are continuing to focus on. Environmental costs, I think you can look at what our costs are associated, with other real estate expense, is still elevated within the organization. Typically, we use to run, say, in the $5 million range on the other real estate in any given quarter. That's been as high as $50 million, and this last quarter, it was $32 million.

We saw a little bit of improvement in the marine portfolio, but that's pretty tiny in the great scheme of things. Again, I think this is much more of a secular trend. And, certainly, almost all of our credit statistics have shown good improvement and good momentum. Particularly, our early stage delinquencies have come down quite dramatically. And even the one that Jeff mentioned earlier that looks like it might be moving slightly in the other direction, 90-plus delinquency, that was almost fully accounted for by maturity delinquency, not underlying performance delinquency. In other words, we have several assets that continue to perform, but the maturity came and we're in the process of either of restructuring, or in a couple of cases, have the take-outs that just happened to fall a little bit after the end of the quarter, so I think even that statistic is moving in the right direction. So I would call it considerably more than seasonality."

It seems likely that if this economy remains healthy and strong, rates will go higher. No one knows for sure how high. But what if we had a 5% loan rate next spring --and PIMCO is looking for something even, I think, more dramatic -- do we run the risk of having to deal with interest rate problems to the bond portfolio a year from now, so we've traded off credit risks for interest rate risks?

But I think as we look at it, if rates ended up moving on up, as you've outlined to 5%, it should be a much stronger overall economy, which would also bode well for, then, improved loan demand and pricing. So we look at that in totality as being not a negative, but actually a positive for us. We are asset-sensitive. We've had a number of AL swaps that have matured. We've got more that will mature, the receive fix-pay variable. So those are things that just continue to make us more asset-sensitive as we look out into the future. Again, we've stayed on our bond portfolio to Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie in the CMO area, so we stayed with the high quality. We tried to target, as Joe was talking about, a two-and-a-half to three-year duration is what we're putting on -- and yes, those will extend out. If the rates go up dramatically, they will go on out to four, four-and-a-half years. I think they cap out at up another 300 basis points at around five years in total. So we take all of that into account. We've modeled it on out. We do not believe that we are, in fact, making that ""trade-off"" that you're talking about. And yet all of us in the financial services have to look at how we're going to deploy the liquidity that we have at this particular point in time without doing anything ridiculous."

Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is our CFO, Jeff Weeden; and available for the Q&A portion of our call are our leaders of Community Banking and National Banking, Beth Mooney and Chris Gorman; our Chief Risk Officer, Chuck Hyle; and our Treasurer, Joe Vayda.
If you turn to Slide 2, this is our forward-looking disclosure statement. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call today.
Now if you turn to Slide 3. This morning we announced second quarter net income from continuing operations of $56 million or $0.06 per common share. The improvement over the prior quarter was due to a lower provision for loan losses, higher fee income and well-controlled expenses. Overall, the results are encouraging and the return to profitability represents an important step forward for our company.
Despite the challenges that our industry faces in terms of the pace of the recovery, and other environmental factors such as regulatory reform, I am confident that we are taking the necessary actions to position the company for better long-term performance.
I was especially pleased by the continued improvement in credit quality, which was the major contributor to our improved financial results for the second quarter. Credit quality improved across the majority of loan portfolios in Community Banking and National Banking, which contributed to the positive net income reported for both groups.
Net charge-offs declined by $87 million, and nonperforming loans decreased by $362 million from the previous quarter. This was the third consecutive quarterly decline in nonperforming loans.  Delinquency trends and the inflow of new nonperforming loans were also favorable. Although net charge-offs will likely to remain elevated for the remainder of 2010, we expect to show further progress in the future quarters.
Our balance sheet continues to reflect strong capital liquidity and reserve levels. At June 30, our Tier 1 common equity ratio was a strong 8.01%, and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 13.55%. Both measures are up from the first quarter and the year-ago period.
At the end of the second quarter, our loan-loss allowance was $2.2 billion and represented 4.16% of total loans and 130% of nonperforming loans. Both of these ratios should maintain our position near the top quartile of our peer group --
Being a core-funded institution remains an important strategic imperative. And as Jeff Weeden will discuss in his remarks, we continue to operate from a position of strength. Our strong capital and liquidity positions enable the company to support the borrowing needs of our clients. Although loan demand remains weak, the company originated approximately $12.9 billion in new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses during the first half of the year.
The final item on our strategic update slide, investing in our Core Relationship businesses, has been a consistent theme for Key. Having a strong balance sheet as a solid foundation, we are continuing to position the company to take advantage of the gradually improving economy. In the Community Bank, our largest investment is in our 14-state branch network. We opened 18 new branches in the first half of 2010 and expect to open an additional 22 branches during the remainder of the year. The deposit generation and overall profitability of our new branches have been in line with our expectations.
In addition, we continue to modernize our existing branches and align staffing with the needs of our communities that we serve. We have designated 225 business-intensive branches, which are staffed to serve our small business clients. We are also a significant participant in the SBA small business loan program.
In the first half of 2010, we also experienced good growth in Private Banking and Key Investment Services, our branch-based investment group. Both areas represent good opportunities for continued growth. Our improved performance in National Banking is largely driven by improving credit trends and the work we have done to reduce our risk profile. But we've also made significant progress in sharpening our focus on targeted client segments and investing in human capital and our noncapital-intensive businesses.
During the first half of the year, KeyBank Capital Markets participated in 30 equity transactions that generated over $25 million in fees. We have also seen improvement in the M&A Advisory business since the third quarter of 2009 as more liquidity has returned to the market.  And we continue to emphasize areas that have synergy with client segments in the Community Bank, such as equipment leasing and certain products offered by the KeyBank Capital Markets.
Our second quarter results were an important step forward for us and we should continue to benefit from the hard work that's been done to improve our risk profile and reposition the company. I remain confident in Key's future and our ability to serve our clients and make progress towards our long-term targets. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for a review of our financial results. Jeff?"
329376,107916604,68494,"KeyCorp, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","KeyCorp","Executives","Thank you, Henry. Slide 4 provides a summary of the company's second quarter 2010 results from Continuing Operations. Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to our Continuing Operations. As Henry mentioned in his comments, for the",1779,"Thank you, Henry. Slide 4 provides a summary of the company's second quarter 2010 results from Continuing Operations. Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to our Continuing Operations. As Henry mentioned in his comments, for the second quarter the company earned a net profit of $0.06 per common share. This was a result of lower provision for loan losses as both net charge-offs and nonperforming loans decreased from the first quarter levels. In addition, the company showed improved pre-provision net revenue as a result of higher noninterest revenue and well-controlled expenses.
The second quarter profit compares to a net loss of $0.68 per share for the same period one year ago and an $0.11 loss per common share for the first quarter of this year. While not noted on this slide, the company's book value and tangible book value increased during the second quarter to $9.19 and $8.10 per share, respectively.
Turning to Slide 5. For the second quarter of 2010, the company's taxable equivalent net interest income was $623 million compared to $632 million for the first quarter of 2010 and $591 million for the same period one year ago. The net interest margin contracted two basis points to 3.17% for the second quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010. However, it is up 40 basis points from the same period one year ago.
The benefit from repricing maturing CDs was more heavily weighted to the last half of the second quarter and will provide us with some improvement to the net interest margin in the third quarter of this year. In addition, during the third quarter, we have approximately $2.8 billion in CDs maturing at an average cost of 4.51%, which were originated
prior to 2009. 
On the other side of the balance sheet, we experienced continued run-off of loan balances, which led to higher levels of short-term liquidity on average for the second quarter. These funds have been redeployed into the Investment portfolio, which will benefit net interest income for the third quarter. With respect to the third quarter, we look for the net interest margin to expand to the mid-3.20% range.
Turning to Slide 6. During the second quarter, the company experienced a $2.6 billion decrease in average total loan balances compared to the first quarter of 2010. The decline in average balances continues to reflect soft loan demand for credit as consumers and businesses continue to deleverage and wait for more clarity on the underlying strength of the economic expansion and employment. Also impacting average loan balances is the impact of our Exit portfolios as we continue to reduce risk in the company. We do not anticipate loan demand to improve until we see greater confidence on the part of consumers and businesses regarding the overall strength of the economy and an improved employment outlook. While conditions are better than what they were last year at this time, average loan balances in our Non-exit portfolios are expected to continue to decline until business lending demand picks up.
Turning to Slide 7. We experienced an increase of $1.3 billion in the combined average balances of demand deposit, NOW, money market deposit accounts and regular savings accounts during the second quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2010. And these balances are up $4.5 billion from the same period one year ago. As we have been discussing for the past few quarters, we continue to experience run-off in our CD book, which declined $2.3 billion as higher-yielding certificates of deposits mature and clients look for other alternatives for investing in the current low-rate environment.
As I mentioned in the margin discussion, we experienced heavy maturities of CDs in the second half of the second quarter. Many of these CDs were originally booked prior to 2009 when liquidity was much tighter than it is today. The third quarter will be the last of the heavy-maturity quarters remaining with respect to the CDs originated
prior to 2009. During the third quarter, we have approximately $2.8 billion of these higher-yielding rate CDs maturing. These maturities will drop off to approximately $800 million of higher-rate CDs in the fourth quarter of this year.
In total, average deposits declined $1 billion during the second quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010. However, the mix of our deposits improved, which we believe will benefit the net interest margin in the second half of the year.
Slide 8 shows the strong liquidity position of the company. With loan demand remaining weak, we have increased the size of the Investment portfolio and reduced our wholesale funding position over the past year. For the second quarter of 2010, the loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 93%, consistent with the first quarter of 2010 and an improvement from one year ago when it was 107%. In this loan-to-deposit ratio, we have also included our discontinued operations balances not funded with securitization trusts. The securitization trusts gross up the balance sheet but do not have an impact on the liquidity of the company.
Turning to Slide 9. Net charge-offs for the second quarter were $435 million and represented 3.18% of average total loans compared to $522 million or 3.67% of average total loans in the first quarter of 2010. Net charge-offs continued to decline in the second quarter as we experienced improvement in most of our loan portfolios when compared to the prior quarters. This improvement, along with lower levels of nonperforming loans and lower total loans outstanding, resulted in a reduction in the reserve for loan losses of $207 million during the second quarter.
At June 30, 2010, the reserve for loan losses stood at $2.2 billion or 4.16% of total loans. Our current expectation is that we will continue to experience elevated but lower levels of net charge-offs in coming quarters. And along with anticipated lower levels of nonperforming loans, we may continue to see further reductions in the level of the loan loss reserve for the balance of the year. As in our prior quarter comment, should the economic conditions materially weaken, this could change our outlook for net charge-offs, nonperforming loans and reserve balance.
Turning to Slide 10. Our nonperforming loans stood at $1.7 billion or 3.19% of total loans at June 30, 2010, down $362 million from March 31 of this year, and down $587 million from their peak at September 30, 2009. Nonperforming assets were also down $342 million to $2.1 billion as of June 30, 2010, and are down over $700 million from their peak in the third quarter of last year.
As shown in the Summary of Changes in Nonperforming Loans on Page 25 of the earnings release today, we experienced another decrease in the net inflow of nonperforming loans during the second quarter, which represented our fourth consecutive quarterly decline in new inflows and the lowest level of new inflows since the third quarter of 2008. We also saw an increase in loan sales and payments as liquidity improved in the second quarter.
As shown on Page 24 of the earnings release, both 90-day or more past due and 30- to 89-day past due loan categories experienced decreases in the second quarter when compared to the prior quarter. Our coverage ratio of loan loss reserves to nonperforming loans improved to 130% at June 30, 2010. And when we combine our reserve for unfunded commitments to our loan loss reserve, our total allowance for credit losses represented 137% coverage of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2010. In addition, nonperforming loans are carried at approximately 69% of their original face values and other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets are carried at approximately 56% of their original face values at June 30, 2010.
Turning to Slide 11. All of our capital ratios improved at June 30, 2010 compared to the prior quarter. At June 30, our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio was 7.65%. Our Tier 1 common ratio was 8.01%, and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 13.55%. As a result of returning to profitability in the second quarter, and the reduction in the reserve for loan losses, the company's disallowed net deferred tax asset for regulatory capital purposes decreased to $405 million at June 30, 2010 from $651 million at March 31, 2010. For regulatory capital purposes, the $405 million of net deferred assets, tax assets disallowed at June 30, 2010, reduced our regulatory capital ratios by approximately 45 basis points.
We believe that the company's strong capital ratios and the return to profitability will improve our prospects for the eventual repayment of the TARP-preferred capital in the future.
And finally, turning to Slide 12. We want to close by updating you on our long-term targets we introduced last quarter. We continue to achieve our core funding and noninterest income to total revenue objectives, and we made additional progress on our net charge-offs, Keyvolution cost saves and ROA objective during the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, the net interest margin was down two basis points in the second quarter. However, our outlook for the third quarter is for an improvement in this measure.
Before leaving this slide, I want to comment on the status of our progress with regard to having clients opt in to overdraft protection. Last quarter, we commented that we estimated that the company could potentially lose up to $50 million in deposit service charges on an annualized basis once Regulation E was fully in effect. Based on the responses that we've received so far, we now estimate that the cost should be closer to $40 million, and we will continue to look for ways to help offset this impact. As you may have seen, yesterday we announced the introduction of a new checking account that not only incorporates overdraft protection for a monthly fee, but also provides identity theft protection. We believe this new service will be well received by clients as they continue to look for convenience and certainty when managing their money.
Also, there has been considerable amount of discussion regarding the new Financial Regulation Act which the President signed into law yesterday. Many of the provisions of this act will require studies and new regulations to be completed before they take effect. One area that has received considerable discussion is the potential impact on interchange revenues. In total, on an annualized basis, Key derives approximately $75 million in revenue from debit interchange. Until the regulations are proposed, we won't know the ultimate impact on this revenue stream.
That concludes our remarks. And now I'll turn the call back over to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A segment of our call. Operator?"

As we think about net interest income, is there enough liability in CD repricing specifically left to get you eventually to your $350 million target? And if not, which is more important? Is it rising rates, or is it loan growth, or it a little bit of both to get there? And then on the other side of the balance sheet, how should we think about what a normal level of securities portfolio is? And assuming the current level is elevated, is it a stop gap until rates go up, or is it stop gap until loan growth reemerges? Or is it ultimately going to be replaced by acquisitions? Just how are you thinking about potentially exiting that trade over time?"

With respect to the margin, we still have some additional runway that will help us here into the third quarter, obviously, because of the repricing that happened in the second quarter of the CD book. Most of that benefit doesn't hit until the third quarter. And of the $2.8 billion that I mentioned, that's repricing in the third quarter, the majority of that benefit, of course, will not hit until the fourth quarter of this year. So while not giving specifics on the question with respect to the 350 margin, we will see improvement. And we expect to see improvement here in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter. But of course, to get much expansion beyond and on up significantly, it will require an additional change in the overall rate environment. Currently, with the company's position, we're approximately 4% asset-sensitive. So as we look out into the future, we're positioned for higher rates but not in the foreseeable, what I call the foreseeable future. As a result, we added to the Investment portfolio in the second quarter. You can see the average balance for the quarter was about $17.3 billion, and the ending balance for the quarter was closer to $19.8 billion on the Investment portfolio. We are keeping the Investment portfolio relatively short in buying securities basically in the two and a half year duration. And we stay also for quality. Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie, CMO packs are sequentials. So I think before we're going to see expansion in the margin above that 350 range, we are going to have to see some loan demand coming back into play. We are working very hard in the field to garner that business at this particular point in time. And I'm sure that Beth and Chris will comment on that later. The Investment portfolio though is something that is there to serve as a reservoir, if you will, for when the loan demand does come back. So it's very difficult for me to tell you the exact level of the Investment portfolio. But we will maintain higher levels in the Investment portfolio than we historically have in the past just because the environment has in fact changed."

There's $1.1 billion of that are the LILO/SILOs, and those will go out for 10 years. So that's a very slow piece of that. And the other part of the equation that's a little bit  slower is also the Marine. Now Marine typically picks up in the second quarter and the third quarter each year with the improvement in the weather and people get out boating, et cetera, but that's also a much longer-duration portfolio. So the other books continue, I think, to pay down. The Residential Properties was down $90 million approximately in the second quarter.

As you can see, companies still continue to delever and have a fair amount of liquidity. But with that said, if I look at it regionally, the Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountains, to your question about where in the cycle and demand, actually went into the slowdown of the latest of the markets.

Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is our CFO, Jeff Weeden; and available for the Q&A portion of our call are our leaders of Community Banking and National Banking, Beth Mooney and Chris Gorman; our Chief Risk Officer, Chuck Hyle; and our Treasurer, Joe Vayda.
If you turn to Slide 2, this is our forward-looking disclosure statement. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call today.
Now if you turn to Slide 3. This morning we announced second quarter net income from continuing operations of $56 million or $0.06 per common share. The improvement over the prior quarter was due to a lower provision for loan losses, higher fee income and well-controlled expenses. Overall, the results are encouraging and the return to profitability represents an important step forward for our company.
Despite the challenges that our industry faces in terms of the pace of the recovery, and other environmental factors such as regulatory reform, I am confident that we are taking the necessary actions to position the company for better long-term performance.
I was especially pleased by the continued improvement in credit quality, which was the major contributor to our improved financial results for the second quarter. Credit quality improved across the majority of loan portfolios in Community Banking and National Banking, which contributed to the positive net income reported for both groups.
Net charge-offs declined by $87 million, and non-performing loans decreased by $362 million from the previous quarter. This was the third consecutive quarterly decline in non-performing loans.  Delinquency trends and the inflow of new non-performing loans were also favorable. Although net charge-offs will likely to remain elevated for the remainder of 2010, we expect to show further progress in the future quarters.
Our balance sheet continues to reflect strong capital liquidity and reserve levels. At June 30, our Tier 1 common equity ratio was a strong 8.01%, and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 13.55%. Both measures are up from the first quarter and the year-ago period.
At the end of the second quarter, our loan-loss allowance was $2.2 billion and represented 4.16% of total loans and 130% of non-performing loans. Both of these ratios should maintain our position near the top quartile of our peer group --
Being a core-funded institution remains an important strategic imperative. And as Jeff Weeden will discuss in his remarks, we continue to operate from a position of strength. Our strong capital and liquidity positions enable the company to support the borrowing needs of our clients. Although loan demand remains weak, the company originated approximately $12.9 billion in new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses during the first half of the year.
The final item on our strategic update slide, investing in our Core Relationship businesses, has been a consistent theme for Key. Having a strong balance sheet as a solid foundation, we are continuing to position the company to take advantage of the gradually improving economy. In the Community Bank, our largest investment is in our 14-state branch network. We opened 18 new branches in the first half of 2010 and expect to open an additional 22 branches during the remainder of the year. The deposit generation and overall profitability of our new branches have been in line with our expectations.
In addition, we continue to modernize our existing branches and align staffing with the needs of our communities that we serve. We have designated 225 business-intensive branches, which are staffed to serve our small business clients. We are also a significant participant in the SBA small business loan program.
In the first half of 2010, we also experienced good growth in Private Banking and Key Investment Services, our branch-based investment group. Both areas represent good opportunities for continued growth. Our improved performance in National Banking is largely driven by improving credit trends and the work we have done to reduce our risk profile. But we've also made significant progress in sharpening our focus on targeted client segments and investing in human capital and our non-capital-intensive businesses.
During the first half of the year, KeyBanc Capital Markets participated in 30 equity transactions that generated over $25 million in fees. We have also seen improvement in the M&A Advisory business since the third quarter of 2009 as more liquidity has returned to the market.  And we continue to emphasize areas that have synergy with client segments in the Community Bank, such as equipment leasing and certain products offered by the KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Our second quarter results were an important step forward for us and we should continue to benefit from the hard work that's been done to improve our risk profile and reposition the company. I remain confident in Key's future and our ability to serve our clients and make progress towards our long-term targets. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for a review of our financial results. Jeff?"
329376,107916604,68533,"KeyCorp, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","KeyCorp","Executives","Thank you, Henry. Slide 4 provides a summary of the company's second quarter 2010 results from Continuing Operations. Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to our Continuing Operations. As Henry mentioned in his comments, for the",1778,"Thank you, Henry. Slide 4 provides a summary of the company's second quarter 2010 results from Continuing Operations. Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to our Continuing Operations. As Henry mentioned in his comments, for the second quarter the company earned a net profit of $0.06 per common share. This was a result of lower provision for loan losses as both net charge-offs and non-performing loans decreased from the first quarter levels. In addition, the company showed improved pre-provision net revenue as a result of higher non-interest revenue and well-controlled expenses.
The second quarter profit compares to a net loss of $0.68 per share for the same period one year ago and an $0.11 loss per common share for the first quarter of this year. While not noted on this slide, the company's book value and tangible book value increased during the second quarter to $9.19 and $8.10 per share, respectively.
Turning to Slide 5. For the second quarter of 2010, the company's taxable equivalent net interest income was $623 million compared to $632 million for the first quarter of 2010 and $591 million for the same period one year ago. The net interest margin contracted two basis points to 3.17% for the second quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010. However, it is up 40 basis points from the same period one year ago.
The benefit from repricing maturing CDs was more heavily weighted to the last half of the second quarter and will provide us with some improvement to the net interest margin in the third quarter of this year. In addition, during the third quarter, we have approximately $2.8 billion in CDs maturing at an average cost of 4.51%, which were originated
prior to 2009. 
On the other side of the balance sheet, we experienced continued run-off of loan balances, which led to higher levels of short-term liquidity on average for the second quarter. These funds have been redeployed into the Investment portfolio, which will benefit net interest income for the third quarter. With respect to the third quarter, we look for the net interest margin to expand to the mid-3.20% range.
Turning to Slide 6. During the second quarter, the company experienced a $2.6 billion decrease in average total loan balances compared to the first quarter of 2010. The decline in average balances continues to reflect soft loan demand for credit as consumers and businesses continue to deleverage and wait for more clarity on the underlying strength of the economic expansion and employment. Also impacting average loan balances is the impact of our Exit portfolios as we continue to reduce risk in the company. We do not anticipate loan demand to improve until we see greater confidence on the part of consumers and businesses regarding the overall strength of the economy and an improved employment outlook. While conditions are better than what they were last year at this time, average loan balances in our Non-exit portfolios are expected to continue to decline until business lending demand picks up.
Turning to Slide 7. We experienced an increase of $1.3 billion in the combined average balances of demand deposit, NOW, money market deposit accounts and regular savings accounts during the second quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2010. And these balances are up $4.5 billion from the same period one year ago. As we have been discussing for the past few quarters, we continue to experience run-off in our CD book, which declined $2.3 billion as higher-yielding certificates of deposits mature and clients look for other alternatives for investing in the current low-rate environment.
As I mentioned in the margin discussion, we experienced heavy maturities of CDs in the second half of the second quarter. Many of these CDs were originally booked prior to 2009 when liquidity was much tighter than it is today. The third quarter will be the last of the heavy-maturity quarters remaining with respect to the CDs originated
prior to 2009. During the third quarter, we have approximately $2.8 billion of these higher-yielding rate CDs maturing. These maturities will drop off to approximately $800 million of higher-rate CDs in the fourth quarter of this year.
In total, average deposits declined $1 billion during the second quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010. However, the mix of our deposits improved, which we believe will benefit the net interest margin in the second half of the year.
Slide 8 shows the strong liquidity position of the company. With loan demand remaining weak, we have increased the size of the Investment portfolio and reduced our wholesale funding position over the past year. For the second quarter of 2010, the loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 93%, consistent with the first quarter of 2010 and an improvement from one year ago when it was 107%. In this loan-to-deposit ratio, we have also included our discontinued operations balances not funded with securitization trusts. The securitization trusts gross up the balance sheet but do not have an impact on the liquidity of the company.
Turning to Slide 9. Net charge-offs for the second quarter were $435 million and represented 3.18% of average total loans compared to $522 million or 3.67% of average total loans in the first quarter of 2010. Net charge-offs continued to decline in the second quarter as we experienced improvement in most of our loan portfolios when compared to the prior quarters. This improvement, along with lower levels of non-performing loans and lower total loans outstanding, resulted in a reduction in the reserve for loan losses of $207 million during the second quarter.
At June 30, 2010, the reserve for loan losses stood at $2.2 billion or 4.16% of total loans. Our current expectation is that we will continue to experience elevated but lower levels of net charge-offs in coming quarters. And along with anticipated lower levels of non-performing loans, we may continue to see further reductions in the level of the loan loss reserve for the balance of the year. As in our prior-quarter comment, should the economic conditions materially weaken, this could change our outlook for net charge-offs, non-performing loans and reserve balance.
Turning to Slide 10. Our non-performing loans stood at $1.7 billion or 3.19% of total loans at June 30, 2010, down $362 million from March 31 of this year, and down $587 million from their peak at September 30, 2009. Non-performing assets were also down $342 million to $2.1 billion as of June 30, 2010, and are down over $700 million from their peak in the third quarter of last year.
As shown in the Summary of Changes in Nonperforming Loans on Page 25 of the earnings release today, we experienced another decrease in the net inflow of non-performing loans during the second quarter, which represented our fourth consecutive quarterly decline in new inflows and the lowest level of new inflows since the third quarter of 2008. We also saw an increase in loan sales and payments as liquidity improved in the second quarter.
As shown on Page 24 of the earnings release, both 90-day or more past due and 30- to 89-day past due loan categories experienced decreases in the second quarter when compared to the prior quarter. Our coverage ratio of loan loss reserves to non-performing loans improved to 130% at June 30, 2010. And when we combine our reserve for unfunded commitments to our loan loss reserve, our total allowance for credit losses represented 137% coverage of non-performing loans at June 30, 2010. In addition, non-performing loans are carried at approximately 69% of their original face values and other real estate owned and other non-performing assets are carried at approximately 56% of their original face values at June 30, 2010.
Turning to Slide 11. All of our capital ratios improved at June 30, 2010 compared to the prior quarter. At June 30, our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio was 7.65%. Our Tier 1 common ratio was 8.01%, and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 13.55%. As a result of returning to profitability in the second quarter, and the reduction in the reserve for loan losses, the company's disallowed net deferred tax asset for regulatory capital purposes decreased to $405 million at June 30, 2010 from $651 million at March 31, 2010. For regulatory capital purposes, the $405 million of net deferred assets, tax assets disallowed at June 30, 2010, reduced our regulatory capital ratios by approximately 45 basis points.
We believe that the company's strong capital ratios and the return to profitability will improve our prospects for the eventual repayment of the TARP-preferred capital in the future.
And finally, turning to Slide 12. We want to close by updating you on our long-term targets we introduced last quarter. We continue to achieve our core funding and non-interest income to total revenue objectives, and we made additional progress on our net charge-offs, Keyvolution cost saves and ROA objective during the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, the net interest margin was down two basis points in the second quarter. However, our outlook for the third quarter is for an improvement in this measure.
Before leaving this slide, I want to comment on the status of our progress with regard to having clients opt in to overdraft protection. Last quarter, we commented that we estimated that the company could potentially lose up to $50 million in deposit service charges on an annualized basis once Regulation E was fully in effect. Based on the responses that we've received so far, we now estimate that the cost should be closer to $40 million, and we will continue to look for ways to help offset this impact. As you may have seen, yesterday we announced the introduction of a new checking account that not only incorporates overdraft protection for a monthly fee, but also provides identity theft protection. We believe this new service will be well received by clients as they continue to look for convenience and certainty when managing their money.
Also, there has been considerable amount of discussion regarding the new Financial Regulation Act which the President signed into law yesterday. Many of the provisions of this act will require studies and new regulations to be completed before they take effect. One area that has received considerable discussion is the potential impact on interchange revenues. In total, on an annualized basis, Key derives approximately $75 million in revenue from debit interchange. Until the regulations are proposed, we won't know the ultimate impact on this revenue stream.
That concludes our remarks. And now I'll turn the call back over to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A segment of our call. Operator?"

As we think about net interest income, is there enough liability in CD repricing specifically left to get you eventually to your $350 million target? And if not, which is more important? Is it rising rates, or is it loan growth, or it a little bit of both to get there? And then on the other side of the balance sheet, how should we think about what a normal level of securities portfolio is? And assuming the current level is elevated, is it a stop gap until rates go up, or is it stop gap until loan growth reemerges? Or is it ultimately going to be replaced by acquisitions? Just how are you thinking about potentially exiting that trade over time?"

With respect to the margin, we still have some additional runway that will help us here into the third quarter, obviously, because of the repricing that happened in the second quarter of the CD book. Most of that benefit doesn't hit until the third quarter. And of the $2.8 billion that I mentioned, that's repricing in the third quarter, the majority of that benefit, of course, will not hit until the fourth quarter of this year. So while not giving specifics on the question with respect to the 350 margin, we will see improvement. And we expect to see improvement here in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter. But of course, to get much expansion beyond and on up significantly, it will require an additional change in the overall rate environment. Currently, with the company's position, we're approximately 4% asset-sensitive. So as we look out into the future, we're positioned for higher rates but not in the foreseeable, what I call the foreseeable future. As a result, we added to the Investment portfolio in the second quarter. You can see the average balance for the quarter was about $17.3 billion, and the ending balance for the quarter was closer to $19.8 billion on the Investment portfolio. We are keeping the Investment portfolio relatively short in buying securities basically in the two and a half year duration. And we stay also for quality. Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie, CMO packs are sequentials. So I think before we're going to see expansion in the margin above that 350 range, we are going to have to see some loan demand coming back into play. We are working very hard in the field to garner that business at this particular point in time. And I'm sure that Beth and Chris will comment on that later. The Investment portfolio though is something that is there to serve as a reservoir, if you will, for when the loan demand does come back. So it's very difficult for me to tell you the exact level of the Investment portfolio. But we will maintain higher levels in the Investment portfolio than we historically have in the past just because the environment has in fact changed."

We don't see anything in the near term that's going to cause those utilization rates to go up. If you think about it, there's not a lot of upward pressure on commodities which forces people to pre-buy. Additionally, people are able to garner whatever they need to keep their operations running on relatively short notice. So we're projecting that the utilization rates are going to remain relatively flat as they were from the first quarter to the second."

And the other part of the equation that's a little bit slower is also the Marine. Now Marine typically picks up in the second quarter and the third quarter each year with the improvement in the weather and people get out boating, et cetera, but that's also a much longer-duration portfolio. So the other books continue, I think, to pay down. The Residential Properties was down $90 million approximately in the second quarter. And so that's really where we're going to see paydowns are going to continue probably at about a $500 million a quarter plus or minus a little bit.

And I think one of the things, too, that -- as Chris was kind of talking about, the availability of people being able to buy and get whatever resources they need, they're able to do that with a lot of their cash. I think in terms of what was announced by our report, I think that came out from the Fed a week ago, the amount of cash that businesses have right now is extremely high. And we see that in our deposit accounts. Whether we get to an 80% loan-to-deposit ratio or not, I can't predict that at this particular point in time. I think what we are doing is continuing to re-price our deposits and basically our inventory, and continue to be on the outlook for signs of an uptick in loan demand here in the future."

But I can tell you that there's a slide in the earnings release, and I believe it is on Page 25 of the press release, it provides the activities that go through ORE during the course of the quarter. So we did have some marks that we took in the quarter, valuation adjustments of approximately $24 million. But we were also able to sell some of the property during the quarter that we realized an overall gain on some of the properties that sold. So we think we have a mark fairly close to value. Some properties we're selling at a profit. Some of the others we're continuing to mark until we can clear the market and keep those properties moved. We have a tendency to try to move as much ORE during the course of the time period that we can. And a lot more of it, of course, that's coming in now is less of the residential side and is more on the income side of the equation. But I think that's a good summary that's provided on Page 25.

So it's an indicator to me that loan demand is still relatively soft. It can be more episodic than trending at this point. As you can see, companies still continue to delever and have a fair amount of liquidity. But with that said, if I look at it regionally, the Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountains, to your question about where in the cycle and demand, actually went into the slowdown of the latest of the markets. And we actually see them coming out the slowest at this point. And then our Northeastern Great Lake regions, we see some general growth in the economies as manufacturing starts to expand.

Good morning, and welcome to our earnings conference call. Joining me for today's presentation is our CFO, Jeff Weeden; and available for the Q&A portion of our call are our leaders of Community Banking and National Banking, Beth Mooney and Chris Gorman; and our Treasurer, Joe Vayda.
Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure statement. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call today.
Now if you turn to Slide 3. This morning, we announced third quarter net income from continuing operations of $163 million or $0.19 per common share. Our positive earnings for the last two quarters resulted in a return to profitability for our year-to-date results with net income from continuing operations for the nine-month period of $121 million or $0.14 per common share. Key's third quarter earnings improvement compared to the second quarter was due to higher pre-provision net revenue and a lower provision for loan losses. The growth in pre-provision net revenue was the result of a higher net interest margin, well-controlled expenses and improvements in several fee-based businesses. Credit quality continued to improve across the majority of loan portfolios in both Community Banking and National Banking, reflecting the work that has been done to lower our risk profile and proactively address credit issues. Our positive credit trends included net charge-offs, which were down for the third consecutive quarter and nonperforming loans, which have declined for the last four quarters. 
Our balance sheet continues to reflect strong capital liquidity and reserve levels. Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio at September 30 was 8.59%, and our Tier I risk-based capital ratio was 14.26%. Key's loan-loss allowance at the end of the third quarter was approximately $2 billion, which represented 3.81% of total loans and 143% coverage of non-performing loans. Both of these ratios should maintain our position near the top of our peer group.
As many of you who have followed our company know, our management team has moved aggressively over the last 18 months to significantly fortify our capital and reserves, lower our risk profile and improve liquidity and funding with a single-minded purpose of emerging from this challenging economic period, strong and well positioned to compete and win in the marketplace.
I believe the trends that we reported today in our pre-provision net revenue demonstrate the progress that is being made. Our strong capital and liquidity positions also enabled the company to support the borrowing needs of our clients when the economy expands. The company originated approximately $8.1 billion in new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses during the quarter and approximately $21 billion year-to-date through September 30.
The final item on our strategic update slide, investing in our core relationship businesses has been a consistent theme for Key. Having a strong balance sheet as a solid foundation, we're continuing to position the company to take advantage of the gradually improving economy. In Community Banking, our largest investment is in our 14-state branch network. We opened 34 new branches in the first nine months of 2010 and expect to open an additional five branches during the fourth quarter. And we have plans to open another 35 to 40 branches in 2011. The profitability of our new branches continues to be in line with our expectations. 
We have also continued to modernize our existing branches and aligned staffing with the needs of the segments and the communities that we serve. One of the segments that continues to be an area of focus is Business Banking, where we have designated 225 branches as business-intensive, which are staffed to serve our small business clients. We are also a significant participant in the SBA Small Business Loan program.
In Retail Banking, we're focused on deepening our existing relationships and new client acquisition. During the first nine months of this year, we have experienced solid growth in our net new DDA accounts and have generated a record level of revenue in our branch-based investment group. 
We're also pleased to receive additional recognition for Key's online capabilities in the September edition of Bank Monitor, which ranked us second among the 16 largest U.S. banks for our online account application features. The investments in our new and modernized branches, along with the enhancements to the online banking, position us to grow as the economy strengthens. 
Our improvement in the National Banking group is largely driven by improving credit trends and the work we have done to reduce our risk profile. We have also made significant progress in sharpening our focus on targeted client segments and investing in the right people and our non-capital intensive businesses. 
Year-to-date, KeyBanc Capital Markets has participated in 41 equity transactions that generated over $40 million in fees. According to industry league tables, we have been one of the top regional banks in IPOs and follow-on deals this year and have played a very active role in the REIT space. We have also seen improvement in M&A advisory business since the third quarter of 2009 as more liquidity has returned to the market. Key has consistently ranked as a top adviser for middle market M&A transactions. 
And we continue to emphasize areas in National Banking that have synergy with our client segments in the community bank, such as equipment leasing and certain products offered through KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I want to recognize the important contributions of our employees across Key, who have remained focused on serving our clients through what has been an extremely challenging period. Our leadership team makes a point to visit a number of our district markets each year. And we just returned from a visit to Portland and Seattle, key growth markets where we are making significant investments for our future. I personally come away from these visits energized and confident about the changes that our team are implementing in our Community Banking model. We are attracting new clients, zeroing in on service and delivery and building the Key brand. 
In markets where there has been disruption among competitors, there is additional opportunity. And again, the perseverance of our frontline bankers during this period has been extraordinary. 
As I mentioned earlier, with the significant strategic actions we've completed and implemented over the last 18 months in our capital structure, risk management, expense control and business investment, our confidence in our fundamental strategy builds. I remain confident in Key's future and our ability to serve our clients and make progress towards our long-term financial targets. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff Weeden for a review of our financial results. Jeff?"

Slide 4 provides a summary of Key's third quarter financial results from continuing operations. Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to Key's continuing operations. As Henry mentioned in his comments, for the",1522,"Thank you, Henry. Slide 4 provides a summary of Key's third quarter financial results from continuing operations. Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to Key's continuing operations. 
As Henry mentioned in his comments, for the third quarter, the company earned a net profit of $0.19 per common share. This was the result of lower provision for loan losses, as both charge-offs and non-performing loans decreased from the second quarter levels. In addition, the company showed improved pre-provision net revenue as a result of higher revenue and well-controlled expenses.
The third quarter profit compares to a profit of $0.06 per common share for the second quarter of this year. While not noted on this slide, the company's book value and tangible book value increased again during the third quarter to $9.54 and $8.46 per share respectively, up from $9.19 and $8.10 per share at June 30, 2010.
On Slide 5 are Key's long term targets for success we introduced earlier this year. On the next several slides, I will comment on our progress towards achieving these targets.
Turning to Slide 6. One of our objectives is to be a core funded institution with a targeted loan-to-deposit ratio of 90% to 100%. As of September 30, 2010, our loan-to-deposit ratio was within this targeted range at 92%. During the third quarter, the company experienced a $2.4 billion decrease in average total loan balances compared to the second quarter of 2010. As we have been commenting on for several quarters, the decline in average balances continues to reflect soft demand for credit and our continued progress on our exit portfolios, as we reduced risk in the company. 
We would also note that we are somewhat encouraged by the stabilization we are seeing in the middle market C&I portfolio, specifically in the Great Lakes and Northeast regions, as businesses begin to make investments to upgrade their production capabilities or are thinking about acquiring other companies. And we also experienced growth in our core leasing portfolio. However, at this time, this activity is not expected to be sufficient to offset continued paydowns in the remaining books of business over the next several quarters.
Looking at our average deposits for the third quarter, we experienced continued improvement in the mix of our deposits, as higher-costing CDs matured and were repriced to current market rates or moved to other deposit categories or other investment alternatives. During the third quarter, we experienced an $800 million increase in the combined average balances of demand deposits, NOW, money market deposit accounts and regular savings accounts compared to the second quarter of this year. And these balances are up $3.8 billion from the same period one year ago. 
As we have been discussing for the past few quarters, we continue to experience runoff in our CD book, which declined $3.5 billion as higher-yielding certificates of deposits mature and clients look for other alternatives for investing in this low-rate environment. The decline in CD balances will slow in future quarters, as scheduled maturities are smaller going forward.
Turning to Slide 7. Our asset quality statistics continue to improve. As Henry mentioned in his comments, net charge-offs were down again this quarter to $357 million or 2.69% of average loans. This is still high compared to our long-term target of 40 to 50 basis points, but a significant improvement over prior quarters. Non-performing loans were also down again this quarter to $1.4 billion or 2.67% of total loans at September 30, 2010, and are now down by more than 40% from their peak one year ago. 
We saw market liquidity strengthen in the latter half of the third quarter and used this as an opportunity to continue to move our nonperforming assets. We were also encouraged by the fact that we were able to move these assets close to where they were carried on the assets on the books net of our reserves, or they were marked in the case of other real estate owned or other nonperforming assets. As a result of the improvement we experienced in credit quality during the third quarter, the reserve for loan losses declined to $1,957,000,000 or 3.81% of total loans and represented 143% coverage of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2010. 
We currently expect to experience continued improvement in the level of net charge-offs and non-performing loans. As a result, we expect our provision for loan losses to be less than the amount of net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Turning to Slide 8. For the third quarter, the company's taxable equivalent net interest income was $647 million compared to $623 million for the second quarter of this year. The net interest margin expanded 18 basis points to 3.35% for the third quarter compared to the second quarter of this year. For the third quarter, earning asset yields remained relatively stable, declining one basis point to 4.39%, while the yield on interest-bearing liabilities declined 24 basis points to 1.46% compared to the second quarter of 2010. 
Benefiting the margin for the third quarter was the redeployment of short-term liquidity into securities available-for-sale portfolio, the repricing of maturing CDs and an improved mix of deposits on the liability side of the balance sheet. The pace of maturities of higher-costing CDs, which benefited the margin the most in the third quarter slows in the fourth quarter of this year to $800 million and slows further in 2011 to a range of $300 million to $500 million per quarter. Given the current mix of our assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics, we expect the net interest margin to remain relatively stable in the mid-3.30% range for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Turning to Slide 9. Our other revenue objective is focused on growing non-interest income and maintaining it above 40% of total revenues. For the third quarter of 2010, total non-interest income was $486 million and represented almost 43% of Key's total revenue. 
During the third quarter, we were very pleased with the strong performance we experienced in investment banking revenues. As shown on Page 20 of today's earnings release, investment banking and capital markets revenues were up $11 million for the quarter and letter of credit and loan fees increased $19 million compared to the second quarter of 2010. 
As discussed over the past two quarters, the implementation of Regulation E on July 1 for new clients and on August 15 for our existing clients resulted in a decline in deposit service charges of $5 million from the second quarter level, which was in line with our expectations.
Turning to Slide 10. We are continuing to make good progress on our Keyvolution savings. And through the third quarter, we have implemented $224 million of annualized savings towards our goal of $300 million to $375 million by the end of 2012. For the third quarter, total non-interest expense was $736 million, down $33 million from the second quarter of 2010, primarily as a result of lower personnel expense and a decline in other real estate expense. Personnel expense declined as a result of a $12 million credit to the pension expense in the third quarter compared to a $6 million of expense in the second quarter. We do not expect to record any pension expense in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
OREO expense declined to $4 million from $22 million in the second quarter of this year and from a highly elevated $51 million for the same period one year ago. During the third quarter, we were successful in selling $63 million of ORE at prices approximating their net carrying values. As a result, ORE expense declined significantly. 
At this point in the cycle, more of the property we are taking possession of has cash flows associated with it and typically has become easier to sell as liquidity has returned to the market for income-producing property. However, we do expect to see volatility in the amount of ORE expense in future quarters depending upon market conditions.
Slide 11 shows our pre-provision net revenue and return on average assets. With the improvement in the net interest margin and good expense control reviewed on the previous slide, pre-provision net revenue improved by $51 million in the third quarter to $397 million. In addition, coupled with improved credit costs, our return on average assets increased to 0.93% for the third quarter of 2010, a significant improvement over where the company was operating just a few quarters ago. 
And finally, turning to Slide 12. All of our capital ratios continued to improve during the third quarter compared to the prior quarter. At September 30, 2010, our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio was 8.0%. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 8.59%, and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 14.26%. We believe our capital position is strong and positions us well for the potential implementation of Basel III and the eventual repayment of the TARP preferred capital in the future. 
That concludes our remarks. And now we'll turn the call back over to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?"

Of that, about $800 million of that $1.1 billion really came from our commercial real estate book. We're going to continue to see commercial real estate loans continue to pay down here. There's improved, I think, liquidity we're seeing in the marketplace. And certainly on the multi-family is doing very well in today's marketplace.

And we are actually starting to see, as Jeff mentioned in his comments particularly in our Great Lakes and Northeastern region, signs of increased new business activity and modest glimmers of loan growth. However on net, you'll still see pressures in the Western markets. They were late into the cycle. But we do see some pickup in business activity and clearly signs of stability in the middle market book, as well as in the core leasing portfolio, which intersects with a lot of that same client base renewed activity."

We have seen that. So the leasing book has stabilized and now it's growing a small amount. As you look at the C&I book, the rate of decline was halved quarter-over-quarter on a linked basis. And conversely, we had a pretty significant step-up in real estate as we strategically de-risk the balance sheet. And obviously, there's a lot of liquidity both in the mortgage market, which we benefited from as a player in the mortgage business, but also just liquidity in the market in general as we take our real estate book down by strategy."

Charge-offs now are less than our pre-provision net revenue. We see that trend can continue. Obviously, that's generating taxable income at that particular point, as well as having the reserve itself come down. So if you think about the reserve itself coming down, and if that generated at the statutory rates for every $1.375 coming off of that, that in and of itself creates less of a deferred tax asset. Profitability on the other hand improves that. So as we look forward, the utilization of any net operating loss carryforwards that have existed at the end of the year, start to also get absorbed. So these are all positive things that contribute to it. And that's why we believe that over the course of the next five quarters that, that this allowed portion of the deferred tax asset will actually be gone."

We've actually, if you look at the reconciliation that's on Page 25 of the press release, we even had valuation adjustments that we took in the current quarter of approximately $7 million that run through.

And so if we look at that particular book, a lot of the stuff that's going to pay off relatively quickly, has done so. When we get into the commercial lease financing, there's $1.1 billion of that particular book that are the lilos and silos. And those are going to be around for a number of years. They may have maturities that go out into the 2020. On the marine book, which is about $2.3 billion at the end of the current quarter, that also is a much longer duration. Now that's more predictable as far as cash flows coming off of it. It will continue to probably work its way down from $100 million to $150 million in any given quarter. And we may get additional acceleration of that, if unemployment goes down and if the economy picks up somewhat, as people want to trade up a different boat. So I think if we look at the overall balance sheet, yes, it will come down some here. But it's more going to be driven on the liability side.

I think if you go to the press release itself and you look at Slide 23, you'll notice on that, that we did have a recovery. But that was in the C&I book, not so much in the CRE book.

In that state, in the past we'd always tried to operate it with the liabilities sense of this position. At these particular raise of how long have been with those rates we remain as that insensitive as of the end of the third quarter in the 3% range. So I think the function of the overall investment portfolio is going to be largely dependent upon the level of funding that we end up with the organization. As I said earlier, it's kind of dependent upon the flow of overall deposit-related activities and loan-related activities. We have that stored liquidity in the investment portfolio to meet future loan demand. We do expect future loan demand in the organization. We will continue to price our deposits also down as we have been doing during the past year, and we should get some continued benefit from that.

So if you look at our coverage ratio, our coverage ratio of nonperformers at this particular point in time is up into the 143%. If you look at where we have the assets recorded, in other words, we've already taken on our total nonperforming loan book, we've already taken charge-offs against that of probably close to $690 million to $700 million, just against the nonperforming loan components. They've already been charged down. We've done a lot of the heavy work at this point in time. Plus we're getting further along into the cycle. So we're very aggressive early on in the process and really working a lot of these nonperformers out.

So I know there's some hypothetical things that we're talking about as to what we thought that would be. But again, to get closer and closer here through the cycle, we have targeted a 40 to 50 basis point range of net charge-offs that were targeting, that is predicated on the fact that we have made so many changes in the composition of our loan portfolio.

Good morning, and welcome to our earnings conference call. Joining me for today's presentation is our CFO, Jeff Weeden; and available for the Q&A portion of our call are our leaders of Community Banking and National Banking, Beth Mooney and Chris Gorman; and our Treasurer, Joe Vayda.
Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure statement. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call today.
Now if you turn to Slide 3. This morning, we announced third quarter net income from continuing operations of $163 million or $0.19 per common share. Our positive earnings for the last two quarters resulted in a return to profitability for our year-to-date results with net income from continuing operations for the nine-month period of $121 million or $0.14 per common share. Key's third quarter earnings improvement compared to the second quarter was due to higher pre-provision net revenue and a lower provision for loan losses. The growth in pre-provision net revenue was the result of a higher net interest margin, well-controlled expenses and improvements in several fee-based businesses. Credit quality continued to improve across the majority of loan portfolios in both Community Banking and National Banking, reflecting the work that has been done to lower our risk profile and proactively address credit issues. Our positive credit trends included net charge-offs, which were down for the third consecutive quarter and nonperforming loans, which have declined for the last four quarters. 
Our balance sheet continues to reflect strong capital liquidity and reserve levels. Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio at September 30 was 8.59%, and our Tier I risk-based capital ratio was 14.26%. Key's loan-loss allowance at the end of the third quarter was approximately $2 billion, which represented 3.81% of total loans and 143% coverage of non-performing loans. Both of these ratios should maintain our position near the top of our peer group.
As many of you who have followed our company know, our management team has moved aggressively over the last 18 months to significantly fortify our capital and reserves, lower our risk profile and improve liquidity and funding with a single-minded purpose of emerging from this challenging economic period, strong and well positioned to compete and win in the marketplace.
I believe the trends that we reported today in our pre-provision net revenue demonstrate the progress that is being made. Our strong capital and liquidity positions also enabled the company to support the borrowing needs of our clients when the economy expands. The company originated approximately $8.1 billion in new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses during the quarter and approximately $21 billion year-to-date through September 30.
The final item on our strategic update slide, investing in our core relationship businesses has been a consistent theme for Key. Having a strong balance sheet as a solid foundation, we're continuing to position the company to take advantage of the gradually improving economy. In Community Banking, our largest investment is in our 14-state branch network. We opened 34 new branches in the first nine months of 2010 and expect to open an additional five branches during the fourth quarter. And we have plans to open another 35 to 40 branches in 2011. The profitability of our new branches continues to be in line with our expectations. 
We have also continued to modernize our existing branches and aligned staffing with the needs of the segments and the communities that we serve. One of the segments that continues to be an area of focus is Business Banking, where we have designated 225 branches as business-intensive, which are staffed to serve our small business clients. We are also a significant participant in the SBA Small Business Loan program.
In Retail Banking, we're focused on deepening our existing relationships and new client acquisition. During the first nine months of this year, we have experienced solid growth in our net new DDA accounts and have generated a record level of revenue in our branch-based investment group. 
We're also pleased to receive additional recognition for Key's online capabilities in the September edition of Bank Monitor, which ranked us second among the 16 largest U.S. banks for our online account application features. The investments in our new and modernized branches, along with the enhancements to the online banking, position us to grow as the economy strengthens. 
Our improvement in the National Banking group is largely driven by improving credit trends and the work we have done to reduce our risk profile. We have also made significant progress in sharpening our focus on targeted client segments and investing in the right people and our non-capital intensive businesses. 
Year-to-date, KeyBanc Capital Markets has participated in 41 equity transactions that generated over $40 million in fees. According to industry league tables, we have been one of the top regional banks in IPOs and follow-on deals this year and have played a very active role in the REIT space. We have also seen improvement in M&A advisory business since the third quarter of 2009 as more liquidity has returned to the market. Key has consistently ranked as a top adviser for middle market M&A transactions. 
And we continue to emphasize areas in National Banking that have synergy with our client segments in the community bank, such as equipment leasing and certain products offered through KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I want to recognize the important contributions of our employees across Key, who have remained focused on serving our clients through what has been an extremely challenging period. Our leadership team makes a point to visit a number of our district markets each year. And we just returned from a visit to Portland and Seattle, key growth markets where we are making significant investments for our future. I personally come away from these visits energized and confident about the changes that our team are implementing in our Community Banking model. We are attracting new clients, zeroing in on service and delivery and building the Key brand. 
In markets where there has been disruption among competitors, there is additional opportunity. And again, the perseverance of our frontline bankers during this period has been extraordinary. 
As I mentioned earlier, with the significant strategic actions we've completed and implemented over the last 18 months in our capital structure, risk management, expense control and business investment, our confidence in our fundamental strategy builds. I remain confident in Key's future and our ability to serve our clients and make progress towards our long-term financial targets. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff Weeden for a review of our financial results. Jeff?"

Slide 4 provides a summary of Key's third quarter financial results from continuing operations. Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to Key's continuing operations. As Henry mentioned in his comments, for the",1522,"Thank you, Henry. Slide 4 provides a summary of Key's third quarter financial results from continuing operations. Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to Key's continuing operations. 
As Henry mentioned in his comments, for the third quarter, the company earned a net profit of $0.19 per common share. This was the result of lower provision for loan losses, as both charge-offs and non-performing loans decreased from the second quarter levels. In addition, the company showed improved pre-provision net revenue as a result of higher revenue and well-controlled expenses.
The third quarter profit compares to a profit of $0.06 per common share for the second quarter of this year. While not noted on this slide, the company's book value and tangible book value increased again during the third quarter to $9.54 and $8.46 per share respectively, up from $9.19 and $8.10 per share at June 30, 2010.
On Slide 5 are Key's long term targets for success we introduced earlier this year. On the next several slides, I will comment on our progress towards achieving these targets.
Turning to Slide 6. One of our objectives is to be a core funded institution with a targeted loan-to-deposit ratio of 90% to 100%. As of September 30, 2010, our loan-to-deposit ratio was within this targeted range at 92%. During the third quarter, the company experienced a $2.4 billion decrease in average total loan balances compared to the second quarter of 2010. As we have been commenting on for several quarters, the decline in average balances continues to reflect soft demand for credit and our continued progress on our exit portfolios, as we reduced risk in the company. 
We would also note that we are somewhat encouraged by the stabilization we are seeing in the middle market C&I portfolio, specifically in the Great Lakes and Northeast regions, as businesses begin to make investments to upgrade their production capabilities or are thinking about acquiring other companies. And we also experienced growth in our core leasing portfolio. However, at this time, this activity is not expected to be sufficient to offset continued paydowns in the remaining books of business over the next several quarters.
Looking at our average deposits for the third quarter, we experienced continued improvement in the mix of our deposits, as higher-costing CDs matured and were repriced to current market rates or moved to other deposit categories or other investment alternatives. During the third quarter, we experienced an $800 million increase in the combined average balances of demand deposits, NOW, money market deposit accounts and regular savings accounts compared to the second quarter of this year. And these balances are up $3.8 billion from the same period one year ago. 
As we have been discussing for the past few quarters, we continue to experience runoff in our CD book, which declined $3.5 billion as higher-yielding certificates of deposits mature and clients look for other alternatives for investing in this low-rate environment. The decline in CD balances will slow in future quarters, as scheduled maturities are smaller going forward.
Turning to Slide 7. Our asset quality statistics continue to improve. As Henry mentioned in his comments, net charge-offs were down again this quarter to $357 million or 2.69% of average loans. This is still high compared to our long-term target of 40 to 50 basis points, but a significant improvement over prior quarters. Non-performing loans were also down again this quarter to $1.4 billion or 2.67% of total loans at September 30, 2010, and are now down by more than 40% from their peak one year ago. 
We saw market liquidity strengthen in the latter half of the third quarter and used this as an opportunity to continue to move our nonperforming assets. We were also encouraged by the fact that we were able to move these assets close to where they were carried on the assets on the books net of our reserves, or they were marked in the case of other real estate owned or other nonperforming assets. As a result of the improvement we experienced in credit quality during the third quarter, the reserve for loan losses declined to $1,957,000,000 or 3.81% of total loans and represented 143% coverage of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2010. 
We currently expect to experience continued improvement in the level of net charge-offs and non-performing loans. As a result, we expect our provision for loan losses to be less than the amount of net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Turning to Slide 8. For the third quarter, the company's taxable equivalent net interest income was $647 million compared to $623 million for the second quarter of this year. The net interest margin expanded 18 basis points to 3.35% for the third quarter compared to the second quarter of this year. For the third quarter, earning asset yields remained relatively stable, declining one basis point to 4.39%, while the yield on interest-bearing liabilities declined 24 basis points to 1.46% compared to the second quarter of 2010. 
Benefiting the margin for the third quarter was the redeployment of short-term liquidity into securities available-for-sale portfolio, the repricing of maturing CDs and an improved mix of deposits on the liability side of the balance sheet. The pace of maturities of higher-costing CDs, which benefited the margin the most in the third quarter slows in the fourth quarter of this year to $800 million and slows further in 2011 to a range of $300 million to $500 million per quarter. Given the current mix of our assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics, we expect the net interest margin to remain relatively stable in the mid-3.30% range for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Turning to Slide 9. Our other revenue objective is focused on growing non-interest income and maintaining it above 40% of total revenues. For the third quarter of 2010, total non-interest income was $486 million and represented almost 43% of Key's total revenue. 
During the third quarter, we were very pleased with the strong performance we experienced in investment banking revenues. As shown on Page 20 of today's earnings release, investment banking and capital markets revenues were up $11 million for the quarter and letter of credit and loan fees increased $19 million compared to the second quarter of 2010. 
As discussed over the past two quarters, the implementation of Regulation E on July 1 for new clients and on August 15 for our existing clients resulted in a decline in deposit service charges of $5 million from the second quarter level, which was in line with our expectations.
Turning to Slide 10. We are continuing to make good progress on our Keyvolution savings. And through the third quarter, we have implemented $224 million of annualized savings towards our goal of $300 million to $375 million by the end of 2012. For the third quarter, total non-interest expense was $736 million, down $33 million from the second quarter of 2010, primarily as a result of lower personnel expense and a decline in other real estate expense. Personnel expense declined as a result of a $12 million credit to the pension expense in the third quarter compared to a $6 million of expense in the second quarter. We do not expect to record any pension expense in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
OREO expense declined to $4 million from $22 million in the second quarter of this year and from a highly elevated $51 million for the same period one year ago. During the third quarter, we were successful in selling $63 million of ORE at prices approximating their net carrying values. As a result, ORE expense declined significantly. 
At this point in the cycle, more of the property we are taking possession of has cash flows associated with it and typically has become easier to sell as liquidity has returned to the market for income-producing property. However, we do expect to see volatility in the amount of ORE expense in future quarters depending upon market conditions.
Slide 11 shows our pre-provision net revenue and return on average assets. With the improvement in the net interest margin and good expense control reviewed on the previous slide, pre-provision net revenue improved by $51 million in the third quarter to $397 million. In addition, coupled with improved credit costs, our return on average assets increased to 0.93% for the third quarter of 2010, a significant improvement over where the company was operating just a few quarters ago. 
And finally, turning to Slide 12. All of our capital ratios continued to improve during the third quarter compared to the prior quarter. At September 30, 2010, our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio was 8.0%. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 8.59%, and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 14.26%. We believe our capital position is strong and positions us well for the potential implementation of Basel III and the eventual repayment of the TARP preferred capital in the future. 
That concludes our remarks. And now we'll turn the call back over to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?"

Of that, about $800 million of that $1.1 billion really came from our commercial real estate book. We're going to continue to see commercial real estate loans continue to pay down here. There's improved, I think, liquidity we're seeing in the marketplace. And certainly on the multi-family is doing very well in today's marketplace.

And we are actually starting to see, as Jeff mentioned in his comments particularly in our Great Lakes and Northeastern region, signs of increased new business activity and modest glimmers of loan growth. However on net, you'll still see pressures in the Western markets. They were late into the cycle. But we do see some pickup in business activity and clearly signs of stability in the middle market book, as well as in the core leasing portfolio, which intersects with a lot of that same client base renewed activity."

We have seen that. So the leasing book has stabilized and now it's growing a small amount. As you look at the C&I book, the rate of decline was halved quarter-over-quarter on a linked basis. And conversely, we had a pretty significant step-up in real estate as we strategically de-risk the balance sheet. And obviously, there's a lot of liquidity both in the mortgage market, which we benefited from as a player in the mortgage business, but also just liquidity in the market in general as we take our real estate book down by strategy."

Charge-offs now are less than our pre-provision net revenue. We see that trend can continue. Obviously, that's generating taxable income at that particular point, as well as having the reserve itself come down. So if you think about the reserve itself coming down, and if that generated at the statutory rates for every $1.375 coming off of that, that in and of itself creates less of a deferred tax asset. Profitability on the other hand improves that. So as we look forward, the utilization of any net operating loss carryforwards that have existed at the end of the year, start to also get absorbed. So these are all positive things that contribute to it. And that's why we believe that over the course of the next five quarters that, that this allowed portion of the deferred tax asset will actually be gone."

We've actually, if you look at the reconciliation that's on Page 25 of the press release, we even had valuation adjustments that we took in the current quarter of approximately $7 million that run through.

When we get into the commercial lease financing, there's $1.1 billion of that particular book that are the lilos and silos. And those are going to be around for a number of years. They may have maturities that go out into the 2020. On the marine book, which is about $2.3 billion at the end of the current quarter, that also is a much longer duration. Now that's more predictable as far as cash flows coming off of it. It will continue to probably work its way down from $100 million to $150 million in any given quarter. And we may get additional acceleration of that, if unemployment goes down and if the economy picks up somewhat, as people want to trade up a different boat. So I think if we look at the overall balance sheet, yes, it will come down some here. But it's more going to be driven on the liability side.

In that state, in the past we'd always tried to operate it with the liabilities sense of this position. At these particular raise of how long have been with those rates we remain as that insensitive as of the end of the third quarter in the 3% range. So I think the function of the overall investment portfolio is going to be largely dependent upon the level of funding that we end up with the organization. As I said earlier, it's kind of dependent upon the flow of overall deposit-related activities and loan-related activities. We have that stored liquidity in the investment portfolio to meet future loan demand. We do expect future loan demand in the organization. We will continue to price our deposits also down as we have been doing during the past year, and we should get some continued benefit from that.

So if you look at our coverage ratio, our coverage ratio of nonperformers at this particular point in time is up into the 143%.

They've already been charged down. We've done a lot of the heavy work at this point in time. Plus we're getting further along into the cycle. So we're very aggressive early on in the process and really working a lot of these nonperformers out.

Slide 2 is our Forwarding-Looking Disclosure Statement.  It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question and answer segment of our call today.  
Now, if you turn to Slide 3; this morning we announced Third Quarter Net Income from Continuing Operations of $163 million or $0.19 per common share.  Our positive earnings for the last two quarters resulted in return to profitability for year-to-date results.  The net income from Continuing Operations for the nine-month period of $121 million or $0.14 per common share.  
These third quarter earnings improvements compared to the second quarter was due to higher pre-provision net revenue and a lower provision for loan losses.  
The growth in pre-provision net revenue was the result of a higher net interest margin, well-controlled expenses and improvements in several T-based businesses.  
Credit quality continued to improve across the majority of loan portfolios in both Community Banking and National Banking, reflecting the work that has been done to lower our risk profile and proactively address credit issues.  
Our positive credit trends included net charge offs, which were down for the third consecutive quarter and non-performing loans, which have declined for the last four quarters.  
Our balance sheet continues to reflect strong capital, liquidity and reserve levels.  Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio at September 30 was 8.59% and our Tier 1 risk based capital ratio was 14.26%.  
Key loan-loss allowance at the end of the third quarter was approximately $2 billion, which represented 3.8% of total loans and 143% coverage of non-performing loans.  Both of these rations should maintain our position near the top of our peer group.  
As many of you who have followed our company know, our management team has moved aggressively over the last 18 months to significantly fortify our capital and reserves, lower our risk profile and improve liquidity in funding with a single-minded purpose of emerging from this challenging economic period strong and well positioned to compete and win in the marketplace.  
I believe the trends that we reported today in our pre-provision net revenue demonstrates the progresses being made.  
Our strong capital and liquidity position also enables the company to support the borrowing needs of our clients when the economy expands.  The company originated approximately 8.1 billion in new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses during the quarter and approximately 21 billion year to date through September 30.  
The final item on our strategic update slide, investing in our core relationship business, has been a consistent theme for Key.  Having a strong balance sheet as a solid foundation, we’re continuing to position the company to take advantage of the gradually improving economy.  
In Community Banking, our largest investment is in our 14-state branch network.  We opened 34 new branches in the first nine months of 2010 and expect to open an additional five branches during the fourth quarter, and we have plans to open another 35 to 40 branches in 2011.  
The profitability of our new branches continues to be in line with our expectations.  We have also continued to modernize our existing branches and align staffing with the needs of the segments and the communities that we serve.  
One of the segments that continues to be an area of focus is Business Banking where we have designated 225 branches as business intensive, which are staffed to serve our small business clients.  We are also a significant participant in the FDAs Small Business Loan Program. 
In Retail Banking, we’re focused on deepening our existing relationships and new client acquisition.  During the first nine months of this year we have experienced solid growth in your net new DDA accounts, and have generated a record level of revenue in our brand-based investment group.  
We’re also pleased to receive additional recognition for Key’s online capabilities in a September Edition of Bank Monitor, which ranked us second among the 16 largest U.S. banks for our online account application features.  
The investments in our new and modernized branches, along with the enhancements to the online banking position us to grow as the economy strengthens.  Our improvement in the national banking group is largely driven by improving product trends and the work we have done to reduce our risk profile.  
We’ve also made significant progress in sharpening our focus on targeted client segments, and investing in the right people, and our non-capital intensive businesses.  Year to date, KeyBank capital markets have participated in 41 equity transactions that generated over $40 million in fees.  According to Industry Lead Tables, we have been one of the top regional banks in IPOs and follow-on deals this year, and have played a very active role in the RAIT space. 
We have also seen improvement in M&A Advisor Business since the third quarter of 2009 as more liquidity has returned to the market.  Key is consistently ranked as a top advisor for middle-market M&A transactions.  
And we continue to emphasize areas in National Banking that have synergy with our client segments in the community bank, such as equipment leasing and certain products offered through KeyBank Capital Markets. 
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I want to recognize the important contributions of our employees across Key who have remained focused on serving our clients through what has been an extremely challenging period.  
Our leadership team makes a point to visit a number of our district markets each year and we just returned from a visit to Portland and Seattle, key growth markets where we are making significant investments for our future.  
I personally come away from these visits energized with confidence about the changes that the inner team are implementing in our community banking model.  We are attracting new clients, zeroing in on service and delivery and building the key brand. 
In markets where there has been disruption among competitors, there is additional opportunity.  And again, the perseverance of our front-line banker during this period had been extraordinary.  
As I mentioned earlier, with the significant strategic actions we completed and implemented over the last 18 months, in our capital structure, risk management, expense control and business investments, our confidence in our fundamental strategy builds.  
I remain confident in Key’s future and our ability to serve our clients and make progress towards our long-term financial targets.  
Now I’ll turn the call over to Jeff Weeden for a review of our financial results.  Jeff?

Slide 4 provides a summary of Key’s Third Quarter Financial Results from Continuing Operations.  Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regards to Key’s continuing operations.As Henry mentioned in his comments, fo",1524,"Thank you, Henry.  Slide 4 provides a summary of Key’s Third Quarter Financial Results from Continuing Operations.  Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regards to Key’s continuing operations.
As Henry mentioned in his comments, for the third quarter the company earned a net profit of $0.19 per common share.  This was a result of lower provision for loan losses and both charge offs and non-performing loans decrease from the second quarter levels.  
In addition, the company showed improved pre-provision net revenue as a result of higher revenue and well-controlled expenses.  
The third quarter profit compares to a profit of $0.06 per common share for the second quarter of this year.  
While not noted on this slide, the company’s book value and tangible book value increased again during the third quarter to $9.54 and $8.46 per share respectively up from $9.19 and $8.10 per share at June 30th, 2010.  
On Slide 5 are Key’s long-term targets for success we introduced earlier this year.  On the next several slides I will comment on our progress towards achieving these targets.  
Turning to Slide 6, one of our objects is to be a core-funded institution with a target loan-to-deposit ratio of 90 to 100%.  As of September 30, 2010, our loan-to-deposit ratio was within this targeted range at 92%.  
During the third quarter, the company experienced a $2.5 billion decrease in average total loan balances compared to the second quarter of 2010.  
As we have been commenting on for several quarters, the decline in average balances continues to reflect soft demand for credit and are continued progress on our exit portfolios as we reduce risk in the company.  
We would also note that we are somewhat encouraged by the stabilization we are seeing in the middle market CNI portfolio; specifically, in the Great Lakes and Northeast Region as business begin to make investments to upgrade their production capabilities, or are thinking about acquiring other companies.  And we also experienced growth in our Core Leasing portfolio.  However, at this time, this activity is not expected to be sufficient to offset continued pay downs in the remaining books of business over the next several quarters.  
Looking at our average deposits for the third quarter, we experienced continued improvement in the mix of our deposits as higher costing CDs matured and were repriced to current market rates or moved to other deposit categories or other investment alternatives.  
During the third quarter, we experienced an $800 million increase in the combined average balances of Demand deposits, NOW, Money Market deposit accounts and regular savings accounts compared to the second quarter of this year.  And these balances are up $3.8 billion from the same period one year ago.  
As we have been discussing for the past few quarters, we continue to experience run offs in our CD book, which declined $3.5 billion as higher-yielding certificates of deposits mature and clients look for other alternatives for investing in this low-rate environment.  The decline in CD balances will slow in future quarters as scheduled maturities are smaller going forward. 
Turning to Slide 7, our Asset Quality Statistics continue to improve.  As Henry mentioned in his comments, net charge offs were down again this quarter to $357 million or 2.69% of average loans.  This is still high compared to our long-term target of 40 to 50 basis points, but a significant improvement over prior quarters.  
Non-performing loans were also down again this quarter to $1.4 billion or 2.67% of total loans at September 30th, 2010, and are now down by more than 40% from their peak one year ago.  
We saw market liquidity strengthen in the latter half of the third quarter and used this as an opportunity to continue to move our non-performing assets.  We were also encouraged by the fact that we were able to move these assets close to where they were carried as the assets on the books, net of our reserves or they were marked in the case of other real estate or other non-performing assets.  
As a result of the improvement we experienced in credit quality during the third quarter, the reserve for loan losses declined to $1,957,000,000, or 3.81% of total loan, and represented 143% coverage of non-performing loans at September 30, 2010. 
We currently expect to experience continued improvement in the level of net charge offs and non-performing loans.  As a result, we expect our provision for loan losses to be less than the amount of net charge offs for the fourth quarter of 2010.  
Turning to Slide 8, for the third quarter, the company’s taxable equivalent net interest income was 647 million compared to $623 million in the second quarter of this year.  The net interest margin expanded 18 basis points to 3.35% for the third quarter compared to the second quarter of this year.  Through the third quarter, earning asset yields remain relatively stable, declining 1 basis point to 4.39% while the yield on interest-bearing liabilities declined 24 basis points to 1.46% compared to the second quarter of 2010.  
Benefiting the margin for the third quarter was the redeployment of short-term liquidity into securities available for sale portfolio, the repricing of maturing CDs and an improved mix of deposits on the liability side of the balance sheet.  
The pace of maturities of higher-costing CDs, which benefited the margin the most in the third quarter, slows the fourth quarter of this year to $800 million and slows further in 2011 to a range of $300 million to $500 million per quarter.  
Given the current mix of our assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics, we expect the net interest margin to remain relatively stable in the mid-3.30% range for the fourth quarter of 2010.  
Turning to Slide 9, our other revenue objective is focused on growing non-interest income and maintaining it above 40% of total revenues.  For the third quarter of 2010, total non-interest income was $486 million and represented almost 43% of piece-total revenue.  
During the third quarter, we were very pleased with the strong performance we experienced in Investment Banking revenues.  As shown on Page 20 of today’s Earnings Release, Investment Banking and Capital Market revenues were up $11 million for the quarter and letter of credit and loan fees increased $19 million compared to the second quarter of 2010.
As discussed over the past two quarters, the implementation of Regulation E on July 1 for new clients and on August 15 for our existing clients resulted in a decline in deposit service charges of $5 million for the second quarter level, which was in line with our expectations.  
Turning to Slide 10, we are continuing to make good progress on our Key-Volution savings and through the third quarter we have implemented $224 million on annualized savings towards our goal of $300 million to $375 million by the end of 2012.  
For the third quarter, total non-interest expense was $736 million, down 33 million from the second quarter of 2010, primarily as a result of lower personnel expense and a decline in other real estate expense.  
Personnel expense declined as result of a $12 million credit to the pension expense in the third quarter compared to a $6 million of expense in the second quarter.  We do not expect to record any pension expense in the fourth quarter of 2010.  
OREO expense declined to $4 million from $22 million in the second quarter of this year.  And from a highly-elevated $51 million for the same period one year ago.  
During the third quarter we were successful in selling $63 million of ORE at prices approximating their net curing values.  As a result, ORE expense declined significantly. 
At this point in the cycle, more of the property we are taking posession of has cash flows associated with it, and typically has become easier to sell as liquidity has returned to the market for income producing property.  However, we do expect to see volitility in the amount of ORE expense in future quarters depending upon market conditions.  
Slide 11 shows our pre-provision net revenue and return on average assets.  With the improvement in the net interest margin, and good expense control reviewed on the previous slide, pre-provision net revenue improved by $51 million in the third quarter, to $397 million.  
In addition, coupled with an improved credit cost, our return on average assets increased to 0.93% for the third quarter of 2010; a significant improvement over where the company was operating a few quarters ago.  
And finally, turning to Slide 12, all of our capital ratios continue to improve during the third quarter compared to the prior quarter.  At September 30th, 2010, our tangible common equities, tangible asset ratio was 8.0%.  Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 8.59%, and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 14.26 percent.  
We believe our capital position is strong and positions us well for the potential implementation of Basel III and the eventual repayment of the TARP-preferred capital in the future.  
So that concludes our remarks and now I’ll turn the call over to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of our call.  Operator?

Of that, about 800 million of that 1.2 billion really came from our commercial real estate book.  
We’re going to continue to see commercial real estate loans continue to pay down here.

However, on net you still see pressures in the Western markets.  They were late into the cycle, but we do see some pickup in business activity and clearly signs of stability in the middle market book, as well as in the core leasing portfolio, which intersects with a lot of that same client base of renewed activity.

We have seen that.  So the leasing book has stabilized and now is growing a small amount.  
As you look at the CNI book, the rate of decline was halved, quarter over quarter on a linked basis.  And conversely, we had a pretty significant step up in real estate as we strategically de-risked the balance sheet.  And obviously, there’s a lot of liquidity buzz in the mortgage market, which we’ve benefited from as a player in the mortgage business.  But also just liquidity in the market in general and we take our real estate book down by strategy.

So if you think about the reserve itself coming down and if that generated at the statutory rates for every dollar, $0.37 ½ coming off of that, that in and of itself creates less of a deferred tax asset.  
Profitability on the other hand improves that.

So there ar e all positive things that contribute to it and that’s why we believe that over the course of the next five quarters that the disallowed portion of the deferred tax asset will actually be gone.

So it’s going to be around for a long time.  If you look at the 5.8 billion, it is actually coming down fairly rapidly here over the past six quarters.  So if we look at that particular book, a lot of the stuff that’s going to pay off relatively quickly has done so.  When we get into the commercial needs financing, this 1.1 billion on that particular book that are the LILOs and the SILOs, those are going to be around for a number of years.  They may have maturities that go out into the 2020.  
On the Marine book, which is about 2.3 billion at the end of the current quarter, that also has a much longer duration.  Now, that’s more predictable as far as the cash flow coming off of it and it will continue to probably work its way down from 100 to $150 million in any given quarter.  And we may get additional acceleration of that if unemployment goes down and the economy picks up somewhat as people want to trade up to a different vote.  
So I think if we look at the overall balance sheet, yes it will come down some here, but it’s more going to be driven on the liability side.  So to the extent that we are continuing to take in deposits, we will find a place obviously to put those particular [inaudible] in investments.

Good morning, and welcome to our earnings conference call. Joining me for today's presentation is our CFO, Jeff Weeden; and available for the Q&A portion of our call are our leaders of Community Banking and National Banking, Beth Mooney and Chris Gorman; and our Treasurer, Joe Vayda.
Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure statement. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call today.
Now if you turn to Slide 3. This morning, we announced third quarter net income from continuing operations of $163 million or $0.19 per common share. Our positive earnings for the last two quarters resulted in a return to profitability for our year-to-date results with net income from continuing operations for the nine-month period of $121 million or $0.14 per common share. Key's third quarter earnings improvement compared to the second quarter was due to higher pre-provision net revenue and a lower provision for loan losses. The growth in pre-provision net revenue was the result of a higher net interest margin, well-controlled expenses and improvements in several fee-based businesses. Credit quality continued to improve across the majority of loan portfolios in both Community Banking and National Banking, reflecting the work that has been done to lower our risk profile and proactively address credit issues. Our positive credit trends included net charge-offs, which were down for the third consecutive quarter and nonperforming loans, which have declined for the last four quarters. 
Our balance sheet continues to reflect strong capital liquidity and reserve levels. Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio at September 30 was 8.59%, and our Tier I risk-based capital ratio was 14.26%. Key's loan-loss allowance at the end of the third quarter was approximately $2 billion, which represented 3.81% of total loans and 143% coverage of non-performing loans. Both of these ratios should maintain our position near the top of our peer group.
As many of you who have followed our company know, our management team has moved aggressively over the last 18 months to significantly fortify our capital and reserves, lower our risk profile and improve liquidity and funding with a single-minded purpose of emerging from this challenging economic period, strong and well positioned to compete and win in the marketplace.
I believe the trends that we reported today in our pre-provision net revenue demonstrate the progress that is being made. Our strong capital and liquidity positions also enabled the company to support the borrowing needs of our clients when the economy expands. The company originated approximately $8.1 billion in new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses during the quarter and approximately $21 billion year-to-date through September 30.
The final item on our strategic update slide, investing in our core relationship businesses has been a consistent theme for Key. Having a strong balance sheet as a solid foundation, we're continuing to position the company to take advantage of the gradually improving economy. In Community Banking, our largest investment is in our 14-state branch network. We opened 34 new branches in the first nine months of 2010 and expect to open an additional five branches during the fourth quarter. And we have plans to open another 35 to 40 branches in 2011. The profitability of our new branches continues to be in line with our expectations. 
We have also continued to modernize our existing branches and aligned staffing with the needs of the segments and the communities that we serve. One of the segments that continues to be an area of focus is Business Banking, where we have designated 225 branches as business-intensive, which are staffed to serve our small business clients. We are also a significant participant in the SBA Small Business Loan program.
In Retail Banking, we're focused on deepening our existing relationships and new client acquisition. During the first nine months of this year, we have experienced solid growth in our net new DDA accounts and have generated a record level of revenue in our branch-based investment group. 
We're also pleased to receive additional recognition for Key's online capabilities in the September edition of Bank Monitor, which ranked us second among the 16 largest U.S. banks for our online account application features. The investments in our new and modernized branches, along with the enhancements to the online banking, position us to grow as the economy strengthens. 
Our improvement in the National Banking group is largely driven by improving credit trends and the work we have done to reduce our risk profile. We have also made significant progress in sharpening our focus on targeted client segments and investing in the right people and our non-capital intensive businesses. 
Year-to-date, KeyBanc Capital Markets has participated in 41 equity transactions that generated over $40 million in fees. According to industry league tables, we have been one of the top regional banks in IPOs and follow-on deals this year and have played a very active role in the REIT space. We have also seen improvement in M&A advisory business since the third quarter of 2009 as more liquidity has returned to the market. Key has consistently ranked as a top adviser for middle market M&A transactions. 
And we continue to emphasize areas in National Banking that have synergy with our client segments in the Community Bank, such as equipment leasing and certain products offered through KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I want to recognize the important contributions of our employees across Key, who have remained focused on serving our clients through what has been an extremely challenging period. Our leadership team makes a point to visit a number of our district markets each year. And we just returned from a visit to Portland and Seattle, key growth markets, where we are making significant investments for our future. I personally come away from these visits energized and confident about the changes that our team are implementing in our Community Banking model. We are attracting new clients, zeroing in on service and delivery and building the Key brand. 
In markets where there has been disruption among competitors, there is additional opportunity. And again, the perseverance of our frontline bankers during this period has been extraordinary. 
As I mentioned earlier, with the significant strategic actions we've completed and implemented over the last 18 months in our capital structure, risk management, expense control and business investment, our confidence in our fundamental strategy builds. I remain confident in Key's future and our ability to serve our clients and make progress towards our long-term financial targets. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff Weeden for a review of our financial results. Jeff?"

Slide 4 provides a summary of Key's third quarter financial results from continuing operations. Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to Key's continuing operations. As Henry mentioned in his comments, for the",1519,"Thank you, Henry. Slide 4 provides a summary of Key's third quarter financial results from continuing operations. Unless otherwise noted, our comments today will be with regard to Key's continuing operations. 
As Henry mentioned in his comments, for the third quarter, the company earned a net profit of $0.19 per common share. This was the result of lower provision for loan losses, as both charge-offs and non-performing loans decreased from the second quarter levels. In addition, the company showed improved pre-provision net revenue as a result of higher revenue and well-controlled expenses.
The third quarter profit compares to a profit of $0.06 per common share for the second quarter of this year. While not noted on this slide, the company's book value and tangible book value increased again during the third quarter to $9.54 and $8.46 per share respectively, up from $9.19 and $8.10 per share at June 30, 2010.
On Slide 5 are Key's long-term targets for success we introduced earlier this year. On the next several slides, I will comment on our progress towards achieving these targets.
Turning to Slide 6. One of our objectives is to be a core-funded institution with a targeted loan-to-deposit ratio of 90% to 100%. As of September 30, 2010, our loan-to-deposit ratio was within this targeted range at 92%. During the third quarter, the company experienced a $2.4 billion decrease in average total loan balances compared to the second quarter of 2010. As we have been commenting on for several quarters, the decline in average balances continues to reflect soft demand for credit and our continued progress on our exit portfolios, as we reduced risk in the company. 
We would also note that we are somewhat encouraged by the stabilization we are seeing in the middle market C&I portfolio, specifically in the Great Lakes and Northeast regions, as businesses begin to make investments to upgrade their production capabilities or are thinking about acquiring other companies. And we also experienced growth in our core leasing portfolio. However, at this time, this activity is not expected to be sufficient to offset continued paydowns in the remaining books of business over the next several quarters.
Looking at our average deposits for the third quarter, we experienced continued improvement in the mix of our deposits, as higher-costing CDs matured and were re-priced to current market rates or moved to other deposit categories or other investment alternatives. During the third quarter, we experienced an $800 million increase in the combined average balances of demand deposits, NOW, money market deposit accounts and regular savings accounts compared to the second quarter of this year. And these balances are up $3.8 billion from the same period one year ago. 
As we have been discussing for the past few quarters, we continue to experience runoff in our CD book, which declined $3.5 billion as higher-yielding certificates of deposits mature and clients look for other alternatives for investing in this low-rate environment. The decline in CD balances will slow in future quarters, as scheduled maturities are smaller going forward.
Turning to Slide 7. Our asset quality statistics continue to improve. As Henry mentioned in his comments, net charge-offs were down again this quarter to $357 million or 2.69% of average loans. This is still high compared to our long-term target of 40 to 50 basis points, but a significant improvement over prior quarters. Non-performing loans were also down again this quarter to $1.4 billion or 2.67% of total loans at September 30, 2010, and are now down by more than 40% from their peak one year ago. 
We saw market liquidity strengthen in the latter half of the third quarter and used this as an opportunity to continue to move our nonperforming assets. We were also encouraged by the fact that we were able to move these assets close to where they were carried on the assets on the books net of our reserves, or they were marked in the case of other real estate owned or other nonperforming assets. As a result of the improvement we experienced in credit quality during the third quarter, the reserve for loan losses declined to $1,957,000,000 or 3.81% of total loans and represented 143% coverage of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2010. 
We currently expect to experience continued improvement in the level of net charge-offs and non-performing loans. As a result, we expect our provision for loan losses to be less than the amount of net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Turning to Slide 8. For the third quarter, the company's taxable equivalent net interest income was $647 million compared to $623 million for the second quarter of this year. The net interest margin expanded 18 basis points to 3.35% for the third quarter compared to the second quarter of this year. For the third quarter, earning asset yields remained relatively stable, declining one basis point to 4.39%, while the yield on interest-bearing liabilities declined 24 basis points to 1.46% compared to the second quarter of 2010. 
Benefiting the margin for the third quarter was the redeployment of short-term liquidity into securities available-for-sale portfolio, the re-pricing of maturing CDs and an improved mix of deposits on the liability side of the balance sheet. The pace of maturities of higher-costing CDs, which benefited the margin the most in the third quarter slows in the fourth quarter of this year to $800 million and slows further in 2011 to a range of $300 million to $500 million per quarter. Given the current mix of our assets and liabilities and their re-pricing characteristics, we expect the net interest margin to remain relatively stable in the mid-3.30% range for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Turning to Slide 9. Our other revenue objective is focused on growing non-interest income and maintaining it above 40% of total revenues. For the third quarter of 2010, total non-interest income was $486 million and represented almost 43% of Key's total revenue. 
During the third quarter, we were very pleased with the strong performance we experienced in investment banking revenues. As shown on Page 20 of today's earnings release, investment banking and capital markets revenues were up $11 million for the quarter and letter of credit and loan fees increased $19 million compared to the second quarter of 2010. 
As discussed over the past two quarters, the implementation of Regulation E on July 1 for new clients and on August 15 for our existing clients resulted in a decline in deposit service charges of $5 million from the second quarter level, which was in line with our expectations.
Turning to Slide 10. We are continuing to make good progress on our Keyvolution savings. And through the third quarter, we have implemented $224 million of annualized savings towards our goal of $300 million to $375 million by the end of 2012. For the third quarter, total non-interest expense was $736 million, down $33 million from the second quarter of 2010, primarily as a result of lower personnel expense and a decline in other real estate expense. Personnel expense declined as a result of a $12 million credit to the pension expense in the third quarter compared to a $6 million of expense in the second quarter. We do not expect to record any pension expense in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
OREO expense declined to $4 million from $22 million in the second quarter of this year and from a highly elevated $51 million for the same period one year ago. During the third quarter, we were successful in selling $63 million of ORE at prices approximating their net carrying values. As a result, ORE expense declined significantly. 
At this point in the cycle, more of the property we are taking possession of has cash flows associated with it and typically has become easier to sell as liquidity has returned to the market for income-producing property. However, we do expect to see volatility in the amount of ORE expense in future quarters depending upon market conditions.
Slide 11 shows our pre-provision net revenue and return on average assets. With the improvement in the net interest margin and good expense control reviewed on the previous slide, pre-provision net revenue improved by $51 million in the third quarter to $397 million. In addition, coupled with improved credit costs, our return on average assets increased to 0.93% for the third quarter of 2010, a significant improvement over where the company was operating just a few quarters ago. 
And finally, turning to Slide 12. All of our capital ratios continued to improve during the third quarter compared to the prior quarter. At September 30, 2010, our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio was 8.0%. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 8.59%, and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 14.26%. We believe our capital position is strong and positions us well for the potential implementation of Basel III and the eventual repayment of the TARP-preferred capital in the future. 
That concludes our remarks. And now we'll turn the call back over to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?"

However, on net, you'll still see pressures in the Western markets. They were late into the cycle. But we do see some pickup in business activity and clearly signs of stability in the middle market book, as well as in the core leasing portfolio, which intersects with a lot of that same client base renewed activity."

We have seen that. So the leasing book has stabilized and now it's growing a small amount. As you look at the C&I book, the rate of decline was halved quarter-over-quarter on a linked basis. And conversely, we had a pretty significant step-up in real estate as we strategically de-risk the balance sheet. And obviously, there's a lot of liquidity both in the mortgage market, which we benefited from as a player in the mortgage business, but also just liquidity in the market in general as we take our real estate book down by strategy."

And there's a combination of events that draw that down. One is profitability, obviously, is critical. And then the other part is that the reserve for loan losses, which is a very large portion of the deferred tax asset component, continues to come down. So being profitable and being profitable on a pre-provision less net charge-offs basis, and as well as bringing the reserve on down, improves that particular recognition of that asset. But it should be noted that as we go through the rest of this year as well as through 2011, that particular asset will continue to decrease and should eventually get down to zero."

I think part of the answer was on the last question and that is, as you see reserves coming down, so we have a combination of events here. Charge-offs are coming down. Charge-offs now are less than our pre-provision net revenue. We see that trend can continue. Obviously, that's generating taxable income at that particular point, as well as having the reserve itself come down. So if you think about the reserve itself coming down, and if that generated at the statutory rates for every $1.375 coming off of that, that in and of itself creates less of a deferred tax asset. Profitability on the other hand improves that. So as we look forward, the utilization of any net operating loss carryforwards that have existed at the end of the year, start to also get absorbed. So these are all positive things that contribute to it. And that's why we believe that over the course of the next five quarters that, that this allowed portion of the deferred tax asset will actually be gone."

When we get into the commercial lease financing, there's $1.1 billion of that particular book that are the LILOs and SILOs. And those are going to be around for a number of years. They may have maturities that go out into the 2020. On the marine book, which is about $2.3 billion at the end of the current quarter, that also is a much longer duration. Now that's more predictable as far as cash flows coming off of it. It will continue to probably work its way down from $100 million to $150 million in any given quarter. And we may get additional acceleration of that, if unemployment goes down and if the economy picks up somewhat, as people want to trade up to a different boat.

I would state, that in the past we'd always tried to operate it with the liabilities sense of this position. At these particular raise of how long have been with those rates we remain as that insensitive as of the end of the third quarter in the 3% range. So I think the function of the overall investment portfolio is going to be largely dependent upon the level of funding that we end up with the organization. As I said earlier, it's kind of dependent upon the flow of overall deposit-related activities and loan-related activities. We have that stored liquidity in the investment portfolio to meet future loan demand. We do expect future loan demand in the organization. We will continue to price our deposits also down as we have been doing during the past year here, and we should get some continued benefit from that.

So if you look at our coverage ratio, our coverage ratio of nonperformers at this particular point in time is up into the 143%. If you look at where we have the assets recorded, in other words, we've already taken on our total nonperforming loan book, we've already taken charge-offs against that of probably close to $690 million to $700 million, just against the nonperforming loan components. They've already been charged down. We've done a lot of the heavy work at this point in time. Plus we're getting further along into the cycle. So we're very aggressive early on in the process and really working a lot of these nonperformers out. If you go back to the second quarter of 2008, that's when we have our big sale of our residential commercial real estate in that particular point in time. And so we started recognizing losses there is that it moving assets in that particular point in time. So as we move forward here into the balance throughout 2010 and into 2011, we're still expecting to have provision expense. So I know there's some hypothetical things that we're talking about as to what we thought that would be. But again, as you  get closer and closer here through the cycle, we have targeted a 40 to 50 basis point range of net charge-offs that were targeting, that is predicated on the fact that we have made so many changes in the composition of our loan portfolio. We've continued to de-risk it over the past three years, not just the past two years. Really the past three years, we continue to de-risk this company with respect to those particular portfolios."
