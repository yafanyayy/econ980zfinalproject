Today, I'm going to talk about what we are currently seeing in our markets, our outlook for fundamentals throughout 2010 and how we plan to reposition our asset base in the future. Bill will have more on our financial results and guidance for 2010 in a moment.
As we enter 2010, we are cautiously optimistic. On the one hand, markets are improving and the dynamics in the business point to better days ahead. On the other hand, we are acutely aware of the macro environment, tremendous capacity still left in the economy, unemployment continuing to plague us in many areas of the world and rising government debt with no near-term solution. These are problems that will not go away soon and we are continuously assessing their potential impact on our business. However, with that as a backdrop, let's talk about what we are seeing in our industry.
In our third quarter conference call, we noted that our global markets were beginning to show some signs of stability. In Q4, we saw continuation of this trend. For the first time in five quarters, we saw positive net demand of just over 3 million square feet in the top 31 North American markets.
In Europe, we saw a similar trend in our markets with positive net demand of 3.5 million square feet. Delivery still outpaced net demand in the U.S., resulting in a slight drop in occupancies, but that trend should reverse itself in Q1 or Q2 this year as new deliveries will slow to a trickle.
In Europe, occupancies were flat from Q3 to Q4. Overall market rents are still soft, of course and they will be until occupancies rise. However, they too are stabilizing as leasing volumes pick up. It's interesting to note that ProLogis's overall leasing volume was up 9.4% in Q4 over Q3.
Now there are three things we are seeing in the markets today that point to a potentially better environment. First, a complete lack of new supply. Second, rising construction costs. And third, higher expected rates of return. Those three characteristics are inconsistent with the soft rental environment that we see today. And of course, without an increase in demand these factors are less relevant, but with net new demand, they could have a significant impact. So let me explain.
As a general statement since 2007, market rents declined by roughly 20% globally, while cap rates rose by about 20 to 25%. Under those conditions, there should not be a substantial amount of new development unless buildings could be built for 40% or so less than they could two years ago. And of course that hasn't happened, so new supply is virtually nonexistent.
Consider that the starts in the top North American markets that we track, totaled only 12 million square feet in 2009 and almost all of it was build to suit. The lowest level of starts in the last 25 years was about 50 million square feet in 1992. So 2009 starts were about 75% below the lowest level seen in 25 years. In addition, even with leasing volumes improving, we expect 2010 will have a similarly low level of supply because current lease rates just don't pencil vis-a-vis costs and return expectations.
So what about construction costs? Well, they are lower since contractors are out of work and land prices are down. Last year, we could build in most areas of the world for about 20% below 2007 prices. But a 20% drop in cost cannot make up for a 20% drop in rent and a 20 to 25% change in expected yields and the current environment is changing. Emerging markets are heating up again, so costs are on the rise.
Steel is up 15% since October. Asphalt is up substantially with oil now at $75 a barrel. Only concrete is expected to remain flat this year. Overall, we expect a 5 to 7% increase in hard costs in most areas of the world in 2010.
Now some believe the market is far too oversupplied with good product already with a long way to go before conditions are tight enough to require new facilities. Perhaps, but that depends on your view how quickly demand picks up. In our product type, this real estate downturn was demand and capital driven, not supply driven. And while net demand contracted in 2009, there was still positive absorption in new state of the art facilities at the expense of second generation buildings. This is particularly true in Europe and Japan where functional obsolescence is a bigger driver of demand.
In the U.S., net absorption and growth in industrial space has historically had a direct correlation to real GDP growth. It's a very simplistic analysis, but for every 1% increase in real U.S. GDP, we believe there is a need for additional 50 million square feet of space.
Estimates for 2010 real GDP growth ranged from 2 to 3%. And if this is achieved, it will go a long way toward bringing occupancies in line with historical averages. Add to that annual obsolescence and ongoing supply chain reconfiguration and we could have a dramatically different occupancy picture in 12 to 24 months, aided in large part by the complete lack of new supply.
So what does this mean for us? Well, at a minimum, it argues for continued stability. And down the road, it potentially argues for new development and thus rising rental rates and rising values. We will see. It does depend on demand. But we are finally seeing large blocks of new space being absorbed, with still no new supply to fill the void.
In recent weeks, we've signed some of the largest leases done during the largest leases done during the last 12 to 18 months in several markets including the U.K., Hungary, Tokyo, Las Vegas, Indianapolis and the Inland Empire. In fact, we are working a number to build to suit proposals because certain sizes of new space in certain locations are becoming scarce.
In the second half of 2009, we signed build to suits with a total expected investment of over $336 million because our customers lack available choices. This year, we expect to double that, with about 80% to 90% of this new development occurring in either Asia or Europe.
In addition, many companies are beginning to talk again about sustainability. The number of companies with environmental agendas is accelerating and just two weeks ago, the SEC mandated that companies begin disclosing the impact of climate change on their businesses. It's clear that environmental stewardship is not a fad and we believe particularly as the economy recovers, it will continue to drive the need for new efficient facilities and accelerate the obsolescence of older ones.
As for institutional demand, investors have definitely increased their appetite for industrial product and are beginning to talk of real estate as an inflation hedge. Since last summer, average prices for industrial real estate have risen by about 10% because there are more buyers than sellers. There is a sense now that prices per square foot are as cheap as they will get, that customer demand will soon increase and cash flows will have to rise down the road as a result.
So given this increase in institutional demand and lack of product on the market, we will look to strategically reposition our direct owned asset base over the next few years through leverage neutral capital recycling. While our cash flow from operations covers maintenance CapEx and dividends, we plan to fund our capital needs through selective third party sales of second generation and non-core product that we own in the U.S.
We will also continue to make some contributions into our property funds. We plan to recycle the proceeds in the new primarily build-to-suit development which we intend to hold on our balance sheet. This approach will allow us to achieve three objectives. First, retain more of our development, thereby decreasing the age of our wholly owned asset pool.
Second, improve the geographic diversification of our wholly owned asset pool as most of our planned developments are in international markets. And third, monetize our land bank more quickly as we can respond to RFPs without regard to third party takeouts.
In summary, we remain cautious on the macro environment, but are encouraged by early signs of fundamental improvement in our business. Customer demand is picking up. Asset pricing has improved. Our work to stabilize our balance sheet is substantially complete and we are now shifting our focus to positioning ourselves to take advantage of the opportunities that we see on the horizon. And while 2010 will still be a tough year from an earnings perspective, we believe there is significant potential for us to enhance cash flow, improve portfolio diversification and create long term value for our shareholders.
Now, let me turn it over to Bill.

As I have said before, 2009 was an extremely complicated and challenging year as it relates to reporting our results. However, we expect 2010 to be substantially cleaner and we hope to simplify things for our investor audience.
With that as a precursor, I would like to cover three topics today. First is, our 2009 results relative to our previous guidance with particular emphasis on Q4. Second, I will review our 2010 guidance and the underlying key assumptions. And third, I will briefly touch on our balance sheet and fund debt positioning.
For the full year 2009, we generated FFO excluding significant non-cash items of $1.15 per share. Adding back $0.26 in one time or nonrecurring costs as outlined in our press release resulted in FFO excluding non-cash items and nonrecurring costs of $1.41 for the year, at the mid-point of our previous guidance of $1.39 to $1.43.
Let me dive a little deeper into Q4 2009, to give a perspective on both the magnitude and type of adjustments made as well as to better outline the earnings potential for the company. In Q4 2009, we generated $0.23 per share in FFO, excluding significant non-cash items and non-recurring charges. I will talk more about those adjustments in a minute.
First, let me shed some light on the nature of the $0.23 per share. That number includes roughly $0.08 in gains on disposition of real estate properties, all of which represent gains off of original gross book basis. Removing the gains will provide a core Q4 FFO of roughly $0.15 or $0.60 on an annualized basis.
Before I walk through how this translates to 2010 performance, let me address the non-cash and nonrecurring charge adjustments made in Q4. As noted on page 1.4 of the supplemental, during the quarter we recorded approximately 369 million or $0.78 per share in impairments and other non-cash charges. The principal components of these adjustments were $136 million on land that we have targeted for sale in 2010 and beyond. These impairments represent approximately a 30% reduction from an original book basis of $438 million.
$54 million on retail properties and ground leases acquired as part of the Catellus merger targeted for sale or redevelopment in 2010. $115 million related to the write-down on our investments in a retail joint venture in Europe, which principally holds land positions in the U.K. and CEE. And $28 million representing our investment in two of our Eaton Vance Funds.
On the non-recurring charge front, we incurred just over $45 million or $0.10 per share in charges in Q4 that we consider as non-recurring, the principal components of which were about $14.5 million in legal tax and investment banking fees related to our bond consent solicitation, which was completed in October. $20 million associated with a trueup of indemnities we have provided to several of our funds.
Liabilities were set up for these obligations, but due to the current leasing environment, we revisited the original releasing assumptions and adjusted accordingly. $13 million was related to settlement costs associated with an obligation assumed in the Catellus merger agreement. And finally, there were a small number of other items that added approximately $2 million to FFO on a net basis that we considered as not repeatable.
Now turning to 2010 guidance, we expect 2010 FFO to be in a range of $0.74 to $0.78 per share with approximately $0.10 of that from gains on dispositions or contributions and $0.64 to $0.68 from core operations. Earnings per share are expected to be $0.25 to $0.29.
As we discussed and displayed in our November NAREIT presentation and subsequent investor conference presentation, we believe we have substantial upside FFO potential from the development portfolio and land assets currently on our balance sheet. However, realization of that upside will occur over the next two to four years.
Offsetting a portion of this upside is higher net interest expense based on lower capitalized interest, the effect of which occurs virtually immediately. Therefore, in relating our 2010 guidance back to our Q4 2009 annualized core FFO run rate of $0.60 per share. The run rate FFO will increase as a result of more of a full year effect of the development portfolio lease up accomplished in 2009 as well as incremental lease up of our development portfolio in 2010.
Additionally, we expect larger development management fees to result from our renewable energy group as well as an increased focus on construction management activities for third parties. These increases in 2010 will be offset to a degree, as we expect to see a continued decrease in same-store NOI based on lease rollovers in the current environment. A as well as a decrease in capitalized interest costs associated with the completion of our existing development portfolio.
Finally, as I will talk about a minute, we expect new development activity to pick up as 2010 progresses and to fund this activity through disposition of assets off our balance sheet. In order to mitigate risk associated with that development activity, it is likely that we will be selling assets slightly ahead of the income generation from the development activity which is dilutive to FFO in 2010.
In looking at the approximately $0.10 per share, we expect in gains for 2010, roughly 40% of that is expected from our Japan operations, 25% is related to an expectation of recapture from 2009 contributions into PEP 2 and the remainder is associated with a variety of targeted building, land and ground lease sales.
Contrary to popular opinion and as we have said in the past, we believe gains from our development activity will be a recurring source of FFO and will grow over time.
Earlier today, we released a document that outlines the business drivers that support our 2010 guidance, the more significant of which I will quickly review for those who don't have that summary readily available.
From a leasing standpoint, we expect to see a 1.5 to 2.5% increase in overall leasing percentage within the total portfolio, i.e., the core development and investment management portfolios on a combined basis.
For the core portfolio, month-to-month and expiring leases represent 15.3% of annualized base rent. We anticipate effective rents on turnovers to be down 10 to 12% and average retention of 65 to 70%. In our investment management business, month-to-month in expiring leases represent 13% of annualized base rents with expected rents on turnovers down a similar 10 to 12% and retention of 70 to 75%.
Same-store NOI, which we report in the aggregate for both direct and fund properties is expected to decrease by 1.5 to 3%, reflecting the continued negative rent growth. We anticipate starting 700 to $800 million of new development. This development combined with land sales is expected to monetize approximately 350 million to $400 million of land.
We expect contributions and dispositions of land, core portfolio assets and development portfolio assets to total 1.3 to $1.5 billion for the year. Roughly 60% of this amount is related to planned dispositions or contributions of U.S. assets with the remainder divided roughly equally between Europe and Asia.
On the expense side, gross G&A is expected to be down roughly 7% with total capitalized G&A in amounts reported as rental and investment management expenses in line with 2009 levels. Gross interest expense is expected to be roughly flat for 2009 with net interest expense increasing by 10 to 12% principally as a result of lower level of capitalized interest.
With these drivers in mind, there are two questions that I would have if I were in your shoes. The first is, are you done with impairments and other adjustments? And the second is, how could 2010 look better or worse?
The answer to the question on whether we will have further impairments is maybe. But we do not believe anywhere near the degree that we saw in 2008 and 2009. Our primary focus continues to be on growing NAV and establishing a framework for long-term FFO growth.
In that vein, we will seek to monetize land assets through outright sale as quickly and prudently as possible and will sell and contribute additional assets to third parties and two funds, none of which are currently targeted to be at losses in 2010. However, depending on valuations and circumstances, we may incur incremental impairments or losses.
The answer to the second question will evolve over the course of the year. But in simple form, we could see accretion to our guidance FFO from improved economic conditions, quicker than expected lease up of our development portfolio and a weakening dollar.
We can see dilution to our FFO guidance from weaker than expected economic conditions sooner, rather than later debt refinancing activities or a strengthening dollar.
Finally, turning to our financing activities. On the balance sheet, we far surpassed our goal of reducing direct debt by $2 billion by the end of 2009. Our year-end direct debt balance of roughly 7.9 billion represents a total decrease of 2.7 billion from December 2008.
Overall debt increased by about 275 million compared with where we ended Q3. However, overall liabilities remained essentially flat as we used a portion of the October bond issuance to pay off approximately $190 million to the IRS related to the Catellus tax audit.
We also made investments of $49 million related to our share of the North American industrial fund capital call through which the fund prepaid debt at a substantial discount and $59 million in PEPR related to the purchase of convertible preferred units, which yield 10.5%.
Our 2010 and 2011 balance sheet debt maturities are relatively modest 233 million and $190 million respectively as a result of our focus in 2009. As I noted in our Q3 call, the next hurdle is related to 2012 and 2013 direct debt maturities and this is not lost on us. But as we stated then, we are evaluating alternatives. We have proven access to the capital markets and intend to address the vast majority of those maturities no later than mid-2011.
Turning to fund debt, we had a very busy fourth quarter 2009, reducing our 2010 fund debt maturities from $2.5 billion at September 30 to $1.6 billion as of December 31. It has been an equally busy beginning to 2010 as we have closed on multiple financings in the last 30 days and the 2010 fund debt maturities have been reduced to approximately 775 million since the beginning of the year.
We have a specific action planned on each of these pieces of debt, the vast majority of which will be refinanced or paid off by June 30. In short, our fund debt profile is much like that of our direct debt. We have substantially addressed 2010 maturities and have relatively modest 2011 maturities.
To wrap up, we see 2010 as a year to establish a baseline for core operations, upon which we can and will grow. We are less focused on FFO in 2010 than we are on creating value and setting ourselves up to take advantage of opportunities to grow the business long term in a prudent matter.
Now let me turn it back to Walt.

The other thing I would say is candidly, if you look at $2 billion of development still -- actually it's $1.7 billion but on lease, but in addition to that we have got those building that were leased last year and we still don't have cash flow and that will be trickling in this year and into next year.
And then you got $2.5 billion of land that we will monetize over time. We think there is tremendous upside in that AFFO. So candidly, while we think it's about at the dividend at this point, slightly above it, we aren't concerned about where the dividend is.

Interestingly enough and I'm going to ask Ted to comment alongside me with this. But what we were seeing in build to suit yields right now are somewhere between 8.5 and 9% and as low as 8. But most of the deals we're looking at are 8.5 and 9. And one deal we did last year was closer to 10. And that by the way is without land at 100% basis, okay.
And what we are seeing on the ability to sell second generation assets into the market, depending how well leased they are obviously depending on where they are and the like because it could be a wide dispersion. But we were thinking those cap rates will be from the low eights to potentially, depending on how old the assets are to high eights and maybe even low nines, okay.
And so it really depends on the blend. But honestly, we are thinking about it as more of an even trade than anything at this point. And in fact, if you consider the fact that the land is already on our balance sheet it's actually accretive from an overall cash flow perspective. So that I think that's the plus.
What Bill was referring to in his comments regarding dilution is that, let's assume we do 700 to 800 million of development this year, we are going to probably pay for roughly, on a half year basis we pay for half of it, because we wouldn't start it all immediately and you got half of it next year.
While, our view is that we'd like to capitalize those developments now, meaning that if we can sell assets in advance of that and be debt neutral and actually in fact in the short term you end up being debt positive, because you basically pay down your line in advance of your development costs but that will be dilutive.
But the overall stabilization of that development vis-a-vis the cap rates that we think we can get will be pretty much a push. And then I am going to ask Ted, you want to make any comments along those lines in terms what we are seeing?

We are in over 100 markets and in over 100 markets, you are going to see some reasonable number of opportunities. Certainly less today than we saw two years ago. There is more interest and demand out there, than I think most people think and certainly than what we anticipated. Japan obviously yields would be less. But if we were to match buildings in Japan up with debt, I think our leverage returns will end up kind of blending that out. So that it again becomes a relatively neutral trade. The reason it's a neutral trade is we are doing development and we are getting a higher yield because of development.
If we actually sell and contribute assets in the U.S. and buy assets in Europe or Japan that would be more dilutive. And we are real encouraged by what we are seeing on the markets and improving the overall quality of our portfolio long-term.

We're meeting the market, I mean where people all -- you can call it aggressive in call it whatever you want. We're meeting the market and we're leasing our space. That's our primary goal and primary focus. As our portfolio gets more occupied, call it 92 to 93%, we will certainly take a look at ways to increase rents.
We believe that day is coming. There is no new supply. There is no new supply being brought to the markets. We are encouraged by that dynamic, with GDP growth we think there will be net new demand, I think there will be net new demand overall and throughout the world in the next few years, no new supply coming in line. We were hoping to have the opportunity to push rents as Walt talked about in his remarks. Costs -- Although they have come down, they have not come down enough to offset what has been a drop in rent in movement and cap rates.
And clearly there will be an increase in rents at the point in time when new development starts to take place. We are seeing that in our build to suit transactions and we are seeing in a few other transactions that are going on in the market that are build to suits, rents on the build to suit projects are higher than what you can lease a current vacant building for. Makes sense to us. We think that's going to, that's how it will play out over time.
So in the trends pretty much throughout the world, Japan is still a very strong market for us. All building that we are -- we built in Japan for the most part are leasing at its kind of the pace at which we anticipated. We are getting the type of rents we anticipated. One nice dynamic in Japan is costs are down there. So on newer development deals, we're actually seeing a pick up in yield. And then in the balance of the world that we work within, I think it's relatively consistent with that of the U.S. and Europe are relatively in the same boat right now.

In Houston, we maintained above 95% occupancy for the last several quarters. We have other markets that are similar to that and that's bearing out in the fundamentals in those markets. We don't expect rents to turn immediately in those markets, but it's promising. Additionally, activity levels globally have improved slightly. It's still a little bit lumpy in various markets. But for the most part, we were starting to see activity, which would translate into hopefully higher occupancies and some potential rent growth say couple quarters from now, as opposed to immediately.

And so but let me purely from a book basis, we look at it and say we want to be in the low to mid-40s on a straight balance sheet perspective. Given some of the leverage in a couple of the funds, we look at it on a look through basis in the 45 to 50% levered basis.
We believe that sort of level would provide us the opportunity ultimately for ratings upgrades if we can combine that, which we will in terms of increased FFO off the non-income producing assets today, to hit the interest coverage targets. And so that's where we are sort of planning things. In terms of how to deal with 2012 and '13 maturities, in the grand scheme of things, we said to be we are going to deal with it. And then we have access to a variety of I mean virtually every part of the capital market spectrum last year.
We probably intend to do the same in 2010 and 2011. And right now, at least before everybody went into a blackout, the debt markets were pretty vibrant, the convert markets are vibrant. And so we intend to look at the spectrum of alternatives and pursue those and we'll give us a good opportunity to extend out debt maturities at the most reasonable cost. Clearly as we talked about, we have -- one of our objectives is to level out our debt maturities in a substantially better fashion than we dealt with in the past.
And if you look out there right now, we've got a hold of 2017 and so seven year deal would be right up our alley. We clearly have a whole 10 years out. And Simon accessed the 30 year market and so we are looking at everything out there. And hang on and you will see.

So we are big bulk distribution guys and over the 25 years that I have been in the business. Bulk distribution has always done incredibly well, vis-a-vis the other two product types, because it's not heavily capital intensive. It tends to be usable to or I should say flexible to a lot of different users and that's why we invest in it.
And that's why candidly, you read a lot of these occupancy numbers or vacancy numbers that are out there. People say, well industrial markets are 13 to 14% vacant. That's a bunch of baloney. It might be, but it is our product type. Not for class B or class A product.

We have done a phenomenal job and we are getting recognized for that in terms how we managed these assets through this difficult period both in terms of occupancy and driving NOI.

Our partner asked us to take portfolios of two of those funds out to market and once we did that we had to take a look at those and what our expectations were for sales et cetera and look more deeply at is there an impairment associated with those.

On the NA III its Lehman is our partner. We probably joked a lot about Lehman a year ago from the standpoint we couldn't get hold of anybody. Candidly, Lehman has been a great partner. Together, we both put in money into NA III, paid down the portion of the mezz loan that State Street Bank has and again those funds are cash flowing well with no real near term debt maturities and so we feel pretty good about NA III.

This morning I will try to keep my comments brief and talk about business fundamentals and progress towards our key focus areas with the objective of leaving more time for Q&A. Bill will have more on our financial results, balance sheet and guidance for the remainder of 2010. 
Overall I would say that Q1 deals a bit like Q4 last year. We hear great things about the recovery and we believe it will have a positive impact on our performance but industrial tends to lag the overall economy and we are not seeing it just yet. 
Right now our business deals like the tale of two cities. On the one hand, the operating environment is still soft, although it feels like it has hit bottom. Our operational results for the quarter beared this out. Rental rates were down by about the same amount as in Q4 and the lease percentage in our total industrial operating portfolio was flat compared to Q4. This reflects a slightly more than expected drop in leasing within our investment management and core direct-owned portfolios offset by a better than expected 500 basis point increase in the lease percentage of our completed development. 
Now on the other hand, values have risen, buyers are plentiful and there is rising activity and optimism in the market. In addition, there is virtually no new supply and our development business is picking up abroad very nicely. Many of our customers are talking expansion for the second half of this year, we will see. It certain feels like brighter days are ahead and if history were to repeat itself, fundamentals should improve by the third or fourth quarter as inventory levels rise in accordance with a growing global economy. 
Overall our FFO per share for the quarter was about $0.01 below our expectations. As we have said in the past, annual FFO will be significantly backend weighted. We believe we will end the year in line with our original FFO guidance after adjusting for dilution from our bond offering. However, what’s important is that we continue to stay focused and execute on three basic things, all of we are making good progress on; first, converting our non-income producing assets into income producing assets; second, creating value through accretive development which helps us accomplish our first objective by monetizing land; and third, continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. 
Bill will have more on the third objective, so let me cover progress on the first two. The most impactful thing we can do right now is lease space in our existing portfolio. Nine months ago, leasing in our total industrial operating portfolio, which is basically everything not under development, was 87.7%. That number, of course, was significantly weighted down by our completed developments. At the end of the first quarter, total leasing in that same portfolio was 89.2%. No doubt market conditions have been challenging but we are pleased with the progress we have made. In the future, we will reach a lease percentage in the low-to-mid 90% range. That will generate over $175 million in additional annual FFO or $0.35 per share. That's real future cash flow. 
In addition, we are growing our development business and in turn reducing our land bank. Last year, that seemed like a daunting task. This year it certainly seems more doable. Opportunities particularly in international markets are increasing. These markets are starved for new product. And while overall conditions are still soft, much of the vacancies especially in Europe are in older obsolete buildings. We set a goal to start $700 million to $800 million of new development this year primarily from build-to-suit. Right now that goal looks very achievable. 
In the first quarter we signed two build-to-suits, one in the UK and one in Hungary. We also started 1.5 million square foot development in Tokyo which will not be completed till next year. Already we have letters of intent for over a third of the building. Total development starts for the first quarter were $252 million. As important given where cap rates are today, we expect to generate over $60 million of NAV accretion from fourth and first quarter starts with land put in the developments at our original book basis. 
In addition, we signed four feed development transactions for customers totaling $81 million. Two of the buildings were in Germany, one was in France and one was in Sweden. In one case, we saw land as a part of the overall transaction. Importantly, that land was sold at a 3% profit to our original basis. For the quarter, we sold a total of $447 million of land. So when you combine land sales with land moved into development, we were able to monetize $138 million of land in the first quarter, now that’s progress. 
The rest of the year is shaping up as well. Since the end of the quarter, we signed two new build-to-suits totaling $125 million and have another seven build-to-suits in negotiation. 
Given the environment we have been in, it can be easy to overlook the long-term value creation potential of our development franchise, we understand that. But for us, it’s one of our core competencies. In combination with strong customer relationships, our development business has great upside potential right now, especially with improving market conditions. Our goal is to unlock that value over time while monetizing our land bank and leasing our non-income producing assets. When we succeeded this, earnings and NAV growth will follow. 
Now let me turn it over to Bill.

Similar to Walt, I am going to try to keep my commentary relatively brief and just hit the key points.

Similar to Walt, I am going to try to keep my commentary relatively brief and just hit the key points. 
I am going to cover three aspects of the company's financial position this morning; first, the summary of our Q1 results; second, our guidance for the year with some brief insight into the things that we expect will impact the next three quarters; and lastly, some comments on our balance sheet and fund debt initiatives. 
We reported $0.01 per share in FFO for Q1 2010. Negatively impacting our reported results was approximately $53 million or $0.12 per share in charges associated with our bond and convert buybacks in Q1 as well as a loss on settlement of a derivative in one of our fronts. 
After adding back these charges, we effectively generated $0.13 per share in FFO for the quarter, which was about $0.01 below our internal expectations. Of the $0.13, $0.02 per share is gain related and $0.11 represents core FFO. The core FFO was $0.01 below our internal expectation principally due to the strength of the dollar versus the euro and lower expected occupancies. There were also a variety of expenses incurred in Q1 that will be non recurring including the one-time tax charge and increased rental expenses associated with the harsh winter.
Relative to full year FFO guidance, our original guidance for 2010 was a range of $0.74 to $0.78 per share. We have decided to expand the range of our guidance to $0.70 to $0.78 per share to take into account the dilutive effects from the debt issuance in March. The revised guidance still excludes the charge of $0.12 in the first quarter related to the buyback and other capital markets activity. 
Relative to our core FFO, we are lowering our estimates to a range of $0.55 to $0.60 per share from our original guidance of $0.64 to $0.68 per share, representing a decrease of $0.0085 per share at the midpoint of the core FFO ranges. 
The principal contributing factors to the decrease are approximately $0.03 to $0.04 dilution associated with the debt offering, approximately $0.0025 associated with lower capitalized cost resulting from our expectation of a lag in the timing of development cost outlay, mitigated somewhat by accretion from a delay in the timing of asset sales, the proceeds of which will ultimately be used to fund the development cost. We expect to about $0.03 dilution to our original forecast from the combination of a stronger than expected dollar, lower than expected occupancy experienced in Q1, higher rental expenses in Q1 and the one-time tax charge.
Finally we will pick up a little more than $0.01 in FFO from our increased investment in PEPR, net of increased borrowing cost. Of the net decrease of $0.0085 just outlined, we believe approximately $0.04 to $0.05 is of a more permanent nature, i.e. the debt offering dilution and potentially the FX while the remainder is either one-time cost or merely a result of a lag of one or two quarters in timing. 
Achievement of the targeted core FFO will be dependent on seeing a recovery in occupancy in the second half of the year as well as implementation on our development activity. From a gain perspective, we expect to generate an additional $0.05 to $0.07 in increased FFO from certain assets that have been targeted per sale or contribution due to increasing values as well as gains from other opportunities that we are working on. 
As we have communicated since February, we expect the core FFO to be backend loaded this year, which is driven principally by our expectation of recovering occupancy and an increase in capitalized cost associated with the ramp up of development activity later this year. 
We have never guided specifically to quarterly results. However, given the disconnect between the sell side quarterly estimates and our internal estimates, let me give a little insight. 
Q2 will likely see a pickup in core FFO from continued leasing and occupancy within the completed development portfolio and reduced tax expense. However we expect Q2 and Q3 to be our low points for capitalization of cost associated with our development activity, which will mitigate a portion of the increases. We expect Q3 and Q4 to show the beginning of the recovery and occupancy in the funds and direct-owned core portfolio as well as continued occupancy pickup from the development portfolio with capitalized cost increasing in Q4 associated with our development activity. 
Additionally as most of asset sales are now targeted to close in late Q3 or Q4, core FFO in Q4 will likely be flat to Q3 and pick up again in 2011 upon completion in occupancy within our build-to-suit pipeline. 
Finally we expect little or no gain on dispositions to be realized in Q2 with our remaining targeted gains realized roughly equally in Q3 and Q4. I hope this bit of insight helps. However I realize that's never enough.
Let me turn to our balance sheet debt and fund related debt briefly. Our balance sheet debt increased in Q1 by a little over $100 million principally associated with our acquisition of incremental units in PEPR. As a result of our debt offerings and buyback activity, we made great progress on smoothing out debt maturities with the focus on reducing 2012 and 2013. We believe these maturities are at acceptable risk levels at this point and therefore, while we intend to be opportunistic, if the situation presents itself in 2010, we will likely put further activity on these maturities on the back burner until 2011. 
Finally, we do intend to continue our delevering efforts through a variety of activities. 
Turning to the fund debt, at March 31st, we had $738 million in remaining 2010 maturities, of which $330 million has been refinanced so far in April. And the vast majority of the remainder will be refinanced or paid off by midsummer if not by June 30. We see no issues associated with dealing with these maturities. 
Let me conclude by making it clear that in 2010 we are most heavily focused on growing the NAV of the company and near term FFO generation may suffer a bit as a result. However, we believe that moves we have made and other that we are focused on for the rest of the year will make ProLogis sustainably profitable and growth oriented in the future. 
Thank you. Let me turn it back over Walt to wrap up.
Walt Rakowich: Thanks, Bill. So before I open it up for Q&A, let me just leave you with one final thought. We understand what we have to do and we continue to make progress in doing it. It’s dangerous to get too focused on where the market is today. We know we have to address today’s market but we are optimistic that it will improve. Our mission in the meantime is to stay focused on our near term objectives. They are converting non-income producing assets into income producing assets, creating NAV through accretive development which helped to accomplish the first as it relates to land and continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. 
As I said before, our successful execution of these three objectives will drive substantial value in the future. We look forward to giving you an update on our progress next quarter. 
Thank you. Operator, we are ready to open up the line.

I think we have communicated constantly over the last 12 or 15 months. We have a large portion of non-income producing assets on the balance sheet, the way of our land bank and the unleashed portion in our development pipeline. And we are working hard, we have made fabulous progress associated with that. And at that conclusion of those monetization and leasing efforts, our core FFO is going to well exceed what’s necessary to fund the dividend. The gains associated with various transaction activities from a basic REIT level are intended to be distributed to shareholders. 
And so, generating the AFFO through a combination of core and gains is just fine by us right now. And so, as we look out - there is nothing in our radar that would adjust the dividend negatively given the activity that we have going and over the next 18 months or so, we believe that the core FFO in and of itself will more than amply cover the dividend.

I think we are reasonably positive based on discussions that we had with customers. We do survey our customers on a quarterly basis. And late last year, they were telling us that they felt that they would be expanding by the second half of the year and interestingly enough when we talked to them again, they are pretty much saying the same thing. 
So we feel pretty convicted about the other thing that we see is if you look at the fact that we are starting $250 million of development, and last year we started $330 million of development, I mentioned that this is almost like a tale of two cities, on one hand in the core portfolio, it’s basically flat to down slightly. On the other hand, you have got this lack of supply that's in the market and you do have customers that are sort of snooping around and starting to sign build-to-suit type transactions and I think that that clearly just by looking at the development and the fact that we just signed another $125 million by the - between the end of the quarter and that this sort of last three weeks. 
I think it’s a pretty good indication that there is activity. If you talk to brokerage firms and one in particular who we talk with prior to the conference call, they will tell you that their book overall of business is up somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 20%. Now the interesting thing is that that’s activity and not necessarily net absorption. But activity nine times out of 10 does lead to net absorption. So whoever you talk to out in the market, they are feeling a lot better but the truth to matter is that we tend to lag six months to maybe nine months behind. First, the companies create sales and then they increase inventories generally speaking.
So we will see but we are feeling a lot better about what we are seeing out there. And I don’t know, Chuck or Ted, if you guys want to add to that.

What surprised us a little bit was the 30 basis point drop in the core. Candidly what surprised us on the upside was that the development went from 62 to 67. And I would have - I would have said it’s probably more like 3% to 4% but 5% will take it. You are not going to see the cash flow coming through from that development until another couple of quarters from that leasing because you do a least but they don’t start paying the rent for another three to six months after you do the TI's and the like.
So the upside is if you look at that direct-owned portfolio in page 1.5, it’s now at 83.7, it was at 78.8 nine months ago, that's progress. Obviously that's driven by the development. Overall the quarter stayed about the same. And so, we think we bottomed out from an occupancy perspective generally speaking plus or minus could we see it go up or down 30 basis points or so in any quarter, 40 basis points, sure and we saw that in the first quarter and it disappointed us. 
That said it’s not completely out of line and we believe we are bumping along the bottom, we think we are making progress overall in the development. And hopefully brighter days are ahead and that we are hearing good things in the market but we will talk about it after it happens as opposed to before it happens.

I wouldn’t assess six months ago that it would be as active as it is. We have had some discussions with some partners of ours that we have done business with globally and there is - as I say, there is no shortage of capital today which is the good news. 
We started the year and it’s in our plan thinking that we would be disposing of certain assets in the U.S. outright and then potentially putting together a fund and/or joint venture towards the end of this year. That is still in our plan and we continue to have very, very preliminary discussions with some of our partners about it. I would tell you that I have zero concerns at this point in time that we would get that done, absolutely zero given what we see out in the market. It’s really more a question of our timing because our timing is - really needs to be lined up somewhat with our developments. And so we have signed 250 million of starts this quarter. We think we will sign 700 to 800 this year but you sign it but you don’t start the development and actually start spending money substantially until five six months after the leases are signed.
And so, we are trying to think about how do somewhat coincide those sales of that joint venture with our actual developments in progress and that's why it sort of pushed it back towards the end of this year in our mind. But there is absolutely no shortage to capital. 
The other thing I would say is I believe this time around that capital sources will gravitate more and more to operators that have co-investment. And when I say operators, I am talking about best in class operators and there isn’t any question in my mind and I don’t think anybody on the phone that we are a best-in-class operator in the industrial business. So we think that we have got a very attractive story relative to the capital. And when it comes time to raise it, we don’t think there will be an issue at all.

I know you tried to give some of the details; but if you look at the $0.11 in core without the development gain this quarter and your guidance of $0.55 to $0.60, you get to a quarterly run rate in the last three quarters of $0.15 to $0.16. That's almost $75 million to $100 million of annualized FFO. And I'm just trying to get a sense of what are the big things, I can't imagine that's all capitalized G&A and capitalized interest that's driving that. So maybe you can walk us through some of the big components of really going from $0.11 and it sounds like second quarter is going to be almost flattish, up to almost $0.16, $0.17, $0.18 by the end of the year, just given your share count, it's a lot of dollars in FFO.

First of all, let me touch the second part relative to the core FFO guidance. The bond offerings had a dilutive effect and that's the biggest single piece of the decline and that's again associated with the fact that we - at the end of the day we have reduced our line of credit, which is our cheapest form of borrowing as a result of those. 
I think we have done a great job from a risk management standpoint pushing out maturities and basically aligning our line of credit that are with what is active development portfolio. And others have gone longer in that regard and there is a risk element associated with that. 
But a couple of things that sort of popped out in March well past the offerings, we are really - the winter expenses that flow through above the fund portfolios, and our core portfolios sort of gave us a little bit of surprise there and it’s a one-time charge from our perspective. And there is a chance, we are digging into it that somewhere or all of that maybe more recoverable than we - than we are planning right now. And that’s a good thing.
We also took a tax charge of about $5 million, that is a one-time item.  And so, when you start getting at that, you got about $0.06 right there. So there is a variety of things that impacted our perspective relative to the overall year’s guidance. But the other side of it is that we believe our development activity will - the $700 million to $800 million that we guided to will definitely come to fruition, we are well along in that regard. However the insurance of those development costs will occur substantially later and the majority of those other than the land will really be pushed into Q4 and into 2011, which because of that does increase or decrease the amount of capitalized cost associated with those and we have mitigated some of that by planning on pushing some of the asset sale book. 
And those are really the key drivers of what’s impacting guidance, relative to the ramp up of FFO. We are - I believe in the second quarter and certainly into the third and fourth quarter, we are going to finally start seeing the full effect of what we have leased so far versus what's occupied in the development portfolio and that's been a painful lag for all of you and us. But we are going to start generating the FFO out of that. We are still eating the cost associated with the unoccupied portion of that development portfolio, which is a drag on earnings. If we are successful as we hope to be in continuing to lease up, we have sort of a supercharged FFO associated with that because we get the reimbursement of the expenses we are eating today as well as the base rent associated with the new lease up.
And so, we think that will ramp up pretty significantly through the end of the year. And then on the other side, both Walt and I touched on, we need to lease space, we are planning on a recovery in the second half of the year relative to occupancies. And those candidly will generate FFO quicker than a sort of a development portfolio where you always have sort of that three to six month lag time for TEIs etcetera. And so, to the extent that we can get the renewals and increase occupancy in that, I think you will see that ramp up. 
So again, from a quarterly perspective, you are not going to see all of it in Q2 by any means because we will get hit for some of these capitalized cost that we had in Q1. But by Q3 and Q4, we should start to see that ramp pretty significantly.

Japan happens to be a market that has a very - land rates are very, very high. The UK would fall into that category, some markets within the U.S. would fall into that category. 
So I think we use on average approximately 25% of the - for non-Japan transactions. And I think we feel very good about the activity level we have both on build-to-suits and in land sales.

I believe it’s one our website, we did a presentation a month or two ago where we laid out the fact that we - our goal is not to take our land to zero, okay. Our goal is to take our land to somewhere in the neighborhood, to let’s $600 million to $1 billion and you get there. We believe that on a run rate basis we can develop somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion per year. Now we are not going to hit that this year because it’s a transition year. But I think when we finally get to a recovered economy, it’s there. 
So if you think about land at 25% to 30% of overall value, and you need to carry at least two years to two years at land, you get to those kinds of numbers. So our view is we want to take our $2.5 billion today down to (I am just going to) roughly the midpoint of that would be $800 million. And we think that that's about a two and a half to three year process to do that. In other words, we are going to working off excess land. Over the next two to three years, we will probably be working off more land than we buy. We won’t be buying zero because in certain markets you may be at no land and in other markets you might have some excess land. But you are working off more land than you are buying and ultimately you are working down to that sort of $800 million, $1 billion, whatever that number is. And then getting, at that point in time you got land where you want it. 
And that should create also additional upside in our earnings because whether or not you sell the land which you would pay down debt or do something with the capital that would generate a return or you put it into production at some return on invested capital, either way you are getting a return on it and therefore monetizing it. And so that's our real goal and objective long-term. 
And one other point, we guided this year to $350 million to $400 million. Obviously we monetized the $138 million in the first quarter. We feel very, very good about hitting the $350 million to $400 million at this point.

In terms of sort of Q1 big picture items, there is about $5 million taxes that are sort of one-time. That is probably versus an historic run rate, an increase in interest cost both in the funds and on the balance sheet as a result of the activities that we have undertaken. There was - interestingly enough on - and I think Michael Bileman may have said a few minutes ago, these costs sort of are more meaningful these days, but I mean as an example we have payroll taxes in the first quarter where you pay the lion’s share of FICA in the first quarter and that’s not a run rate going forward. 
And so, there is whole host of things that factor into sort of a first quarter lower FFO and that for us was exaggerated a little bit by some of the one-time cost and it was offset by some benefits that we saw in the first quarter as well. But we feel pretty good about the ramp up through the rest of the year and again, you are not going to see a big piece of that in the second quarter because in fact, we have - to put things in perspective, I think we have a 163 buildings in our completed development portfolio. And we typically capitalize costs associated with those until they reach what we call stabilization, which is either they are 93% leased or they are completed for more than 12 months. 
And in the first quarter, we had 17 buildings as a subset of that in which we were still capitalizing various costs; 14 of those 17 buildings roll off into the stabilized category in Q2. And so, we will see a decrease in Q2 and Q3 of capitalized costs associated with the roll off of that and you won't pick it up again until Q4 when we start really incurring the lion’s share of the cost associated with the incremental build-to-suit development etcetera that we have started. 
I think that answers the question.

Secondly, in Europe conditions there weakened materially during the quarter. We saw occupancy fall more 100 bps for PEPR, and almost 200 bps for the other fund PEPR 2. How does that enter into your guys’ calculus on starting build-to-suits? And why start build-to-suits if you have so much supply in your current high quality portfolio in Europe?

I think will take the second piece of it and then I will let Bill take the first. You start build-to-suits because companies want it not because you want them. I mean what’s happening is that companies are looking for a certain size in a certain location. Nine times out of 10 on one or two pieces of land that makes sense to them. And you might have an existing building that's out there but the fact is that it maybe - it may not fit them, they needed a 100,000 square feet and you got 80,000, they can - that particular building just may not fit them or maybe they want 100 with an additional 30 of expansion. 
And so what you are - what you are finding is that they are less and less of those choices and you don't have developers building those choices on a speculative basis. And so, while the market doesn't appear to be growing per se in terms of additional occupancy, it is certainly - there are companies that are in need of space that just isn't out there. And so we have got really one or two choices, you can either ignore it or in our case you have got land that needs to be monetized over time. You can hop on it and do it. 
And there aren't that many companies out there that have the capital today to build these buildings. And so, we think it’s an opportunity and again, I think you will see as you look at our quarterly numbers throughout the year, I think you are going to see that we will do a substantial amount of that build-to-suit business which is indicative of the fact that the market is there. There are just people that need it. 
Why do it? In addition to that, frankly the construction cost today are somewhere in the neighborhood of 20% down from where they were two years ago. And so, you have always people that are floating around in the market saying, “Well, boy, we are buying these assets at a 20% to 30% discount to replacement cost.” And they are fooling themselves to a certain degree because replacement cost had changed and now it may be back to where it was in 2007 in a couple of years but the fact is that replacement cost are much lower today. And I would much rather build a new building preleased on a long-term basis with a great customer and monetize land at 20% below where I could build a building than be out there knocking our heads against everybody else in the market that in 20 other buyers that are looking to buy something that creates no value on the long-term basis. That's why we are developing today and I think ultimately you will find the demand is there to meet it.

And so, as you get near the end, we used it in the fall and just to tab in earlier this year, to about $28 million. And as you get near the end, we reload that program. We thought an opportune time to do that was when were in the midst of following the covert offering and entering into the blackout period for the earnings where we are in a period where we technically couldn’t sell anything for about 60 day period. Just to take the heat off the market, then Kim we are going to go up and sell a bunch of stock. 
The practical reality is that if we choose to raise equity of any size, we will do it in an open market transaction. But the ATM offers us the opportunity that if circumstances arise where you can take advantage of something and use $50 million or $75 million here and there. That program is available to this and I believe that we would use it.
So the main message there is if we were going to do an offering or raise equity of any size, we do it through the normal process in open market.

And I think the interesting thing is that we believe today that were we to sell these starts, we would create something there in the neighborhood of $16 million. We would be roughly at 20% to 21% margin on our cost with our land in at book bases. And that really is indicative of what's happened to cap rates in the last year.

And so, there is value, obviously that the funds got and because we had cut the deal last year, the cap is 8.25%. But 5.9% I think is very characteristic of the Tokyo market today and then when you add land to that, you come up to 95% of the $172 million.

I think cap rates are where they are and obviously they have come down substantially in the last 12 months. And so, it would be - I think it would be crazy. Even though I think there will be more capital in the market, I am not sure I would believe that cap rates are coming down substantially, the flip side to that is because of the amount of capital in the market, I am not sure that they are going up either much in the next year. 
And so, how are we planning our portfolio around that? Well, one of the things that we talked about is that we were going to sell some assets throughout the year predominantly in the U.S. and trade those dollars into development assets where we think we can create NAV. And I still believe today that that is the right thing to do because there isn’t as much competition to build existing buildings. We have a land bank that we need to monetize and we have got the people in the place in customer relationships. So we are best positioned to do that. So why would you gravitate your core competency and in doing so, sell assets that - whether it’s a feeding frenzy. 
And so, we continue to have that in the back of our minds candidly we are less anxious to do it immediately because the developments will ramp up more towards the end of the year and selling assets substantially in advance to the cash flow needed for those development is significantly dilutive. And so, we are going to try to time that a little bit better but it really hasn't changed our overall view of how we go about our business right now.

These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which ProLogis operates as well as Management's beliefs and assumptions.
Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings.
I'd also like to state that our second quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. And as we have done in the past, to provide a broader range of investors and analysts with an opportunity to ask their questions, we will ask you to please limit your questions to one at a time.
Walt, would you please begin?

This morning I'll talk about business fundamentals and then update you on progress toward our goals for 2010, which we are very, very happy with. Bill will then discuss our earnings for the quarter and our financial outlook for the balance of the year. Overall, the market feels a lot like it did last quarter, bumping along the bottom, with some evidence of it strengthening in a few markets.
Consensus GDP forecasts have been revised down in most areas of the world. And our customers are reading the same headlines that we are and have the same concerns that we have. In general, I would say most of our customers still remain cautious about making definitive inventory expansion decisions.
Now, there are positive signs, however. In North America, market occupancies ticked up 16 basis points for the quarter and net absorption was positive at about 11 million square feet. This is the first time we've seen a positive movement in market occupancy since the third quarter of 2007.
And in Europe and Asia, supply chain reconfiguration and ownership shifts continue to drive demand for our newer, modern facilities. Now, I'll have more to say later on our new developments but we're making good progress, particularly abroad.
In our global portfolio, we achieved a 45 basis-point increase in our lease percentage during the quarter, driven by a nearly 500-basis point increase in leasing in our completed developments. As for rental rates, we think they have reached the floor in most markets, but same-store rental growth will continue to be challenging until such time as meaningful occupancy increases take place.
Our rental growth for the quarter was negative 15.7%, but note that less than 3% of the transactions drove about a quarter of the decline and many of those leases were short-term deals. In addition, bear in mind that we're now rolling down 2006/2007 rents, which were down at the peak of the market.
The good news is that our retention ratios remain extremely high, at approximately 80% and our portfolio remains well occupied relative to the overall market. That's due in large part to the quality of our people and the quality of our assets.
Another interesting thing, we see in the market is that values continue to rise for core industrial product. There is an ample amount of institutional capital on the sidelines and interest rates are low. Buyers can buy assets at below replacement costs due to low rental levels and there is no speculative supply being built.
Frankly, it's pretty good environment for buyers and for sellers, with the only impediment being that there is very little good industrial product for sale. In the beginning of this year, we set out a goal to sell $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion of primarily U.S. properties in order to fund and retain most of our new developments.
This strategy basically enables us to enhance our geographical diversification, while also allowing us to deleverage the company further. However, our focus here has been to closely match the timing of our sales with our need for proceeds, which is more weighted towards the latter half of this year and into 2011.
So far, we've completed about $250 million of sales or contributions through the end of Q2. For the balance of the year, we plan to make an additional $200 million to $300 million in contributions to our funds in JVs, sell an additional $100 million of land and sell roughly $700 million to $800 million of our U.S. assets.
Now, we'll have more to report on this as the second half progresses. Now let me update you on the progress toward our other initiatives, which are all centered around converting non-income-producing assets into income-producing assets and creating value through accretive development.
First, we're making strong progress in leasing up our development portfolio. Recall that we started the year with our 50 million square foot development portfolio at 62% leased. At the end of Q1, we were at 67% and we ended Q2 at 72%. We may see a bit slower progress in Q3 due to the summer months in Europe, which are always slow but we think we're going to end the year at approximately 80%.
That implies another four million square feet of net leasing in the second half of 2010 or $25 million to $30 million in annualized NOI upon occupancy. In addition, at the beginning of the year we set a goal to start $700 million to $800 million of new development in 2010.
It seemed like a lofty goal at the time, but right now we're extremely pleased with our progress. Year-to-date, including our recent announcements, we're at $473 million or 63% of the midpoint of our annual goal.
During the quarter, we signed $196 million of build-to-suits in the U.K., Sweden, France, Germany and Japan. So despite fears of a fallout from European sovereign debt issues, we haven't had any customers pulling back out of plans for new development and while we may see a slowdown in decision-making in Europe, we think it will be more of a pause than anything else.
Remember what's driving our business in Europe and for that matter Asia, is not necessarily growth, but reconfigurations in our customer supply chains. Companies are relocating in search of efficiencies, not necessarily growth. We think this trend continues in any economic environment.
As for our North American business, our expectation is that it will soon join Europe and Asia in contributing to our development starts. So far we've only done one build-to-suit in North America in the last three quarters, but we expect this to change.
Some markets are beginning to tighten in first generation product, even though overall market occupancies are still low. This is an opportunity for us in our view as it has been in Europe and Asia, because we have great entitled land and the ability to deliver without having to source takeout capital. This is where the majority of our investment capital will go in the future.
In terms of profitability, since the fourth quarter of last year our development yields, excluding Japan, have averaged 8.6%, with our land in at original cost. Inclusive of our Japan developments, we believe we will create slightly in excess of $100 million in value at today's cap rates on these new developments.
We're also making progress in creating a return on our land bank. At the beginning of the year, we set a goal to put into development and/or sell $350 million to $400 million of our land this year. Through the end of Q2, we've hit about $176 million or 50% of the midpoint of our guidance. Our mission, of course, is to reduce our land bank over time, predominantly through development but also through some sales.
Over the last 18 months, we've taken impairments on land that we intended to sell. As markets recover, we're encouraged by some recent interest from users to buy land for new facilities. Some of this interest is on parcels that we originally designated to be developed and held on our balance sheet.
So as we decide to sell the land, we may incur additional impairments on some parcels in the quarters ahead. However, it will clearly be the right thing to do and we intend to take advantage of those opportunities should they arise.
In summary, we believe that market occupancies and rents are stabilizing across our global markets but that the pace of the recovery may still be slow. In the meantime, our portfolio has held up extremely well, given its quality and diversification.
We're on track with our targets to reduce the level of non-income-producing assets this year. And we believe our efforts will unlock substantial value over time. Now, let me turn it over to Bill.

I will try to be brief in covering three aspects of the company's financial position. Number one, a summary of Q2 and year-to-date results; number two, guidance for the remainder of the year with some brief insight into the things that we expect will impact the second half and number three, just a few comments on our balance sheet and fund debt initiatives.
We reported $0.15 per share in FFO for Q2 2010 after adding back $0.01 of non-cash adjustments associated with our share of an impairment in our Mexico fund and the write-off of previously-paid costs as a result of our amendment to the global line of credit. Of the $0.15 per share in FFO for the quarter, $0.02 was in gains associated primarily with our Q2 contribution to PEP II, while the remaining $0.13 is core FFO.
The core FFO is very much in line with the direction we provided last quarter, when we stated that Q2 would likely see a pick-up in core FFO from continued occupancy gains in the completed development portfolio and reduced tax expense, somewhat offset by lower capitalized interest. The drop in the Euro during the quarter had a negligible impact on the quarterly results and was essentially offset by the strengthening of the yen.
For the six-months ended June 30th, after adding back the $0.12 of first quarter non-recurring costs and year-to-date non-cash adjustments, we have generated $0.28 of FFO; $0.04 of that is gain-related, while $0.24 represents core FFO. We remain comfortable with our full-year guidance of $0.55 to $0.60 in core and $0.70 to $0.78 in total FFO.
Relative to core, we expect Q3 and Q4 core FFO run rates to reflect a pick-up from overall occupancy gains in our development portfolio, increased development management fees and increased capitalized costs associated with the ramp-up of our development activity, particularly in Q4.
As a result, we are expecting $0.31 to $0.36 per share in core FFO in the second half of the year, with roughly 40% of that in Q3 and 60% in Q4. Clearly, the principle risk to this guidance is the state of the overall economy, which has clearly moderated. We expect to - we continue to expect $0.11 to $0.14 of FFO-related gains in the second half of the year, with roughly 30% of that in Q3 and 70% in Q4, principally driven by an expectation of recouping $0.03 to $0.04 per share in gains at the end of the year, associated with our 2009 contributions into PEP II as a result of improved valuations.
As we continue to pursue non-strategic asset and land sales, we may take some losses or impairments and are well prepared to do - to do so in order to more quickly monetize our land bank, return solely to our industrial roots and rationalize our core industrial portfolio. To the extent, we do have additional non-cash losses or impairment charges this year. They will be added back to be consistent with our definition of FFO, excluding significant non-cash charges.
Turning to the balance sheet, the balance on our line increased in Q2 by $264 million, which was predominantly related to the repurchase of convertible debt. It is our intent to continue to opportunistically chip away at our 2012 and 2013 maturities as well as delever through asset sales proceeds over the course of the next six months. We have on balance sheet debt maturities of just $368 million between now and year-end 2011.
At the end of the second quarter, we amended the global line to reduce the aggregate commitments to approximately $2.2 billion, consistent with the lower level of commitments that become effective on October 6, 2010.
In doing so, we reduced the commitment fee costs of the line ahead of schedule. We also eliminated the very confusing borrowing base covenant and replaced it with a more straightforward debt yield covenant. And we cleaned up definitions in a few of the covenants to bring them back in the line with the original line agreements. We believe the amendment better aligns our senior credit facility covenants with current market terms.
As of quarter end, we have borrowing capacity of $1.7 billion under the line of credit. Just to clarify, we would have had borrowing capacity of $1.6 billion under the line if we had stayed with the borrowing base concept, but that is no longer relevant.
What is relevant is that we now have more transparent covenant computations that are better aligned with market terms. And furthermore, we're strongly supported by our lending group.
Relative to the rating agencies and their view of ProLogis, you should be aware that Moody's put us on watch in late June. And it is our expectation that they will review the credit again following our third quarter results.
We expect both S&P and Fitch to review the credit in the immediate future, based on our Q2 results. We believe the progress we have made over the past 21 months relative to the balance sheet, liquidity profile and the continuing momentum in our core FFO will be appropriately taken into account in all three reviews.
Turning to the fund debt, we reduced 2010 maturities by $375 million during Q2. And so far in the third quarter, we have repaid or refinanced the entire $172 million outstanding in PEP II as well as partially repaid PEPR's corporate revolver.
Therefore, as of today, we have only $179 million of remaining second half maturities, which will be paid down at their maturity dates through refinancing or fund equity contributions. Our 2011 fund debt maturities totaled just $258 million, a very welcome reprieve from the last 21 months of activity.
With that, let me turn it back over to Walt to wrap up.

We realize that the markets are choppy and we could be in for some slow growth ahead. But I think when you look back two years from now, we'll say that around Q2 2010, we reached an inflection point in our markets.
For one, we shouldn't underestimate how important it is to have reached the point where for the first time in three years, we had positive net absorption in our markets. Normally, this is a substantial turning point that signals better days ahead.
Second, there has been virtually no new supply started for almost two years. And we don't expect much for at least the next 12 to 18 months. In our view, the development market has already adjusted to the slower growth environment that we may be in.
And, third, market rents may still fall some but they are so low now that it's almost unimaginable that they will stay where they are forever. We believe that there's upside here with some level of occupancy increases. We think it's a matter of when, not if.
As for ProLogis, look, we're running a marathon, not a sprint. Everything, we're doing here is with the intention of improving our company over the long-term and we're going to continue to run the company that way.
We accomplished a lot in the last 18 months, but we realize there is still a lot to do. As a former President once said, we can't just congratulate ourselves on the past; we have to rededicate ourselves to the future.
We think we've done that and we think the progress we're making in the pipeline leasing and in our global development business, is a true indicator of the diversity in our global platform and our ability to execute. And we expect to have more good things to talk about in future quarters, so stay tuned. In the long run, value will be created.
Operator, I think we're ready to open it up for questions.

That would sort of imply, just at the midpoint, just over $0.13 in the third quarter and then ramping to $0.20 in the fourth quarter.
And that drive would be almost $32 million in FFO going from 3Q to 4Q. So a very large number. I'm just trying to reconcile that. You had PEPR this morning, obviously, decreased guidance by about 11%. I didn't think development management fees were that big of a contributor relative to the full year, being only at $20 million, which I think was your last guidance number. So can you just walk through the pieces of how you get a $32 million FFO boost in core FFO in Q4?

And we feel pretty good about that. We believe, as we've talked before, that we're going to ramp up in the occupancy versus the leasing side of development portfolio. And so we feel pretty good about that. You know, in terms of some of the asset sales and overall deleveraging initiatives that we have, hopefully we'll see a moderation in interest expense itself. And on the other side, we'll see a ramp-up in capitalized interest associated with the ramp-up in overall development activities. And so, you know, there's a - there's a bunch of ins and outs, but those are the major drivers of the ramp-up in FFO.

But I will say, to make a general comment, you know, we adjusted our guidance in Q1 for not only the dilutive effect of the bond offering that we did at that time, capital markets transaction, but what we were beginning to see in the markets. And candidly in Q1 we could see that the markets weren't as robust as we thought. We did take guidance down. And I think at this stage in the game, look, the uncertainty - this uncertain market can any decision-maker look foolish, right?
But we think that we've taken into account where the market is to the best of our knowledge and based upon the fees that will kick in the second quarter. And the developments - excuse me, second half and the developments which will kick in, I think right now we're pretty comfortable with where our guidance is.

First of all, I don't think that - I don't think that it's - who knows? I mean, you never know. But I think you should expect that we'll see negative rent declines through 2011, but that they will moderate. And the reason I say that is because right now we're turning leases that were generally done and then obviously not all of then, but a lot of them. We’re done in 2006 and in early 2007, which, to us, was the peak in the market.
Now, it's a general statement, obviously you have 10-year leases that are turning now that were done early in the year. And you have short-term leases that were done in ‘08 but for the most part we're turning that - those peak rents right now. And we think that we're going to see the largest declines this year and that that will taper off in 2011. But I also don't want anybody to think that we think that in 2011 they turn positive, because you're still going to be turning in ‘11 rents that you did in ‘07 and ‘08, which to me were reasonably good markets, although not necessarily as good as ‘06.
And I also believe that market rents will moderate, i.e. they're not going to go down much more and we might even see them pick up a little bit. It's such low levels right now that it's hard for me to imagine that they go down, in fact, if anything, maybe even come up a little bit, but not enough to turn a negative situation into a positive by the year 2011. I guess that would be my response. And then the second bit of that, I think if I understand your question correctly and then I'll turn it over to Chuck, but I think the rents that - basically the rents that you're looking at in terms of the roll downs are net effective rents. In other words, they're net effective rents compared with net effective rents. So they take into account all of the free rent associated with every deal that we do. And, Chuck, I know I said a lot there, but is there anything that you want to add to that?

One of the things that we're finding significant about this quarter is it is the first quarter in many, many quarters that we've seen positive net absorption. And if you look back on the 31 markets that we track in North America and maybe write these down. In 2008, there was negative absorption of 122 million square feet.
In the first half of 2009, it was negative 98 million. In the second half of 2009, it was negative 23.5 million. Q1 of this year it was negative 2.7, Q2 in this year is plus 11 million. In normal years, we'll see anywhere between 100 million and in a good year 200 million, square feet of growth absorption. There are virtually no starts and virtually no completions as we look forward over the next 12 to 24 months.
As this absorption starts to - positive absorption starts to kick in, it's probably not going to be in 2011, with the exception of a few markets. But we do see kind of a bright light relative to rental growth beyond 2011. There's just no new inventory being built and we are now seeing positive net absorption and some markets are actually getting reasonably tight in terms of availability.
Toronto would be a great example. There are very few buildings available in that market. Parts of Southern California are getting tight. We're seeing several pockets where there are no buildings in certain square footages. So we're - we're cautiously optimistic on a go-forward basis here, relative to rents.

We did make a $61 million acquisition this quarter but I think we've been telling you all that as of the fourth quarter last year, we made a sale that required that we do a 1031 exchange this year. And so we have been looking for acquisitions to buy.
This happened to be a great acquisition that we could buy at below replacement cost, because we were basically buying it at 80% leased. We're very comfortable with the lease up-risk associated with it. So we did purchase it. But were it not for the 1031 exchange requirement, we are not in the market to acquire today. We would much rather put our capital into the development and building out our land bank and taking non-income producing assets and turning them into income-producing assets.

And I think we put out the announcement with SCE, a couple of weeks ago or a month and-a-half ago or so. And that is a relatively large multi-year assignment with them. And so I don't know about the absolute level of development management fees as yet that we've targeted for 2011. But that is a business that we're growing and continue to - and will hopefully continue to generate fees.

I was going to add to that, Jamie, I think this fee business is a business that you have to expect will continue and, frankly, we've been in the business for years now. But, if anything, I think user interest is picking up and I think we're going to have a lot of opportunities to build buildings for users. Some will be on our land and some of it will not be on our land, but this is not a business that's a one-time thing. In fact, if anything, I would hope that it is a business I think and fully expect that it will grow from the $20 million on an annual basis moving forward. And as Bill said, the solar activity we have got going on, which is a pretty meaningful contributor to that. And we've only put solar on 2% of our roofs right now. So we have a long way to go in terms of what we can do there. But really, the other piece of this is just the development lease-up and you've got the - you got the numbers there. I mean, we went from 67% to 72% this quarter and I think you can probably assume that virtually all of those leases done are not generating any grant in the second quarter. And you can also assume that a pretty good chunk of - we can get you the numbers, I don't have it. But, you know, that was leased in the 67%, still wasn't generating income in the second quarter. And I think you can also assume that some of going from 72% to 80% will generate income by the fourth quarter, although not all of it, obviously, because you got to get there over that six-month period of time.
So if you begin to do the math and what I tried to do is lay out in my comments, just taking it from 72% to 80%, because some of it is in Japan, generates in the neighborhood of $25 million to $30 million in FFO on an annualized basis, which is like $0.05 or $0.06 a share. And so you can see that the development is the thing that really has the big impact on the ramp-up in the second half and some of that is already contractual that we've signed. So that's why we feel reasonably good about it at this point.

Orange County is below 6% in terms of vacancy. Canada is less than 5%. Inland Empire is less than 8%. There is a handful of markets that are, you know, below 8% in terms of vacancy rates that is starting to get in the range of being relatively tight. And you've got to layer onto it that there is no new supply coming on line. And it is just something that we haven't really experienced, certainly in my career, other than this particular point in time and the negative net absorption was pretty significant. Now, that we're turning to positive or so it seems, occupancy increases across-the-board could be relatively substantial if we get back to the type of leasing environment that would be normal; not robust, just normal.
In markets, that are already below 8%, vacancy could very quickly get into the threes and fours in terms of percent vacancy, which will drive demand for development, and certainly increase lease rates. So I had to hit on some U.S. markets; there's other markets throughout the world that we've great success in leasing, in the U.K. and in Germany and, I mean, quite a few places in Europe are also tightening up. And Japan has continued to be a good market for us from a leasing perspective. That market really never, from our perspective, got impacted in a material way.

I mean, look, it all hinges on the economy. We're all sitting here wondering and none of us have a great crystal ball but I would say to what Chuck what was saying before, that most of our customers are telling us that they are running very tight with their inventories right now. But they're also in the mode of not expanding because they're kind of holding their breath, too.
I mean, they're sitting back and saying look, is there going to be an expansion - I mean, is there going to be better economic times ahead or not and so all of us are asking that question. I do think that at some point in time they will make expansion decisions, because I believe that we're going to continue to see, albeit slow, positive GDP growth and they're running so tight right now that something has got to bust.
And so we believe that there will be some occupancy growth. However, as it relates to what our projections are right now, we're looking at the end of the year and saying, look, we believe that our developments will take from 72% to 80%; we feel pretty doggone good about that. And our international markets are leasing and that is where the preponderance of our space is.
But candidly, as it relates to our core occupancies, i.e. everything other than the developments. I mean, we think it is going to be up a little bit by the end of the year, perhaps 50 to 100 basis points, but not much more than that. Because I think it is still going to take time for this economy to heal itself. And so we're not expecting major increases in occupancies through the end of the year, save for our development portfolio.
And then the other thing, last but not least that I would mention to reiterate what I said in my comments, is that the international markets are not really dependent as much on growth, which isn't to say that we're expecting to see occupancy increases necessarily in Europe and Asia. But it is to say that what is driving our business there is not as dependent on growth as much as it is just people moving around playing musical chairs, and trying to become more efficient at what they have.
And we're the direct positive recipient of that because we own newer space and because we're developers. And that is why we're confident that we'll lease up our portfolio over time and that is why we're confident we’re going to continue to probably do build-to-suit developments in those areas of the world, because there is a need for it.

Also you guys made a decision in late ‘09 to reduce your natural hedge in Europe, because you anticipated that the Euro would appreciate relative to the dollar. We know the converse has been true so far but the Euro recently rebounded. Are you guys thinking about reinstituting the natural hedge now, given what we've seen?

And I'm sorry, but in this market it is damn tough to maintain occupancies at over 95%, one and, number two, I believe six months ago when we entered into the year, we were pretty clear that we thought our investment management business occupancies and in particular PEPR, were going to decline, maybe as much as 300 basis points or more to the 92% - 91% to 92% level. And that's just simply because you cannot maintain in this marketplace, 95% to 96% occupied this year and we knew it. And so I don't think that what has happened to PEPR - it's happened to PEPR is any change.
And if anything, you know, we're expecting the second half to be relatively stable, but nonetheless, as it relates to our same-store sales, I mean, our view is not the same as PEPR's view because we didn't exactly enter into the world this year at 96% leased. And so if anything, our occupancies will rise because of the development lease-up and so we're in a completely different ballgame than they are. And so, Bill, do you want to talk about the dollar?

We capitalize relatively a small amount of interest and other costs on our land, you know, and the only time that we do that is if we're actively installing infrastructure and/or close - you know, prepping the particular parcels for what would be a near-term development opportunity.
And so, you know, at this point in time we probably capitalize interest on somewhere around 12% or 15% of our overall land and that changes from time to time, you know, as we focus on different parcels, et cetera. But, I mean, in terms of a, you know, $2.3 billion book land basis, we're capitalizing interest on something shy of $300 million of that and that will fluctuate from time to time, depending upon the activities going on. But I would never anticipate it getting substantially above that level in terms of overall percentage or dollars.

We're on track to do that. That equates to roughly $700 million to $800 million in development starts, plus we would sell off roughly $150 million of land. So you monetize $350 million to $400. We believe that we can repeat that program over the next three years. And in addition to that, you shouldn't think about that land being heavy; you should think about it being heavy at $2.3 billion, but not heavy at about $1 billion. In other words, we're going to carry about $1 billion of land on our land on our balance sheet, sort of when we stabilize out this company.
So the reduction that we see taking place is roughly $1.3 billion. We think we can accomplish that over a three-year period of time. We also think that not all of that will be developed, but some of it will be sold, just like we're selling it this year and so that you accelerate that process through the sale of certain parcels. And we already have interest in - if we have interest this year, then we believe we're going to have substantial interest in the next two years moving forward.
So it may sound and seem like a big number, but it is within reason likely about a three-year program for us to get down to where we really need to be.

I'm wondering whether or not you believe that is the case?
And then secondly, on the long-term outlook for the development pipeline, I think you guys had indicated around $1 billion to a $1.5 billion of annual development starts over a longer term.

Our real monetization is probably more like $500 million on annual basis, $200 million in sales, and $300 million or so goes into development. And so you should assume that we'll purchase probably $100 million to $150 million off of that, because you cannot match your land perfectly.

I don't know that we look at - I think we look at our land as being about a third of the cost of our development. That is on average; some places it is more and in some places it is less. If you use a midpoint of $1.25 billion in starts, once we kind of ramp up to a normal economic environment, that would be - we would be monetizing $400 million a year worth of land.
We want to hold about - we believe long-term having about $1 billion land bank, somewhere between $800 million and $1 billion, is about a two and two and-a-half year supply of land. We think that's appropriate on a go-forward basis. We clearly have more land than we would like today. But if you look at where we're at year-to-date on starts, and where we're guiding to relative to starts and the fact that we're currently pursuing over 30 transactions that are all build-to-suits, 12 of which we feel real good about, which is why our guidance is between $700 million and 800 million - you know, this is still a relatively tough environment and for us to get between $700 million and 800 million. I don't think it is much of a stretch at all to get to a point where we're doing on average about $1.2 billion. Again, that monetizes $400 million of land a year; we'll layer in some sales. And I think we'll get back down to a reasonable land banks in the three-year period of time that Walt referenced.
In terms of - so I hit on kind of how we get - three years from now, how we get to that number. Long-term, again, we think we'll do between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. We think this year actually in many ways justifies that. Obviously, in the past, we got starts to be a number much greater. I think at this point we're looking at spec starts to be a very small amount of what we do, maybe 25%, growing to probably 50%. And there may be an environment where we exceed that. I personally feel pretty good about 50% build-to-suits/50% spec as a mix long-term, but different market environments will dictate different thoughts on that. There are markets, as we mentioned - I mean the reason we're chasing over 30, what we believe are very real deals, there are markets that don't have buildings in certain size ranges available right now. This is totally consistent with past recoveries.
Net absorption turns positive, there is - in this case, there is absolutely no development. If somebody needs a 350,000-foot building in a market like Toronto. There just aren't any options for them available. That will drive build-to-suit developments, that will help us get to our $1 billion to $1.5 billion quicker than I think people are assuming. And we feel real comfortable with our ability to hit those kinds of numbers and the market is going in our direction from that perspective. No new speculative starts and positive net absorption. That is a good combination for us on a go-forward basis.

It’s clear to us now that market conditions are improving. In Q2, we reported that net absorption had turned positive by 11 million square feet in U.S. markets. In Europe, the same positive trend occurred. In Q3, we again saw positive net absorption of 7 million square feet in the U.S. The figures aren’t in yet for Europe, but we expect the results to be on the plus side as well. It had been obvious for some time that sales growth has been outpacing inventory growth, as you would expect in the beginning of a recovery. We’re now beginning to see this trend reverse itself.
There are few important data points in our third quarter operating results that point to fundamental improvement. First, same-store NOI was a positive 0.27% and overall occupancies rose again by 24 basis points, mainly driven by occupancy increases in our direct-owned portfolio.
Our static development leasing was up by 217 basis points, slower than previous quarters, but about what we expected due to the summer months in Europe where decisions are slow to materialize. Since the end of the quarter, overall activity has picked up. And given quarter-to-date agreements and leasing activity, we still expect our static development portfolio to be about 80% leased by year end.
In addition, rental rates are becoming more encouraging. They’ve certainly flattened out in most markets. And now, in a few markets, they’re beginning to rise. For the last four quarters, our rental rate growth has been down 13.9% on average. This quarter it’s down 8.5%.
Finally, as we’ve previously mentioned, we’re seeing some markets where new space is almost completely absorbed. This is an incredibly positive sign for the markets and for our development business.
Now let me just spend a few minutes on our overall portfolio strategy. In our view, nobody in the industry owns a more geographically diverse portfolio of high-quality industrial assets than ProLogis. That’s one of the benefits of having developed hundreds of millions of square feet of new product in global markets over the last 15 years. However, we intend to pursue opportunities to optimize our portfolio and sharpen our investment focus. Our aim is to invest our capital in the highest quality assets in major logistics corridors.
In our supplemental disclosure on page 5.4, we list the major logistics corridors in North America, Europe, and Japan and our investment in those markets. We’re especially interested in these corridors because they have the highest concentration of population, which of course fuels consumption and business spending. These characteristics drive a deep and consistent need for goods and distribution in those areas.
Now, currently we have 71% of our capital in these major corridors, adjusted for the Blackstone transaction. Over time, you are going to see us take this to 80% to 90% of our capital and you’ll also see our development business more highly focused in these areas as well. Now that’s not to say that we see little opportunity in some of the smaller, secondary markets. In fact, those opportunities will continue to exist, but our strategy will be more concentrated in the major markets from a long-term, capital investment perspective, which we believe will serve ourselves better in the years ahead.
So, how does this play into our thinking around the recently announced sale to Blackstone? Well, our strategy has been to recycle out of non-strategic assets in predominantly secondary U.S. markets. This transaction moves us forward in the accomplishment of that objective. Of the direct-owned sale portfolio, 72% of the assets are outside of the major logistics corridors in which we have chosen to concentrate our investment. In addition, the average tenant size of 44,000 square feet is about 40% smaller than our average across the company and only 8% of the square footage in the portfolio is leased by our global customers. So after the completion of the transaction, we’ll have an additional $2 billion to $2.5 billion of non-strategic industrial assets that we’ll target for distributions in future years. By recycling proceeds from these sales into new development, we believe we will substantially increase the NAV of the company.
In addition, we’re going to look to exit our remaining investment in non-industrial properties, which primarily consists of retail and other assets we acquired during the Catellus merger. Historically, there were tax consequences to selling these assets before 2014 given the 10-year tax prohibition of selling assets that were once held in a C corporation. However, the recent Jobs Bill recently passed changed that provision for 2010 and 2011, and we now have a window to sell these assets sooner without C Corp tax consequences.
So, we will complete the first phase of these dispositions, by selling off our interest in the New Orleans Hilton, which we announced in the Blackstone transaction; and we are now actively engaged in the disposition of our remaining investment, which we hope to close in early 2011.
Looking ahead to the future, our prospects for growth are strong. We’ve talked in the past about embedded growth in our overall occupancies and in our land bank - both of which are significant. We also think there will be future growth in market rents as they climb back to replacement cost levels, although that may take some time and it could be a little bit down the road. But the emerging opportunity is in our development business. We have a very unique global franchise of people, customers, and land and in certain markets new product is virtually all absorbed and rents are poised to rise. Construction costs have adjusted downward. Competitors are on the sidelines, and we’re at an all-time low in terms of new supply. And most importantly, customers are beginning to look for new space.
We believe our new development starts will grow next year to $800 million, to perhaps as much as $1 billion. Levels will be up from this year in all regions of the world. How do we plan to pay for it? Really, in two different ways. For developments that are not in markets where we want our long-term capital to be, we will be sellers, just like we were this year when we built the co-op build-to-suit and sold it in Scotland and the Miyagi build-to-suit in Sendai, Japan.
For the balance of it, as I mentioned, we will methodically recycle our capital out of older product or secondary markets, with the aim of holding those developments in targeted markets. This will create growth in our NAV, improve our geographic diversification and enhance the quality and concentration of our portfolio within major logistics corridors. Now, let me turn it over to Bill.

This morning I plan to cover four aspects of the companies’ financial position and strategy; number one, Q3 and year-to-date results; number two, expectations for Q4 strategic positioning; number three, a high-level overview of our outlook",1076,"Thanks, Walt. This morning I plan to cover four aspects of the companies’ financial position and strategy; number one, Q3 and year-to-date results; number two, expectations for Q4 strategic positioning; number three, a high-level overview of our outlook for 2011; and number four, how we’re thinking about our dividend.
We reported $0.22 per share in FFO for Q3 2010, after adding back $0.01 of non-cash adjustments associated with impairments related to the sale of one building and one land parcel as well as modest losses from the early retirement of debt.
Of the $0.22 per share in FFO for the quarter, $0.07 was in gains associated with contributions to PEP II and the sale of Ichikawa II, while the remaining $0.15 was core FFO. Q3 core FFO was slightly ahead of the guidance we provided last quarter when we stated that Q3 would comprise roughly 40% of our second half core FFO. Approximately $0.01 of Q3 core FFO was due to timing differences with the largest being reimbursement of certain expenses that had been budgeted for Q4. Gains of $0.07 per share also slightly exceeded the 30% of second half gains we anticipated in the third quarter principally due to the strengthened yen and its effect on the sale proceeds of Ichikawa II.
While we’ve seen significant strengthening of the euro versus the dollar in recent weeks, the average euro exchange rate for core operating earnings in Q3 was $1.28 versus $1.29 for Q2, and therefore, the strength of the euro was not a particular factor for Q3 core FFO.
For the nine months ended September 30th, we have generated FFO, excluding non-cash items, of $0.42. After adding back the $0.08 of non-recurring charges that we highlighted in earlier conference calls, we have generated $0.50 of FFO relative to our full-year guidance; of which $0.38 represents core FFO, with the remainder being gain-related.
Last week, with the announcement of our agreement to sell over $1 billion of assets to Blackstone, we reduced and tightened our full-year core FFO range to reflect $0.015 to $0.02 of dilution. This was primarily due to exceeding our original guidance for sales and contributions of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Additionally, the closing of the sales will take place sooner than expected with limited immediate reinvestment opportunities other than paying down the line of credit balance to zero and paying off our November bond maturity.
For the first quarter in a long while, I’m not going to spend any time talking about debt maturities. With less than $400 million due before 2012 the non-balance sheet debt, we are well positioned. We do, however, intend to continue to deleverage the company and bring our leverage, debt-to-EBITDA and fixed-charge coverage in line with the sector and in line with investment-grade metrics.
We remain comfortable with our guidance for full FFO, excluding non-cash items, from $0.70 to $0.78, which includes gains. Relative to core, including the dilutive impact from the Blackstone transaction, we expect our Q4 core FFO run rate to be roughly flat with Q3. As noted in our press release, we anticipate taking charges in the fourth quarter associated with strategic positioning activities, which will not be included in our definition of core FFO.
Relative to the strategic positioning initiative, we are highly focused on implementing a number of these in the fourth quarter. The most significant of which are; first, a strategic decision to more aggressively pursue land sales, wherein, we are undertaking a rigorous, re-evaluation of all land position, with the aim to expand the bucket of land which we will actively pursue sales on. As a result, we may take further impairments on our current book basis, which we would expect to be in line with discount ranges presented in our recent investor presentations.
Second, we are going to pursue a tender for various bonds and/or converts of between $1 billion and $2 billion with the principal intent of further smoothing our annual maturities, as well as deploying the proceeds from our asset sales more accretively. The cost associated with these tenders, from both potential premium paid as well as transaction cost, will be incurred a special charges in Q4.
Third, we are likely to close out a few derivative positions inside our funds, which have become ineffective, as well as incur swap breakage costs as a result of a partial repayment of some fund debt. There would be one-time charges associated with these transactions.
Fourth, we continue to focus on simplifying the company in creating incremental cost savings from structural and platform efficiencies, some of which may be incurred or reserved for in Q4. Finally, we are pursuing the sale of various non-core, retail, mixed-use and ground-lease assets, principally associated with our purchase of Catellus in 2005. The pursuit of the sale of these assets will likely result in a book impairment of approximately $120 million in Q4, but will also move us well down the path of simplification and getting back to our industrial roots.
Implementation of these initiatives represents the completion of our stabilization and simplification tasks that we laid out two years ago in New York. Relative to these tasks, we’re at the 26-mile mark in the marathon and the finish line is in clear sight.
Lastly, let me address our thinking about our dividend and core FFO for 2011. While the Blackstone transaction is expected to generate taxable gains, due to our intent to repurchase debt and other anticipated fourth quarter charges, our taxable income will be lower than we originally planned. As such, we plan to distribute $0.1125 per share in the fourth quarter. Our Board currently intends to maintain this level of cash dividend throughout 2011, which is a dividend level more in line with our expected taxable income and AFFO from core operations. We anticipate growing the dividend over time in line with AFFO growth.
Turning to core FFO per share in 2011, we are looking at growth of 15% or more over 2010 core and we plan to provide detail business drivers to support that guidance in early 2011. While our growth rate in 2011 will be impacted by the reinvestment dilution associated with our 2010 asset sales, we anticipate growth from the impact of further development portfolio leasing and occupancy, new built-to-suit developments coming online and higher average occupancies in both the funds and core portfolios.
With that, let me turn it back over to Walt to wrap up.

Second, we think there will be strong development opportunities with healthy margins for companies with customer relationships, land, expertise and access to capital. This is where we intend to deploy the vast amount of our capital in the years ahead. Third, when you combine the potential NAV accretion from a diversified development business, with the upside associated with occupancy gains, depressed market rents and monetization of land; it’s a powerful backdrop for future growth. Brighter days are ahead.

I think we’ve been fairly consistent in terms of our long-term leverage metrics, and again, people measure them in different ways. But the way we look at it from a debt-to-gross real estate asset perspective, we want to be in that sort of low 40s range, sort of 40% to 45% range over the long term and hopefully towards the bottom end of that range, if not below. From a debt-to-EBITDA perspective, we clearly intend to get that down into the sevens, and from a fixed charge coverage ratio, we want to get that up. All of those metrics we want to get in line with strong BBB investment grade metrics, and so that’s where we’re focused.
In terms of the asset sales and land sales, we’re still working through the whole budgeting process and allocation. Our intent is to more aggressively pursue land sales by widening and opening up the bucket of land available for sale. That’s not in and of itself going to generate land sales but it will certainly give our guys better direction and the ability to get creative in that. We’ve talked about, over the next two to three years, that we want to get our ultimate land balance down into that $600 million to $750 million range and that’s our focus in terms of land sales as well as putting land into development is long term, getting it down into that range. And if you sort of look out three years out, that’s where we’d hope to be.

So, one of the things I would say as it relates to land sales in the future is that the sales that will take place will likely be more weighted outside of these markets than inside these markets. In other words, our view is that we would be developing in these markets, which isn’t to say that we don’t have some parcels within these markets that could be for sale, but it is to say that we’re going to look very, very closely at developing and our focus development in these markets. And, so in the determination of all of that, we’ll take that into account.

As we monetize land and as we lease up the development portfolio as well as the gain occupancies in the overall portfolio, we believe our EBITDA will increase substantially. So the only metric in my mind that we’re out of line on today is really the debt-to-EBITDA and that’s because of the non-performing assets or non-income producing assets. So I’d go back and recalculate some of those debt metrics.
But relative to the rating agencies, I’m not going to go through every single agency and we put this in our presentation back at the BAML conference a couple of weeks ago. Every single agency calculates each of those metrics in a dramatically different fashion. So they have debt-to-EBITDA targets, one of them has if you’re below 10 times, you’re in good shape. Fixed charge coverage, one of them has if you’re at 1.5, another at 2.0, but they bear no relationship to each other in the calculation. And so it’s just a very confusing thing. I would encourage you to go back and look at sort of the last page of our presentation and you can get some indication as to how differently they calculate them, but clearly we’re focused on improving the leverage metrics.

Toronto is picking up steam. Potentially pockets of Washington D.C. are picking up steam. I’d also say areas within the U.K., and areas with certain size ranges within the U.K. particularly, larger buildings, appear to be picking up steam, and our folks are very bullish on Stuttgart and Munich, and certainly Tokyo.

So when we talked about guidance, we were talking about excluding those sort of one-time charges.

We’ve generated $0.38 of FFO relative to our core FFO guidance of $0.53 to $0.56. Therefore, our fourth quarter, to come inside the range, would be $0.15 to $0.18 or $0.19. Now we’ve taken into account the dilutive impact that we’ll have in the fourth quarter from the reinvestment of the Blackstone proceeds etc. But just, I want everybody to be clear, from our perspective relative to our guidance, our core FFO year-to-date is $0.38 and our full year FFO year-to-date is $0.50 relative to our guidance.

I would say that first of all, in the last four quarters we’ve started $593 million of new starts. And so, just to put things into context, let’s just round that and say in the last four quarters it’s been $600 million. So the expansion would be going from, if you will, $600 million to what we think is $800 million to $1 billion. What we’ve really seen for the most part in the last four quarter is a little bit of musical chairs, meaning that companies are moving from one facility into another generally in search of efficiencies. So, they may not be expanding, but they are certainly keeping, roughly the same square footage, some may be a little up, some a little down but moving from one asset, which is older into another asset that’s newer.
What we expect to see and what we’re beginning to see overall is expansion. If you take a look at the fact that first of all in the U.S., gross absorption last year was down roughly 50 n square feet to 60 million square feet. It was the first year gross absorption was down in the U.S. in the over 25 years since it’s been tracked.
This year, year-to-date gross absorption is a positive 35 million square feet. In most years, if you go back over 25 years, gross absorption is anywhere from 50 million square feet on the low side to close to 200 million square feet on the high side. And so, what we’re beginning to see is positive gross absorption. We’re seeing the same thing in Europe, which really to me, says that we’re looking at expansion. In my view, expansion means an overall expansion of our business.
So we feel that we could build roughly another $600 million to $700 million of build-to-suits next year if the market was, if you will, still in musical chair’s land. But in fact, we think the market will be expanding next year based on what we see and that’s what gives us more comfort in the $800 million to $1 billion range.
Let me just point out one other thing. If you take a look at overall retail sales and track that on a peak-to-trough basis, those retails sales went down 12%, then up 9.5% and they’re down roughly by 4% peak-to-trough. And then you look at inventories, which went down 15%, and they’ve only recovered about 6%, and they’re basically down 10.5% peak-to-trough.
What that basically tells you is that retail sales are rebounding, inventories haven’t rebounded but again we’re seeing that inventory rebound starting to kick in today, in terms of our discussions with our customers, in terms of the positive absorption that we’re seeing. And so, all of that is giving us comfort moving into next year that we should see an expanding development program.

It’s still 3PLs, transportation companies, electronics, appliance and paper packaging being the largest customer segments. But what we really have seen is certain segments begin to emerge. So internet retailers are emerging as a group that is really taking up space as well as food and supermarkets, healthcare and paper and packaging. And the paper and packaging companies are segmented as a group that we really look at because they are tracking very closely the increases in retail sales and inventory levels.

Can you sort of run through the spectrum of cap rates throughout your portfolio as you do your 2011 planning?

At that point, we will see what’s the - we probably expect a continued rolldown on rent renewals, but hopefully nothing as dramatic as we saw earlier in the year and hopefully more on a line that is coming down. However, we will have the benefits of the incremental occupancy that we gained this year in the development portfolio and hopefully increasing occupancies in both the overall portfolio but particularly the development portfolio going into next year. And so, we are going to have a little bit of a roll down but were also going to have increased occupancies and the full year of benefits.
Now that’s going to be tempered a bit depending upon the reinvestment opportunities associated with the asset sales etc. Again those are marginally or slightly dilutive today because our easiest and most obvious reinvestment rate is in reducing lower cost debt. So we’ve got a spread there. But overall, I think you hit the nail on the head in terms of fourth quarter as sort of the runway going into ‘11.

So let me just say, I know of very few assets that we own that I would classify as third-tier quality. So, it’s hard for me to really speak to that because I mean if you got a third-tier quality asset, you may not be able to sell it at all but we don’t own that type of product by and large.
So, I would just say the spectrum of cap rates, let me talk first about new assets throughout the world and then we’ll focus on second tier. New assets in Japan are probably 5.5% today. In the U.K., it’s probably 6% to 6.25%. On the continent in Europe and Western Europe, it is probably 7%. I’d say U.S. major markets would be anywhere from 6.5%, maybe even low 6s, to7%. And when I say major markets, it’s really the U.S. large corridors that are listed on page 5.4.
So, our focus is really building assets at an 8% or 8.5% or a 9% and picking up NAV growth through where the new asset cap rates are. But if we look at secondary markets and really, we don’t own a lot of second generation properties in secondary markets, but to the extent that we do, I’d say those assets today are trading it anywhere from 7.25% to probably an 8.5% and that kind of circles the fence let’s say and that would be in the U.S. And I would say that probably is the case for Europe as well. It’s hard for me to really gauge where second generation assets would trade in Japan, we just don’t own any nor do we really own much in the way of second-generation assets in Europe. So we don’t see a lot of that trading. But in the U.S., again I would say 7.25% to 8.5%, if they’re decent assets in second generation markets that have a little bit of age to them.

However, relative to the debt tenders and repurchasing debt, look I think, personally, it makes sense to continue to attack the debt maturities and the smoothing of those debt maturities at all times and paying a premium for potentially pieces of that is a factor of where interest rates are now versus where our debt costs are. The other opportunity in attacking some of that debt is to position ourselves better for future debt issuances, and candidly, transfer some of that debt that we might issue in the future over into the euro-related debt, Eurobond market to begin increasing the natural hedge on the euro. We’ve gotten a pretty sizeable rise in the euro over the last four to six weeks.
We do already put in place TMK bond debt as we stabilize our Japan buildings and so that provides fair amount of the natural hedge to the yen, but we’re light on the natural hedge to the euro today. And so, so cleaning up some of this debt taking some of it out of the system, smoothing out the maturities and potentially being able to replace it with euro-denominated debt over the next 12 to 18 months, in our mind, would be prudent.

So it could have a very significant positive impact on our rent rolldowns next year, and we got to take a close look at it.

One thing I would want to point out to make sure everybody knows is that we have a development portfolio leasing number and then we have, if you will, a static leasing number and the reason we track the static number because as we lease up some of these buildings, we had commitments to contribute those assets into mainly the European fund and we had a Japan joint venture as well.
And so, as we take those out of the portfolio, the leasing essentially drops because you are taking fully leased buildings and essentially contributing them.
So if you look on page 3.1, the actual leasing in the static portfolio, down at the bottom, is 74%. That number, I can tell you, has jumped materially since then, closer to 76% today because of some of the leasing that we’ve done in the quarter and that’s what gives us confidence that that number will rise to 80%. And that number went up 217 basis points during the quarter. We’ve talked about it, if you go back and take a look at what we said in the second quarter call, we knew that the third quarter would be a little slower, it always is in Europe.

So, as time goes on, you end up with less available units that will meet users’ demands, or users’ needs, and therefore you’re not going to be able to lease it as quickly as you did when you had two or three units that were larger that could be broken down and accommodate just about any size.
So I think naturally it takes longer as you get to the end, but I wouldn’t necessarily describe it because they’re lesser quality buildings.

This morning we’ll hear from Walt Rakowich, CEO, to comment on the market environment and then Bill Sullivan, CFO, will cover results and guidance. Additionally, we are joined today by Ted Antenucci, President and Chief Investment Officer, and Gary Anderson, Head of Global Operations and Investment Management. 
Yesterday afternoon, we announced our intention to offer, subject to market and other conditions, 80 million of our common shares. A separate press release was issued and a preliminary prospectus was filed providing details about the proposed transaction. The proposed offering is being made only by means of the preliminary prospectus supplement and related prospectus. I would refer you to the press release and the preliminary prospectus supplement for more specifics about the offering. Because this offering is pending, we are unable to say more about it on this call. 
Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to state that this conference call will contain forward looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about the market and the industry in which ProLogis operates as well as management’s beliefs and assumptions. 
Forward looking statements are not guaranteed the performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors please refer to the forward looking statement notice in our SEC filings. 
I’d also like to add that our third quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA, that are non GAAP measures, and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided reconciliation to those measures. 
As we’ve done in the past, to give a broader range of investors and analyst the opportunities to ask their questions, we will ask you to please limit your questions to one at a time. 
Walt, would you please begin?

It’s clear to us now that market conditions are improving. In Q2, we reported that net absorption had turned positive by 11 msf in US markets. In Europe, the same positive trend occurred. In Q3, we again saw positive net absorption of 7 msf feet in the US. The figures aren’t in yet for Europe, but we expect the results to be on the plus side as well. 
It had been obvious for some time that sales growth was outpacing inventory growth, as you would expect in the beginning of a recovery. We’re now beginning to see this trend reverse itself. 
There are few important data points in our third quarter operating results that point to fundamental improvement. First, same store NOI was a positive 0.27% and overall occupancies rose again by 24 basis points, mainly driven by occupancy increases in our direct owned portfolio. 
Our static development leasing was up by 217 basis points. Slower than previous quarters, but about what we expected due to the summer months in Europe where decisions are slow to materialize. Since the end of the quarter, overall activity has picked up. And given quarter-to-date agreements and leasing activity, we still expect our static development portfolio to be about 80% leased by year end. 
In addition, rental rates are becoming more encouraging. They’ve certainly flattened out in most markets. And now, in a few markets, they’re beginning to rise. For the last four quarters, our rental rate growth has been down 13.9% on average. This quarter it’s down 8.5%. 
And finally, as we’ve previously mentioned, we’re seeing some markets where new space is almost completely absorbed. This is an incredibly positive sign for the markets and for our development business. 
Now let me just spend a few minutes on our overall portfolio strategy. In our view, nobody in the industry owns a more geographically diverse portfolio of high quality industrial assets than ProLogis. That’s one of the benefits of having developed hundreds of millions of square feet of new product in global markets over the last 15 years. However, we intend to pursue opportunities to optimize our portfolio and sharpen our investment focus. Our aim is to invest our capital in the highest quality assets in major logistics corridors. 
In our supplemental disclosure on page 5.4, we list the major logistic corridors in North America, Europe, and Japan and our investment in those markets. We’re especially interested in these corridors because they have the highest concentration of population, which of course fuels consumption and business spending. These characteristics drive a deep and consistent need for goods and distribution in those areas.
Currently, we have 71% of our capital in these major corridors, adjusted for the Blackstone transaction. Over time, you are going to see us take this to 80 to 90% of our capital. And you’ll also see our development business more highly focused in these areas as well. That is not to say that we see little opportunity in some of the smaller, secondary markets. In fact, those opportunities will continue to exist, but our strategy will be more concentrated in the major markets from a long term, capital investment perspective. Which we believe will serve ourselves better in the years ahead.
So, how does this play into our thinking around the recently announced sale to Blackstone? Well, our strategy has been to recycle out of non strategic assets in predominantly secondary US. markets. This transaction moves us forward in the accomplishment of that objective. Of the direct owned sale portfolio, 72% of the assets are outside of the major logistics corridors in which we have chosen to concentrate our investment. In addition, the average tenant size of 44,000 square feet is about 40% smaller than our average across the company. And, only 8% of the square footage in the portfolio is leased by our global customers. So, after the completion of the transaction, we’ll have an additional $2 to $2.5 billion of non strategic industrial assets that we’ll target for distributions in future years. By recycling proceeds from these sales into new development, we believe we will substantially increase the NAV of the company. 
In addition, we’re going to look to exit our remaining investment in non industrial properties, which primarily consists of retail and other assets we acquired during the Catellus merger. Historically, there were tax consequences in selling these assets before 2014 given the 10 year tax prohibition of selling assets that were once held in a c corporation. However, the recent Jobs Bill, recently passed changed that provision for 2010 and 2011, and we now have a window to sell these assets sooner without C corp tax consequences. We will complete the first phase of these dispositions, by selling off our interest in the New Orleans Hilton, which we announced in the Blackstone transaction, and we are now actively engaged in the disposition of our remaining investment, which we hope to close in early 2011. 
Looking ahead to the future, our prospects for growth are strong. We’ve talked in the past about embedded growth in our overall occupancies and in our land bank, both of which are significant. We also think there will be future growth in market rents as they climb back to replacement cost levels, although that may take some time and it could be a little bit down the road. 
The emerging opportunity is in our development business. We have a very unique global franchise of people, customers, and land. In certain markets new product is virtually all absorbed and rents are poised to rise. Construction costs have adjusted downward. Competitors are on the sidelines, and we’re at an all time low in terms of new supply. And most importantly, customers are beginning to look for new space. 
We believe our new development starts will grow next year to $800 million, to perhaps as much as $1 billion. Levels will be up from this year in all regions of the world. How do we plan to pay for it. Really, in two different ways. For developments that are not in markets where we want our long term capital to be, we will be sellers. Just like we were this year when we built the Co-op build-to-suit and sold it in Scotland, and Miyagi build to suit in Sendai, Japan.
For the balance of it, as I mentioned, we will methodically recycle our capital out of older product or secondary markets, with the aim of holding those developments in targeted markets. This will create growth in our NAV, improve our geographic diversification and enhance the quality and concentration of our portfolio within major logistics corridors. 
Now, let me turn it over to Bill.

This morning I plan to cover four aspects of the companies financial position and strategy: Q3 and year-to-date results, expectations for Q4 strategic positioning, a high level overview of our outlook for 2011, and how we’re thinking about",1075,"Thanks, Walt. This morning I plan to cover four aspects of the companies financial position and strategy: Q3 and year-to-date results, expectations for Q4 strategic positioning, a high level overview of our outlook for 2011, and how we’re thinking about our dividend. We reported $0.22 per share in FFO for Q3 2010, after adding back $0.01 of non cash adjustments associated with impairments related to the sale of one building and one land parcel as well as modest losses from the early retirement of debt. 
Of the $0.22 per share in FFO for the quarter, $0.07 was in gains associated with contributions to PEP II and the sale of Ichikawa II, while the remaining $0.15 was core FFO. Q3 core FFO was slightly ahead of the guidance we provided last quarter when we stated that Q3 would comprise roughly 40% of our second half core FFO. Approximately $0.01 of Q3 core FFO was due to timing differences with the largest being reimbursement of certain expenses that had been budgeted for Q4. Gains of $0.07 per share also slightly exceeded the 30% of second half gains we anticipated in Q3, principally due to the strength yen and its effect on the sale proceeds of Ichikawa II. 
While we’ve seen significant strengthening of the Euro versus the Dollar in recent weeks, the average Euro exchange rate for core operating earnings in Q3 was $1.28 versus $1.29 for Q2, and therefore, the strength of the Euro was not a particular factor for Q3 core FFO. 
For the nine months ended September 30th, we have generated FFO, excluding non cash items, of $0.42. After adding back the $0.08 of non recurring charges that we highlighted in earlier conference calls, we have generated $0.50 of FFO relative to our full year guidance; of which $0.38 represents core FFO, with the remainder being gain related. 
Last week, with the announcement of our agreement to sell over $1 billion of assets to Blackstone, we reduced and tightened our full year core FFO range to reflect $0.015 to $0.02 of dilution. This was primarily due to exceeding our original guidance for sales and contributions of $1.3 to $1.5 billion. Additionally, the closing of the sales will take place sooner than expected with limited immediate reinvestment opportunities other than paying down the line of credit balance to zero and paying off our November bond maturity. 
For the first quarter in a long while, I’m not going to spend any time talking about debt maturities. With less than $400 million due before 2012 in non balance sheet debt, we are well positioned. We do, however, intend to continue to deleverage the company and bring our leverage, debt-to-EBITDA and fixed charge coverage in line with the sector and in line with investment grade metrics. 
We remain comfortable with our guidance for full FFO, excluding non cash items, from $0.70 to $0.78, which includes gains. Relative to core, including the dilutive impact from the Blackstone transaction, we expect our Q4 core FFO run rate to be roughly flat with Q3. As noted in our press release, we anticipate taking charges in the fourth quarter associated with strategic positioning activities, which will not be included in our definition core FFO. 
Relative to the strategic positioning initiative, we are highly focused on implementing a number of these in the fourth quarter. The most significant of which are:
The strategic decision to more aggressively pursue land sales, wherein, we are undertaking a rigorous, re-evaluation of all land position, with the aim to expand the bucket of land we will actively pursue sales on. As a result, we may take further impairments on our current book basis, which we would expect to be in line with discount ranges presented in our recent investor presentations. 
We are going to pursue a tender for various bonds and or converts of between $1 billion and $2 billion with the principal intent of further smoothing our annual maturities, as well as deploying the proceeds from our asset sales more accretively. The cost associated with these tenders, from both potential premium paid as well as transaction cost, will be incurred a special charges in Q4. 
We are likely to close out a few derivative positions inside our funds, which have become ineffective, as well as incur swap breakage costs as a result of a partial repayment of some fund debt. There would be one time charges associated with these transactions. 
We continue to focus on simplifying the company in creating incremental cost savings from structural and platform efficiencies, some of which may be incurred or reserved for in Q4. 
Finally, we are pursuing the sale of various non-core, retail, mixed use and ground lease assets, principally associated with our purchase of Catellus in 2005. The pursuit of the sale of these assets will likely result in a book impairment of approximately $120 million in Q4, but will also move us well down the path of simplification and getting back to our industrial roots. 
Implementation of these initiatives represents the completion of our stabilization and simplification task that we laid out two years ago in New York. Relative to these tasks, we’re at the 26 mile mark in the marathon and the finish line is in clear sight. 
Lastly, let me address our thinking about our dividend and core FFO for 2011. While the Blackstone transaction is expected to generate taxable gains, due to our intent to repurchase debt and other anticipated fourth quarter charges, our taxable income will be lower than we originally planned. As such, we plan to distribute $0.1125 per share in the fourth quarter. Our Board currently intends to maintain this level of cash dividend throughout 2011, which is a dividend level more in line with our expected taxable income and AFFO from core operations. We anticipate growing the dividend over time in line with AFFO growth. 
Turning to core FFO per share in 2011, we are looking at growth of 15% or more over 2010 core. And we plan to provide detail business drivers to support that guidance in early 2011. While our growth rate in 2011 will be impacted by the reinvestment dilution associated with our 2010 asset sales, we anticipate growth from the impact of further development portfolio leasing and occupancy, new built-to-suit developments coming online and higher average occupancies in both the funds and core portfolios. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Walt to wrap up.

Global markets are beginning to rebound and occupancies continue to rise. Overall, it’s beginning to feel better out there. 
Second, we think there will be strong development opportunities with healthy margins for companies with customer relationships, land, expertise and access to capital. This is where we intend to deploy the vast amount of our capital in the years ahead. 
And, third, when you combine the potential NAV accretion from the diversified development business, with the upside associated with occupancy gains, depressed market rents and monetization of land; it’s a powerful backdrop for future growth. Brighter days are ahead.

People measure them in different ways but the way we look at it from a debt-to-gross real estate asset perspective. We want to be in that sort of low 40s max of 40% to 45% range and over the long term hopefully towards the bottom end of that range, if not below. 
From a debt-to-EBITDA perspective, we clearly intend to get that down into the sevens, and from a fixed charge coverage ratio, we want to get that up. All of those metrics we want to get in line with strong BBB investment grade metrics, and so that’s where we’re focused. 
In terms of the asset sales and land sales, we’re still working through the whole budgeting process and allocation. Our intent is to more aggressively pursue land sales, by widening and opening up the bucket of land available for sale. That’s not in and of itself going to generate land sales but it will certainly give our guys better direction and the ability to get creative in that. 
We’ve talked about, over the next two to three years, that we want to get our ultimate land balance down into that $600 million to $750 million range. That’s our focus in terms of land sales, as well as, putting land into development is long term, getting it down into that range. So if you sort of look three years out, that’s where we’d hope to be.

This is where a lot of our investment, a majority of our investment, will take place in the future. And again, this is where 71% of our investment is today. So, one of the things I would say as it relates to land sales in the future is that the sales that will take place, will likely be more weighted outside of these markets than inside these markets. In other words, our view is that we would be developing in these markets. Which isn’t to say that we don’t have some parcels within these markets that could be for sale, but it is to say that we’re going to look very, very closely at developing and our focus development in these markets. And, so in the determination of all of that, we’ll take that into account.

But I think you ought to go back and take a look at the debt et cetera because candidly, we’re not that far off the debt metrics other than on the debt-to-EBITDA side. As we monetize land and as we lease up the development portfolio as well as the gain occupancies in the overall portfolio, we believe our EBITDA will increase substantially. And so the only metric in my mind that we’re out of line on today is really debt-to-EBITDA. That’s because of the non performing assets, or non income producing assets. So I’d go back and recalculate some of those debt metrics.
But relative to the rating agencies, I’m not going to go through every single agency. We put this in our presentation back at the BAML conference a couple of weeks ago. Every single agency calculates each of those metrics in a dramatically different fashion. So they have debt-to-EBITDA targets, one of them has if you’re below 10 times you’re in good shape. Fixed charge coverage, one of them has if you’re at 1.5, another at 2.0, but they bear no relationship to each other in the calculation. And so it’s just a very confusing thing. I would encourage you to go back and look at sort of the last page of our presentation and you can get some indication as to how differently they calculate them, but clearly we’re focused on improving the leverage metrics.

I will say, based on the book value today, close to 79 or 78% of our land is in the US. logistics corridors and about 66% of our land is in the corridors in Europe, relative to the book value today.
Now again, that may change with the overall analysis that we’re going to undertake in the fourth quarter but it does give you a pretty good idea. I will say that those numbers pretty closely mirror the acreage, which obviously will not change. So, we are pretty well positioned to develop in those corridors relative to our land overall. But again, I can’t tell you where the fourth quarter numbers are going to come out.

I mean, we are seeing in markets, it’s not like you have more build-to-suits in one market verses another. It’s amazing how spread out that seems to be. What that’s really done is create an opportunity for us, this year at least, to look at a few build-to-suits and do we want to own this or don’t we want to own this? As I mentioned in my comments, two of those build-to-suits we decided to sell off. One was in Sendai and one was in Scotland. 
With that said, I think the markets that are probably ripe for development in the future and, I’ll say this, by saying non-build-to-suit development, i.e. a little bit more inventory development, are L.A. seems to be picking up steam. Toronto is picking up steam. Potentially pockets of Washington D.C. are picking up steam. I’d also say areas within the UK, and areas with certain size ranges within the UK particularly larger buildings appear to be picking up steam. Our folks are very bullish on Stuttgart and Munich. 
So there are areas throughout the world and certainly Tokyo, there are areas throughout the world where we really believe the markets are actually back today. We’ll begin to see some development moving into next year.

Given that the run rate will be around, I guess the $0.12 to $0.13 a share range in Q4 and that probably doesn’t include the full quarter impact of the Blackstone sale. 
And then you’ll be selling an additional $350 to $550 million of non core assets, which are also likely to be dilutive. So it just seems like, there’s a lot of growth that’s going to get baked into 2011, and I’m wondering where that’s going to stem from?

So that all the numbers that everybody is focused on are identical and hopefully you guys will start focusing on core as a key sort of guidance measure so that the consensus estimates out there become consistent. 
But, just to clarify the $0.42 etcetera. Back in my comments, I talked about the fact that we’ve got $0.42 of year-to-date FFO. However, in the first quarter, and this is all related to our guidance in the first quarter we had about $0.08 of actual cash but not non recurring charges principally associated with our tender exercise earlier in the year where we paid some premiums on the repurchases of those bonds. 
So when we talked about guidance, we were talking about excluding those sort of one time charges. If you exclude those one time charges of about $0.08, we’ve generated $0.50 of FFO this year, relative to our $0.70 to $0.78 full year guidance. On a core FFO basis, we’ve generated $0.38 this year. In other words, of that $0.50, $0.12 is clearly related to gains. 
We’ve generated $0.38 of FFO, relative to our core FFO guidance of $0.53 to $0.56. Therefore, our fourth quarter, to come inside the range, would be $0.15 to $0.18 or $0.19. Now we’ve taken into account the dilutive impact that we’ll have in the fourth quarter from the reinvestment of the Blackstone proceeds et cetera. But just, I want everybody to be clear, from our perspective relative to our guidance, our FFO; our core FFO year-to-date is $0.38 and our full year FFO, year to date is $0.50 relative to our guidance.

Just to put things into context, let’s just round that and say in the last four quarters it’s been $600 million. So the expansion would be going from, if you will, $600 million to what we think is $800 million to $1 billion. 
What we’ve really seen for the most part in the last four quarter is a little bit of musical chairs, meaning that companies are moving from one facility into another generally in search of efficiencies. So, they may not be expanding, but they are certainly keeping, roughly the same square footage some may be a little up, some a little down but moving from one asset, which is older into another asset that’s newer. 
What we expect to see and what we’re beginning to see overall is expansion. If you take a look at the fact that first of all in the US, gross absorption last year was down roughly 50 msf to 60 msf. It was the first year gross absorption was down in the US in the over 25 years since it’s been tracked. 
This year, year-to-date gross absorption is a positive 35 msf. In most years, if you go back over 25 years, gross absorption is anywhere from 50 msf on the low side to close to 200 msf on the high side. And so, what we’re beginning to see is positive gross absorption. We’re seeing the same thing in Europe. That really to me, says that we’re looking at expansion. In my view, expansion means an overall expansion of our business. So we feel that we could build roughly another $600 million to $700 million of build-to-suits next year if the market was, if you will, still in musical chair land. But in fact, we think the market will be expanding next year based on what we see and that’s what gives us more comfort in the $800 million to $1 billion range. 
Let me just point out one other thing. If you take a look at overall retail sales and track that on a peak to trough basis, those retails sales went down 12%, then up 9.5% and they’re down roughly by 4% peak to trough. And then you look at inventories, which went down 15%, and they’ve only recovered about 6%, and they’re basically down 10.5% peak to trough. 
What that basically tells you is retail sales are rebounding, inventories haven’t rebounded but again we’re seeing that inventory rebound starting to kick in today. In terms of our discussions with our customers, in terms of the positive absorption that we’re seeing, all of that is giving us comfort moving into next year that we should see an expanding development program.

So internet retailers are emerging as a group that is really taking up space as well as food and supermarkets, healthcare and paper and packaging. The paper and packaging companies are segmented as a group that we’re really looking closely at because they track very closely the increases in retail sales and inventory levels.

We probably expect a continued roll down on rent renewals, but hopefully nothing as dramatic as we saw earlier in the year and hopefully more on a line that is coming down. 
However, we will have the benefits of the incremental occupancy that we gained this year in the development portfolio and hopefully increasing occupancies in both the overall portfolio but particularly the development portfolio going into next year. So we are going to have a little bit of a roll down but were also going to have increased occupancies and the full year of benefits. 
Now that’s going to be tempered a bit depending upon the reinvestment opportunities associated with the asset sales et cetera. Again those are marginally, or slightly, dilutive today because our easiest and most obvious reinvestment rate is in reducing lower cost debt. So we’ve got a spread there. But overall, I think you hit the nail on the head in terms of fourth quarter as sort of the runway going into ‘11.

So let me just say, I know of very few assets that we own that I would classify as third tier quality. So, it’s hard for me to really speak to that. If you got a third tier quality asset, you might not be able to sell it at all but we don’t own that type of product by and large. So, I would just say the spectrum of cap rates. Let me talk first about new assets throughout the world and then we’ll focus on second tier. New assets in Japan are probably 5.5% today. In the UK, it’s probably 6 to 6.25%. On the continent in Europe and Western Europe, it is probably 7%. I’d say US major markets would be anywhere from 6.5, maybe even low 6s, to7%. And when I say major markets, it’s really the US large corridors that are listed on page 5.4. 
So, our focus is really building assets at an 8 or 8.5 or a 9 and picking up NAV growth through where the new asset cap rates are. But if we look at secondary markets and really, we don’t own a lot of second generation properties in secondary markets, but to the extent that we do, I’d say those assets today are trading anywhere from 7.25 to probably an 8.5. And that kind of circles the fence let’s say and that would be in the US. And that’s hard for me. And I would say that is probably the case for Europe as well, it’s hard for me to really gauge where second generation assets would trade in Japan. Nor do we really own much in the way of second generation assets in Europe, so we don’t see a lot of that trading. But in the US, again I would say 7.25 to 8.5, if they’re decent assets in second generation markets that have a little bit of age to them.

However, relative to the debt tenders and repurchasing debt, look I think, personally, it makes sense to continue to attack the debt maturities and the smoothing of those debt maturities at all times. Paying a premium for potentially pieces of that is a factor of where interest rates are now versus where our debt costs are. The other opportunity in attacking some of that debt is to position ourselves better for future debt issuances, and candidly, transfer some of that debt that we might issue in the future over into the Euro related Eurobond market to begin increasing the natural hedge on the Euro. 
We’ve gotten a pretty sizeable rise on the Euro over the last four to six weeks. We do already put in place TMK bond debt as we stabilize our Japan buildings and so that provides a natural hedge to the yen, but we’re light on the natural hedge of the Euro today. So cleaning up some of this debt, taking it out of the system, smoothing out the maturities and potentially being able to replace it with Euro denominated debt over the next 12 to 18 months, in our mind, would be prudent.

One I want to point out so that everybody knows is that we have a development portfolio leasing number and then we have, if you will, a static leasing number. The reason we track that static number because as we leased up some of these buildings we had commitments to contribute those assets into mainly the European fund and the Japan joint venture as well. So, as we take those out of the portfolio, the leasing essentially drops because you are taking fully leased buildings and essentially contributing them. 
So, if you look on page 3.1 the actual leasing in the static portfolio, down at the bottom, is 74%. That number, I can tell you, has jumped materially since then, closer to 76% today because of some of the leasing that we’ve done in the quarter. And that’s what gives us confidence that that number will rise to 80%. That number went up 217 basis points during the quarter. 
We’ve talked about it, if you go back to what we talked about in the second quarter call, we knew that the third quarter would be a little slower it always is in Europe. The majority of the space that needs to be leased is in Europe. So, we’ve got confidence based on the activities that we see that we will be in that 80% type level at the end of the year.

For the most part everything we built is in the best markets in the world. There are certainly going be some buildings that we have leased a portion of, that will have space available in, that are 100,000 square foot unit or 150,000 square foot unit, of the larger building. Often times, it takes a little while to find the right size customer to fit that remaining space. 
So, as time goes on, you end up with less available units that will meet users’ demands, or users’ needs, and therefore you’re not going to be able to lease it as quickly as you did when you had two or three units that were larger that could be broken down and accommodate just about any size. So I think naturally it takes longer as you get to the end, but I wouldn’t necessarily describe it because they’re lesser quality buildings.

It’s clear to us now that market conditions are improving. In Q2, we reported that net absorption had turned positive by 11 msf in US markets. In Europe, the same positive trend occurred. In Q3, we again saw positive net absorption of 7 msf feet in the US. The figures aren’t in yet for Europe, but we expect the results to be on the plus side as well. 
It had been obvious for some time that sales growth was outpacing inventory growth, as you would expect in the beginning of a recovery. We’re now beginning to see this trend reverse itself. 
There are few important data points in our third quarter operating results that point to fundamental improvement. First, same store NOI was a positive 0.27% and overall occupancies rose again by 24 basis points, mainly driven by occupancy increases in our direct owned portfolio. 
Our static development leasing was up by 217 basis points. Slower than previous quarters, but about what we expected due to the summer months in Europe where decisions are slow to materialize. Since the end of the quarter, overall activity has picked up. And given quarter-to-date agreements and leasing activity, we still expect our static development portfolio to be about 80% leased by year end. 
In addition, rental rates are becoming more encouraging. They’ve certainly flattened out in most markets. And now, in a few markets, they’re beginning to rise. For the last four quarters, our rental rate growth has been down 13.9% on average. This quarter it’s down 8.5%. 
And finally, as we’ve previously mentioned, we’re seeing some markets where new space is almost completely absorbed. This is an incredibly positive sign for the markets and for our development business. 
Now let me just spend a few minutes on our overall portfolio strategy. In our view, nobody in the industry owns a more geographically diverse portfolio of high quality industrial assets than ProLogis. That’s one of the benefits of having developed hundreds of millions of square feet of new product in global markets over the last 15 years. However, we intend to pursue opportunities to optimize our portfolio and sharpen our investment focus. Our aim is to invest our capital in the highest quality assets in major logistics corridors. 
In our supplemental disclosure on page 5.4, we list the major logistic corridors in North America, Europe, and Japan and our investment in those markets. We’re especially interested in these corridors because they have the highest concentration of population, which of course fuels consumption and business spending. These characteristics drive a deep and consistent need for goods and distribution in those areas.
Currently, we have 71% of our capital in these major corridors, adjusted for the Blackstone transaction. Over time, you are going to see us take this to 80 to 90% of our capital. And you’ll also see our development business more highly focused in these areas as well. That is not to say that we see little opportunity in some of the smaller, secondary markets. In fact, those opportunities will continue to exist, but our strategy will be more concentrated in the major markets from a long term, capital investment perspective. Which we believe will serve ourselves better in the years ahead.
So, how does this play into our thinking around the recently announced sale to Blackstone? Well, our strategy has been to recycle out of non strategic assets in predominantly secondary US. markets. This transaction moves us forward in the accomplishment of that objective. Of the direct owned sale portfolio, 72% of the assets are outside of the major logistics corridors in which we have chosen to concentrate our investment. In addition, the average tenant size of 44,000 square feet is about 40% smaller than our average across the company. And, only 8% of the square footage in the portfolio is leased by our global customers. So, after the completion of the transaction, we’ll have an additional $2 to $2.5 billion of non strategic industrial assets that we’ll target for distributions in future years. By recycling proceeds from these sales into new development, we believe we will substantially increase the NAV of the company. 
In addition, we’re going to look to exit our remaining investment in non industrial properties, which primarily consists of retail and other assets we acquired during the Catellus merger. Historically, there were tax consequences in selling these assets before 2014 given the 10 year tax prohibition of selling assets that were once held in a c corporation. However, the recent Jobs Bill, recently passed changed that provision for 2010 and 2011, and we now have a window to sell these assets sooner without C corp tax consequences. We will complete the first phase of these dispositions, by selling off our interest in the New Orleans Hilton, which we announced in the Blackstone transaction, and we are now actively engaged in the disposition of our remaining investment, which we hope to close in early 2011. 
Looking ahead to the future, our prospects for growth are strong. We’ve talked in the past about embedded growth in our overall occupancies and in our land bank, both of which are significant. We also think there will be future growth in market rents as they climb back to replacement cost levels, although that may take some time and it could be a little bit down the road. 
The emerging opportunity is in our development business. We have a very unique global franchise of people, customers, and land. In certain markets new product is virtually all absorbed and rents are poised to rise. Construction costs have adjusted downward. Competitors are on the sidelines, and we’re at an all time low in terms of new supply. And most importantly, customers are beginning to look for new space. 
We believe our new development starts will grow next year to $800 million, to perhaps as much as $1 billion. Levels will be up from this year in all regions of the world. How do we plan to pay for it. Really, in two different ways. For developments that are not in markets where we want our long term capital to be, we will be sellers. Just like we were this year when we built the Co-op build-to-suit and sold it in Scotland, and Miyagi build to suit in Sendai, Japan.
For the balance of it, as I mentioned, we will methodically recycle our capital out of older product or secondary markets, with the aim of holding those developments in targeted markets. This will create growth in our NAV, improve our geographic diversification and enhance the quality and concentration of our portfolio within major logistics corridors. 
Now, let me turn it over to Bill.

This morning I plan to cover four aspects of the companies financial position and strategy: Q3 and year-to-date results, expectations for Q4 strategic positioning, a high level overview of our outlook for 2011, and how we’re thinking about",1075,"Thanks, Walt. This morning I plan to cover four aspects of the companies financial position and strategy: Q3 and year-to-date results, expectations for Q4 strategic positioning, a high level overview of our outlook for 2011, and how we’re thinking about our dividend. We reported $0.22 per share in FFO for Q3 2010, after adding back $0.01 of non cash adjustments associated with impairments related to the sale of one building and one land parcel as well as modest losses from the early retirement of debt. 
Of the $0.22 per share in FFO for the quarter, $0.07 was in gains associated with contributions to PEP II and the sale of Ichikawa II, while the remaining $0.15 was core FFO. Q3 core FFO was slightly ahead of the guidance we provided last quarter when we stated that Q3 would comprise roughly 40% of our second half core FFO. Approximately $0.01 of Q3 core FFO was due to timing differences with the largest being reimbursement of certain expenses that had been budgeted for Q4. Gains of $0.07 per share also slightly exceeded the 30% of second half gains we anticipated in Q3, principally due to the strength yen and its effect on the sale proceeds of Ichikawa II. 
While we’ve seen significant strengthening of the Euro versus the Dollar in recent weeks, the average Euro exchange rate for core operating earnings in Q3 was $1.28 versus $1.29 for Q2, and therefore, the strength of the Euro was not a particular factor for Q3 core FFO. 
For the nine months ended September 30th, we have generated FFO, excluding non cash items, of $0.42. After adding back the $0.08 of non recurring charges that we highlighted in earlier conference calls, we have generated $0.50 of FFO relative to our full year guidance; of which $0.38 represents core FFO, with the remainder being gain related. 
Last week, with the announcement of our agreement to sell over $1 billion of assets to Blackstone, we reduced and tightened our full year core FFO range to reflect $0.015 to $0.02 of dilution. This was primarily due to exceeding our original guidance for sales and contributions of $1.3 to $1.5 billion. Additionally, the closing of the sales will take place sooner than expected with limited immediate reinvestment opportunities other than paying down the line of credit balance to zero and paying off our November bond maturity. 
For the first quarter in a long while, I’m not going to spend any time talking about debt maturities. With less than $400 million due before 2012 in non balance sheet debt, we are well positioned. We do, however, intend to continue to deleverage the company and bring our leverage, debt-to-EBITDA and fixed charge coverage in line with the sector and in line with investment grade metrics. 
We remain comfortable with our guidance for full FFO, excluding non cash items, from $0.70 to $0.78, which includes gains. Relative to core, including the dilutive impact from the Blackstone transaction, we expect our Q4 core FFO run rate to be roughly flat with Q3. As noted in our press release, we anticipate taking charges in the fourth quarter associated with strategic positioning activities, which will not be included in our definition core FFO. 
Relative to the strategic positioning initiative, we are highly focused on implementing a number of these in the fourth quarter. The most significant of which are:
The strategic decision to more aggressively pursue land sales, wherein, we are undertaking a rigorous, re-evaluation of all land position, with the aim to expand the bucket of land we will actively pursue sales on. As a result, we may take further impairments on our current book basis, which we would expect to be in line with discount ranges presented in our recent investor presentations. 
We are going to pursue a tender for various bonds and or converts of between $1 billion and $2 billion with the principal intent of further smoothing our annual maturities, as well as deploying the proceeds from our asset sales more accretively. The cost associated with these tenders, from both potential premium paid as well as transaction cost, will be incurred a special charges in Q4. 
We are likely to close out a few derivative positions inside our funds, which have become ineffective, as well as incur swap breakage costs as a result of a partial repayment of some fund debt. There would be one time charges associated with these transactions. 
We continue to focus on simplifying the company in creating incremental cost savings from structural and platform efficiencies, some of which may be incurred or reserved for in Q4. 
Finally, we are pursuing the sale of various non-core, retail, mixed use and ground lease assets, principally associated with our purchase of Catellus in 2005. The pursuit of the sale of these assets will likely result in a book impairment of approximately $120 million in Q4, but will also move us well down the path of simplification and getting back to our industrial roots. 
Implementation of these initiatives represents the completion of our stabilization and simplification task that we laid out two years ago in New York. Relative to these tasks, we’re at the 26 mile mark in the marathon and the finish line is in clear sight. 
Lastly, let me address our thinking about our dividend and core FFO for 2011. While the Blackstone transaction is expected to generate taxable gains, due to our intent to repurchase debt and other anticipated fourth quarter charges, our taxable income will be lower than we originally planned. As such, we plan to distribute $0.1125 per share in the fourth quarter. Our Board currently intends to maintain this level of cash dividend throughout 2011, which is a dividend level more in line with our expected taxable income and AFFO from core operations. We anticipate growing the dividend over time in line with AFFO growth. 
Turning to core FFO per share in 2011, we are looking at growth of 15% or more over 2010 core. And we plan to provide detail business drivers to support that guidance in early 2011. While our growth rate in 2011 will be impacted by the reinvestment dilution associated with our 2010 asset sales, we anticipate growth from the impact of further development portfolio leasing and occupancy, new built-to-suit developments coming online and higher average occupancies in both the funds and core portfolios. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Walt to wrap up.

We want to be in that sort of low 40s max of 40% to 45% range and over the long term hopefully towards the bottom end of that range, if not below. 
From a debt-to-EBITDA perspective, we clearly intend to get that down into the sevens, and from a fixed charge coverage ratio, we want to get that up. All of those metrics we want to get in line with strong BBB investment grade metrics, and so that’s where we’re focused. 
In terms of the asset sales and land sales, we’re still working through the whole budgeting process and allocation. Our intent is to more aggressively pursue land sales, by widening and opening up the bucket of land available for sale. That’s not in and of itself going to generate land sales but it will certainly give our guys better direction and the ability to get creative in that. 
We’ve talked about, over the next two to three years, that we want to get our ultimate land balance down into that $600 million to $750 million range. That’s our focus in terms of land sales, as well as, putting land into development is long term, getting it down into that range.

In other words, our view is that we would be developing in these markets. Which isn’t to say that we don’t have some parcels within these markets that could be for sale, but it is to say that we’re going to look very, very closely at developing and our focus development in these markets. And, so in the determination of all of that, we’ll take that into account.

But I think you ought to go back and take a look at the debt et cetera because candidly, we’re not that far off the debt metrics other than on the debt-to-EBITDA side. As we monetize land and as we lease up the development portfolio as well as the gain occupancies in the overall portfolio, we believe our EBITDA will increase substantially. And so the only metric in my mind that we’re out of line on today is really debt-to-EBITDA. That’s because of the non performing assets, or non income producing assets. So I’d go back and recalculate some of those debt metrics.
But relative to the rating agencies, I’m not going to go through every single agency. We put this in our presentation back at the BAML conference a couple of weeks ago. Every single agency calculates each of those metrics in a dramatically different fashion. So they have debt-to-EBITDA targets, one of them has if you’re below 10 times you’re in good shape. Fixed charge coverage, one of them has if you’re at 1.5, another at 2.0, but they bear no relationship to each other in the calculation. And so it’s just a very confusing thing. I would encourage you to go back and look at sort of the last page of our presentation and you can get some indication as to how differently they calculate them, but clearly we’re focused on improving the leverage metrics.

Toronto is picking up steam. Potentially pockets of Washington D.C. are picking up steam. I’d also say areas within the UK, and areas with certain size ranges within the UK particularly larger buildings appear to be picking up steam. Our folks are very bullish on Stuttgart and Munich. 
So there are areas throughout the world and certainly Tokyo, there are areas throughout the world where we really believe the markets are actually back today. We’ll begin to see some development moving into next year.

Given that the run rate will be around, I guess the $0.12 to $0.13 a share range in Q4 and that probably doesn’t include the full quarter impact of the Blackstone sale.

So that all the numbers that everybody is focused on are identical and hopefully you guys will start focusing on core as a key sort of guidance measure so that the consensus estimates out there become consistent. 
But, just to clarify the $0.42 etcetera. Back in my comments, I talked about the fact that we’ve got $0.42 of year-to-date FFO. However, in the first quarter, and this is all related to our guidance in the first quarter we had about $0.08 of actual cash but not non recurring charges principally associated with our tender exercise earlier in the year where we paid some premiums on the repurchases of those bonds. 
So when we talked about guidance, we were talking about excluding those sort of one time charges. If you exclude those one time charges of about $0.08, we’ve generated $0.50 of FFO this year, relative to our $0.70 to $0.78 full year guidance. On a core FFO basis, we’ve generated $0.38 this year. In other words, of that $0.50, $0.12 is clearly related to gains. 
We’ve generated $0.38 of FFO, relative to our core FFO guidance of $0.53 to $0.56. Therefore, our fourth quarter, to come inside the range, would be $0.15 to $0.18 or $0.19. Now we’ve taken into account the dilutive impact that we’ll have in the fourth quarter from the reinvestment of the Blackstone proceeds et cetera. But just, I want everybody to be clear, from our perspective relative to our guidance, our FFO; our core FFO year-to-date is $0.38 and our full year FFO, year to date is $0.50 relative to our guidance.

Just to put things into context, let’s just round that and say in the last four quarters it’s been $600 million. So the expansion would be going from, if you will, $600 million to what we think is $800 million to $1 billion. 
What we’ve really seen for the most part in the last four quarter is a little bit of musical chairs, meaning that companies are moving from one facility into another generally in search of efficiencies. So, they may not be expanding, but they are certainly keeping, roughly the same square footage some may be a little up, some a little down but moving from one asset, which is older into another asset that’s newer. 
What we expect to see and what we’re beginning to see overall is expansion. If you take a look at the fact that first of all in the US, gross absorption last year was down roughly 50 msf to 60 msf. It was the first year gross absorption was down in the US in the over 25 years since it’s been tracked. 
This year, year-to-date gross absorption is a positive 35 msf. In most years, if you go back over 25 years, gross absorption is anywhere from 50 msf on the low side to close to 200 msf on the high side. And so, what we’re beginning to see is positive gross absorption. We’re seeing the same thing in Europe. That really to me, says that we’re looking at expansion. In my view, expansion means an overall expansion of our business. So we feel that we could build roughly another $600 million to $700 million of build-to-suits next year if the market was, if you will, still in musical chair land. But in fact, we think the market will be expanding next year based on what we see and that’s what gives us more comfort in the $800 million to $1 billion range. 
Let me just point out one other thing. If you take a look at overall retail sales and track that on a peak to trough basis, those retails sales went down 12%, then up 9.5% and they’re down roughly by 4% peak to trough. And then you look at inventories, which went down 15%, and they’ve only recovered about 6%, and they’re basically down 10.5% peak to trough. 
What that basically tells you is retail sales are rebounding, inventories haven’t rebounded but again we’re seeing that inventory rebound starting to kick in today. In terms of our discussions with our customers, in terms of the positive absorption that we’re seeing, all of that is giving us comfort moving into next year that we should see an expanding development program.

So internet retailers are emerging as a group that is really taking up space as well as food and supermarkets, healthcare and paper and packaging. The paper and packaging companies are segmented as a group that we’re really looking closely at because they track very closely the increases in retail sales and inventory levels.

However, we will have the benefits of the incremental occupancy that we gained this year in the development portfolio and hopefully increasing occupancies in both the overall portfolio but particularly the development portfolio going into next year. So we are going to have a little bit of a roll down but were also going to have increased occupancies and the full year of benefits. 
Now that’s going to be tempered a bit depending upon the reinvestment opportunities associated with the asset sales et cetera. Again those are marginally, or slightly, dilutive today because our easiest and most obvious reinvestment rate is in reducing lower cost debt. So we’ve got a spread there.

So let me just say, I know of very few assets that we own that I would classify as third tier quality. So, it’s hard for me to really speak to that. If you got a third tier quality asset, you might not be able to sell it at all but we don’t own that type of product by and large. So, I would just say the spectrum of cap rates. Let me talk first about new assets throughout the world and then we’ll focus on second tier. New assets in Japan are probably 5.5% today. In the UK, it’s probably 6 to 6.25%. On the continent in Europe and Western Europe, it is probably 7%. I’d say US major markets would be anywhere from 6.5, maybe even low 6s, to7%. And when I say major markets, it’s really the US large corridors that are listed on page 5.4. 
So, our focus is really building assets at an 8 or 8.5 or a 9 and picking up NAV growth through where the new asset cap rates are. But if we look at secondary markets and really, we don’t own a lot of second generation properties in secondary markets, but to the extent that we do, I’d say those assets today are trading anywhere from 7.25 to probably an 8.5. And that kind of circles the fence let’s say and that would be in the US. And that’s hard for me. And I would say that is probably the case for Europe as well, it’s hard for me to really gauge where second generation assets would trade in Japan. Nor do we really own much in the way of second generation assets in Europe, so we don’t see a lot of that trading. But in the US, again I would say 7.25 to 8.5, if they’re decent assets in second generation markets that have a little bit of age to them.

However, relative to the debt tenders and repurchasing debt, look I think, personally, it makes sense to continue to attack the debt maturities and the smoothing of those debt maturities at all times. Paying a premium for potentially pieces of that is a factor of where interest rates are now versus where our debt costs are. The other opportunity in attacking some of that debt is to position ourselves better for future debt issuances, and candidly, transfer some of that debt that we might issue in the future over into the Euro related Eurobond market to begin increasing the natural hedge on the Euro. 
We’ve gotten a pretty sizeable rise on the Euro over the last four to six weeks. We do already put in place TMK bond debt as we stabilize our Japan buildings and so that provides a natural hedge to the yen, but we’re light on the natural hedge of the Euro today. So cleaning up some of this debt, taking it out of the system, smoothing out the maturities and potentially being able to replace it with Euro denominated debt over the next 12 to 18 months, in our mind, would be prudent.

And I think there’s going to be a number of companies that are developers out there that will be on the sidelines and not able to take advantage of those opportunities because they’re not well capitalized. Our company is in a great position take advantage of them, and we want to make sure that we are well capitalized to do it.

We are seeing net effective rent basically stabilize across all of our global markets. We are expecting them to be flat to up in 2011. For the last four quarters, the average rental rate growth was negative 13.9, and again, Q3 was negative 8.51%. I think our view is that there is going to be variation in the go forward quarters probably up from that 8.51% but ultimately it will trend down through 2011 as we roll off 2006, ‘07 and ’08 peak rents. So the general trend is down from where we are today.

If you take a look at where our investment is, one of the things we really haven’t talked about is we have $2.4 billion of our investment in L.A, which is sizable relative to the overall company, it is our largest investment by 2.5 times any place in the world and we’re beginning to see rents move up in Southern California. So it could have a very significant impact, positive impact, on our rent roll downs next year, and we’ve got to take a close look at it. I would estimate that we are still over market by call it 5, 6, 7% in the aggregate. But that could really change very quickly. I mean market rents jump 5% and all of a sudden, three months from now, I will tell you we are at market. So we’ll see, but we are beginning to see some good things happening out in the market place today.

One I want to point out so that everybody knows is that we have a development portfolio leasing number and then we have, if you will, a static leasing number. The reason we track that static number because as we leased up some of these buildings we had commitments to contribute those assets into mainly the European fund and the Japan joint venture as well. So, as we take those out of the portfolio, the leasing essentially drops because you are taking fully leased buildings and essentially contributing them. 
So, if you look on page 3.1 the actual leasing in the static portfolio, down at the bottom, is 74%. That number, I can tell you, has jumped materially since then, closer to 76% today because of some of the leasing that we’ve done in the quarter. And that’s what gives us confidence that that number will rise to 80%. That number went up 217 basis points during the quarter. 
We’ve talked about it, if you go back to what we talked about in the second quarter call, we knew that the third quarter would be a little slower it always is in Europe. The majority of the space that needs to be leased is in Europe. So, we’ve got confidence based on the activities that we see that we will be in that 80% type level at the end of the year.

For the most part everything we built is in the best markets in the world. There are certainly going be some buildings that we have leased a portion of, that will have space available in, that are 100,000 square foot unit or 150,000 square foot unit, of the larger building. Often times, it takes a little while to find the right size customer to fit that remaining space. 
So, as time goes on, you end up with less available units that will meet users’ demands, or users’ needs, and therefore you’re not going to be able to lease it as quickly as you did when you had two or three units that were larger that could be broken down and accommodate just about any size. So I think naturally it takes longer as you get to the end, but I wouldn’t necessarily describe it because they’re lesser quality buildings.
