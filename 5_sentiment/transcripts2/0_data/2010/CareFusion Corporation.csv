Thank you for joining us on today's call as we provide an overview of CareFusion's results for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2009 and an update on our outlook for full year fiscal 2010.Our",457,"Thank you, Alicia, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call as we provide an overview of CareFusion's results for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2009 and an update on our outlook for full year fiscal 2010.
Our press release was issued today at 1 P. M. Pacific Time or 4 P. M. Eastern Time, posted on our website at www.CareFusion.com and filed on the Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
We also filed and posted several slides to accompany today's webcast. While we will not review each slide on today's call, these slides should be used as a reference guide by investors. Slides include comparisons of the results for our second quarter ended December 31, 2009 to both the prior year period and to our first quarter ended September 30, 2009; as well as an updated financial outlook for the full year and definitions of our non-GAAP items and reconciliations to GAAP.
Joining me on today's call are David Schlotterbeck, CareFusion's CEO; Ed Borkowski, our CFO; and Dwight Winstead, our Chief Operating Officer. Before I turn the call over, I would like to make a few remarks.
In today's call, we will be presenting our results on a GAAP and on an adjusted basis. Our adjusted results exclude restructuring and acquisition integration charges, one-time spinoff-related costs, nonrecurring tax items, and discontinued operations. We believe that the adjusted financial measures can facilitate a more complete analysis and greater transparency into our ongoing results of operations, particularly in comparing underlying results from period-to-period. Our management team utilizes adjusted financial measures internally and financial planning to monitor business unit performance and in evaluating management performance. We have included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with today's release.
I would also like to remind investors that during today's call, we will be making statements that are forward-looking and consequently are subject to risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include statements regarding our fiscal 2010 guidance, our expectations regarding hospital capital spending, our expected stand-up costs and other costs related to the separation from Cardinal Health, and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.
You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this afternoon's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
With that, I will turn the call over to Dave.

Before I talk about our Q2 results and the outlook for the balance of the fiscal year, I would like to say a few words about the business community’s admirable response to the disaster in Haiti. I am particularly proud of our CareFusio",1713,"Thank you, Carol. Before I talk about our Q2 results and the outlook for the balance of the fiscal year, I would like to say a few words about the business community’s admirable response to the disaster in Haiti. I am particularly proud of our CareFusion employees. Across our global operations, we mobilized within a 48-hour period, worked with our customers to reprioritize orders and had a $3.1 million donation ready to go with Infusion pumps, ventilators, and water purification products purchased from another local company. We were not alone. Many other healthcare companies did their part to collectively pledge millions of dollars in cash and products during the first two weeks following the disaster. The people of Haiti need our help and I am proud of the way our industry has responded.
Now, let me turn to our Q2 performance. As we discussed during our Q1 call, the first half of fiscal 2009 was very strong for us, as the capital spending slowdown was in the early stages. We believe we were the first med tech company to call the slowdown back in November of 2008. At that time, our order pipeline was full, and we were efficiently installing this backlog through the end of our Q2 of last year. It wasn't until Q3 of fiscal 2009 that the slowdown showed in our financial results.
Now against this backdrop of a very strong Q2 in the prior year, we executed particularly well this quarter and continued to grow our business. Top line revenue grew 5%, with strong performance in our Infusion and Respiratory businesses within the Critical Care Technologies segment, and from our Interventional Specialties in surgical products businesses within our Medical Technologies and Services segment. Our Dispensing business performed exactly as we expected. Equally important were order rates, which were strong across Critical Care Technologies, including in our Dispensing business, where we continued to expand our book of business.
Recent customer wins across the segment include Tenet Healthcare, and ten-year agreement to upgrade Infusion pumps across Tenet’s 50 affiliated hospitals. This is one of the largest Infusion contracts in history. The Cleveland Clinic, where we are completing a sole source agreement to upgrade and expand our Pyxis medication Dispensing technology. CHRISTUS Healthcare, a five-year sole source agreement to upgrade and expand Pyxis Perioperative Dispensing technology across this 25 hospital network. And of course, we continue to fill ventilator orders for the CDC as part of our contract for the national strategic stockpile.
Competitively, we are in a great position across this segment. For example, in the Infusion business, we have won 95% of the 74 new contracts where we completed, of which 80% were competitive displacements. We continue to take market share.
In summary, this was a good quarter. We executed well. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.39, which gives me confidence to raise our guidance for the year to the upper end of our previously-provided $1.35 to $1.45 range. I expect we will finish the fiscal year in the range of $1.40 to $1.45. This guidance assumes no further material improvement in hospital capital spending during this fiscal year.
Now, while I am pleased to be at the upper end of our prior guidance range, we are executing against a long-term strategy and we have important investments to make in the second half of our fiscal 2010 that I will not compromise. These investments will govern earnings growth somewhat in Q3 and Q4. In total, we are investing nearly $30 million in the second half of our year in increased R&D, expanded sales coverage, and new product launches. I will provide you examples of where we are investing shortly, what let me first address the hospital capital spending environment.
As I said during our Q1 call, we are seeing a gradual thaw in hospital spending. I have characterized orders as improving about 10% to 15% beyond the 10% to 15% improvement we saw beginning in April of 2009. We saw this modest momentum from Q1 continue in Q2, and as an example, I believe orders within our Infusion business are now running at about 65% to 70% of where they were during the first half of calendar 2008. We remain disciplined in our tracking of deal flow and still see about $250 million in capital orders on hold. While this is modest progress, it remains encouraging. I remain very comfortable with our long-term goals to grow revenue in the mid-single digits and earnings in the 11% to 15% range. Strategically and competitively, we are in an enviable position.
I want to say a few words about our long-term strategy and investments we are making in the second half of the fiscal year. We are delivering clinically proven products that will lower the cost of healthcare for generations to come. This focus has initially been supported through our work to eliminate medication errors and hospital acquired infections, because addressing these two issues could eliminate more than $20 billion of excess costs in the United States alone. We are now making additional investments that will expand our portfolio into adjacencies that continue this theme of lowering healthcare costs.
Let me give you some recent and near-term examples of how we are innovating to reduce healthcare costs. First, you may have read about a groundbreaking study published in January in the New England Journal of Medicine, proving the superiority of 2% chlorhexidine-alcohol in skin preparation prior to certain surgeries. Using our ChloraPrep product, the study showed a 41% reduction in surgical site infections over traditional povidone-iodine. Based on these results, proper skin preparation using 2% chlorhexidine-alcohol has the potential to remove as much as $4 billion in healthcare costs in the US alone. Some hospitals are already declaring it the standard of care for certain surgical procedures. We have long believed ChloraPrep should be the standard of care in preparing nations prior to surgery or catheter insertions. To drive our growth, we are making investments to increase our sales force in the US and in key geographies worldwide.
In March, we will launch an innovative product to hold a laparoscopic video camera during minimally invasive procedures. There are 3 million laparoscopic surgical procedures annually, and in 95% of them, a surgeon, clinician, or surgical intern now holds the camera for up to two hours. Can you imagine trying to hold a camera steady for two hours? This device allows the surgeon to easily manipulate the camera with greater control and stability. We believe this could reduce procedure times by 10% and free 1 person using minimally invasive surgeries to perform higher value duties. These are high-value procedures, and we estimate the time saved will enable larger hospitals to add one or two more procedures every day. With the scarcity of clinical resources and the need for greater efficiency, we believe the economic impact of this product will be substantial.
Finally, we are investing in another important segment of the market for spinal surgery, by expanding our product platform to better address compression fractures. We are in limited release with a new product and based on early feedback, we are increasing our investment to drive its growth. This is a $500 million to $600 million segment that is rapidly growing because 50% of women and 25% of men over the age of 50 will experience one of these painful fractures.
There are two primary approaches, both of which deliver bone cement to vertebrae to stabilize the fracture. One approach is vertebroplasty, delivering bone cement with specialized needles. We have a system that has been widely adopted in this space. The other approach is kyphoplasty, where a small balloon is first inserted to open the space prior to delivering the bone cement. We will offer a highly-differentiated value proposition, with our new kyphoplastic offering, that I think will become another example of lowering the cost of healthcare for generations to come. Not only will our products be very competitively priced, we believe the features of these products will make them safer and more effective for surgeons and interventional radiologists to use. CareFusion will be the only company in the industry to offer a full line of products that address both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.
Of course, we also continue to invest in our core brands. In December, we announced six new Pyxis products at the largest annual conference for hospital pharmacists. These products continue our leadership in improving safety and lowering costs by supporting care communication in the hospital. Within the Alaris line, we implemented an important customer installation to automatically document Infusion data to the hospital’s electronic medical record. This closer integration of our devices with the hospital’s IT system frees nurses from tedious and error-prone manual documentation and allows them to spend more time caring for patients.
I will close by re-iterating that the long-term fundamental drivers of our business remain very positive. We have scale in our key product lines with growth opportunities in all geographies, a robust innovation pipeline with resources and opportunities to further differentiate through innovation. We expect to see R&D investments increase in the second half of FY10 and I remain committed to our long-term goal of investing 6% to 7% of sales on innovation. I want to clarify one point about this metric.
When I talk about the percentage of our sales invested in R&D, I am referring to our product businesses. Remember, we also have a large distribution business outside the United States that has no associated R&D investments and therefore, its sales are not included in the calculation of this metric. While I haven't defined that specifically before, I think this makes the most sense, given the composition of our business. In the future, we will also look to provide you with more color around the capitalized portion of our R&D investments. For those businesses that have R&D spending, we expect to exit the year with our R&D spend approaching 5% of sales.
And finally, we are uniquely focused on measurably improving the safety and efficiency of healthcare, reducing the cost of healthcare for generations to come. We have an experienced management team with a proven track record of success that is highly motivated to grow our business.
Now, let me turn it over to Ed.

I will review our results in more detail and provide some additional commentary on our expectations for the second half of the year. But first, let me provide a brief recap of the quarter. Our strong results",1679,"Thank you, Dave; and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our results in more detail and provide some additional commentary on our expectations for the second half of the year. But first, let me provide a brief recap of the quarter. Our strong results for the second quarter were led by a significant increase of sales in our Respiratory products related to flu preparedness and H1N1, and better-than-expected sales in our Infusion business. Our product mix for the current quarter came in differently than we had forecasted, with Respiratory sales making up a larger proportion of overall sales. This change in mix impacted both our gross margins and our tax rate. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was higher due to this change in product mix and the jurisdictions where these sales occurred.
As I take you through the details of our second quarter results on a year-over-year comparison, I will also highlight some of the sequential improvements we made from the first to the second quarter, which may be more relevant.
Total revenue for the second quarter increased 5% to $1 billion compared to the prior year period, or 2% on a constant currency basis. Sequentially, our revenues increased by $96 million or 11%. For the second half of the year, we expect our top line to grow over the first half revenues of $1.9 billion, with a slight weight into the fourth quarter. With this upward revenue trend, we are raising our full-year revenue guidance to be in the range of $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion, up from the previously provided range of $3.85 billion to $4.00 billion. We continue to expect a moderately positive impact from foreign currency on the full year.
Moving on to our segments, I would like to remind you that our fiscal 2010 results include higher SG&A expense related to standing up as a public company than the historical comparisons.
In our Critical Care Technologies segment, which includes our Dispensing, Infusion and Respiratory business lines, revenues were $682 million, and adjusted segment profit was $126 million, a 1% and a 15% decrease respectively from the prior-year period. Sequentially, revenue increased 11% and adjusted segment profit increased 13%. The growth in our second quarter top line was driven by the significant increase in sales in our Respiratory products that I mentioned previously.
We performed better than expected in our Infusion business during the quarter as our business gained momentum following the ship hold that was lifted in July of 2009 and we continued to increase our competitive wins. Our Dispensing business remains on track and in line with our estimates. As expected, second-quarter sales were down compared to the prior year period, but were up sequentially. As we said last quarter, we expect Dispensing sales to be flat year-over-year due to delays in hospital capital spending. For the second half, we expect the Critical Care Technologies segment top line growth rates to increase versus the first half, due to increased sales in our Dispensing and Respiratory businesses.
In our Medical Technologies and Services segment, which includes our Infection Prevention and Medical Specialties businesses, revenues were $337 million, a 15% increase over the prior-year period. Results were driven primarily by increased sales from our International Surgical Products business, formerly known as our international distribution business; and our Interventional Specialties business. Adjusted segment profit decreased 19% to $23 million, primarily related to corporate overhead costs of operating as a public company, which were partially offset by increased profitability in our Interventional Specialties business.
On a sequential basis, MTS revenues increased 10% and adjusted segment profit increased 6%. For the second half, we expect MTS sales to increase from the $643 million of revenue we recorded in the first six months, driven by the sales of our ChloraPrep product.
Gross margins for the second quarter were 47% compared to 49% in the prior-year period, due to product mix. As I said earlier, we had higher Respiratory sales this quarter. Recall that our Respiratory gross margins are somewhat lower than gross margins in our other capital equipment businesses and positively offsetting this impact was our continued cost management and manufacturing efficiencies realized during the current year quarter. For the full fiscal year, we expect our gross margins to be approximately 48% and in line with our previously-provided guidance of 47% to 48%. Product mix will affect gross margins as Respiratory sales increase over the first half levels.
Adjusted operating expenses, including SG&A and R&D totaled $329 million or 32% of total revenue, in line with our expectations. Adjusted SG&A expense of $292 million increased 14% over the prior year period, as the incremental operating costs related to standing up as a public company impacted our spend. This spend was positively offset by the previously announced March 2009 restructuring. R&D for the quarter totaled $37 million, down from the $41 million invested in the prior year period, impacted by the timing of product development.
As we look to our adjusted operating expenses for the remainder of the year, I would like to reiterate what Dave said about executing on our longer-term strategy and making necessary investments. In the second half of the year, we will be increasing our investments to support the sales of our ChloraPrep product in the United States to support upcoming launches of our ChloraPrep product internationally, and to build a sales force to support the launch and promotion of our kyphoplasty product. We are also expecting R&D to increase in the second half, as we ramp up product development. Together, these additional investments will increase our operating expenses by approximately $30 million beyond our initial plan. We expect these investments to provide incremental returns in fiscal 2011 and beyond, including contributing to top line growth and margin expansion.
For the full year, we expect our adjusted operating expenses to be between 34% to 35% of total revenue, within the range previously provided, driven by the investments I just mentioned, and the timing of the spend for our stand-up costs, which are somewhat weighted to the second half of the year.
Interest expense and other totaled $24 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, primarily driven by interest on our $1.4 billion of debt, which carries a yield to maturity interest rate of 5.8%. Our adjusted effective tax rate of 30.2% for the second quarter was higher than our previous guidance, primarily driven by the increase in our Respiratory product sales and compares to a rate of 20.6% for the prior year period. The period-over-period increase in the tax rate is primarily driven by a shift in the mix of pre-tax income to higher tax jurisdictions. We expect that the shift in the mix of pre-tax income to higher tax jurisdictions we saw in the second quarter will continue to impact the remainder of the fiscal year, and as a result, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 28% for the full year, an increase over the range we had previously guided. The higher tax rate will have an approximate $0.04 impact to our earnings for the year.
Moving to operating cash flow, for the six months ended December 31, 2009, our operating cash flow from continuing operations was approximately $351 million. Capital spending totaled $67 million and depreciation and amortization was $84 million. At December 31, we had $970 million in cash. For the full year, we expect our capital spending to be approximately $160 million to $170 million, down from the $180 million we had previously guided to, driven by the timing of projects. We continue to expect that depreciation and amortization will be approximately $170 million.
Our financial condition continues to strengthen, and we now expect our operating cash flow will be in the range of $500 million to $550 million, up from the range of $400 million to $450 million we had previously provided.
Our adjusted net income for the quarter totaled $88 million, compared to $110 million a year ago. Our fully diluted adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.39, compared to $0.50 a year ago, and flat compared to our first quarter ended September 30, 2009. Excluded from adjusted earnings in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 are $22 million in one-time pre-tax expenditures or $0.07 per fully diluted share.
Based on our results for the first half of fiscal 2010 and the investments we intend to make in the second half of the year, we are raising the lower end of our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05, and are now projecting EPS to be between $1.40 and $1.45. This narrowed guidance range implies an adjusted EPS range of $0.61 to $0.66 for the second half of the year, a decline over the $0.79 recorded in the first half, most of which is driven by the additional commercial and R&D investments we plan to make in the second half of the year to support long-term growth as well as the timing of the spend for our stand-up costs.
Turning to currency, we have previously indicated that currency will provide a benefit of about $0.01 per share per quarter. Even with the recent strengthening of the dollar, we did not see a material change from that impact.
Before we move into the Q&A, I would like to reiterate that our management team’s commitment is to make investments we believe will allow us to continue to grow our business. Looking beyond fiscal 2010, we remain committed to growing our top line in the mid-single digits and our earnings in an 11% to 15% range. We still have a lot of work to do over the next several years as we stand up the company, exit the transition service agreements with Cardinal Health, and drive margin improvements throughout our business. We are pleased that our strong results for the first six months as a public company allows us to continue on with our priorities of investing in our long-term strategic plans.
I will now turn the call over to Carol for questions.

It has a full range of benefits and we believe ultimately can help reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia. Now I want to mention that we recently discovered an electromagnetic sensitivity, which led us to recall the first six units that we had shipped. We are targeting to resume customer shipments next quarter, and no impact on full year performance.

Our press release was issued today at 1 p.m. Pacific Time, or 4 p.m. Eastern Time, posted on our website at www.carefusion.com and filed on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We also filed and posted several slides to accompany today's webcast. While we will not review each slide on today's call, these slides should be used as a reference guide for investors.  The slides include comparisons of the results for the three and nine months ending March 31 to both the prior-year period, as well is an updated financial outlook for our full year fiscal 2010 and definitions of our non-GAAP items and reconciliations to GAAP.
Joining me on today's call are David Schlotterbeck, CareFusion's CEO; Ed Borkowski, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dwight Winstead, our Chief Operating Officer. Before I turn the call over I'd like to make just a few remarks. 
In today's call we will be presenting our results on a GAAP and on an adjusted basis. Our adjusted results exclude restructuring and acquisition integration charges, one-time spinoff related costs, nonrecurring tax items and discontinued operations. We believe that adjusted financial measures can facilitate a more complete analysis and greater transparency into our ongoing results of operations, particularly in comparing underlying results from period to period. Our management team utilizes adjusted financial measures internally and financial planning to monitor business unit performance and in evaluating management performance.  We have included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with today's release. 
I would like to remind investors that during today's call, we will be making statements that are forward-looking statements and consequently are subject to risks and uncertainties. Examples include statements regarding our fiscal 2010 guidance, our expectations regarding hospital capital spending, expected stand-up costs and other costs related to the separation from Cardinal Health and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. 
You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this afternoon's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Dave."

We made substantial progress in our business this quarter and we have a lot to cover today. Let me begin by talking about our performance in the third quarter and then provide some color on the balance of the year as we move into our fiscal 2011. I'll also provide my perspective on recent developments in the Infusion market. 
Our results in Q3 were in line with how we expected the year would trend, but our normal seasonal decline in Q3 revenue was more pronounced primarily due to an installation reschedule in our Dispensing business from the back half of FY '10 to the front half of FY '11, and to a lesser extent and earlier into the flu season. This lower topline, of course, had an impact on our bottom line. Looking ahead to Q4, I expect to see a strong sequential improvement from this quarter, and I remain confident in our full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.40 to $1.45. We remain on track to achieve this.
Let's start with the top line. For our capital equipment businesses, Q2 and Q4 tend to be our strongest revenue quarters because they coincide with hospital yearends and our own. That makes Q1 and Q3 our historically weaker quarters. However, this Q1, as you know, was strong due to the bolus of Infusion sales we had following the release of our ship hold in July. Even with a solid revenue increase of 13% from last year's Q3, we indeed followed the historic trend with revenue that was sequentially down from Q2. Therefore, while Q3 was somewhat weaker than we had originally expected, it was in line with how our business normally trends and how we guided for the full year. The shift in revenue from this fiscal year to next fiscal year will put us slightly below the low end of FY '10 revenue range previously provided. Even though our customers are making some near-term decisions in prioritizing capital spending, the fundamentals of our business remain strong. We remain confident in our ability to achieve mid-single digit long-term revenue growth. We continue to see a gradual falling in the hospital capital spending environment during Q3. I'd like to give you more color on this and how it's affecting our business.
There are clear differences emerging in how hospitals are allocating their limited capital resources. IT projects are moving to the top of hospitals' priority lists to take advantage of funds that are available through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act.  We also believe that critical care devices, such as our Infusion pumps, are among the higher priorities. We continue to track orders that are on hold and estimate another 10% of the $250 million in capital equipment projects I referenced last quarter were converted to orders in Q3.
Looking at segment performance in Q3, our Infusion and Respiratory businesses within Critical Care Technologies had another strong quarter as did the Interventional Specialties, Infection Prevention and International Surgical Products businesses within Medical Technologies and Services. Highlights from Q3 include excellent progress in our Dispensing business. Data from HIMSS Analytics confirms we have gained market share throughout the year, something our win-loss analysis has indicated for some time. For six quarters we've also ranked number one in customer satisfaction according to MD Buyline. In Q3, our success continued with Dispensing contracts at Ascension Health, one of the largest care providers in the U.S. with locations in 19 states, and Banner and Sutter Health, which combined represent about 50 major hospitals in the Western United States. Within the Infusion business, we again won more than 90% of the new contracts where we competed and we increased our win rate in competitive situations.
Though the flu season began and ended earlier than in prior years, which put some pressure on Respiratory Disposable sales, our total Respiratory business continued to perform well. Outside the U.S., Respiratory revenue grew 50% from the prior year. And in our Medical Technologies and Services segment, we saw an increase in sales of our ChloraPrep product with March being our best month ever in ChloraPrep. In addition to the New England Journal of Medicine study from January, the May issue of the American Journal of Infection Control published a study showing an 84% reduction in post-cesarean section surgical infections when a protocol is followed that includes ChloraPrep.
I spoke last quarter about the investments we plan to make in Q3 and Q4 that would somewhat govern our earnings growth in FY '10. We're on track with those investments. We increased our R&D expenditures, expanded our coverage to drive ChloraPrep sales and completed our hiring of sales reps for expansion into the kyphoplasty segment of spinal surgery. 
In March, we launched our AVAmax veterbral balloon product for kyphoplasty procedures and are now in limited release. The product is performing very well in the field and feedback has been very positive. Last month, we introduced our new EnView camera controller. This device allows a surgeon to easily manipulate the endoscope, or camera, with greater control and stability during minimally invasive surgeries. There are 3 million of these procedures performed annually in the United States, and in early use of our device, we are seeing very good results. We are looking forward to a full-market release in Q1.
In addition, we made strategic progress in optimizing our business portfolio, most notably with our plans to acquire Medegen, a proven innovator in needleless valves and IV disposable products. Medegen's products have helped hospitals demonstrate substantial declines in catheter-related bloodstream infections, which are a significant problem for hospitals worldwide. These infections have been shown to increase a patient's hospital stay by 10 to 24 days with approximately 25% of the 250,000 annual incidents resulting in death. We are working through all of the customary closing conditions now, and subject to clearance from the FTC expect to finalize the acquisition before the end of our fiscal year.
Finally, we completed and announced an important strategic agreement last week with Cerner. Neal Patterson, the CEO of Cerner, and I personally endorse this first-of-its-kind agreement in our industry. We believe that we'll create a unified solution for closed-loop management of medications and medical supplies within a hospital. As medical devices and information technology continue to converge in healthcare, we expect that this agreement will help our joint hospital customers further improve patient safety, regulatory compliance and financial performance. In addition, Cerner will become a value-added reseller for Pyxis  products in Cerner's core electronic health record accounts. This is exciting for us because Cerner is the healthcare IT supplier of choice and hundreds of U.S. hospitals giving us additional reach and presence for one of our core offerings. We expect this to be a very successful agreement for both companies and to expand it in the future with other CareFusion products. Each of these developments reinforces my view that strategically and competitively we remain in an enviable position. 
Now before I turn it over to Ed to discuss our financial results in more detail, I'd like to address recent developments in the Infusion market that will have some effect on our business in FY '11 and over the longer term.
On April 23, the FDA issued a draft guidance document for the premarket clearance of Infusion pumps. We have reviewed the guidance and we both understand and fully support their intent to protect patients from harm. The guidance is thorough and rigorous and therefore will add time and additional complexity to our development and product introduction cycles. We take our responsibility very seriously, and since 2007 we have invested more than $125 million in our quality systems and product improvements. We will work closely with the FDA as we implement processes and procedures aligned with this new guidance. 
Earlier this week, Baxter and the FDA announced plans to remove Baxter's install base of Colleague pumps from U.S. hospitals. While it would be premature to forecast the impact of this decision on our Infusion business, we have reviewed our manufacturing and customer support capacity and we are prepared to meet any increase in demand. As you know, we demonstrated our ability to meet high levels of customer demand following the release of our own ship hold in July of last year, shipping as many as 5,000 units per day. The Alaris system is a highly-differentiated product with safety features and a scalable platform that has proven effective in hospitals of all sizes.  We will include our view of the impact when we provide our fiscal 2011 guidance.
I want to close by thanking our employees from around the world for their hard work and commitment particularly with all that was going on in this last quarter.  Eight months into our spin up and stand up as CareFusion, we're making excellent progress. I remain very optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. 
We raised our guidance in November and again raised the narrative in February. We have good visibility through the fourth quarter of this fiscal year and we're confident of our long-term gross prospects. As a new company, we are well positioned with our vision to improve the cost and safety of healthcare for generations to come and our mission to deliver clinically-proven products and services to improve care. This focus continues to resonate with our customers. We are backing it up with investments in our future pipeline. 
Now let me turn it over tho Ed."

Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on today's call. Before I take you through our results for the third quarter and guidance for the year, I would like to reiterate that while our third quarter was weaker than we origin",1420,"Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on today's call. Before I take you through our results for the third quarter and guidance for the year, I would like to reiterate that while our third quarter was weaker than we originally expected, principally due to the shift in revenue of dispensing, a shorter flu season for Respiratory and a higher tax rate, it was in line with how our business normally trends and how we guided for the full year.
Starting with the top line, total revenue increased 13% to $952 million compared to the prior year period or 10% on a constant currency basis. For the first nine months, we recorded total revenues of $2.9 billion. We expect fourth quarter revenues to be up sequentially driven by trends we see in our capital equipment businesses. This increase is occurring notwithstanding the Dispensing revenue shift to the first half of fiscal 2011. As a result of these trends, we now expect fiscal 2010 revenues to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion. 
Moving to our segments, I would like to remind you that our fiscal 2010 results include higher SG&A expense related to standing up as a public company compared to our historical results. In our Critical Care Technology segment, which includes our Dispensing, Infusion and Respiratory business lines, revenues were $629 million and adjusted segment profit was $90 million, a 16% increase and a 30% increase respectively from the prior-year period. The growth in our third-quarter topline was driven by the significant increase in sales in our Respiratory business where we saw increased demand in ventilators for flu and emergency preparedness related to H1N1.
In addition, we recorded increased sales in our Infusion business as we continue to gain momentum and increase our competitive wins. For the full fiscal year, we expect our critical care technology segment topline growth in high single digits and for product mix in the fourth quarter to shift as Infusion and Dispensing sales grow sequentially and Respiratory sales remain at third quarter levels. 
In our Medical Technologies and Services segment, which includes our Infection Prevention and Medical Specialties businesses, revenues were $323 million, a 7% increase over the prior-year period. Results were driven primarily by increased sales from our International Surgical Products business, our ChloraPrep skin antiseptic product and our Interventional Specialties business. 
Adjusted segment profit was $22 million, a decrease of $26 million year-over-year, primarily driven by higher cost for standing up as a public company. On a sequential basis, adjusted segment profit decreased $1 million from the second quarter related to increased sales resources to support our ChloraPrep and kyphoplasty products. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect double-digit topline growth driven by sales from our International Surgical Products business and our ChloraPrep product.
Gross margins for the third quarter were 47%, compared to 50% in the prior year due to product mix, which included higher Respiratory and lower Dispensing sales during the current year quarter. The current product mix puts pressure on gross margins as our Respiratory gross margins are lower than those in our other capital equipment businesses and our Dispensing gross margins are generally higher than the corporate average. Positively offsetting this impact was our continued efforts in cost management and ongoing manufacturing efficiencies realized during the current year quarter.  For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect our gross margins to be approximately 48%. 
Adjusted operating expenses including SG&A and R&D, totaled $340 million or 36% of total revenue, in line with our expectations. Adjusted SG&A expense of $298 million increased 14% over the prior-year period as the incremental operating costs related to standing up as a public company impacted our spend. This spend was positively offset by benefits from the March 2009 restructuring.
R&D for the quarter totaled $42 million, up 8% from the prior year as we increased our investment in R&D. For the full year, we expect our adjusted operating expenses to be approximately 34% of total revenues driven by R&D spend, commercial investments and stand-up costs. We have taken certain actions to control spending in the fourth quarter which will carry into fiscal 2011. We continue to evaluate our overall operations and cost of doing business as we close out our fiscal 2010. Operationally, we believe that with our continued focus on cost and our ability to execute, we can over the near and long-term improve our margins by driving efficiencies to improve our costs and goods and decrease our SG&A spend.
Interest expense and other totaled $29 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, primarily driven by interest in our $1.4 billion of debt which carries a yield-to-maturity interest rate of 5.8%, as well as foreign currency and miscellaneous expense related the nonoperating items that flow through this line item. We do not anticipate that these miscellaneous items will continue in the fourth quarter, and as a result we are forecasting approximately $25 million for this item.
Last quarter we indicated that currency would provide about a penny per quarter compared to last year's results. Even with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we do not see a material change in that guidance and expect that currency will benefit the bottom line by approximately $0.05 for the full year. 
As disclosed in today's press release, we undertook an extensive review of our existing tax reserves, and based on this review determined to increase our tax reserves by $58 million. Given the size of our business and our global structure, we made what we believe are the appropriate adjustments and do not expect to make additional related reserves in future periods.
Based on current revenue projections, we expect that our adjusted tax rate, excluding the $58 million charge, will remain at approximately 28% for the year. During the fiscal 2011, our preliminary expectations based upon revenue mix indicate that our adjusted tax rate will be approximately 30%. We continue to believe we have opportunities to decrease our tax rate over the longer term. As a result of the increase in our tax reserves, our GAAP tax rate for the current quarter increased significantly to 114%. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of the tax reserve change, our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 30%. 
Moving to operating cash flow for the nine months ended March 31, 2010, our operating cash flow from continuing operations was approximately $536 million. Capital spending totaled $96 million and depreciation and amortization was $129 million. At March 31, we had $1.1 billion in cash. As we announced on April 5, we intend to use to $225 million of that cash to acquire Medegen.
For the full year, we expect our capital spending to be approximately $140 million to $150 million, down from the $160 million to $170 million we had previously guided to driven primarily by the timing of projects. We expect that depreciation and amortization will be approximately $170 million for the year. Our operating cash flow for the full year is expected to be approximately $550 million reflecting disbursements of taxes and payables due in the fourth quarter. 
Our adjusted net income for the quarter was $57 million compared to $78 million a year ago.  Our fully diluted adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.26 compared to $0.35 a year ago, driven by a higher tax rate, operating expenses and interest expense and other in the current quarter. Excluding from adjusted earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 are $19 million in one-time expenditures and the $58 million increase in tax reserves or $0.30 per fully diluted share.  
Based on our results for the first nine months of fiscal 2010, and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are reaffirming our full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.40 to $1.45.
Before we move into the Q&A, I would like to provide a couple of updates. First, as we have stated previously, we intend to evaluate acquisitions that can help drive our growth and expansion goals as we did with Medegen, but also consider opportunities to rationalize our portfolio and divest in non-core businesses. Following the close of the quarter, we signed a definitive agreement to divest our Research Services business to eResearch Technology. Second, our fourth quarter and full year results will be announced in August and at that time we will provide financial guidance for fiscal 2011. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Carol for questions."

Neal Patterson and I met personally and sort of consummated the arrangement between the two companies and we both are of a similar mind that different pieces of equipment in the hospital need to be able to show the clinicians the same information that they can get from a terminal. And we decided to start with our Dispensing equipment. And there are actually a number of benefits for the hospital customers because ultimately we will integrate the information contained in the Cerner EMR currently available elsewhere to the customer into the Dispensing equipment, and we will feed back into the Cerner EMR information that comes out of the Dispensing equipment. This really simplifies the workflow for the customer greatly. And in fact, within 48 hours of that announcement going out, we had already heard from customers that had actually decided to buy someone else's Dispensing equipment, that they were putting their decision on hold and we're going to evaluate what the benefits would be  for them to go to Pyxis. I think there's financially, and from a business standpoint for the Pyxis business, there is a number of customers in the hundreds that we already have Dispensing equipment with. And I think that the retention rate is going to go up dramatically for that group of customers. There are a number of others that are not currently Pyxis customers that really provide opportunity to convert. And we actually expect to see revenues starting to show up in the first quarter of this new fiscal year. And this has already been rolled out to the Cerner salespeople, and frankly their reaction was extremely positive. And this is really the first step in a long-term plan.  We'll really have the first relationship where ultimately all of our medical devices and capital equipment will connect to talk with feed the Cerner system. And I think that's what the customer deserves, and I'm hopeful that we're able to put together similar arrangements with other HIT suppliers because it's ultimately going to take cost out of healthcare, which is really what our mission is all about."

We continue to look at how many people we need to run all that, as well as what kind of services need to support all of that. So as you would expect in this quarter, as we've been running the business for the last two or three quarters, continue to focus on what exactly we need in going forward. This quarter we did take some additional actions to take a hard look at future hiring, and things like that, to make sure that we have the right size. We have plenty of employees, just making sure that they are all doing the -- that they're in the right places doing the right things. There are other things that we've looked at in terms of, as you can imagine, going through an initial spin, a lot of work going on with a lot of consultants.  We've really looked at that spin very hard to see what we're doing, what we're spending, to make sure it's as efficient as possible and discrete as possible as we go forward.

And what I said in my prepared remarks, Erik, were that we actually increased our competitive win rate in Q3. Now I don't have an up-to-date independent third-party assessment of our share, but what I'm being told is that it's 40%-ish and growing. And the way that that works is that you only increase share is if you win a competitive account. If you re-up an existing customer, that's not a share increase, although it is a business benefit. And so it's really important from a share perspective to make sure that your competitive wins are actually greater than your share in the market. And so we're running twice our share in the market right now, so that says to me we're clearly taking share. It's probably worth mentioning that share in the Infusion market changes slowly. I remember I think in 2000 or so that Alaris had then about a 28% share and that has grown now to about 40%. That's been a 10-year period. And the reason for that is only 20% of the market shows up for renewal or less. Sometimes it's as small as 14% of the market shows up for renewal on an annualized basis. And so that's sort of what you have to work with and governs your ability to take share. Now I will tell you if the useful life on this pumps were shorter, we'd take share a lot faster. But also keep in mind that customers buy house-wide and it's probably -- Infusion pumps are the most ubiquitous medical device in healthcare facilities and they average one per bed. And so it's not something the customer can really afford to re-outfit on a frequent basis. Now I think the Baxter withdrawal from the market is sort of going to accelerate that 20% per year, if what I've read that they have about 200,000 units in the market. The average number of units placed in the United States in total is about 120,000 a year. So that's about two-and-three-quarter years worth of Infusion pumps that will be showing up sort of unexpectedly, or one-and-three-quarter years.  I did my math wrong.  I'm sorry."

Our press release was issued today at 1 p.m. Pacific Time, or 4 p.m. Eastern Time, posted on our website at www.carefusion.com and filed on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also filed and posted several slides to accompany today's webcast. While we will not review each slide on today's call, these slides should be used as a reference guide for investors.  The slides include comparisons of the results for the three and nine months ending March 31 to both the prior-year period, as well is an updated financial outlook for our full year fiscal 2010 and definitions of our non-GAAP items and reconciliations to GAAP.
Joining me on today's call are David Schlotterbeck, CareFusion's CEO; Ed Borkowski, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dwight Winstead, our Chief Operating Officer. Before I turn the call over I'd like to make just a few remarks. 
In today's call we will be presenting our results on a GAAP and on an adjusted basis. Our adjusted results exclude restructuring and acquisition integration charges, one-time spinoff related costs, nonrecurring tax items and discontinued operations. We believe that adjusted financial measures can facilitate a more complete analysis and greater transparency into our ongoing results of operations, particularly in comparing underlying results from period to period. Our management team utilizes adjusted financial measures internally and financial planning to monitor business unit performance and in evaluating management performance.  We have included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with today's release. 
I would like to remind investors that during today's call, we will be making statements that are forward-looking statements and consequently are subject to risks and uncertainties. Examples include statements regarding our fiscal 2010 guidance, our expectations regarding hospital capital spending, expected stand-up costs and other costs related to the separation from Cardinal Health and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. 
You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this afternoon's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Dave."

We made substantial progress in our business this quarter and we have a lot to cover today. Let me begin by talking about our performance in the third quarter and then provide some color on the balance of the year as we move into our fiscal 2011. I'll also provide my perspective on recent developments in the Infusion market. 
Our results in Q3 were in line with how we expected the year would trend, but our normal seasonal decline in Q3 revenue was more pronounced primarily due to an installation reschedule in our Dispensing business from the back half of FY '10 to the front half of FY '11, and to a lesser extent and earlier into the flu season. This lower top line, of course, had an impact on our bottom line. Looking ahead to Q4, I expect to see a strong sequential improvement from this quarter, and I remain confident in our full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.40 to $1.45. We remain on track to achieve this.
Let's start with the top line. For our capital equipment businesses, Q2 and Q4 tend to be our strongest revenue quarters because they coincide with hospital yearends and our own. That makes Q1 and Q3 our historically weaker quarters. However, this Q1, as you know, was strong due to the bolus of Infusion sales we had following the release of our ship hold in July. Even with a solid revenue increase of 13% from last year's Q3, we indeed followed the historic trend with revenue that was sequentially down from Q2. Therefore, while Q3 was somewhat weaker than we had originally expected, it was in line with how our business normally trends and how we guided for the full year. The shift in revenue from this fiscal year to next fiscal year will put us slightly below the low end of FY '10 revenue range previously provided. Even though our customers are making some near-term decisions in prioritizing capital spending, the fundamentals of our business remain strong. We remain confident in our ability to achieve mid-single digit long-term revenue growth. We continue to see a gradual falling in the hospital capital spending environment during Q3. I'd like to give you more color on this and how it's affecting our business.
There are clear differences emerging in how hospitals are allocating their limited capital resources. IT projects are moving to the top of hospitals' priority lists to take advantage of funds that are available through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act.  We also believe that critical care devices, such as our Infusion pumps, are among the higher priorities. We continue to track orders that are on hold and estimate another 10% of the $250 million in capital equipment projects I referenced last quarter were converted to orders in Q3.
Looking at segment performance in Q3, our Infusion and Respiratory businesses within Critical Care Technologies had another strong quarter as did the Interventional Specialties, Infection Prevention and International Surgical Products businesses within Medical Technologies and Services. Highlights from Q3 include excellent progress in our Dispensing business. Data from HIMSS Analytics confirms we have gained market share throughout the year, something our win-loss analysis has indicated for some time. For six quarters we've also ranked number one in customer satisfaction according to MD Buyline. In Q3, our success continued with Dispensing contracts at Ascension Health, one of the largest care providers in the U.S. with locations in 19 states, and Banner and Sutter Health, which combined represent about 50 major hospitals in the Western United States. Within the Infusion business, we again won more than 90% of the new contracts where we competed and we increased our win rate in competitive situations.
Though the flu season began and ended earlier than in prior years, which put some pressure on Respiratory Disposable sales, our total Respiratory business continued to perform well. Outside the U.S., Respiratory revenue grew 50% from the prior year. And in our Medical Technologies and Services segment, we saw an increase in sales of our ChloraPrep product with March being our best month ever in ChloraPrep. In addition to the New England Journal of Medicine study from January, the May issue of the American Journal of Infection Control published a study showing an 84% reduction in post-cesarean section surgical infections when a protocol is followed that includes ChloraPrep.
I spoke last quarter about the investments we plan to make in Q3 and Q4 that would somewhat govern our earnings growth in FY '10. We're on track with those investments. We increased our R&D expenditures, expanded our coverage to drive ChloraPrep sales and completed our hiring of sales reps for expansion into the kyphoplasty segment of spinal surgery. 
In March, we launched our AVAmax veterbral balloon product for kyphoplasty procedures and are now in limited release. The product is performing very well in the field and feedback has been very positive. Last month, we introduced our new EnView camera controller. This device allows a surgeon to easily manipulate the endoscope, or camera, with greater control and stability during minimally invasive surgeries. There are 3 million of these procedures performed annually in the United States, and in early use of our device, we are seeing very good results. We are looking forward to a full-market release in Q1.
In addition, we made strategic progress in optimizing our business portfolio, most notably with our plans to acquire Medegen, a proven innovator in needleless valves and IV disposable products. Medegen's products have helped hospitals demonstrate substantial declines in catheter-related bloodstream infections, which are a significant problem for hospitals worldwide. These infections have been shown to increase a patient's hospital stay by 10 to 24 days with approximately 25% of the 250,000 annual incidents resulting in death. We are working through all of the customary closing conditions now, and subject to clearance from the FTC expect to finalize the acquisition before the end of our fiscal year.
Finally, we completed and announced an important strategic agreement last week with Cerner. Neal Patterson, the CEO of Cerner, and I personally endorse this first-of-its-kind agreement in our industry. We believe that we'll create a unified solution for closed-loop management of medications and medical supplies within a hospital. As medical devices and information technology continue to converge in healthcare, we expect that this agreement will help our joint hospital customers further improve patient safety, regulatory compliance and financial performance. 
In addition, Cerner will become a value-added reseller for Pyxis products in Cerner's core electronic health record accounts. This is exciting for us because Cerner is the healthcare IT supplier of choice in hundreds of U.S. hospitals giving us additional reach and presence for one of our core offerings. We expect this to be a very successful agreement for both companies and to expand it in the future with other CareFusion products. Each of these developments reinforces my view that strategically and competitively, we remain in an enviable position. 
Now before I turn it over to Ed to discuss our financial results in more detail, I'd like to address recent developments in the infusion market that will have some effect on our business in FY '11 and over the longer term.
On April 23, the FDA issued a draft guidance document for the pre-market clearance of infusion pumps. We have reviewed the guidance and we both understand and fully support their intent to protect patients from harm. The guidance is thorough and rigorous and therefore, will add time and additional complexity to our development and product introduction cycles. We take our responsibility very seriously, and since 2007 we have invested more than $125 million in our quality systems and product improvements. We will work closely with the FDA as we implement processes and procedures aligned with this new guidance. 
Earlier this week, Baxter and the FDA announced plans to remove Baxter's installed base of Colleague pumps from U.S. hospitals. While it would be premature to forecast the impact of this decision on our Infusion business, we have reviewed our manufacturing and customer support capacity and we are prepared to meet any increase in demand. As you know, we demonstrated our ability to meet high levels of customer demand following the release of our own ship hold in July of last year, shipping as many as 5,000 units per day. The Alaris System is a highly differentiated product with safety features and a scalable platform that has proven effective in hospitals of all sizes. We will include our view of the impact when we provide our fiscal 2011 guidance.
I want to close by thanking our employees from around the world for their hard work and commitment particularly with all that was going on in this last quarter. Eight months into our spin up and stand up as CareFusion, we're making excellent progress. I remain very optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. 
We raised our guidance in November and again raised and narrowed it in February. We have good visibility through the fourth quarter of this fiscal year and we're confident of our long-term growth prospects. As a new company, we are well positioned with our vision to improve the cost and safety of healthcare for generations to come, and our mission to deliver clinically proven products and services to improve care. This focus continues to resonate with our customers, and we're backing it up with investments in our future pipeline. 
Now let me turn it over to Ed."
49276069,104538359,60318,"CareFusion Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, May 06, 2010",2010-05-06,"Earnings Calls","CareFusion Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. Before I take you through our results for the third quarter and guidance for the year, I would like to reiterate that while our third quarter was weaker than we origi",1426,"Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. Before I take you through our results for the third quarter and guidance for the year, I would like to reiterate that while our third quarter was weaker than we originally expected, principally due to the shift in revenue in dispensing, a shorter flu season for Respiratory and a higher tax rate, it was in line with how our business normally trends and how we guided for the full year.
Starting with the top line, total revenue increased 13% to $952 million compared to the prior-year period or 10% on a constant currency basis. For the first nine months, we recorded total revenues of $2.9 billion. We expect fourth quarter revenues to be up sequentially driven by trends we see in our capital equipment businesses. This increase is occurring notwithstanding the Dispensing revenue shift to the first half of fiscal 2011. As a result of these trends, we now expect fiscal 2010 revenues to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion. 
Moving to our segments, I would like to remind you that our fiscal 2010 results include higher SG&A expense related to standing up as a public company compared to our historical results. In our Critical Care Technologies segment, which includes our Dispensing, Infusion and Respiratory business lines, revenues were $629 million and adjusted segment profit was $90 million, a 16% increase and a 30% increase respectively from the prior-year period. The growth in our third quarter top line was driven by the significant increase in sales in our Respiratory business where we saw increased demand in ventilators for flu and emergency preparedness related to H1N1.
In addition, we recorded increased sales in our Infusion business as we continue to gain momentum and increase our competitive wins. For the full fiscal year, we expect our Critical Care Technologies segment top line growth in high single digits and for product mix in the fourth quarter to shift, as Infusion and Dispensing sales grow sequentially and Respiratory sales remain at third quarter levels. 
In our Medical Technologies and Services segment, which includes our Infection Prevention and Medical Specialties businesses, revenues were $323 million, a 7% increase over the prior-year period. Results were driven primarily by increased sales from our International Surgical Products business, our ChloraPrep skin antiseptic product and our Interventional Specialties business. 
Adjusted segment profit was $22 million, a decrease of $26 million year-over-year, primarily driven by higher cost for standing up as a public company. On a sequential basis, adjusted segment profit decreased $1 million from the second quarter related to increased sales resources to support our ChloraPrep and kyphoplasty products. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect double-digit top line growth driven by sales from our International Surgical Products business and our ChloraPrep product.
Gross margins for the third quarter were 47% compared to 50% in the prior year due to product mix, which included higher Respiratory and lower Dispensing sales during the current year quarter. The current product mix puts pressure on gross margins as our Respiratory gross margins are lower than those in our other capital equipment businesses and our Dispensing gross margins are generally higher than the corporate average. Positively offsetting this impact was our continued efforts in cost management and ongoing manufacturing efficiencies realized during the current year quarter. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect our gross margins to be approximately 48%. 
Adjusted operating expenses including SG&A and R&D, totaled $340 million or 36% of total revenue, in line with our expectations. Adjusted SG&A expense of $298 million increased 14% over the prior-year period as the incremental operating costs related to standing up as a public company impacted our spend. This spend was positively offset by benefits from the March 2009 restructuring.
R&D for the quarter totaled $42 million, up 8% from the prior year as we increased our investment in R&D. For the full year, we expect our adjusted operating expenses to be approximately 34% of total revenues driven by R&D spend, commercial investments and stand-up costs. We have taken certain actions to control spending in the fourth quarter which will carry into fiscal 2011. We continue to evaluate our overall operations and cost of doing business as we close out our fiscal 2010. Operationally, we believe that with our continued focus on cost and our ability to execute, we can over the near and long term improve our margins by driving efficiencies to improve our costs of goods and decrease our SG&A spend.
Interest expense and other totaled $29 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, primarily driven by interest on our $1.4 billion of debt, which carries a yield to maturity interest rate of 5.8%, as well as foreign currency and miscellaneous expenses related to non-operating items that flow through this line item. We do not anticipate that these miscellaneous items will continue in the fourth quarter, and as a result, we are forecasting approximately $25 million for this item.
Last quarter we indicated that currency would provide about a penny per quarter compared to last year's results. Even with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we do not see a material change in that guidance and expect that currency will benefit the bottom line by approximately $0.05 for the full year. 
As disclosed in today's press release, we undertook an extensive review of our existing tax reserves, and based on this review determined to increase our tax reserves by $58 million. Given the size of our business and our global structure, we made what we believe are the appropriate adjustments and do not expect to make additional related reserves in future periods.
Based on current revenue projections, we expect that our adjusted tax rate, excluding the $58 million charge, will remain at approximately 28% for the year. During the fiscal 2011, our preliminary expectations based upon revenue mix indicate that our adjusted tax rate will be approximately 30%. We continue to believe we have opportunities to decrease our tax rate over the longer term. As a result of the increase in our tax reserves, our GAAP tax rate for the current quarter increased significantly to 114%. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of the tax reserve change, our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 30%. 
Moving to operating cash flow for the nine months ended March 31, 2010, our operating cash flow from continuing operations was approximately $536 million. Capital spending totaled $96 million and depreciation and amortization was $129 million. At March 31, we had $1.1 billion in cash. As we announced on April 5, we intend to use to $225 million of that cash to acquire Medegen.
For the full year, we expect our capital spending to be approximately $140 million to $150 million, down from the $160 million to $170 million we had previously guided to driven primarily by the timing of projects. We expect that depreciation and amortization will be approximately $170 million for the year. Our operating cash flow for the full year is expected to be approximately $550 million reflecting disbursements of taxes and payables due in the fourth quarter. 
Our adjusted net income for the quarter was $57 million compared to $78 million a year ago.  Our fully diluted adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.26 compared to $0.35 a year ago, driven by a higher tax rate, operating expenses and interest expense and other in the current quarter. Excluding from adjusted earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 are $19 million in one-time expenditures and the $58 million increase in tax reserves or $0.30 per fully diluted share.  
Based on our results for the first nine months of fiscal 2010, and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are reaffirming our full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.40 to $1.45.
Before we move into the Q&A, I would like to provide a couple of updates. First, as we have stated previously, we intend to evaluate acquisitions that can help drive our growth and expansion goals as we did with Medegen, but also consider opportunities to rationalize our portfolio and divest in non-core businesses. Following the close of the quarter, we signed a definitive agreement to divest our Research Services business to eResearch Technology. Second, our fourth quarter and full year results will be announced in August and at that time we will provide financial guidance for fiscal 2011. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Carol for questions."

Neal Patterson and I met personally and sort of consummated the arrangement between the two companies and we both are of a similar mind that different pieces of equipment in the hospital need to be able to show the clinicians the same information that they can get from a terminal. And we decided to start with our Dispensing equipment. And there are actually a number of benefits for the hospital customers because ultimately we will integrate the information contained in the Cerner EMR currently available elsewhere to the customer into the Dispensing equipment, and we will feed back into the Cerner EMR information that comes out of the Dispensing equipment. This really simplifies the workflow for the customer greatly. And in fact, within 48 hours of that announcement going out, we had already heard from customers that had actually decided to buy someone else's Dispensing equipment, that they were putting their decision on hold and we're going to evaluate what the benefits would be  for them to go to Pyxis. I think there's financially, and from a business standpoint for the Pyxis business, there is a number of customers in the hundreds that we already have Dispensing equipment with. And I think that the retention rate is going to go up dramatically for that group of customers. There are a number of others that are not currently Pyxis customers that really provide opportunity to convert. And we actually expect to see revenues starting to show up in the first quarter of this new fiscal year. And this has already been rolled out to the Cerner salespeople, and frankly their reaction was extremely positive. And this is really the first step in a long-term plan.  We'll really have the first relationship where ultimately all of our medical devices and capital equipment will connect to talk with feed the Cerner system.

I think it will be measured in many, many months in the best case simply because the requirements are so comprehensive and there's a significant amount of testing that is required before you can even submit for a 510(k) approval. So my take is everyone in the market will see their pipeline of new product slow down significantly, and so we're going to all be equally affected. And I guess the good news with that is it keeps the playing field level. But for all of us, it does increase our cost of doing business.  Now to your question on H1N1 for the quarter, my recollection is that that is about $20 million to $25 million -- or about $16 million in the third quarter."

And what I said in my prepared remarks, Erik, were that we actually increased our competitive win rate in Q3. Now I don't have an up-to-date independent third-party assessment of our share, but what I'm being told is that it's 40%-ish and growing. And the way that that works is that you only increase share is if you win a competitive account. If you re-up an existing customer, that's not a share increase, although it is a business benefit. And so it's really important from a share perspective to make sure that your competitive wins are actually greater than your share in the market. And so we're running twice our share in the market right now, so that says to me we're clearly taking share. It's probably worth mentioning that share in the Infusion market changes slowly. I remember I think in 2000 or so that Alaris had then about a 28% share and that has grown now to about 40%. That's been a 10-year period. And the reason for that is only 20% of the market shows up for renewal or less. Sometimes it's as small as 14% of the market shows up for renewal on an annualized basis. And so that's sort of what you have to work with and governs your ability to take share. Now I will tell you if the useful life on this pumps were shorter, we'd take share a lot faster. But also keep in mind that customers buy house-wide and it's probably -- Infusion pumps are the most ubiquitous medical device in healthcare facilities and they average one per bed. And so it's not something the customer can really afford to re-outfit on a frequent basis. Now I think the Baxter withdrawal from the market is sort of going to accelerate that 20% per year, if what I've read that they have about 200,000 units in the market. The average number of units placed in the United States in total is about 120,000 a year. So that's about two-and-three-quarter years worth of Infusion pumps that will be showing up sort of unexpectedly, or one-and-three-quarter years.  I did my math wrong.  I'm sorry."

Our press release was issued today at 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time or 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, posted on our website at CareFusion.com and filed on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also filed and posted several slides to accompany today's webcast, which may be found on the Investor Relations homepage of CareFusion with our other earnings materials. While we will not review each slide on today's call, these slides should be used as a reference guide by investors. These slides include comparisons of the results for the three and 12 months ended June 30, 2010 to both of the prior year periods, as well as a financial outlook for full year fiscal 2011 and definitions of our non-GAAP items and reconciliations to GAAP.
Joining me on today's call are Dave Schlotterbeck, our CEO; Ed Borkowski, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dwight Winstead, our Chief Operating Officer. Before I turn the call over, I'd like to make a few remarks.
In today's call, we will be presenting our results on a GAAP and an adjusted basis. Our adjusted results exclude restructuring and acquisition integration charges, nonrecurring spin-off related costs, nonrecurring gain on sale of assets, nonrecurring tax items and discontinued operations. We believe that adjusted financial measures can facilitate a more complete analysis and greater transparency to CareFusion's ongoing results of operations, particularly in comparing underlying results from period to period. 
Our management team utilizes adjusted financial measures internally in financial planning to monitor business unit performance and in evaluating management performance. We've included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with today's release.
I would like to remind investors that during today's call, we will be making statements that are forward-looking and consequently are subject to risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include statements regarding our fiscal '11 guidance; our expectations related to our restructuring program, including anticipated timing, costs and expected savings; our expectations regarding hospital capital spending; expectations regarding acquisitions and divestitures; and statements regarding business and revenue growth and anticipated foreign currency fluctuations as well as other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.
You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. Such factors include risk factors set forth in this afternoon's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors, and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Dave."

Overall, we had a solid first year, with results that reflect the strength of our products and our team.

Overall, we had a solid first year, with results that reflect the strength of our products and our team. 
Our adjusted EPS from continuing operations came in at $1.42 against the narrowed $1.40 to $1.45 range we provided following the second quarter. There were many accomplishments during the year delivered by the hard work of our employees. Their work during the year was outstanding, to not only execute the spin-off, but to grow our business. And I would like to thank our employees for their effort.
Now moving on to earnings and FY '11. Today, we announced a restructuring of our company, which essentially flattens the organization and reduces our infrastructure. We had previously indicated we would need to address our operating margins to compare with our peers, and we're now taking steps to do so. These actions will provide a solid base and allow us to gain efficiencies as we grow our business.
At the same time, we're investing $17 million to increase our gross R&D spend and complete the build-out of our strategic selling organization. Outside the U.S., we continue to analyze the specific impact of this restructuring on our international operations, and we will closely adhere to local regulations as we make necessary changes. 
Beyond the reductions, we'll continue to analyze our portfolio of businesses and expect to make decisions during the year to divest certain operations that do not strategically fit or are dilutive to our operating margins. While it would be premature to identify specific businesses, we see clear opportunities to redeploy capital toward higher value and more synergistic investments on a global scale. We also want to remain fiscally prudent in the current economic environment and maintain adequate financial resources for growth.
Now I'll turn to the performance of our businesses as we exited Q4. Within the Critical Care Technologies segment, Q4 was another exceptional quarter for our Infusion business. Our win rate remained above 90% in the fourth quarter and for the full year, with our rate of competitive displacements moving above 70% for the year, making it one of our highest volume years ever in the Infusion business. While it's still early to determine precisely how much additional share we will gain as a result of Baxter's mandated recall, it is clear that our Alaris System is extremely competitive in the market. 
We expect to earn an even greater share of new customer business in FY '11, and this will be weighted towards Q3 and Q4. We have an aggressive program in place to target customers using Baxter pumps, and we know this scenario will be competitive. And it will put some pressure on our Infusion margins in the short term. However, by converting share now, we will benefit for an extended period into the future through our Disposables business. As I said last quarter, we've reviewed our manufacturing and customer support capacity and we are prepared to meet any increase in demand.
We reached another positive milestone under our amended consent decree by receiving FDA approval to move into the audit or the monitoring stage. This means that our quality system has met FDA inspection guidelines. And while I'm proud of the work that we've done to reach this stage, we are in no way easing up on our investments or our focus on the continuous improvements of our quality systems and products. We've made a long-term commitment to make the safety, quality and integrity of our products the foundation of CareFusion.
Also in the Critical Care segment, our Dispensing business had a very strong Q4 to close out a year where we tripled our rate of competitive displacements from the prior year. Our ratio of new business wins to competitive losses was more than 3:1 on a revenue basis for all of FY '10. This's a very positive turnaround for this business, and it's a clear sign that we are once again growing market share.
We're also seeing positive uptake from the new Pyxis products launched in 2010, like Pyxis Advisor. This product proactively monitors lab, pharmacy and patient data across the hospital and can help anticipate medication errors before they occur. It's a great example of how we are leveraging software capabilities to enhance the value of our Capital Equipment businesses and drive incremental revenue. 
Overall, we're pleased with the improvements in the Pyxis business. It is the healthiest it's been in the past several years, and we expect to see bookings in this business grow nicely in FY '11.
Likewise, our Respiratory business finished its strongest year ever, driven largely by emergency flu preparedness programs by hospitals and governments worldwide. While this business tends to have somewhat lower margins than our other Capital Equipment businesses, its strong, double-digit revenue growth this year was complemented by disciplined expense management to deliver excellent growth in its contribution to our consolidated earnings. We continue to see opportunities to accelerate long-term earnings contributions from our Respiratory business.
The Medical Technologies and Services segment continued to see strong growth in Infection Prevention, with our clinically proven ChloraPrep product, and in Interventional Specialties. ChloraPrep revenue ramped steadily throughout the year and is benefiting from sales resources we added last quarter following the New England Journal of Medicine study in January. In Interventional Specialties, we plan full commercial launch of our AVAmax Vertebral Balloon product for kyphoplasty procedures this quarter.
Now Ed will provide our complete guidance for fiscal '11 but let me share a couple thoughts. First, we intend to grow FY '11 revenue in the mid-single digits, in line with the long-term guidance range we had previously provided. We expect a combination of this revenue growth and the measures we have taken to reduce costs to provide leverage to the bottom line, creating earnings per share growth of 11% to 18%. Let me point out that the top end of this range is higher than our previously provided long-term goal.
As you consider our top line guidance for fiscal '11, recall that we overachieved in fiscal '10 as a result of several nonrecurring items, including Infusion sales in Q1, when the Alaris System came off ship hold, and Respiratory sales related to flu preparedness. Our FY '11 growth projections include overcoming these Infusion and Respiratory benefits, as well as the impact of the change in currency from FY '10 to FY '11. 
Taking into account all of these items, which represent approximately $210 million in revenue, our growth target for FY '11 reflects an underlying core growth of our businesses of 10% to 12%. I only share that because I think it highlights the health of our business and the excellent position we are in to continue growing over the long term.  
We will also continue to connect our assets across CareFusion, leveraging data generated by our products to help hospitals and clinicians deliver better care. We'll continue to invest in our innovation pipeline for the future and in further establishing our business in growth markets outside the U.S..
As I look ahead to fiscal '11 and beyond, I remain extremely optimistic about the opportunities we have to grow. 11 months after our spin-off from Cardinal Health, we exit our first fiscal year well positioned with our vision to improve the cost and safety of healthcare for generations to come, and our mission to deliver clinically proven products and services to improve care. 
Our products are performing well in the market, and our portfolio of businesses provides us with a good balance of capital equipment essential for hospitals to deliver patient care, in addition to higher margin and higher growth procedure-based products.
Now let me turn this over to Ed."

And again, thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will be reviewing our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year, reviewing the benefits and costs of our company-wide restructuring, and providing our full year fiscal 2011 guidance. 
The results we are presenting today for the quarter and full year ended June 30, 2010 reflect strong sales and solid operational performances across our business segments, as well as investment in our commercial efforts and product pipeline. Our top and bottom line results reflect a stronger year than we had originally forecasted at the time of our spin-off from Cardinal Health. It is important to note that several of the items that positively impacted our fiscal 2010 results are not expected to reoccur in fiscal 2011. I will go over the contributions of those items in more detail a little later.
Now let me review the financial results. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.38 in the quarter and $1.42 for the full year. We had guided to a range of $1.40 to $1.45 for the year. However, our tax rate was higher as we finished the year and negatively impacted our results by approximately $0.03.
Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $1.035 billion, an increase of 19% on both a reported and constant currency basis compared to the prior year period.  For the fiscal year, revenue totaled $3.93 billion, an increase of 9% on both a reported and constant currency basis, and in the midpoint of the range we provided at the end of the third quarter.
Moving on to our segments. In our Critical Care Technologies segment, which includes our Dispensing, Infusion and Respiratory business lines, revenue for the fourth quarter was $716 million, a 21% increase from the prior year period, driven by increased sales across all of our CCT businesses. For the full year, revenue was $2.6 billion, a 9% increase over the prior year period, and was consistent with our estimated growth rate of high single digits. 
Revenues for the year were driven by sales of our Infusion products, due to the resumption of installations of our Alaris System in July 2009 following the release of the ship hold, and continued momentum through the year as we achieved a significant amount of competitive wins. We also saw increased sales in our Respiratory business, resulting from increased demand in ventilators for flu and emergency preparedness related to H1N1. In Dispensing, we finished the year strong and continued to add new business, including competitive wins.
In our Medical Technologies and Services segment, which includes our Infection Prevention and Medical Specialties businesses, fourth quarter revenues were $319 million, a 16% from the increase from the prior year period, driven by our core ChloraPrep skin antiseptic product and Interventional Specialties business. 
For the full year, revenue increased 10% to $1.3 billion and was consistent with our estimated double-digit growth rate. Revenues for the year were driven primarily by increased sales from our International Surgical Products, ChloraPrep and Interventional Specialties businesses.
Gross margins for the fourth quarter were 47% compared to 46% in the prior year period. For the year, gross margins were 48%. Year-over-year, we saw increased margins related to the ongoing cost management efforts and manufacturing efficiencies. And for the year, this benefit was offset by a product mix that included a higher proportion of Respiratory sales, which have somewhat lower margins than our other Capital Equipment businesses. 
For the fourth quarter, adjusted operating expenses including SG&A and R&D totaled $338 million or 33% of total revenue. Adjusted SG&A expense of $294 million increased 14% over the prior year period. R&D for the quarter totaled $44 million, up 1% from the prior year. 
For the full year, adjusted operating expenses totaled $1.3 billion or 34% of total revenue. Adjusted SG&A expense of $1.2 billion increased 10% over the prior year period. R&D totaled $159 million, down slightly from the prior year. Our adjusted operating expenses for the year were driven by standup costs and commercial investments to support future growth, which was positively offset by benefits from the March 2009 restructuring.
Interest expense and other totaled $20 million for the fourth quarter. For the full year, interest expense and other totaled $115 million, primarily driven by interest on our $1.4 billion of debt, which carries a yield to maturity interest rate of 5.8%; the impact of $22 million in debt fees associated with our bridge loan facility, arranged to facilitate the separation from Cardinal Health; as well as miscellaneous expenses related to non-operating items that flowed through this line item.
During our fourth quarter, as the U.S. dollar strengthened and several European currencies weakened, our results were negatively impacted by approximately $0.01 per share. For the full year, currency was a benefit to the bottom line by approximately $0.05 per share.
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 33.2%. For the full year, it was 29.5%, which was higher than the 28% we had estimated. As you know, subsequent to our spin-off from Cardinal Health, we made revisions to our estimated adjusted tax rate in the third quarter. Our higher tax rate for the quarter and the year was impacted by those revisions as well as changes in the income mix between our U.S. and international operations.
Turning to operating cash flow. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2010, our operating cash flow from continuing operations was significantly stronger than we had expected and came in at $706 million. Our over-performance was driven by improvements in working capital, including accounts receivable and inventories due to our strong fourth quarter. 
Capital spending totaled $141 million, which was less than we forecasted at the beginning of the year as a result of the timing of projects and payments. Depreciation and amortization was $173 million. At June 30, we had $1 billion in cash, which includes the impact of the $224 million we spent to acquire Medegen in May and $81 million in proceeds from the sale of our Research Services businesses in June.
Before I turn to our guidance for fiscal '11, I would like to review the expected benefits and costs of the company-wide restructuring we announced today. As part of this restructuring, we will reduce our global workforce by approximately 700 positions in fiscal 2011. We'll accomplish this primarily through a reduction in number of management layers and our support infrastructure.
We expect our global restructuring to deliver $85 million to $95 million in savings in fiscal 2011, and for that to grow by $25 million to $110 million to $120 million in fiscal '12. We expect that these savings, along with other cost management initiatives we have implemented during the year, will help to reduce our costs and accelerate our margin expansion. In addition, we estimate incurring total pretax nonrecurring expenses of approximately $40 million to $50 million in fiscal '11 related to this restructuring, which includes employee-related separation costs.
I would now like to now turn to our financial outlook for fiscal 2011. We are expecting top and bottom line growth consistent with our long-term goals of mid-single digit revenue growth and 11% to 15% growth in adjusted operating earnings. Compared to our fiscal 2010 results, revenue is expected to grow mid-single digits on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, our revenue is expected to grow mid- to high-single digits, which is actually higher than our long-term guidance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to increase 11% to 18%, to a range of $1.58 to $1.68 per share.
In arriving at these estimates, we made several assumptions I would like to share with you. Hospital capital spending will grow in the low- to mid- single digit range, and our customers will continue to prioritize their spending. We will achieve $85 million to $95 million of pretax cost savings from the restructuring we announced today, and will incur pretax one-time expenditures of approximately $40 million to $50 million.
We expect that our Infusion business segment revenue will grow double digits to the high teens, driven by a couple of items. One, our acquisition of Medegen in May 2010 will benefit our top line and will be essentially break-even to the bottom line. Two, Baxter's removal of its Colleague pump installed base, as required by the FDA, will provide us an opportunity to gain further market share. At this time, we are assuming there will be an incremental contribution from this opportunity, and that it will begin impacting us in the second half of fiscal '11 and will increase as we move into fiscal '12.
We are expecting gross margins of approximately 48%, driven by the positive benefits of higher year-over-year margins in our MTS business and by manufacturing efficiencies throughout the organization. Primarily offsetting these benefits are expected lower gross margins in our Infusion business, where more aggressive pricing may be required to win market share related to the Baxter recall opportunity. As Dave mentioned, over the next several years, we expect margins to improve significantly as we supply the related disposables.
We are assuming that foreign exchange rates will remain at current levels and will negatively affect adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.08. Our adjusted tax rate will be approximately 30% to 32%, which is higher than the 30% rate we had indicated in May, driven by higher-than-expected income mix in the U.S., primarily from the projected increase in U.S. Infusion sales in fiscal '11. 
And lastly, we expect to exclude $100 million to $110 million in one-time items related to our company-wide restructuring, spin-off costs from Cardinal Health, as well as merger and integration costs related to Medegen. 
At the time we spun off from Cardinal Health, we said fiscal 2010 would be our base year from which our growth should be evaluated. In fact, we overachieved against our original fiscal 2010 expectations, driven by incremental positive contributions from both our Infusion and Respiratory businesses, as well as a slower ramp up in expenses in the first two quarters after the spin-off.
Several of the items that positively impacted our fiscal 2010 results are not expected to reoccur in fiscal '11. Let me break these items down. You can follow along on Slide 10 of the investor deck that is included in our webcast materials.
First, the revenue from the release of the Alaris ship hold impacted our first and second quarters by approximately $60 million, the majority of which was recorded in Q1. Second, the increased demand for ventilators related to H1N1 contributed $60 million to $65 million in revenues through fiscal 2010. Third, while foreign currency benefited our top line in 2010, changes in foreign currency are expected to result in a negative $85 million to $90 million revenue impact, based on fiscal 2010 actual results and projected fiscal 2011 budgets. 
Also recall that we divested our Research Services business in May 2010. This business contributed revenues of approximately $59 million in fiscal 2010 and is not included in discontinued operations. Revenue from our Medegen acquisition will impact our fiscal 2011, and we expect these two items will essentially offset each other.
Heading into 2011. Our plan overcomes the revenue benefits we had in fiscal 2010 as well as the impact of foreign currency. Together, these items represent approximately $210 million in revenue and an impact to the bottom line of $0.25 to $0.30.
While we do not guide on a quarterly basis, a couple of comments on the trends we see impacting the timing of results in fiscal 2011 will be useful as you build your financial models. We expect earnings to be weighted to the second half of the year, with nearly 60% of earnings coming in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal '11.
We expect our first quarter of fiscal 2011 to be down year-over-year. We had a strong first quarter in fiscal 2010, which benefited from the majority of approximately $60 million of Infusion revenues following the ship hold and increased demand for ventilators related to H1N1. Together with our slower ramp up in spending, these items, which are not predicted to occur again in the first quarter of fiscal '11, contributed approximately $0.12 to the $0.39 adjusted earnings per share we reported in our first quarter of fiscal 2010.
For the year, adjusted operating expenses are respected to total 33% of total revenue, down from 34% of total revenue in fiscal '10, due to the restructuring and our efforts in our cost management.
Our adjusted operating margins were 14% as we exited fiscal 2010. As a result of increased sales and the cost savings from the restructuring, we expect our adjusted operating margins to increase to approximately 15% of revenue or 16% on a constant-currency basis by the end of fiscal 2011.
We remain committed to achieving operating margins consistent with our peers. And because we have accelerated our efforts to improve our margins, we anticipate getting there ahead of our original expectation of three to five years post-spin. We expect to further increase our operating margins in the future through the combination of an additional $25 million in annualized cost savings from the restructuring, continued improvement in our cost of goods, exiting the transition service agreements with Cardinal Health and potentially divesting lower margin businesses. 
Interest expense and other is expected to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million for fiscal 2011.
And turning to cash flow. In fiscal 2011, we are expecting operating cash flow to be in the range of $425 million to $475 million, down from fiscal 2010 because of several one-time cash expenditures we are expecting in fiscal '11 that did not occur last year. These expenditures total approximately $200 million, and they are: two interest payments on our debt in fiscal 2011, whereas we had only one payment in '10; higher cash tax payments in fiscal '11, reflecting spin-related tax costs we had previously agreed to share with Cardinal and incremental taxes paid by Cardinal Health for July and August of 2009, prior to our spin off; and management and employee incentive plan payments, compared to no payments in fiscal '10. Our cash flow assumptions for fiscal '11 do not include the potential costs or benefits of any divestitures that we may undertake during the year.
In summary, we exited fiscal 2010 with strong results and in solid competitive positions across our businesses. We took necessary steps to lower our costs as we head into fiscal 2011, which we believe places us in an even better position for the longer term.
I'll turn the call back over to Carol."

The $85 million to $95 million is for this year, related to the restructuring we're just announcing now, with an incremental $25 million coming in '12, just due to timing of certain activities that are going on within the company.

The benefit that I see is that this is -- this time period is well defined, it is an isolated event, I think probably every hospital in the country is aware of it, and we've been very public about the fact that we intend to be aggressive on our pricing across the board only during that time period. And so our intention, and I believe it will not happen that customers will acclimate themselves to a whole new pricing level. I just don't believe that, that's going to happen. And if they want to benefit from more aggressive pricing, then they're going to have to buy during that two-year time period. It's pretty much that simple."

And I think as we get into the next few months and customers sort out the demand aspect of when they will be converting, some of what we're also dealing with in the marketplace is the ability to manufacture from a capacity standpoint. And I think there's been a lot of discussion in the industry about capacity. I think as we talked about on our last call, we have the ability to double capacity by the November timeframe. And therefore balancing the customer's need to convert as well as who can provide the capacity gives us two pretty good feels of how the marketplace will play out. But I think the other piece you have to go back to is to the previous comments, and that is we've been competing in the marketplace very effectively as based on our win rates, even before this conversion started.

Our press release was issued today at 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time or 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, posted on our website at carefusion.com and filed on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also filed and posted several slides to accompany today's webcast, which may be found on the Investor Relations homepage of CareFusion with our other earnings materials. While we will not review each slide on today's call, these slides should be used as a reference guide by investors. These slides include comparisons of the results for the three and 12 months ended June 30, 2010 to both of the prior year periods, as well as a financial outlook for full year fiscal 2011 and definitions of our non-GAAP items and reconciliations to GAAP.
Joining me on today's call are Dave Schlotterbeck, our CEO; Ed Borkowski, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dwight Winstead, our Chief Operating Officer. Before I turn the call over, I'd like to make a few remarks.
In today's call, we will be presenting our results on a GAAP and an adjusted basis. Our adjusted results exclude restructuring and acquisition integration charges, nonrecurring spin-off related costs, nonrecurring gain on sale of assets, nonrecurring tax items and discontinued operations. We believe that adjusted financial measures can facilitate a more complete analysis and greater transparency to CareFusion's ongoing results of operations, particularly in comparing underlying results from period to period. 
Our management team utilizes adjusted financial measures internally in financial planning to monitor business unit performance and in evaluating management performance. We've included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with today's release.
I would like to remind investors that during today's call, we will be making statements that are forward-looking and consequently are subject to risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include statements regarding our fiscal '11 guidance; our expectations related to our restructuring program, including anticipated timing, costs and expected savings; our expectations regarding hospital capital spending; expectations regarding acquisitions and divestitures; and statements regarding business and revenue growth and anticipated foreign currency fluctuations as well as other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.
You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. Such factors include risk factors set forth in this afternoon's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors, and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Dave."

Overall, we had a solid first year, with results that reflect the strength of our products and our team. 
Our adjusted EPS from continuing operations came in at $1.42 against the narrowed $1.40 to $1.45 range we provided following the second quarter. There were many accomplishments during the year delivered by the hard work of our employees. Their work during the year was outstanding, to not only execute the spin-off, but to grow our business. And I would like to thank our employees for their effort.
Now moving on to earnings and FY '11. Today, we announced a restructuring of our company, which essentially flattens the organization and reduces our infrastructure. We had previously indicated we would need to address our operating margins to compare with our peers, and we're now taking steps to do so. These actions will provide a solid base and allow us to gain efficiencies as we grow our business.
At the same time, we're investing $17 million to increase our gross R&D spend and complete the build-out of our strategic selling organization. Outside the U.S., we continue to analyze the specific impact of this restructuring on our international operations, and we will closely adhere to local regulations as we make necessary changes. 
Beyond the reductions, we'll continue to analyze our portfolio of businesses and expect to make decisions during the year to divest certain operations that do not strategically fit or are dilutive to our operating margins. While it would be premature to identify specific businesses, we see clear opportunities to redeploy capital toward higher value and more synergistic investments on a global scale. We also want to remain fiscally prudent in the current economic environment and maintain adequate financial resources for growth.
Now I'll turn to the performance of our businesses as we exited Q4. Within the Critical Care Technologies segment, Q4 was another exceptional quarter for our Infusion business. Our win rate remained above 90% in the fourth quarter and for the full year, with our rate of competitive displacements moving above 70% for the year, making it one of our highest volume years ever in the Infusion business. While it's still early to determine precisely how much additional share we will gain as a result of Baxter's mandated recall, it is clear that our Alaris System is extremely competitive in the market. 
We expect to earn an even greater share of new customer business in FY '11, and this will be weighted towards Q3 and Q4. We have an aggressive program in place to target customers using Baxter pumps, and we know this scenario will be competitive. And it will put some pressure on our Infusion margins in the short term. However, by converting share now, we will benefit for an extended period into the future through our Disposables business. As I said last quarter, we've reviewed our manufacturing and customer support capacity and we are prepared to meet any increase in demand.
We reached another positive milestone under our amended consent decree by receiving FDA approval to move into the audit or the monitoring stage. This means that our quality system has met FDA inspection guidelines. And while I'm proud of the work that we've done to reach this stage, we are in no way easing up on our investments or our focus on the continuous improvements of our quality systems and products. We've made a long-term commitment to make the safety, quality and integrity of our products the foundation of CareFusion.
Also in the Critical Care segment, our Dispensing business had a very strong Q4 to close out a year where we tripled our rate of competitive displacements from the prior year. Our ratio of new business wins to competitive losses was more than 3:1 on a revenue basis for all of FY '10. This's a very positive turnaround for this business, and it's a clear sign that we are once again growing market share.
We're also seeing positive uptake from the new Pyxis products launched in 2010, like Pyxis Advisor. This product proactively monitors lab, pharmacy and patient data across the hospital and can help anticipate medication errors before they occur. It's a great example of how we are leveraging software capabilities to enhance the value of our Capital Equipment businesses and drive incremental revenue. 
Overall, we're pleased with the improvements in the Pyxis business. It is the healthiest it's been in the past several years, and we expect to see bookings in this business grow nicely in FY '11.
Likewise, our Respiratory business finished its strongest year ever, driven largely by emergency flu preparedness programs by hospitals and governments worldwide. While this business tends to have somewhat lower margins than our other Capital Equipment businesses, its strong, double-digit revenue growth this year was complemented by disciplined expense management to deliver excellent growth in its contribution to our consolidated earnings. We continue to see opportunities to accelerate long-term earnings contributions from our Respiratory business.
The Medical Technologies and Services segment continued to see strong growth in Infection Prevention, with our clinically proven ChloraPrep product, and in Interventional Specialties. ChloraPrep revenue ramped steadily throughout the year and is benefiting from sales resources we added last quarter following the New England Journal of Medicine study in January. In Interventional Specialties, we plan full commercial launch of our AVAmax Vertebral Balloon product for kyphoplasty procedures this quarter.
Now Ed will provide our complete guidance for fiscal '11 but let me share a couple thoughts. First, we intend to grow FY '11 revenue in the mid-single digits, in line with the long-term guidance range we had previously provided. We expect a combination of this revenue growth and the measures we have taken to reduce costs to provide leverage to the bottom line, creating earnings per share growth of 11% to 18%. Let me point out that the top end of this range is higher than our previously provided long-term goal.
As you consider our top line guidance for fiscal '11, recall that we overachieved in fiscal '10 as a result of several nonrecurring items, including Infusion sales in Q1, when the Alaris System came off ship hold, and Respiratory sales related to flu preparedness. Our FY '11 growth projections include overcoming these Infusion and Respiratory benefits, as well as the impact of the change in currency from FY '10 to FY '11. 
Taking into account all of these items, which represent approximately $210 million in revenue, our growth target for FY '11 reflects an underlying core growth of our businesses of 10% to 12%. I only share that because I think it highlights the health of our business and the excellent position we are in to continue growing over the long term.  
We will also continue to connect our assets across CareFusion, leveraging data generated by our products to help hospitals and clinicians deliver better care. We'll continue to invest in our innovation pipeline for the future and in further establishing our business in growth markets outside the U.S.
As I look ahead to fiscal '11 and beyond, I remain extremely optimistic about the opportunities we have to grow. 11 months after our spin-off from Cardinal Health, we exit our first fiscal year well positioned with our vision to improve the cost and safety of healthcare for generations to come and our mission to deliver clinically proven products and services to improve care. 
Our products are performing well in the market, and our portfolio of businesses provides us with a good balance of capital equipment essential for hospitals to deliver patient care, in addition to higher margin and higher growth procedure-based products.
Now let me turn this over to Ed."

And again, thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will be reviewing our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year, reviewing the benefits and costs of our company-wide restructuring, and p",2443,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. And again, thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will be reviewing our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year, reviewing the benefits and costs of our company-wide restructuring, and providing our full year fiscal 2011 guidance. 
The results we are presenting today for the quarter and full year ended June 30, 2010, reflect strong sales and solid operational performances across our business segments, as well as investment in our commercial efforts and product pipeline. Our top and bottom line results reflect a stronger year than we had originally forecasted at the time of our spin-off from Cardinal Health. It is important to note that several of the items that positively impacted our fiscal 2010 results are not expected to reoccur in fiscal 2011. I will go over the contributions of those items in more detail a little later.
Now let me review the financial results. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.38 in the quarter and $1.42 for the full year. We had guided to a range of $1.40 to $1.45 for the year. However, our tax rate was higher as we finished the year and negatively impacted our results by approximately $0.03.
Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $1.035 billion, an increase of 19% on both a reported and constant currency basis compared to the prior year period.  For the fiscal year, revenue totaled $3.93 billion, an increase of 9% on both a reported and constant currency basis and in the midpoint of the range we provided at the end of the third quarter.
Moving on to our segments. In our Critical Care Technologies segment, which includes our Dispensing, Infusion and Respiratory business lines, revenue for the fourth quarter was $716 million, a 21% increase from the prior year period, driven by increased sales across all of our CCT businesses. For the full year, revenue was $2.6 billion, a 9% increase over the prior year period and was consistent with our estimated growth rate of high single digits. 
Revenues for the year were driven by sales of our Infusion products, due to the resumption of installations of our Alaris System in July 2009 following the release of the ship hold, and continued momentum through the year as we achieved a significant amount of competitive wins. We also saw increased sales in our Respiratory business, resulting from increased demand in ventilators for flu and emergency preparedness related to H1N1. In Dispensing, we finished the year strong and continued to add new business, including competitive wins.
In our Medical Technologies and Services segment, which includes our Infection Prevention and Medical Specialties businesses, fourth quarter revenues were $319 million, a 16% increase from the prior year period, driven by our ChloraPrep skin antiseptic product and Interventional Specialties business. 
For the full year, revenue increased 10% to $1.3 billion and was consistent with our estimated double-digit growth rate. Revenues for the year were driven primarily by increased sales from our International Surgical Products, ChloraPrep and Interventional Specialties businesses.
Gross margins for the fourth quarter were 47% compared to 46% in the prior year period. For the year, gross margins were 48%. Year-over-year, we saw increased margins related to the ongoing cost management efforts and manufacturing efficiencies. And for the year, this benefit was offset by a product mix that included a higher proportion of Respiratory sales, which have somewhat lower margins than our other Capital Equipment businesses. 
For the fourth quarter, adjusted operating expenses including SG&A and R&D totaled $338 million or 33% of total revenue. Adjusted SG&A expense of $294 million increased 14% over the prior year period. R&D for the quarter totaled $44 million, up 1% from the prior year. 
For the full year, adjusted operating expenses totaled $1.3 billion or 34% of total revenue. Adjusted SG&A expense of $1.2 billion increased 10% over the prior year period. R&D totaled $159 million, down slightly from the prior year. Our adjusted operating expenses for the year were driven by standup costs and commercial investments to support future growth, which was positively offset by benefits from the March 2009 restructuring.
Interest expense and other totaled $20 million for the fourth quarter. For the full year, interest expense and other totaled $115 million, primarily driven by interest on our $1.4 billion of debt, which carries a yield-to-maturity interest rate of 5.8%; the impact of $22 million in debt fees associated with our bridge loan facility, arranged to facilitate the separation from Cardinal Health; as well as miscellaneous expenses related to non-operating items that flowed through this line item.
During our fourth quarter, as the U.S. dollar strengthened and several European currencies weakened, our results were negatively impacted by approximately $0.01 per share. For the full year, currency was a benefit to the bottom line by approximately $0.05 per share.
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 33.2%. For the full year, it was 29.5%, which was higher than the 28% we had estimated. As you know, subsequent to our spin-off from Cardinal Health, we made revisions to our estimated adjusted tax rate in the third quarter. Our higher tax rate for the quarter and the year was impacted by those revisions as well as changes in the income mix between our U.S. and international operations.
Turning to operating cash flow. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2010, our operating cash flow from continuing operations was significantly stronger than we had expected and came in at $706 million. Our over-performance was driven by improvements in working capital, including accounts receivable and inventories due to our strong fourth quarter. 
Capital spending totaled $141 million, which was less than we forecasted at the beginning of the year as a result of the timing of projects and payments. Depreciation and amortization was $173 million. At June 30, we had $1 billion in cash, which includes the impact of the $224 million we spent to acquire Medegen in May and $81 million in proceeds from the sale of our Research Services businesses in June.
Before I turn to our guidance for fiscal '11, I would like to review the expected benefits and costs of the company-wide restructuring we announced today. As part of this restructuring, we will reduce our global workforce by approximately 700 positions in fiscal 2011. We'll accomplish this primarily through a reduction in number of management layers and our support infrastructure.
We expect our global restructuring to deliver $85 million to $95 million in savings in fiscal 2011, and for that to grow by $25 million to $110 million to $120 million in fiscal '12. We expect that these savings, along with other cost management initiatives we have implemented during the year, will help to reduce our costs and accelerate our margin expansion. In addition, we estimate incurring total pretax nonrecurring expenses of approximately $40 million to $50 million in fiscal '11 related to this restructuring, which includes employee-related separation costs.
I would now like to now turn to our financial outlook for fiscal 2011. We are expecting top and bottom line growth consistent with our long-term goals of mid-single digit revenue growth and 11% to 15% growth in adjusted operating earnings. Compared to our fiscal 2010 results, revenue is expected to grow mid-single digits on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, our revenue is expected to grow mid- to high-single digits, which is actually higher than our long-term guidance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to increase 11% to 18%, to a range of $1.58 to $1.68 per share.
In arriving at these estimates, we made several assumptions I would like to share with you. Hospital capital spending will grow in the low- to mid- single digit range, and our customers will continue to prioritize their spending. We will achieve $85 million to $95 million of pretax cost savings from the restructuring we announced today, and will incur pretax one-time expenditures of approximately $40 million to $50 million.
We expect that our Infusion business segment revenue will grow double digits to the high teens, driven by a couple of items. One, our acquisition of Medegen in May 2010 will benefit our top line and will be essentially break-even to the bottom line. Two, Baxter's removal of its Colleague pump installed base, as required by the FDA, will provide us an opportunity to gain further market share. At this time, we are assuming there will be an incremental contribution from this opportunity, and that it will begin impacting us in the second half of fiscal '11 and will increase as we move into fiscal '12.
We are expecting gross margins of approximately 48%, driven by the positive benefits of higher year-over-year margins in our MTS business and by manufacturing efficiencies throughout the organization. Primarily offsetting these benefits are expected lower gross margins in our Infusion business, where more aggressive pricing may be required to win market share related to the Baxter recall opportunity. As Dave mentioned, over the next several years, we expect margins to improve significantly as we supply the related disposables.
We are assuming that foreign exchange rates will remain at current levels and will negatively affect adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.08. Our adjusted tax rate will be approximately 30% to 32%, which is higher than the 30% rate we had indicated in May, driven by higher-than-expected income mix in the U.S., primarily from the projected increase in U.S. Infusion sales in fiscal '11. 
And lastly, we expect to exclude $100 million to $110 million in one-time items related to our company-wide restructuring, spin-off costs from Cardinal Health, as well as merger and integration costs related to Medegen. 
At the time we spun off from Cardinal Health, we said fiscal 2010 would be our base year from which our growth should be evaluated. In fact, we overachieved against our original fiscal 2010 expectations, driven by incremental positive contributions from both our Infusion and Respiratory businesses, as well as a slower ramp up in expenses in the first two quarters after the spin-off.
Several of the items that positively impacted our fiscal 2010 results are not expected to reoccur in fiscal '11. Let me break these items down. You can follow along on Slide 10 of the investor deck that is included in our webcast materials.
First, the revenue from the release of the Alaris ship hold impacted our first and second quarters by approximately $60 million, the majority of which was recorded in Q1. Second, the increased demand for ventilators related to H1N1 contributed $60 million to $65 million in revenues through fiscal 2010. Third, while foreign currency benefited our top line in 2010, changes in foreign currency are expected to result in a negative $85 million to $90 million revenue impact, based on fiscal 2010 actual results and projected fiscal 2011 budgets. 
Also recall that we divested our Research Services business in May 2010. This business contributed revenues of approximately $59 million in fiscal 2010 and is not included in discontinued operations. Revenue from our Medegen acquisition will impact our fiscal 2011, and we expect these two items will essentially offset each other.
Heading into 2011. Our plan overcomes the revenue benefits we had in fiscal 2010 as well as the impact of foreign currency. Together, these items represent approximately $210 million in revenue and an impact to the bottom line of $0.25 to $0.30.
While we do not guide on a quarterly basis, a couple of comments on the trends we see impacting the timing of results in fiscal 2011 will be useful as you build your financial models. We expect earnings to be weighted to the second half of the year, with nearly 60% of earnings coming in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal '11.
We expect our first quarter of fiscal 2011 to be down year-over-year. We had a strong first quarter in fiscal 2010, which benefited from the majority of approximately $60 million of Infusion revenues following the ship hold and increased demand for ventilators related to H1N1. Together with our slower ramp up in spending, these items, which are not predicted to occur again in the first quarter of fiscal '11, contributed approximately $0.12 to the $0.39 adjusted earnings per share we reported in our first quarter of fiscal 2010.
For the year, adjusted operating expenses are respected to total 33% of total revenue, down from 34% of total revenue in fiscal '10, due to the restructuring and our efforts in our cost management.
Our adjusted operating margins were 14% as we exited fiscal 2010. As a result of increased sales and the cost savings from the restructuring, we expect our adjusted operating margins to increase to approximately 15% of revenue or 16% on a constant-currency basis by the end of fiscal 2011.
We remain committed to achieving operating margins consistent with our peers. And because we have accelerated our efforts to improve our margins, we anticipate getting there ahead of our original expectation of three to five years post-spin. We expect to further increase our operating margins in the future through the combination of an additional $25 million in annualized cost savings from the restructuring, continued improvement in our cost of goods, exiting the transition service agreements with Cardinal Health and potentially divesting lower margin businesses. 
Interest expense and other is expected to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million for fiscal 2011.
And turning to cash flow. In fiscal 2011, we are expecting operating cash flow to be in the range of $425 million to $475 million, down from fiscal 2010 because of several one-time cash expenditures we are expecting in fiscal '11 that did not occur last year. These expenditures total approximately $200 million, and they are: two interest payments on our debt in fiscal 2011, whereas we had only one payment in '10; higher cash tax payments in fiscal '11, reflecting spin-related tax costs we had previously agreed to share with Cardinal and incremental taxes paid by Cardinal Health for July and August of 2009, prior to our spin off; and management and employee incentive plan payments, compared to no payments in fiscal '10. Our cash flow assumptions for fiscal '11 do not include the potential costs or benefits of any divestitures that we may undertake during the year.
In summary, we exited fiscal 2010 with strong results and in solid competitive positions across our businesses. We took necessary steps to lower our costs as we head into fiscal 2011, which we believe places us in an even better position for the longer term.
I'll turn the call back over to Carol."

Most of that difference is probably due to the international -- what didn't get done from an international perspective, at least not yet. So we're tracking to about $90 million now. The $85 million to $95 million is for this year, related to the restructuring we're just announcing now, with an incremental $25 million coming in '12, just due to timing of certain activities that are going on within the company. Related to divestitures, we look at these very closely in terms of both dilution and/or accretion when we look at them.

Now our view is that this kind of pricing is going to be temporary, and that it will need to pretty much apply across the board. And so as a result, the objective here is to gain share so that as we begin to ship the related disposables, their much higher margins will continue to fuel our bottom line for the next five to seven years.

And I think just your earnings growth of let's say 11% to 15%, I think that probably gets you -- assuming that our business and everything is sort of growing based upon what the assumptions we talked about this year, and working capital stays, let's say, basically flat, I think you get close to about $600 million for into '12 if all those assumptions were to hold. So I think maybe that's the way to think about it directionally."

Thank you for joining us on today's call as we provide an overview of CareFusion's results for the three months ended September 30, 2010, and provide an update to our guidance for fiscal 2011.
Our press release was issued this morning at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time and posted on our website at www.carefusion.com, and filed on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also filed and posted several slides to accompany today's webcast, which may be found on the Investor Relations homepage with the earnings materials. While we will not review each slide on today's call, these slides should be used as a reference guide by investors. The slides include comparisons of the results for the three months ended September 30, 2010, to the prior year period, as well as financial outlook for full year fiscal 2011 and definitions of our non-GAAP items and reconciliations to GAAP.
Joining me on today's call are Dave Schlotterbeck, our CEO; Ed Borkowski, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dwight Winstead, our Chief Operating Officer. Before I turn the call over, I'd like to make a few remarks.
In today's call, we will be presenting our results on a GAAP and an adjusted basis. Our adjusted results exclude restructuring and acquisition, integration charges, nonrecurring spinoff-related costs, nonrecurring tax items and discontinuing operations. We believe that adjusted financial measures can facilitate a more complete analysis and greater transparency into CareFusion's ongoing results of operations, particularly in comparing underlying results from period to period. Our management team utilizes adjusted financial measures internally in financial planning to monitor business unit performance and in evaluating management performance. We've included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with today's release.
I would like to remind investors that during today's call, we will be making statements that are essentially forward-looking and consequently are subject to risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include statements regarding our fiscal '11 guidance; our expectations regarding hospital capital spending; expectations related to our restructuring program, including anticipated timing, costs and expected savings; our expectations regarding acquisitions and divestitures and statements regarding business and revenue growth and anticipated foreign fluctuations, as well as any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.
You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors, and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Dave."

Let me start by talking about our results in the quarter and then make comments about my planned retirement. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance during the first quarter.

Overall, I'm pleased with our performance during the first quarter. Our earnings were in line with our expectations and highlighted a strong quarter for the Infusion, Dispensing, Infection Prevention and Medical Specialties businesses.
These businesses all saw continued momentum from the fourth quarter, giving me confidence to reaffirm our revenue and EPS guidance for the year. With an adjusted EPS for Q1 of $0.30, we are on track with the full year guidance we provided in August of $1.58 to $1.68 and 11% to 18% year-over-year increase, as we indicated when we reported our Q4 results. Earnings were projected to decline in the first quarter due to the strong Q1 we had last year, where we shipped an unusually large amount of infusion pumps following a ship hold and had strong Respiratory sales associated with H1N1. 
We continue to expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range we provided in August. We overcame nearly all of the $60 million in benefit we saw in the first quarter of last year from H1N1 and our Alaris System coming off a ship hold. Our Respiratory revenue was lighter than we anticipated. We expect this impact through the remainder of the year will be offset by strength in our other businesses and upside to our budgeted foreign currency rates.
Let me take a minute to discuss the factors that affected Respiratory sales during the quarter. Coming off a record year due to H1N1, many hospitals had adequate capital equipment to meet their needs. This was complicated by an overall lower census, including the lowest birthrate in 100 years, according to recent CDC data, and a mild start to the flu season. This combination of what we now understand to include forward buying by our customers during the last fiscal year and lower admissions to start this fiscal year led the softness in Respiratory capital sales and associated disposables. 
On the Capital Equipment side of the business, we performed better in the U.S. market but saw a greater shortfall to our revenue expectations outside the U.S. due to a slowdown in the European market and, to a lesser degree, with our distributor in Canada. Our Respiratory business is positioned well, with a competitive product portfolio and a strong pipeline to drive growth over the longer term. 
We saw a continued growth in our Infusion business, surpassing the substantial Q1 we had in the prior fiscal year. We exited this quarter with a strong backlog, putting this business in great shape for the year. I remind you that we have a large ramp projected throughout the year in our Infusion sales. We have a lot of work ahead, and we are operating in a very competitive environment. But the early indications show continued year-over-year momentum from Q4 through Q1 and even as we have entered Q2. 
In the last 15 months, we have taken an estimated 49,000 competitive channels and only lost 4,500. So we have momentum, and our year is shaping up as we expect it. I continue to feel comfortable with our projections for share gains, with the variable we don't control being the exact timing of the conversions. 
There's a similar story in Dispensing. The business is performing as we expected, meaning, competitive wins continued to far outpace any competitive losses as we renew existing customers and build a healthy backlog. We won a record number of new contracts through this period, coming off our strongest Q4 in three years for committed contracts. We have good momentum in our core Dispensing business and are increasing the value we provide our customers through strategic partnerships, like the alliance we created with Cerner. In our first quarter of the Cerner relationship, we are already taking orders moving ahead with our co-development plans and seeing progress in our pipeline.
In Medical Technologies and Services, we had some revenue pressure against Q1 of last year due to the sale of our Research Services business and softness in surgical volumes outside the U.S. We also had a strong prior year period in our International Surgical Products business in both sales and in the benefit of foreign currency exchange rates. 
I was very pleased with the continued progress we made in our Infection Prevention business where ChloraPrep, our skin antiseptic product for vascular and surgical procedures, continued to grow substantially despite softness in procedure volumes. ChloraPrep is quickly becoming a standard of care in hospitals across the country, with strong clinical evidence base and a growing number of key opinion leaders advocating its use. We have an active schedule of introductions for the product outside the U.S. beginning in early 2011.
We also continue to make product with the launch of our AVAmax Vertebral Balloon product for kyphoplastic procedures in the U.S. market. We have a modest revenue plan for it in this first year but are encouraged by the market interest and user feedback. Approximately 100 hospitals are now using the product, which we believe to be a positive indicator just three months following our commercial launch. 
Overall, we remain in a good position as we navigate several important initiatives through the year. We continue to make progress against the global restructuring we undertook last quarter to deliver more than $100 million of annual ongoing savings. We remain committed to evaluating strategic options and taking action this year with businesses in our portfolio that do not strategically fit or are dilutive to our operating margins.
We also continue to invest in R&D, in our innovation pipeline, with a focus on growth over the long term. We're increasing our R&D spend approximately 10% in FY '11 to strengthen our core franchises, extend our offerings into adjacent markets and connect our existing devices to increase the value we bring to customers as CareFusion.
As you know  from our separate news release this morning, I also announced my retirement plans today. The decision about the timing to retire is always a personal one. In my case, I've always had a relatively short time period in mind once we completed the spinoff with an experienced leadership team in place and a solid year behind us as a public company. I'm confident that I'll leave CareFusion in an excellent position to continue to grow well into the future. We established a differentiated vision to lower the cost and improve the safety of healthcare for generations to come and have executed against it with an enviable portfolio of industry-leading medical devices and services for our customers worldwide. I'm proud of the company and where it stands in the industry as I anticipate this new phase in my life.
The board started succession planning earlier this year. Given my decision, and the internal and external search for my successor has been initiated, led by our Presiding Director Mike Losh. Mike and the special committee of the board intend to be disciplined and thorough in their approach, with the target date to have a new CEO in place prior to my departure on February 28. 
And before I turn it over to Ed, I want to thank our global employees for the support they've given me and the commitment they continue to demonstrate to our customers and to the growth of CareFusion. We're making progress through a combination of longer-term investments and the shorter-term work we've undertaken to improve our profitability. As I've said before, our portfolio of businesses continues to provide us with a good long-term balance of capital equipment essential for hospitals to deliver patient care, along with procedure-based products. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ed."
49276069,114780090,84252,"CareFusion Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","CareFusion Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will be reviewing our financial results for the first quarter and our full year fiscal 2011 guidance. Before I move to our results for the quarter, I'd like to p",1679,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will be reviewing our financial results for the first quarter and our full year fiscal 2011 guidance. Before I move to our results for the quarter, I'd like to provide some context to these results compared to the guidance we provided in August.
While we do not guide on a quarterly basis, we said that we expected our first quarter earnings to be down year-over-year based on several items that positively impacted our first quarter fiscal 2010 results, which we did not expect to reoccur in the first quarter of fiscal '11. In addition, we said that we expected earnings to be weighted to the second half of the year, with nearly 60% coming in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal '11. 
Today, we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS and revenue guidance ranges for fiscal '11. We continue to expect that our results will be weighted to the second half of the fiscal year, as momentum in several of our businesses builds throughout the year. Additionally, currency rates have improved since we last provided guidance, which benefits our top line. However, notwithstanding the currency benefit, we would be within our guidance ranges for both revenue and adjusted EPS. Please keep these points in mind as I review the financial results for the quarter in more detail.
Our adjusted net income for the quarter was $67 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared to $87 million or $0.39 per diluted share a year ago, resulting from lower revenue, lower gross margins and higher interest expense and a higher tax rate in the current quarter. Excluded from adjusted net income in the first quarter of fiscal '11 are $40 million or $0.13 per diluted share in one-time expenditures related to our company-wide restructuring, spinoff costs from Cardinal Health, as well as merger and integration costs. 
Revenue for the first quarter totaled $908 million, a decrease of 2% on a reported basis and less than 1% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior year period. On a segment basis, revenues in our Critical Care Technologies segment, which includes our Dispensing, Infusion and Respiratory business lines, totaled $617 million for the first quarter of fiscal '11, essentially flat compared to the prior year period. Adjusted segment profit was $100 million, down 11% from the prior year period due to Infusion and Respiratory results in the first quarter of fiscal '10, which benefited from the unusual items I mentioned earlier.
The Critical Care results were driven by a year-over-year increase in Infusion sales for the first quarter of fiscal '11. We continue to expect that our Infusion revenue will grow double digits to the high teens, driven by incremental growth in the infusion market, our acquisition of Medegen in May of 2010 and the opportunity provided by Baxter's required removal of its COLLEAGUE pump installed base, which we continue to expect to occur in the second half of fiscal '11 and to increase as we move into fiscal '12.
The increase in Infusion sales was offset by lower Respiratory sales, which were lower than the prior year and lower than we had anticipated. We expect the dynamics that Dave mentioned in his remarks to impact our Respiratory businesses throughout the remainder of the year. And as a result, we now expect Respiratory sales to be down mid-single digits compared to fiscal '10. 
Our Dispensing business continues to gain favorable momentum as we continue to add to our revenue base through competitive wins, renewals and our agreement with Cerner, which is adding to our yield pipeline. As David indicated, we won a record number of new contracts in the quarter and are on track to achieve our Dispensing forecast for fiscal '11.
In our Medical Technologies and Services segment, which includes our Infection Prevention and Medical Specialty businesses, first quarter revenues were $291 million, a 5% decrease from the prior year period. Adjusted segment profit was $22 million, flat from the prior year. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by the loss of sales from our Research Services business that was sold in May of 2010 and lower International Surgical Products revenues, which were negatively impacted by currency and a benefit from the sales of surgical masks for H1N1 purposes that occurred in the prior year quarter but was not repeated in the first quarter of fiscal '11. These were partially offset by increased sales from our ChloraPrep skin antiseptic product and our Interventional Specialties businesses.
Looking ahead to the remainder of the fiscal year, we are maintaining our revenue guidance of mid-single-digit growth over fiscal 2010 revenue of $3.9 billion. We expect slightly more than 50% of revenue will come in the second half of the fiscal year. 
In August, we said that changes in foreign currency were expected to have a negative impact on our revenue results. As the U.S. dollar weakened and several European currencies strengthened since we built our fiscal 2011 budget, the impact of currency on our top line has improved, and together with the strength in our other businesses is expected to offset the softness we are seeing in our Respiratory business. 
Our gross margins for the first quarter were 48% compared to 49% in the prior year due to product mix. The prior year quarter included higher gross margins in our Infusion and Dispensing businesses and manufacturing efficiencies as we resumed manufacturing of the Alaris System in the first quarter of fiscal '10. Sequentially from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, gross margins are up as a result of the company-wide restructuring and continued benefits from manufacturing efficiencies. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect our gross margins to be approximately 48%.
Adjusted operating expenses, including SG&A and R&D, totaled $318 million or 35% of total revenue, essentially flat compared to the prior year period. Adjusted SG&A expense of $278 million declined 1% over the prior year period. SG&A included higher spend within the Medical Specialties and Infection Prevention selling organizations to support our AVAmax and ChloraPrep products. The spending was offset by benefits from the August 2010 restructuring, as well as continued cost-saving efforts across all of our business. R&D for the quarter totaled $40 million, up 11% from the prior year.
For the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted operating expenses to total 33% of total revenue due to the restructuring and our continued cost-management efforts. Longer term, we believe that with our continued focus on cost and our ability to execute, we can, over the near and long term, improve our margins by driving efficiencies to improve our cost of goods and continue to decrease our SG&A spend. 
Interest expense and other totaled $24 million for the first quarter of fiscal '11, primarily driven by interest on our $1.4 billion of debt, which carries a yield of maturity interest rate of 5.8%, as well as miscellaneous expenses related to nonoperating items that flowed through this line item. During our first quarter, currency negatively impacted our results by approximately $0.02 per share. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 31.7%, in line with our previous guidance. and compares to a rate of 24.3% for the prior year period. The period-over-period increase in the tax rate is primarily driven by a shift in the mix of pretax income to higher tax jurisdictions, in part as a result of the tax changes we made in the third quarter fiscal '10. The significant increase in our tax rate year-over-year negatively impacted our results by approximately $0.03. 
Turning to operating cash flow. For the three months ended September 30, 2010, our operating cash flow used on continuing operations was $7 million. The use of cash during the quarter was expected and was primarily driven by cash payments related to an interest payment on our debt and management and employee incentive plans, both of which were not included in the prior year. 
Capital spending totaled $35 million and depreciation and amortization was $45 million. We continue to estimate CapEx to be $160 million to $180 million for the year. And on September 30, we had approximately $1 billion in cash. We continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $425 million to $475 million for fiscal 2011. As I've said on our August call, our cash flow assumptions for fiscal '11 do not include the potential costs or benefits of any divestitures that we may undertake during the year.
I would also like to provide you with an update on how we are progressing against the goals we established at the time we announced the global restructuring in August of 2010. At that time, we guided to expected savings of $85 million to $95 million in fiscal '11 and for that amount to increase by an additional $25 million in fiscal 2012. In addition, we estimate incurring total pretax nonrecurring expenses of approximately $40 million to $50 million in fiscal '11 related to this restructuring. 
I am pleased to say that as of the end of September,
we completed Phase I of the restructuring and believe we are on track to achieve our full year savings target. Our savings during the first quarter were on track with our expectations of approximately $90 million and will increase next quarter. During the quarter, we recorded charges of $20 million related to the restructuring.
As I said in my opening remarks, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.58 to $1.68. In my comments, I've walked through the assumptions we've made in arriving at these estimates, including the positive trends in the majority of our businesses. I would also like to reiterate that we expect earnings to be weighted to the second half of fiscal '11, driven in large part by our upcoming opportunities in the Infusion business and the timing of new product launches. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Carol for questions. Thank you."

As far as pricing, I don't think there's a rule of thumb that we're using. As we had indicated earlier, we will be competitive on pricing. We like the model of getting our devices in place because of the continuing and ongoing revenue stream relative to the disposable components.

But I have to tell you, going in and describing what we are capable of doing and where that is going really seems to have a fair amount of pull-through in making those capital equipment decisions.

And then I think we get to the $85 million to $95 million that I mentioned for this year and then another $25 million the year after. So all looks on track relative to what we expect. So that looks like a pretty good shape there."

Our business came very close to, on its own, exceeding last quarter or a year ago quarter, which included north of $50 million of ship hold products. And so clearly, momentum is growing in that business. We saw a very strong booking quarter in Q1 in our Infusion business. We are expecting that to grow substantially in the second quarter. And so maybe some folks are having trouble out there, but we're not one of them. And just to help put it into perspective, as orders are booked and contracts are signed, about the fastest you would see the installation take place and customers allow us then, give us the approval so that we can recognize revenue, is about 120 days. So you'll be seeing some of the orders that were booked in Q1 being installed in Q3. And that's why Q2 is such an important indicator for us because those will begin installs and recognizing that revenue late Q3 and Q4 of next year. So we'll pretty much have a wrap on what the Infusion year is going to look like, as we said, by the time of the next earnings call in February because we'll be at a point where everything that will have been committed to by that point in time can be installed by the end of the year, and so I think we'll be able to have a pretty good sense on things. What I can say is that we're seeing a lot more activity amongst this Baxter base than we saw just a few months ago. And interestingly, I think, each of the manufacturers has a completely different view of what's going on in that base. I think ours is pretty positive. And whereas others are going from not positive to, we're pleased with the results. But as you look at the history, when we say we're pleased with the results, we deliver."

Thank you for joining us on today's call as we provide an overview of CareFusion's results for the three months ended September 30, 2010, and provide an update to our guidance for fiscal 2011.
Our press release was issued this morning at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time and posted on our website at www.carefusion.com, and filed on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also filed and posted several slides to accompany today's webcast, which may be found on the Investor Relations homepage with the earnings materials. While we will not review each slide on today's call, these slides should be used as a reference guide by investors. The slides include comparisons of the results for the three months ended September 30, 2010, to the prior year period, as well as financial outlook for full year fiscal 2011 and definitions of our non-GAAP items and reconciliations to GAAP.
Joining me on today's call are Dave Schlotterbeck, our CEO; Ed Borkowski, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dwight Winstead, our Chief Operating Officer. Before I turn the call over, I'd like to make a few remarks.
In today's call, we will be presenting our results on a GAAP and an adjusted basis. Our adjusted results exclude restructuring and acquisition, integration charges, nonrecurring spinoff-related costs, nonrecurring tax items and discontinuing operations. We believe that adjusted financial measures can facilitate a more complete analysis and greater transparency into CareFusion's ongoing results of operations, particularly in comparing underlying results from period to period. Our management team utilizes adjusted financial measures internally in financial planning to monitor business unit performance and in evaluating management performance. We've included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with today's release.
I would like to remind investors that during today's call, we will be making statements that are essentially forward-looking and consequently are subject to risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include statements regarding our fiscal '11 guidance; our expectations regarding hospital capital spending; expectations related to our restructuring program, including anticipated timing, costs and expected savings; our expectations regarding acquisitions and divestitures and statements regarding business and revenue growth and anticipated foreign fluctuations, as well as any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.
You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors, and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Dave.

Let me start by talking about our results in the quarter and then make comments about my planned retirement. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance during the first quarter. Our earnings were in line with our expectations and highlighted",1284,"Thanks, Carol. Let me start by talking about our results in the quarter and then make comments about my planned retirement. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance during the first quarter. Our earnings were in line with our expectations and highlighted a strong quarter for the Infusion, Dispensing, Infection Prevention and Medical Specialties businesses.
These businesses all saw continued momentum from the fourth quarter, giving me confidence to reaffirm our revenue and EPS guidance for the year. With an adjusted EPS for Q1 of $0.30, we are on track with the full year guidance we provided in August of $1.58 to $1.68 and 11% to 18% year-over-year increase, as we indicated when we reported our Q4 results. Earnings were projected to decline in the first quarter due to the strong Q1 we had last year, where we shipped an unusually large amount of infusion pumps following a ship hold and had strong Respiratory sales associated with H1N1. 
We continue to expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range we provided in August. We overcame nearly all of the $60 million in benefit we saw in the first quarter of last year from H1N1 and our Alaris System coming off a ship hold. Our Respiratory revenue was lighter than we anticipated. We expect this impact through the remainder of the year will be offset by strength in our other businesses and upside to our budgeted foreign currency rates.
Let me take a minute to discuss the factors that affected Respiratory sales during the quarter. Coming off a record year due to H1N1, many hospitals had adequate capital equipment to meet their needs. This was complicated by an overall lower census, including the lowest birthrate in 100 years, according to recent CDC data, and a mild start to the flu season. This combination of what we now understand to include forward buying by our customers during the last fiscal year and lower admissions to start this fiscal year led the softness in Respiratory capital sales and associated disposables. 
On the Capital Equipment side of the business, we performed better in the U.S. market but saw a greater shortfall to our revenue expectations outside the U.S. due to a slowdown in the European market and, to a lesser degree, with our distributor in Canada. Our Respiratory business is positioned well, with a competitive product portfolio and a strong pipeline to drive growth over the longer term. 
We saw a continued growth in our Infusion business, surpassing the substantial Q1 we had in the prior fiscal year. We exited this quarter with a strong backlog, putting this business in great shape for the year. I remind you that we have a large ramp projected throughout the year in our Infusion sales. We have a lot of work ahead, and we are operating in a very competitive environment. But the early indications show continued year-over-year momentum from Q4 through Q1 and even as we have entered Q2. 
In the last 15 months, we have taken an estimated 49,000 competitive channels and only lost 4,500. So we have momentum, and our year is shaping up as we expect it. I continue to feel comfortable with our projections for share gains, with the variable we don't control being the exact timing of the conversions. 
There's a similar story in Dispensing. The business is performing as we expected, meaning, competitive wins continued to far outpace any competitive losses as we renew existing customers and build a healthy backlog. We won a record number of new contracts through this period, coming off our strongest Q4 in three years for committed contracts. We have good momentum in our core Dispensing business and are increasing the value we provide our customers through strategic partnerships, like the alliance we created with Cerner. In our first quarter of the Cerner relationship, we are already taking orders moving ahead with our co-development plans and seeing progress in our pipeline.
In Medical Technologies and Services, we had some revenue pressure against Q1 of last year due to the sale of our Research Services business and softness in surgical volumes outside the U.S. We also had a strong prior year period in our International Surgical Products business in both sales and in the benefit of foreign currency exchange rates. 
I was very pleased with the continued progress we made in our Infection Prevention business where ChloraPrep, our skin antiseptic product for vascular and surgical procedures, continued to grow substantially despite softness in procedure volumes. ChloraPrep is quickly becoming a standard of care in hospitals across the country, with strong clinical evidence base and a growing number of key opinion leaders advocating its use. We have an active schedule of introductions for the product outside the U.S. beginning in early 2011.
We also continue to make product with the launch of our AVAmax Vertebral Balloon product for kyphoplastic procedures in the U.S. market. We have a modest revenue plan for it in this first year but are encouraged by the market interest and user feedback. Approximately 100 hospitals are now using the product, which we believe to be a positive indicator just three months following our commercial launch. 
Overall, we remain in a good position as we navigate several important initiatives through the year. We continue to make progress against the global restructuring we undertook last quarter to deliver more than $100 million of annual ongoing savings. We remain committed to evaluating strategic options and taking action this year with businesses in our portfolio that do not strategically fit or are dilutive to our operating margins.
We also continue to invest in R&D, in our innovation pipeline, with a focus on growth over the long term. We're increasing our R&D spend approximately 10% in FY '11 to strengthen our core franchises, extend our offerings into adjacent markets and connect our existing devices to increase the value we bring to customers as CareFusion.
As you know  from our separate news release this morning, I also announced my retirement plans today. The decision about the timing to retire is always a personal one. In my case, I've always had a relatively short time period in mind once we completed the spinoff with an experienced leadership team in place and a solid year behind us as a public company. I'm confident that I'll leave CareFusion in an excellent position to continue to grow well into the future. We established a differentiated vision to lower the cost and improve the safety of healthcare for generations to come and have executed against it with an enviable portfolio of industry-leading medical devices and services for our customers worldwide. I'm proud of the company and where it stands in the industry as I anticipate this new phase in my life.
The board started succession planning earlier this year. Given my decision, and the internal and external search for my successor has been initiated, led by our Presiding Director Mike Losh. Mike and the special committee of the board intend to be disciplined and thorough in their approach, with the target date to have a new CEO in place prior to my departure on February 28. 
And before I turn it over to Ed, I want to thank our global employees for the support they've given me and the commitment they continue to demonstrate to our customers and to the growth of CareFusion. We're making progress through a combination of longer-term investments and the shorter-term work we've undertaken to improve our profitability. As I've said before, our portfolio of businesses continues to provide us with a good long-term balance of capital equipment essential for hospitals to deliver patient care, along with procedure-based products. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ed.

On today's call, I will be reviewing our financial results for the first quarter and our full year fiscal 2011 guidance. Before I move to our results for the quarter, I'd like to p",1679,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will be reviewing our financial results for the first quarter and our full year fiscal 2011 guidance. Before I move to our results for the quarter, I'd like to provide some context to these results compared to the guidance we provided in August.
While we do not guide on a quarterly basis, we said that we expected our first quarter earnings to be down year-over-year based on several items that positively impacted our first quarter fiscal 2010 results, which we did not expect to reoccur in the first quarter of fiscal '11. In addition, we said that we expected earnings to be weighted to the second half of the year, with nearly 60% coming in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal '11. 
Today, we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS and revenue guidance ranges for fiscal '11. We continue to expect that our results will be weighted to the second half of the fiscal year, as momentum in several of our businesses builds throughout the year. Additionally, currency rates have improved since we last provided guidance, which benefits our top line. However, notwithstanding the currency benefit, we would be within our guidance ranges for both revenue and adjusted EPS. Please keep these points in mind as I review the financial results for the quarter in more detail.
Our adjusted net income for the quarter was $67 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared to $87 million or $0.39 per diluted share a year ago, resulting from lower revenue, lower gross margins and higher interest expense and a higher tax rate in the current quarter. Excluded from adjusted net income in the first quarter of fiscal '11 are $40 million or $0.13 per diluted share in one-time expenditures related to our company-wide restructuring, spinoff costs from Cardinal Health, as well as merger and integration costs. 
Revenue for the first quarter totaled $908 million, a decrease of 2% on a reported basis and less than 1% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior year period. On a segment basis, revenues in our Critical Care Technologies segment, which includes our Dispensing, Infusion and Respiratory business lines, totaled $617 million for the first quarter of fiscal '11, essentially flat compared to the prior year period. Adjusted segment profit was $100 million, down 11% from the prior year period due to Infusion and Respiratory results in the first quarter of fiscal '10, which benefited from the unusual items I mentioned earlier.
The Critical Care results were driven by a year-over-year increase in Infusion sales for the first quarter of fiscal '11. We continue to expect that our Infusion revenue will grow double digits to the high teens, driven by incremental growth in the infusion market, our acquisition of Medegen in May of 2010 and the opportunity provided by Baxter's required removal of its COLLEAGUE pump installed base, which we continue to expect to occur in the second half of fiscal '11 and to increase as we move into fiscal '12.
The increase in Infusion sales was offset by lower Respiratory sales, which were lower than the prior year and lower than we had anticipated. We expect the dynamics that Dave mentioned in his remarks to impact our Respiratory businesses throughout the remainder of the year. And as a result, we now expect Respiratory sales to be down mid-single digits compared to fiscal '10. 
Our Dispensing business continues to gain favorable momentum as we continue to add to our revenue base through competitive wins, renewals and our agreement with Cerner, which is adding to our yield pipeline. As David indicated, we won a record number of new contracts in the quarter and are on track to achieve our Dispensing forecast for fiscal '11.
In our Medical Technologies and Services segment, which includes our Infection Prevention and Medical Specialty businesses, first quarter revenues were $291 million, a 5% decrease from the prior year period. Adjusted segment profit was $22 million, flat from the prior year. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by the loss of sales from our Research Services business that was sold in May of 2010 and lower International Surgical Products revenues, which were negatively impacted by currency and a benefit from the sales of surgical masks for H1N1 purposes that occurred in the prior year quarter but was not repeated in the first quarter of fiscal '11. These were partially offset by increased sales from our ChloraPrep skin antiseptic product and our Interventional Specialties businesses.
Looking ahead to the remainder of the fiscal year, we are maintaining our revenue guidance of mid-single-digit growth over fiscal 2010 revenue of $3.9 billion. We expect slightly more than 50% of revenue will come in the second half of the fiscal year. 
In August, we said that changes in foreign currency were expected to have a negative impact on our revenue results. As the U.S. dollar weakened and several European currencies strengthened since we built our fiscal 2011 budget, the impact of currency on our top line has improved, and together with the strength in our other businesses is expected to offset the softness we are seeing in our Respiratory business. 
Our gross margins for the first quarter were 48% compared to 49% in the prior year due to product mix. The prior year quarter included higher gross margins in our Infusion and Dispensing businesses and manufacturing efficiencies as we resumed manufacturing of the Alaris System in the first quarter of fiscal '10. Sequentially from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, gross margins are up as a result of the company-wide restructuring and continued benefits from manufacturing efficiencies. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect our gross margins to be approximately 48%.
Adjusted operating expenses, including SG&A and R&D, totaled $318 million or 35% of total revenue, essentially flat compared to the prior year period. Adjusted SG&A expense of $278 million declined 1% over the prior year period. SG&A included higher spend within the Medical Specialties and Infection Prevention selling organizations to support our AVAmax and ChloraPrep products. The spending was offset by benefits from the August 2010 restructuring, as well as continued cost-saving efforts across all of our business. R&D for the quarter totaled $40 million, up 11% from the prior year.
For the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted operating expenses to total 33% of total revenue due to the restructuring and our continued cost-management efforts. Longer term, we believe that with our continued focus on cost and our ability to execute, we can, over the near and long term, improve our margins by driving efficiencies to improve our cost of goods and continue to decrease our SG&A spend. 
Interest expense and other totaled $24 million for the first quarter of fiscal '11, primarily driven by interest on our $1.4 billion of debt, which carries a yield of maturity interest rate of 5.8%, as well as miscellaneous expenses related to nonoperating items that flowed through this line item. During our first quarter, currency negatively impacted our results by approximately $0.02 per share. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 31.7%, in line with our previous guidance. and compares to a rate of 24.3% for the prior year period. The period-over-period increase in the tax rate is primarily driven by a shift in the mix of pretax income to higher tax jurisdictions, in part as a result of the tax changes we made in the third quarter fiscal '10. The significant increase in our tax rate year-over-year negatively impacted our results by approximately $0.03. 
Turning to operating cash flow. For the three months ended September 30, 2010, our operating cash flow used on continuing operations was $7 million. The use of cash during the quarter was expected and was primarily driven by cash payments related to an interest payment on our debt and management and employee incentive plans, both of which were not included in the prior year. 
Capital spending totaled $35 million and depreciation and amortization was $45 million. We continue to estimate CapEx to be $160 million to $180 million for the year. And on September 30, we had approximately $1 billion in cash. We continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $425 million to $475 million for fiscal 2011. As I've said on our August call, our cash flow assumptions for fiscal '11 do not include the potential costs or benefits of any divestitures that we may undertake during the year.
I would also like to provide you with an update on how we are progressing against the goals we established at the time we announced the global restructuring in August of 2010. At that time, we guided to expected savings of $85 million to $95 million in fiscal '11 and for that amount to increase by an additional $25 million in fiscal 2012. In addition, we estimate incurring total pretax nonrecurring expenses of approximately $40 million to $50 million in fiscal '11 related to this restructuring. 
I am pleased to say that as of the end of September,
we completed Phase I of the restructuring and believe we are on track to achieve our full year savings target. Our savings during the first quarter were on track with our expectations of approximately $90 million and will increase next quarter. During the quarter, we recorded charges of $20 million related to the restructuring.
As I said in my opening remarks, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.58 to $1.68. In my comments, I've walked through the assumptions we've made in arriving at these estimates, including the positive trends in the majority of our businesses. I would also like to reiterate that we expect earnings to be weighted to the second half of fiscal '11, driven in large part by our upcoming opportunities in the Infusion business and the timing of new product launches. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Carol for questions. Thank you.

Our strategy really is to gather up as much of the market while we're alone in it as possible. And so we continue to be optimistic about its ongoing contribution. I'm sorry, what was the second part to your question, Amit?

There's stockpiling that needs to be burned off, and we're expecting that business to rebound in FY '12.

Last year, our Infusion business, on its own, not including about $60 million of the ship hold release, grew 9% on the top line. I think in the first quarter of this year, we grew about 11% on the top line for the basic business. And if you add in Medegen to that, you're picking up another two to three points, and so you're nearly at 15%. So high teens, given that there are 300,000 channels out there in the marketplace available to us, maybe less to others, is, in our mind, very doable. And as I mentioned in my remarks, the only thing we can't control is the timing of the conversion because that's really a customer-controlled decision.

As we've studied what's happened in the market, people bought forward both in the United States and in the EU. And so in terms of capital equipment, we don't anticipate that recovering until our FY '12. We also believe that disposables were stockpiled. When you combine that with the fact that admissions are down, birthrates are down, both of which use ventilation disposables, the stockpiling they did still needs to be burned off before they get back to their normal buying patterns. So bottom line, as we see it, is that we would expect to see continued softness in the Respiratory business through our FY '11, rebounding to more normal purchase patterns in FY '12.

So it was slightly down. However, not to be confused with the momentum that Dave referred to and what we're seeing relative to the ramp-up of committed contracts. We had a very strong committed contract quarter for Q1, and as Dave said, while we don't have visibility for the entire year and we know our plan was somewhat back-loaded, we are getting better visibility. And we think by Q2 earnings call, we'll have a good indication as to how it's coming together, but nothing would move us away from the overall targets that we've established for picking up volume based on the Baxter opportunity. As far as pricing, I don't think there's a rule of thumb that we're using. As we had indicated earlier, we will be competitive on pricing. We like the model of getting our devices in place because of the continuing and ongoing revenue stream relative to the disposable components. And now with the superiority of our Medegen valve, we believe that's going to just make our disposable components that much stronger as we move forward. So we have factored that in, and the pricing that we've established, as well as what we're seeing to strengthen our Dispensing business, is back to where he gave you assurance early on that we still see 48% gross margins to be on our overall target for the full year.

We're expecting that those will cause a lot of chatter and position us well for going into FY '12. One of the things that we have been very focused on is connectivity and connecting our products into the customers' HIT system. And I had mentioned about a year ago that we had started a project to provide a common network to our customers, so that even though we have a number of products that can be networked, by the end of this year, they will all be able to be networked over a single network that is purchased by the customer, really designed to feed data from those products into the EMR [electronic medical record] of their HIT system. I think we will likely be the first company to be officially able to help our customers meet the Phase III requirement on the HIT stimulus, which actually doesn't roll around until 2015. But I have to tell you, going in and describing what we are capable of doing and where that is going really seems to have a fair amount of pull-through in making those capital equipment decisions. So we have a number of smaller products that are coming out this year, and to sort of put it into perspective, last year, we introduced a total of 27 new products during the 12 months of 2010.

You said that the timing is somewhat unpredictable there. And one of your competitors has said that hospitals are taking a longer time than expected to make a decision. I guess I just wanted to see, one, if you agree with that statement that hospitals are taking a longer time than expected. And then also, if you could just kind of help us think about if hospitals do make a decision by year end, kind of when you would expect to start seeing those revenues. Is that a process that's likely to take three months, six months longer, just kind of help us think about the timing there?

Our business came very close to, on its own, exceeding last quarter or a year ago quarter, which included north of $50 million of ship hold products. And so clearly, momentum is growing in that business. We saw a very strong booking quarter in Q1 in our Infusion business. We are expecting that to grow substantially in the second quarter. And so maybe some folks are having trouble out there, but we're not one of them. And just to help put it into perspective, as orders are booked and contracts are signed, about the fastest you would see the installation take place and customers allow us then, give us the approval so that we can recognize revenue, is about 120 days. So you'll be seeing some of the orders that were booked in Q1 being installed in Q3. And that's why Q2 is such an important indicator for us because those will begin installs and recognizing that revenue late Q3 and Q4 of next year. So we'll pretty much have a wrap on what the Infusion year is going to look like, as we said, by the time of the next earnings call in February because we'll be at a point where everything that will have been committed to by that point in time can be installed by the end of the year, and so I think we'll be able to have a pretty good sense on things. What I can say is that we're seeing a lot more activity amongst this Baxter base than we saw just a few months ago. And interestingly, I think, each of the manufacturers has a completely different view of what's going on in that base. I think ours is pretty positive. And whereas others are going from not positive to, we're pleased with the results. But as you look at the history, when we say we're pleased with the results, we deliver.

Thank you for joining us on today's call as we provide an overview of CareFusion's results for the three months ended September 30, 2010, and provide an update to our guidance for fiscal 2011.
Our press release was issued this morning at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time and posted on our website at www.carefusion.com, and filed on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also filed and posted several slides to accompany today's webcast, which may be found on the Investor Relations homepage with the earnings materials. While we will not review each slide on today's call, these slides should be used as a reference guide by investors. The slides include comparisons of the results for the three months ended September 30, 2010, to the prior year period, as well as financial outlook for full year fiscal 2011 and definitions of our non-GAAP items and reconciliations to GAAP.
Joining me on today's call are Dave Schlotterbeck, our CEO; Ed Borkowski, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dwight Winstead, our Chief Operating Officer. Before I turn the call over, I'd like to make a few remarks.
In today's call, we will be presenting our results on a GAAP and an adjusted basis. Our adjusted results exclude restructuring and acquisition, integration charges, nonrecurring spinoff-related costs, nonrecurring tax items and discontinuing operations. We believe that adjusted financial measures can facilitate a more complete analysis and greater transparency into CareFusion's ongoing results of operations, particularly in comparing underlying results from period to period. Our management team utilizes adjusted financial measures internally in financial planning to monitor business unit performance and in evaluating management performance. We've included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with today's release.
I would like to remind investors that during today's call, we will be making statements that are essentially forward-looking and consequently are subject to risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include statements regarding our fiscal '11 guidance; our expectations regarding hospital capital spending; expectations related to our restructuring program, including anticipated timing, costs and expected savings; our expectations regarding acquisitions and divestitures and statements regarding business and revenue growth and anticipated foreign currency fluctuations, as well as any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.
You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors, and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Dave."

Let me start by talking about our results in the quarter and then make comments about my planned retirement. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance during the first quarter. Our earnings were in line with our expectations and highlighted",1284,"Thanks, Carol. Let me start by talking about our results in the quarter and then make comments about my planned retirement. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance during the first quarter. Our earnings were in line with our expectations and highlighted a strong quarter for the Infusion, Dispensing, Infection Prevention and Medical Specialties businesses.
These businesses all saw continued momentum from the fourth quarter, giving me confidence to reaffirm our revenue and EPS guidance for the year. With an adjusted EPS for Q1 of $0.30, we are on track with the full year guidance we provided in August of $1.58 to $1.68 and 11% to 18% year-over-year increase, as we indicated when we reported our Q4 results. Earnings were projected to decline in the first quarter due to the strong Q1 we had last year, where we shipped an unusually large amount of infusion pumps following a ship hold and had strong Respiratory sales associated with H1N1. 
We continue to expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range we provided in August. We overcame nearly all of the $60 million in benefit we saw in the first quarter of last year from H1N1 and our Alaris System coming off a ship hold. Our Respiratory revenue was lighter than we anticipated. We expect this impact through the remainder of the year will be offset by strength in our other businesses and upside to our budgeted foreign currency rates.
Let me take a minute to discuss the factors that affected Respiratory sales during the quarter. Coming off a record year due to H1N1, many hospitals had adequate capital equipment to meet their needs. This was complicated by an overall lower census, including the lowest birthrate in 100 years, according to recent CDC data, and a mild start to the flu season. This combination of what we now understand to include forward buying by our customers during the last fiscal year and lower admissions to start this fiscal year led the softness in Respiratory capital sales and associated disposables. 
On the Capital Equipment side of the business, we performed better in the U.S. market but saw a greater shortfall to our revenue expectations outside the U.S. due to a slowdown in the European market and, to a lesser degree, with our distributor in Canada. Our Respiratory business is positioned well, with a competitive product portfolio and a strong pipeline to drive growth over the longer term. 
We saw a continued growth in our Infusion business, surpassing the substantial Q1 we had in the prior fiscal year. We exited this quarter with a strong backlog, putting this business in great shape for the year. I remind you that we have a large ramp projected throughout the year in our Infusion sales. We have a lot of work ahead, and we are operating in a very competitive environment. But the early indications show continued year-over-year momentum from Q4 through Q1 and even as we have entered Q2. 
In the last 15 months, we have taken an estimated 49,000 competitive channels and only lost 4,500. So we have momentum, and our year is shaping up as we expect it. I continue to feel comfortable with our projections for share gains, with the variable we don't control being the exact timing of the conversions. 
There's a similar story in Dispensing. The business is performing as we expected, meaning, competitive wins continued to far outpace any competitive losses as we renew existing customers and build a healthy backlog. We won a record number of new contracts through this period, coming off our strongest Q4 in three years for committed contracts. We have good momentum in our core Dispensing business and are increasing the value we provide our customers through strategic partnerships, like the alliance we created with Cerner. In our first quarter of the Cerner relationship, we are already taking orders moving ahead with our co-development plans and seeing progress in our pipeline.
In Medical Technologies and Services, we had some revenue pressure against Q1 of last year due to the sale of our Research Services business and softness in surgical volumes outside the U.S. We also had a strong prior year period in our International Surgical Products business in both sales and in the benefit of foreign currency exchange rates. 
I was very pleased with the continued progress we made in our Infection Prevention business where ChloraPrep, our skin antiseptic product for vascular and surgical procedures, continued to grow substantially despite softness in procedure volumes. ChloraPrep is quickly becoming a standard of care in hospitals across the country, with strong clinical evidence base and a growing number of key opinion leaders advocating its use. We have an active schedule of introductions for the product outside the U.S. beginning in early 2011.
We also continue to make product with the launch of our AVAmax Vertebral Balloon product for kyphoplastic procedures in the U.S. market. We have a modest revenue plan for it in this first year but are encouraged by the market interest and user feedback. Approximately 100 hospitals are now using the product, which we believe to be a positive indicator just three months following our commercial launch. 
Overall, we remain in a good position as we navigate several important initiatives through the year. We continue to make progress against the global restructuring we undertook last quarter to deliver more than $100 million of annual ongoing savings. We remain committed to evaluating strategic options and taking action this year with businesses in our portfolio that do not strategically fit or are dilutive to our operating margins.
We also continue to invest in R&D, in our innovation pipeline, with a focus on growth over the long term. We're increasing our R&D spend approximately 10% in FY '11 to strengthen our core franchises, extend our offerings into adjacent markets and connect our existing devices to increase the value we bring to customers as CareFusion.
As you know  from our separate news release this morning, I also announced my retirement plans today. The decision about the timing to retire is always a personal one. In my case, I've always had a relatively short time period in mind once we completed the spinoff with an experienced leadership team in place and a solid year behind us as a public company. I'm confident that I'll leave CareFusion in an excellent position to continue to grow well into the future. We established a differentiated vision to lower the cost and improve the safety of healthcare for generations to come and have executed against it with an enviable portfolio of industry-leading medical devices and services for our customers worldwide. I'm proud of the company and where it stands in the industry as I anticipate this new phase in my life.
The board started succession planning earlier this year. Given my decision, and the internal and external search for my successor has been initiated, led by our Presiding Director Mike Losh. Mike and the special committee of the board intend to be disciplined and thorough in their approach, with the target date to have a new CEO in place prior to my departure on February 28. 
And before I turn it over to Ed, I want to thank our global employees for the support they've given me and the commitment they continue to demonstrate to our customers and to the growth of CareFusion. We're making progress through a combination of longer-term investments and the shorter-term work we've undertaken to improve our profitability. As I've said before, our portfolio of businesses continues to provide us with a good long-term balance of capital equipment essential for hospitals to deliver patient care, along with procedure-based products. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ed."
49276069,114780090,84308,"CareFusion Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","CareFusion Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will be reviewing our financial results for the first quarter and our full year fiscal 2011 guidance. Before I move to our results for the quarter, I'd like to p",1679,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will be reviewing our financial results for the first quarter and our full year fiscal 2011 guidance. Before I move to our results for the quarter, I'd like to provide some context to these results compared to the guidance we provided in August.
While we do not guide on a quarterly basis, we said that we expected our first quarter earnings to be down year-over-year based on several items that positively impacted our first quarter fiscal 2010 results, which we did not expect to reoccur in the first quarter of fiscal '11. In addition, we said that we expected earnings to be weighted to the second half of the year, with nearly 60% coming in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal '11. 
Today, we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS and revenue guidance ranges for fiscal '11. We continue to expect that our results will be weighted to the second half of the fiscal year, as momentum in several of our businesses builds throughout the year. Additionally, currency rates have improved since we last provided guidance, which benefits our top line. However, notwithstanding the currency benefit, we would be within our guidance ranges for both revenue and adjusted EPS. Please keep these points in mind as I review the financial results for the quarter in more detail.
Our adjusted net income for the quarter was $67 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared to $87 million or $0.39 per diluted share a year ago, resulting from lower revenue, lower gross margins and higher interest expense and a higher tax rate in the current quarter. Excluded from adjusted net income in the first quarter of fiscal '11 are $40 million or $0.13 per diluted share in one-time expenditures related to our company-wide restructuring, spinoff costs from Cardinal Health, as well as merger and integration costs. 
Revenue for the first quarter totaled $908 million, a decrease of 2% on a reported basis and less than 1% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior year period. On a segment basis, revenues in our Critical Care Technologies segment, which includes our Dispensing, Infusion and Respiratory business lines, totaled $617 million for the first quarter of fiscal '11, essentially flat compared to the prior year period. Adjusted segment profit was $100 million, down 11% from the prior year period due to Infusion and Respiratory results in the first quarter of fiscal '10, which benefited from the unusual items I mentioned earlier.
The Critical Care results were driven by a year-over-year increase in Infusion sales for the first quarter of fiscal '11. We continue to expect that our Infusion revenue will grow double digits to the high teens, driven by incremental growth in the infusion market, our acquisition of Medegen in May of 2010 and the opportunity provided by Baxter's required removal of its COLLEAGUE pump installed base, which we continue to expect to occur in the second half of fiscal '11 and to increase as we move into fiscal '12.
The increase in Infusion sales was offset by lower Respiratory sales, which were lower than the prior year and lower than we had anticipated. We expect the dynamics that Dave mentioned in his remarks to impact our Respiratory business throughout the remainder of the year. And as a result, we now expect Respiratory sales to be down mid-single digits compared to fiscal '10. 
Our Dispensing business continues to gain favorable momentum as we continue to add to our revenue base through competitive wins, renewals and our agreement with Cerner, which is adding to our yield pipeline. As David indicated, we won a record number of new contracts in the quarter and are on track to achieve our Dispensing forecast for fiscal '11.
In our Medical Technologies and Services segment, which includes our Infection Prevention and Medical Specialty businesses, first quarter revenues were $291 million, a 5% decrease from the prior year period. Adjusted segment profit was $22 million, flat from the prior year. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by the loss of sales from our Research Services business that was sold in May of 2010 and lower International Surgical Product revenues, which were negatively impacted by currency and a benefit from the sales of surgical masks for H1N1 purposes that occurred in the prior year quarter but was not repeated in the first quarter of fiscal '11. These were partially offset by increased sales from our ChloraPrep skin antiseptic product and our Interventional Specialties businesses.
Looking ahead to the remainder of the fiscal year, we are maintaining our revenue guidance of mid-single-digit growth over fiscal 2010 revenue of $3.9 billion. We expect slightly more than 50% of revenue will come in the second half of the fiscal year. 
In August, we said that changes in foreign currency were expected to have a negative impact on our revenue results. As the U.S. dollar weakened and several European currencies strengthened since we built our fiscal 2011 budget, the impact of currency on our top line has improved, and together with the strength in our other businesses is expected to offset the softness we are seeing in our Respiratory business. 
Our gross margins for the first quarter were 48% compared to 49% in the prior year due to product mix. The prior year quarter included higher gross margins in our Infusion and Dispensing businesses and manufacturing efficiencies as we resumed manufacturing of the Alaris System in the first quarter of fiscal '10. Sequentially from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, gross margins are up as a result of the company-wide restructuring and continued benefits from manufacturing efficiencies. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect our gross margins to be approximately 48%.
Adjusted operating expenses, including SG&A and R&D, totaled $318 million or 35% of total revenue, essentially flat compared to the prior year period. Adjusted SG&A expense of $278 million declined 1% over the prior year period. SG&A included higher spend within the Medical Specialties and Infection Prevention selling organizations to support our AVAmax and ChloraPrep products. The spending was offset by benefits from the August 2010 restructuring, as well as continued cost-saving efforts across all of our business. R&D for the quarter totaled $40 million, up 11% from the prior year.
For the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted operating expenses to total 33% of total revenue due to the restructuring and our continued cost-management efforts. Longer term, we believe that with our continued focus on cost and our ability to execute, we can, over the near and long term, improve our margins by driving efficiencies to improve our cost of goods and continue to decrease our SG&A spend. 
Interest expense and other totaled $24 million for the first quarter of fiscal '11, primarily driven by interest on our $1.4 billion of debt, which carries a yield of maturity interest rate of 5.8%, as well as miscellaneous expenses related to nonoperating items that flowed through this line item. During our first quarter, currency negatively impacted our results by approximately $0.02 per share. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 31.7%, in line with our previous guidance and compares to a rate of 24.3% for the prior year period. The period-over-period increase in the tax rate is primarily driven by a shift in the mix of pretax income to higher tax jurisdictions, in part as a result of the tax changes we made in the third quarter fiscal '10. The significant increase in our tax rate year-over-year negatively impacted our results by approximately $0.03. 
Turning to operating cash flow. For the three months ended September 30, 2010, our operating cash flow used on continuing operations was $7 million. The use of cash during the quarter was expected and was primarily driven by cash payments related to an interest payment on our debt and management and employee incentive plans, both of which were not included in the prior year. 
Capital spending totaled $35 million and depreciation and amortization was $45 million. We continue to estimate CapEx to be $160 million to $180 million for the year. And on September 30, we had approximately $1 billion in cash. We continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $425 million to $475 million for fiscal 2011. As I've said on our August call, our cash flow assumptions for fiscal '11 do not include the potential costs or benefits of any divestitures that we may undertake during the year.
I would also like to provide you with an update on how we are progressing against the goals we established at the time we announced the global restructuring in August of 2010. At that time, we guided to expected savings of $85 million to $95 million in fiscal '11 and for that amount to increase by an additional $25 million in fiscal 2012. In addition, we estimate incurring total pretax nonrecurring expenses of approximately $40 million to $50 million in fiscal '11 related to this restructuring. 
I am pleased to say that as of the end of September, we completed Phase 1 of the restructuring and believe we are on track to achieve our full year savings target. Our savings during the first quarter were on track with our expectations of approximately $90 million and will increase next quarter. During the quarter, we recorded charges of $20 million related to the restructuring.
As I said in my opening remarks, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.58 to $1.68. In my comments, I've walked through the assumptions we've made in arriving at these estimates, including the positive trends in the majority of our businesses. I would also like to reiterate that we expect earnings to be weighted to the second half of fiscal '11, driven in large part by our upcoming opportunities in the Infusion business and the timing of new product launches. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Carol for questions. Thank you."

So it was slightly down. However, not to be confused with the momentum that Dave referred to and what we're seeing relative to the ramp-up of committed contracts. We had a very strong committed contract quarter for Q1, and as Dave said, while we don't have visibility for the entire year and we know our plan was somewhat back-loaded, we are getting better visibility. And we think by Q2 earnings call, we'll have a good indication as to how it's coming together, but nothing would move us away from the overall targets that we've established for picking up volume based on the Baxter opportunity. As far as pricing, I don't think there's a rule of thumb that we're using. As we had indicated earlier, we will be competitive on pricing. We like the model of getting our devices in place because of the continuing and ongoing revenue stream relative to the disposable components. And now with the superiority of our Medegen valve, we believe that's going to just make our disposable components that much stronger as we move forward. So we have factored that in, and the pricing that we've established, as well as what we're seeing to strengthen our Dispensing business, is back to where he gave you assurance early on that we still see 48% gross margins to be on our overall target for the full year."

We're expecting that those will cause a lot of chatter and position us well for going into FY '12. One of the things that we have been very focused on is connectivity and connecting our products into the customers' HIT system. And I had mentioned about a year ago that we had started a project to provide a common network to our customers, so that even though we have a number of products that can be networked, by the end of this year, they will all be able to be networked over a single network that is purchased by the customer, really designed to feed data from those products into the EMR [electronic medical record] of their HIT system. I think we will likely be the first company to be officially able to help our customers meet the Phase III requirement on the HIT stimulus, which actually doesn't roll around until 2015. But I have to tell you, going in and describing what we are capable of doing and where that is going really seems to have a fair amount of pull-through in making those capital equipment decisions. So we have a number of smaller products that are coming out this year, and to sort of put it into perspective, last year, we introduced a total of 27 new products during the 12 months of 2010.

Our business came very close to, on its own, exceeding last quarter or a year ago quarter, which included north of $50 million of ship hold products. And so clearly, momentum is growing in that business. We saw a very strong booking quarter in Q1 in our Infusion business. We are expecting that to grow substantially in the second quarter. And so maybe some folks are having trouble out there, but we're not one of them. And just to help put it into perspective, as orders are booked and contracts are signed, about the fastest you would see the installation take place and customers allow us then, give us the approval so that we can recognize revenue, is about 120 days. So you'll be seeing some of the orders that were booked in Q1 being installed in Q3. And that's why Q2 is such an important indicator for us because those will begin installs and recognizing that revenue late Q3 and Q4 of next year. So we'll pretty much have a wrap on what the Infusion year is going to look like, as we said, by the time of the next earnings call in February because we'll be at a point where everything that will have been committed to by that point in time can be installed by the end of the year, and so I think we'll be able to have a pretty good sense on things. What I can say is that we're seeing a lot more activity amongst this Baxter base than we saw just a few months ago. And interestingly, I think, each of the manufacturers has a completely different view of what's going on in that base. I think ours is pretty positive. And whereas others are going from not positive to, we're pleased with the results. But as you look at the history, when we say we're pleased with the results, we deliver."

Thank you for joining us on today's call as we provide an overview of CareFusion's results for the three months ended September 30, 2010, and provide an update to our guidance for fiscal 2011.
 Our press release was issued this morning at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time and posted on our website at www.carefusion.com, and filed on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also filed and posted several slides to accompany today's webcast, which may be found on the Investor Relations homepage with the earnings materials. While we will not review each slide on today's call, these slides should be used as a reference guide by investors. The slides include comparisons of the results for the three months ended September 30, 2010, to the prior year period, as well as financial outlook for full year fiscal 2011 and definitions of our non-GAAP items and reconciliations to GAAP.
 Joining me on today's call are Dave Schlotterbeck, our CEO; Ed Borkowski, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dwight Winstead, our Chief Operating Officer. Before I turn the call over, I'd like to make a few remarks.
 In today's call, we will be presenting our results on a GAAP and an adjusted basis. Our adjusted results exclude restructuring and acquisition, integration charges, nonrecurring spinoff-related costs, nonrecurring tax items and discontinuing operations. We believe that adjusted financial measures can facilitate a more complete analysis and greater transparency into CareFusion's ongoing results of operations, particularly in comparing underlying results from period to period. Our management team utilizes adjusted financial measures internally in financial planning to monitor business unit performance and in evaluating management performance. We've included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with today's release.
 I would like to remind investors that during today's call, we will be making statements that are essentially forward-looking and consequently are subject to risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include statements regarding our fiscal '11 guidance; our expectations regarding hospital capital spending; expectations related to our restructuring program, including anticipated timing, costs and expected savings; our expectations regarding acquisitions and divestitures and statements regarding business and revenue growth and anticipated foreign fluctuations, as well as any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.
 You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors, and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
 With that, I will turn the call over to Dave.

Let me start by talking about our results in the quarter and then make comments about my planned retirement. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance during the first quarter.

Overall, I'm pleased with our performance during the first quarter. Our earnings were in line with our expectations and highlighted a strong quarter for the Infusion, Dispensing, Infection Prevention and Medical Specialties businesses.
 These businesses all saw continued momentum from the fourth quarter, giving me confidence to reaffirm our revenue and EPS guidance for the year. With an adjusted EPS for Q1 of $0.30, we are on track with the full year guidance we provided in August of $1.58 to $1.68 and 11% to 18% year-over-year increase, as we indicated when we reported our Q4 results. Earnings were projected to decline in the first quarter due to the strong Q1 we had last year, where we shipped an unusually large amount of infusion pumps following a ship hold and had strong Respiratory sales associated with H1N1.
 We continue to expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range we provided in August. We overcame nearly all of the $60 million in benefit we saw in the first quarter of last year from H1N1 and our Alaris System coming off a ship hold. Our Respiratory revenue was lighter than we anticipated. We expect this impact through the remainder of the year will be offset by strength in our other businesses and upside to our budgeted foreign currency rates.
 Let me take a minute to discuss the factors that affected Respiratory sales during the quarter. Coming off a record year due to H1N1, many hospitals had adequate capital equipment to meet their needs. This was complicated by an overall lower census, including the lowest birthrate in 100 years, according to recent CDC data, and a mild start to the flu season. This combination of what we now understand to include forward buying by our customers during the last fiscal year and lower admissions to start this fiscal year led the softness in Respiratory capital sales and associated disposables.
 On the Capital Equipment side of the business, we performed better in the U.S. market but saw a greater shortfall to our revenue expectations outside the U.S. due to a slowdown in the European market and, to a lesser degree, with our distributor in Canada. Our Respiratory business is positioned well, with a competitive product portfolio and a strong pipeline to drive growth over the longer term.
 We saw a continued growth in our Infusion business, surpassing the substantial Q1 we had in the prior fiscal year. We exited this quarter with a strong backlog, putting this business in great shape for the year. I remind you that we have a large ramp projected throughout the year in our Infusion sales. We have a lot of work ahead, and we are operating in a very competitive environment. But the early indications show continued year-over-year momentum from Q4 through Q1 and even as we have entered Q2.
 In the last 15 months, we have taken an estimated 49,000 competitive channels and only lost 4,500. So we have momentum, and our year is shaping up as we expect it. I continue to feel comfortable with our projections for share gains, with the variable we don't control being the exact timing of the conversions.
 There's a similar story in Dispensing. The business is performing as we expected, meaning, competitive wins continued to far outpace any competitive losses as we renew existing customers and build a healthy backlog. We won a record number of new contracts through this period, coming off our strongest Q4 in three years for committed contracts. We have good momentum in our core Dispensing business and are increasing the value we provide our customers through strategic partnerships, like the alliance we created with Cerner. In our first quarter of the Cerner relationship, we are already taking orders moving ahead with our co-development plans and seeing progress in our pipeline.
 In Medical Technologies and Services, we had some revenue pressure against Q1 of last year due to the sale of our Research Services business and softness in surgical volumes outside the U.S. We also had a strong prior year period in our International Surgical Products business in both sales and in the benefit of foreign currency exchange rates.
 I was very pleased with the continued progress we made in our Infection Prevention business where ChloraPrep, our skin antiseptic product for vascular and surgical procedures, continued to grow substantially despite softness in procedure volumes. ChloraPrep is quickly becoming a standard of care in hospitals across the country, with strong clinical evidence base and a growing number of key opinion leaders advocating its use. We have an active schedule of introductions for the product outside the U.S. beginning in early 2011.
 We also continue to make product with the launch of our AVAmax Vertebral Balloon product for kyphoplastic procedures in the U.S. market. We have a modest revenue plan for it in this first year but are encouraged by the market interest and user feedback. Approximately 100 hospitals are now using the product, which we believe to be a positive indicator just three months following our commercial launch.
 Overall, we remain in a good position as we navigate several important initiatives through the year. We continue to make progress against the global restructuring we undertook last quarter to deliver more than $100 million of annual ongoing savings. We remain committed to evaluating strategic options and taking action this year with businesses in our portfolio that do not strategically fit or are dilutive to our operating margins.
 We also continue to invest in R&D, in our innovation pipeline, with a focus on growth over the long term. We're increasing our R&D spend approximately 10% in FY '11 to strengthen our core franchises, extend our offerings into adjacent markets and connect our existing devices to increase the value we bring to customers as CareFusion.
 As you know  from our separate news release this morning, I also announced my retirement plans today. The decision about the timing to retire is always a personal one. In my case, I've always had a relatively short time period in mind once we completed the spinoff with an experienced leadership team in place and a solid year behind us as a public company. I'm confident that I'll leave CareFusion in an excellent position to continue to grow well into the future. We established a differentiated vision to lower the cost and improve the safety of healthcare for generations to come and have executed against it with an enviable portfolio of industry-leading medical devices and services for our customers worldwide. I'm proud of the company and where it stands in the industry as I anticipate this new phase in my life.
 The board started succession planning earlier this year. Given my decision, and the internal and external search for my successor has been initiated, led by our Presiding Director Mike Losh. Mike and the special committee of the board intend to be disciplined and thorough in their approach, with the target date to have a new CEO in place prior to my departure on February 28.
 And before I turn it over to Ed, I want to thank our global employees for the support they've given me and the commitment they continue to demonstrate to our customers and to the growth of CareFusion. We're making progress through a combination of longer-term investments and the shorter-term work we've undertaken to improve our profitability. As I've said before, our portfolio of businesses continues to provide us with a good long-term balance of capital equipment essential for hospitals to deliver patient care, along with procedure-based products.
 Now I'll turn it over to Ed.

49276069,114780090,86593,"CareFusion Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","CareFusion Corporation","Executives"," Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will be reviewing our financial results for the first quarter and our full year fiscal 2011 guidance. Before I move to our results for the quarter, I'd like to",1679," Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will be reviewing our financial results for the first quarter and our full year fiscal 2011 guidance. Before I move to our results for the quarter, I'd like to provide some context to these results compared to the guidance we provided in August.
 While we do not guide on a quarterly basis, we said that we expected our first quarter earnings to be down year-over-year based on several items that positively impacted our first quarter fiscal 2010 results, which we did not expect to reoccur in the first quarter of fiscal '11. In addition, we said that we expected earnings to be weighted to the second half of the year, with nearly 60% coming in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal '11.
 Today, we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS and revenue guidance ranges for fiscal '11. We continue to expect that our results will be weighted to the second half of the fiscal year, as momentum in several of our businesses builds throughout the year. Additionally, currency rates have improved since we last provided guidance, which benefits our top line. However, notwithstanding the currency benefit, we would be within our guidance ranges for both revenue and adjusted EPS. Please keep these points in mind as I review the financial results for the quarter in more detail.
 Our adjusted net income for the quarter was $67 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared to $87 million or $0.39 per diluted share a year ago, resulting from lower revenue, lower gross margins and higher interest expense and a higher tax rate in the current quarter. Excluded from adjusted net income in the first quarter of fiscal '11 are $40 million or $0.13 per diluted share in one-time expenditures related to our company-wide restructuring, spinoff costs from Cardinal Health, as well as merger and integration costs.
 Revenue for the first quarter totaled $908 million, a decrease of 2% on a reported basis and less than 1% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior year period. On a segment basis, revenues in our Critical Care Technologies segment, which includes our Dispensing, Infusion and Respiratory business lines, totaled $617 million for the first quarter of fiscal '11, essentially flat compared to the prior year period. Adjusted segment profit was $100 million, down 11% from the prior year period due to Infusion and Respiratory results in the first quarter of fiscal '10, which benefited from the unusual items I mentioned earlier.
 The Critical Care results were driven by a year-over-year increase in Infusion sales for the first quarter of fiscal '11. We continue to expect that our Infusion revenue will grow double digits to the high teens, driven by incremental growth in the infusion market, our acquisition of Medegen in May of 2010 and the opportunity provided by Baxter's required removal of its COLLEAGUE pump installed base, which we continue to expect to occur in the second half of fiscal '11 and to increase as we move into fiscal '12.
 The increase in Infusion sales was offset by lower Respiratory sales, which were lower than the prior year and lower than we had anticipated. We expect the dynamics that Dave mentioned in his remarks to impact our Respiratory businesses throughout the remainder of the year. And as a result, we now expect Respiratory sales to be down mid-single digits compared to fiscal '10.
 Our Dispensing business continues to gain favorable momentum as we continue to add to our revenue base through competitive wins, renewals and our agreement with Cerner, which is adding to our yield pipeline. As David indicated, we won a record number of new contracts in the quarter and are on track to achieve our Dispensing forecast for fiscal '11.
 In our Medical Technologies and Services segment, which includes our Infection Prevention and Medical Specialty businesses, first quarter revenues were $291 million, a 5% decrease from the prior year period. Adjusted segment profit was $22 million, flat from the prior year. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by the loss of sales from our Research Services business that was sold in May of 2010 and lower International Surgical Products revenues, which were negatively impacted by currency and a benefit from the sales of surgical masks for H1N1 purposes that occurred in the prior year quarter but was not repeated in the first quarter of fiscal '11. These were partially offset by increased sales from our ChloraPrep skin antiseptic product and our Interventional Specialties businesses.
 Looking ahead to the remainder of the fiscal year, we are maintaining our revenue guidance of mid-single-digit growth over fiscal 2010 revenue of $3.9 billion. We expect slightly more than 50% of revenue will come in the second half of the fiscal year.
 In August, we said that changes in foreign currency were expected to have a negative impact on our revenue results. As the U.S. dollar weakened and several European currencies strengthened since we built our fiscal 2011 budget, the impact of currency on our top line has improved, and together with the strength in our other businesses is expected to offset the softness we are seeing in our Respiratory business.
 Our gross margins for the first quarter were 48% compared to 49% in the prior year due to product mix. The prior year quarter included higher gross margins in our Infusion and Dispensing businesses and manufacturing efficiencies as we resumed manufacturing of the Alaris System in the first quarter of fiscal '10. Sequentially from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, gross margins are up as a result of the company-wide restructuring and continued benefits from manufacturing efficiencies. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect our gross margins to be approximately 48%.
 Adjusted operating expenses, including SG&A and R&D, totaled $318 million or 35% of total revenue, essentially flat compared to the prior year period. Adjusted SG&A expense of $278 million declined 1% over the prior year period. SG&A included higher spend within the Medical Specialties and Infection Prevention selling organizations to support our AVAmax and ChloraPrep products. The spending was offset by benefits from the August 2010 restructuring, as well as continued cost-saving efforts across all of our business. R&D for the quarter totaled $40 million, up 11% from the prior year.
 For the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted operating expenses to total 33% of total revenue due to the restructuring and our continued cost-management efforts. Longer term, we believe that with our continued focus on cost and our ability to execute, we can, over the near and long term, improve our margins by driving efficiencies to improve our cost of goods and continue to decrease our SG&A spend.
 Interest expense and other totaled $24 million for the first quarter of fiscal '11, primarily driven by interest on our $1.4 billion of debt, which carries a yield of maturity interest rate of 5.8%, as well as miscellaneous expenses related to nonoperating items that flowed through this line item. During our first quarter, currency negatively impacted our results by approximately $0.02 per share.
 Our adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 31.7%, in line with our previous guidance. and compares to a rate of 24.3% for the prior year period. The period-over-period increase in the tax rate is primarily driven by a shift in the mix of pretax income to higher tax jurisdictions, in part as a result of the tax changes we made in the third quarter fiscal '10. The significant increase in our tax rate year-over-year negatively impacted our results by approximately $0.03.
 Turning to operating cash flow. For the three months ended September 30, 2010, our operating cash flow used on continuing operations was $7 million. The use of cash during the quarter was expected and was primarily driven by cash payments related to an interest payment on our debt and management and employee incentive plans, both of which were not included in the prior year.
 Capital spending totaled $35 million and depreciation and amortization was $45 million. We continue to estimate CapEx to be $160 million to $180 million for the year. And on September 30, we had approximately $1 billion in cash. We continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $425 million to $475 million for fiscal 2011. As I've said on our August call, our cash flow assumptions for fiscal '11 do not include the potential costs or benefits of any divestitures that we may undertake during the year.
 I would also like to provide you with an update on how we are progressing against the goals we established at the time we announced the global restructuring in August of 2010. At that time, we guided to expected savings of $85 million to $95 million in fiscal '11 and for that amount to increase by an additional $25 million in fiscal 2012. In addition, we estimate incurring total pretax nonrecurring expenses of approximately $40 million to $50 million in fiscal '11 related to this restructuring.
 I am pleased to say that as of the end of September,
 we completed Phase I of the restructuring and believe we are on track to achieve our full year savings target. Our savings during the first quarter were on track with our expectations of approximately $90 million and will increase next quarter. During the quarter, we recorded charges of $20 million related to the restructuring.
 As I said in my opening remarks, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.58 to $1.68. In my comments, I've walked through the assumptions we've made in arriving at these estimates, including the positive trends in the majority of our businesses. I would also like to reiterate that we expect earnings to be weighted to the second half of fiscal '11, driven in large part by our upcoming opportunities in the Infusion business and the timing of new product launches.
 At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Carol for questions. Thank you.

What we are seeing and being told by customers is that they are going into the decision-making mode. They know that they've got a finite time period to put some other product in place in their institutions.

And if you add in Medegen to that, you're picking up another two to three points, and so you're nearly at 15%.

And so in terms of capital equipment, we don't anticipate that recovering until our FY '12. We also believe that disposables were stockpiled. When you combine that with the fact that admissions are down, birthrates are down, both of which use ventilation disposables, the stockpiling they did still needs to be burned off before they get back to their normal buying patterns. So bottom line, as we see it, is that we would expect to see continued softness in the Respiratory business through our FY '11, rebounding to more normal purchase patterns in FY '12.

We had a very strong committed contract quarter for Q1, and as Dave said, while we don't have visibility for the entire year and we know our plan was somewhat back-loaded, we are getting better visibility. And we think by Q2 earnings call, we'll have a good indication as to how it's coming together, but nothing would move us away from the overall targets that we've established for picking up volume based on the Baxter opportunity. As far as pricing, I don't think there's a rule of thumb that we're using. As we had indicated earlier, we will be competitive on pricing. We like the model of getting our devices in place because of the continuing and ongoing revenue stream relative to the disposable components. And now with the superiority of our Medegen valve, we believe that's going to just make our disposable components that much stronger as we move forward. So we have factored that in, and the pricing that we've established, as well as what we're seeing to strengthen our Dispensing business, is back to where he gave you assurance early on that we still see 48% gross margins to be on our overall target for the full year.

We're expecting that those will cause a lot of chatter and position us well for going into FY '12. One of the things that we have been very focused on is connectivity and connecting our products into the customers' HIT system. And I had mentioned about a year ago that we had started a project to provide a common network to our customers, so that even though we have a number of products that can be networked, by the end of this year, they will all be able to be networked over a single network that is purchased by the customer, really designed to feed data from those products into the EMR [electronic medical record] of their HIT system. I think we will likely be the first company to be officially able to help our customers meet the Phase III requirement on the HIT stimulus, which actually doesn't roll around until 2015. But I have to tell you, going in and describing what we are capable of doing and where that is going really seems to have a fair amount of pull-through in making those capital equipment decisions. So we have a number of smaller products that are coming out this year, and to sort of put it into perspective, last year, we introduced a total of 27 new products during the 12 months of 2010.

And s",337," Well, Lennox, I think the word that I've heard is frozen, and our business is anything but frozen. Our business came very close to, on its own, exceeding last quarter or a year ago quarter, which included north of $50 million of ship hold products. And so clearly, momentum is growing in that business. We saw a very strong booking quarter in Q1 in our Infusion business. We are expecting that to grow substantially in the second quarter. And so maybe some folks are having trouble out there, but we're not one of them. And just to help put it into perspective, as orders are booked and contracts are signed, about the fastest you would see the installation take place and customers allow us then, give us the approval so that we can recognize revenue, is about 120 days. So you'll be seeing some of the orders that were booked in Q1 being installed in Q3. And that's why Q2 is such an important indicator for us because those will begin installs and recognizing that revenue late Q3 and Q4 of next year. So we'll pretty much have a wrap on what the Infusion year is going to look like, as we said, by the time of the next earnings call in February because we'll be at a point where everything that will have been committed to by that point in time can be installed by the end of the year, and so I think we'll be able to have a pretty good sense on things. What I can say is that we're seeing a lot more activity amongst this Baxter base than we saw just a few months ago. And interestingly, I think, each of the manufacturers has a completely different view of what's going on in that base. I think ours is pretty positive. And whereas others are going from not positive to, we're pleased with the results. But as you look at the history, when we say we're pleased with the results, we deliver.
