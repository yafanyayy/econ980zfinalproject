Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules. If you have not done so I encourage you to visit our Web site, register for e-mail alerts and view our fourth quarter 2009 earnings documents. Our Web site address is www.dom.com/investors.
In addition to the earnings release kit we also have included a slide presentation that will guide this morning’s discussion that can be accessed through our Web site.
And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings release and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management’s projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.
Also on this call we will discuss some measures about our company’s performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Those measures include our first quarter and full year 2010 operating earnings guidance as well as operating earnings before interest and tax, commonly referred to as EBIT. Reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in our earnings release kit.
I will now turn our call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mark McGettrick.

Joining me on the call this morning is our CEO, Tom Farrell and other members of our management team. Tom will update you on regulatory proceedings and other operational and strategic issues following my overview of 2009 financial results and 2010 operating earnings guidance. We will then take your questions.
Tom Farrell will identify the key elements of a proposed settlement agreement which we and others submitted to the State Corporation Commission to resolve Virginia Power's base rate case which is now underway.
So let me begin by pointing out that the 2009 operating and GAAP earnings reflect reserves associated with the impacts outlined in that agreement. With that back drop let me discuss consolidated 2009 results.
2009 was a good year for Dominion. Operating earnings were $3.27 per share falling in the upper half of our annual guidance range and a 3.5% increase over 2008. These results were driven by good performance from our business units as well as lower financing costs and income taxes.
Our operating earnings include a fourth quarter reserve of $50 million after tax or $0.08 per share related to the proposed rate settlement. I will cover these results in more detail in a moment.
Also, late last year we announced a 4.6% increase in our dividend, from annual rate of $1.75 per share to $1.83 per share. The new rate is consistent with our targeted payout ratio of 55%. We produced operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 of $0.63 per share. These operating earnings reflect the $0.08 per share reserve to offset the higher rates implemented September 1st.
We were able to offset the impact with a proposed rate settlement as well as a year-end unplanned outage at Millstone Unit 3 and still deliver operating earnings in the upper half of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Taxes were somewhat lower than our guidance. We anticipate a 36% effective tax rate as well as an estimated 30 million further reduction to our income taxes related to a manufacturing deduction.
GAAP earnings were $0.28 per share for the fourth quarter and $2.46 per share for the full year of 2009. The largest differences between GAAP and operating earnings were the fourth quarter impact of the proposed settlement agreement and the Virginia rate proceedings and the first quarter impairment charge from a ceiling test on our oil and gas properties. A summary of other differences along with the reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on schedules II and III of the earnings release kit.
Now, moving to operating results for our business units. Full-year 2009   EBIT for Dominion Virginia Power and Dominion generation was below our guidance range issued last January. Largely due to mild weather and the impact of the proposed settlement agreement, which calls for no increase in base rates.
Dominion Virginia Power also experienced higher storm restoration costs and Dominion generation experienced lower realized power prices. Weather normalized retail kilowatt hour sales for 2009 were down 1.1% from 2008, but for the fourth quarter were actually up 0.7%. The detailed sales figures are shown on Page #38 of the earnings release kit.
Dominion Energy finished in the upper half of our 2009 EBIT guidance range. Higher than expected transportation as storage revenues as well as lower fuel costs were key contributors to the strong performance.
Operating results for Dominion Energy also include Hope Gas which had previously been excluded from operating earnings. Its inclusion at less than a $0.01 per share impact.
At a consolidated level interest expenses and our effective tax rate were lower than expected. Interest expenses were $118 million below the bottom of our guidance range due to strong internal cash flow, lower interest rates and the benefits of pre-issuance hedges.
While our full year 2009 guidance issued last January assumed a 38% effective tax rate, our actual effective tax rate for the year was about 35%, slightly below the 36% for 2008. We believe a 36% to 37% tax rate is a reasonable going forward assumption for our consolidated results.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. I'm pleased to report that we expect to close the sale of Peoples Gas shortly. As you know we canceled the sale of Hope Gas after the ruling by the West Virginia Public Service Commission. However, we still expect to receive proceeds of $780 million before adjustments for working capital, which is approximately 80% of the combined transaction. The after-tax proceeds from the sale of Peoples Gas will be used to pay down debt. The reduced proceeds will have no impact on our incremental needs for new common equity.
Cash flow from operations was 3.8 billion in 2009 compared to 2.7 billion in 2008. Liquidity was very strong at 3.3 billion at year-end. For statements of cash flow and liquidity please see pages #14 and #39 of the earnings release kit.
The Company’s equity needs in 2010 are relatively modest. As we have stated in the past the equity need for 2010 is approximately $400 million. Early indications from potential purchasers of our Marcellus acreage show a very strong interest in our properties.
Since we expect to begin to monetize the Marcellus acreage this year we expect to reach sufficient after-tax proceeds to offset the need for all 400 million and plan to use market purchases to satisfy our dividend reinvestment in other automatic issuance plans. This improves our ability to achieve our 2010 operating earnings guidance as our original outlook did not include the Marcellus sale and assume the 400 million would be met with new shares.
Our debt needs for the year to cover both maturities and new capital investment are fairly typical. Current plans call for 1.1 billion at Dominion and 850 million at Virginia Power. Recall that all of this planned issuance was hedged early last year when treasury rates were significantly lower than today.
Based on our current value of the hedges we expect to achieve an effective rate which is approximately 80 basis points lower than current market rates. We expect our interest expense to be lower than previously thought in 2010, which also improves our ability to achieve our 2010 guidance.
We are also planning to replace our credit facility some time in the second quarter or third quarter of this year. We have a 1.7 billion facility terminating in August, a 200 million bilateral facility terminating in December and our 2.9 billion core facility terminating in February of next year. For several reasons we will be able to operate with less liquidity than we have maintained in recent years.
First, these facilities back up commercial paper and we intend to manage that program at a materially lower level than in the past. Second, over the last year, we have made significant progress in hedging our gas and electricity output and transactions that do not require margin support and therefore we need less liquidity to support our commodity hedges.
Finally, while improving dramatically over the last two quarters we all know the bank capacity for traditional credit facilities has decreased and pricing has increased. We believe we can operate comfortably with credit facilities totaling $3 billion to $3.5 billion and believe our bank groups will be supportive. We have discussed our plans with the rating agencies and they are comfortable with our approach.
Now to first quarter and full-year 2010 guidance. Dominion expects first quarter 2010 operating earnings in the range of $0.90 to $1 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.98 per share in the first quarter of 2009. Positive factors for the first quarter of 2010 compared to the prior year include higher, wider revenues and the impact of a full quarter’s benefit from the Cove Point expansion.
Factors offsetting these positives include lower merchant generation margins, normal weather and the impact of an unplanned outage at Millstone Unit 3 in January.
We are also affirming our 2010 operating earnings guidance of $3.20 to $3.40 per share. The major drivers include the proposed settlement agreement for the Virginia rate case, our current hedge positions, the lower financing costs and operating expenses.
We will not provide additional detail supporting our 2010 guidance or the outlook for later years until we have received a final decision in the base rate proceeding in Virginia. That may not happen until March or April of this year. Assuming we receive a decision by that time, we will be in a position to provide more information at our analyst meeting which we intend to be scheduled for the morning of May 7, in New York.
One of the drivers of our 2010 guidance that we can update is our sensitivity to changes in commodity prices. We have added to our 2010 hedge positions for Millstone and our New England coal units increasing the coverage of expected output to 90% and 85% respectively. We have now essentially completed our hedging for 2010 and have only minimal exposure to changes in commodity prices.
Our sensitivity to $1 move from natural gas prices in 2010 is now less than $0.05 per share. We also raised our 2011 hedge position for Millstone to 31%. The update of our hedge positions can be found on Pages #32 to #34 of our earnings release kit.
We intend to provide some supplemental disclosure of our operating results beginning with the release of first quarter 2010 earnings. The 10-K format is shown in the slide presentation.
In addition to our disclosure by business unit we will show quarterly EBIT for the legal entity of Virginia Power, which includes generation, transmission and distribution, operations. We’ll also show quarterly EBIT for our regulated gas businesses, merchant generation, unregulated natural gas and Dominion Retail. We intend to discuss this in detail on our next earnings call and we hope this provide some of the information that many of you have requested.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.

Our operational performance met or exceeded expectations at each business unit in 2009. Our nuclear fleet achieved a 93.1% capacity factor for the year, the highest combined level since 2005, the year that the last of our seven units was acquired.
We also had several successful refueling outages in 2009. A station record of 27 days was set at Quani [ph] and a Dominion nuclear fleet record of just under 23 days was achieved at Surry Unit No. 1.
Our fossil and hydro generation fleet operated well. With an overall equivalent forced outage rate of 3.52% and a record best ever of 3.31% for the Virginia Power fleet.
The capacity factor at Fairless Power Station was 64.3% the highest in its six-year history. We continued to implement our company wide infrastructure growth program.
Dominion Generation added 417 net megawatts of new capacity to its fleet last year. In our regulated operations the completion of Ladysmith 5 added 151 megawatts and numerous upgrades and other changes added another 116. In our merchant generation business the Fowler Ridge base one wind project added 150 megawatts of renewable capacity.
At Dominion Virginia Power our efforts and investment to improve system reliability continued to produce positive results. Average minutes out excluding major storms for 2009 declined nearly 9% from the prior year.
Dominion Virginia Power also added over 31,000 new connects. Although this was below the levels of the past few years, it was still a strong showing in a down economy. We exited 2009 with positive trends in both sales and customer growth.
Operations at Dominion Energy’s pipeline and storage business were highlighted by the completion of the Cove Point Expansion Project and the USA Storage Project.
We also began offering interim service at Dominion Hub I in November. Our smaller non-regulated businesses also performed well during the year. Dominion E&P drilled 307 wells in 2009 without a single dry hole including 22 vertical Marcellus wells.
Dominion Retail added 184,000 net new customer accounts during 2009. It also had great success this quarter in the recently opened market in PPLs service area, acquiring an additional 185,000 new customers this month, which is almost 75% of all customers who have switched suppliers.
As I have discussed in previous conference calls the Virginia economy has held up relatively well during the economic downturn. The national unemployment rate remained above 10%. But the rate in Virginia has remained well below the national levels at less than 7%. The unemployment rate in our service area is also below the average for the state.
We are looking for a modestly improving economy in 2010. The strength of our service area supports our infrastructure growth program at Virginia Power. PJM confirmed our state economic strength in its recently published annual forecast of demand growth.
The Dominion zone advanced from the second highest to the highest growth rate among all 19 zones within PJM, covering 13 states and the District of Columbia. PJM projected the ten-year summer peak load to grow at a 2.5 annual rate, up from 2.2% last year. That projection supports the need for over 5600 megawatts of additional generating capacity by 2020. PJM’s projection in 2007 identified only a need of 4,000 megawatts by 2017.
We continue to progress on a regulated growth projects. At year-end the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was 55% complete and Bear Garden Power Station was 48% complete. Both projects remain on schedule and on budget.
Our two major transmission projects, the Meadowbrook-to-Loudoun and Carson-Suffolk line are also on schedule for 2011 in service date. All of these projects totaling over $3 billion in new investment qualify for enhanced rates of return.
Our infrastructure growth program extends to our pipeline and storage business as well. In our market area the arrival of the Rockies Express and the potential development of the Marcellus Shale formation create a significant number of opportunities for new infrastructure investment projects.
One of these is the Appalachian Gateway; the $635 million pipeline project will ensure market access for the participating Appalachian producers by firming up their transportation rights. We prefiled for FERC approval last fall and hope to obtain our certificate early next year.
Also, the gathering enhancement project estimated at an additional $250 million which does not require permits will add critically necessary additional gathering and processing facilities. We expect construction to begin next year and have all of these facilities in service by the fall of 2012.
Other projects we are evaluating include the 300,000 Dth/d from Marcellus Northeast pipeline where we conducted a favorable (inaudible) season in August. And the keystone connector, a potential joint venture with Transco which we transport Rockies and Marcellus Shale Gas across Pennsylvania to the East Coast markets.
We discussed our plans to monetize our 450,000 plus acres in the Marcellus formation over the next two years on our last call. While we have nothing to announce today, as Mark said, the level of interest has been strong. We intend to use the net proceeds for many sale of Marcellus acreage to offset the need to issue new common stock.
Now I want to update you on the progress in our regulatory proceedings. Hearings are underway in the proceeding to set base rates for Virginia Power under the state’s 2007 reregulation statute. On November 5th the company along with the Attorney General’s Office and Consumer Council and several large commercial and industrial customers submitted a proposed settlement agreement.
The agreement provide for no change in base rates from their pre-September 2009 levels and a very significant credit to customers which will offset rate increases for 2010 from our growth projects.
The return on equity would be set at 11.9% for base rates and 12.3% including the statutory generation premium of 100 basis points for the rate riders for the Virginia City and Bear Garden Generating Plants
The Commission has agreed to consider the stipulation while it hears the rest of the evidence in the rate case. Assuming a full hearing of the evidence and a briefing process we would not expect the final decision from the Commission before March or April. Once we receive a final order, we will be in a position to provide further details on our guidance for operating earnings for 2010 and later years.
As Mark mentioned we have tentatively scheduled an analyst meeting for the morning of May 7th in New York. We have also filed this quarter for an increase in base rates for our North Carolina service territory. We expect the decision in that proceeding before the end of the year.
Overall, 2009 was a very good year for Dominion. We delivered higher operating earnings, increased our dividend, made substantial progress in our infrastructure growth program and added significantly to our renewable generation portfolio. We are nearly finished with the base rate case in Virginia. We are optimistic about 2010 and look forward to discussing with you in more detail in the near future. Thank you and we are now ready for your questions.

In addition to that, our taxes did come in better. That would have given us about a 29% tax rate. We came in about 22%. It’s really driven by two main items. One is that the manufacturing deduction that we anticipate at $30 million came in at about $42 million and that there were some state allocation changes that benefited us to the tune of about $23 million. So it drove a lower fourth quarter number, but if you look at it year-over-year our tax rate consolidates about 35% this year and about 36% last year and we think 36% to 37% on a going forward basis is probably accurate.

Joining me on the call this morning is our CEO, Tom Farrell, and other members of our management team. Tom will update you on regulatory proceedings and other operational and strategic issues, following my overview of 2009 financial results and 2010 operating earnings guidance. We will then take your questions. Tom Farrell will identify the key elements of a proposed settlement agreement, which we and others submitted to the State Corporation Commission to resolve Virginia Power's base rate case, which is now underway. So let me begin by pointing out that the 2009 operating and GAAP earnings reflect reserves associated with the impacts outlined in that agreement. With that backdrop, let me discuss consolidated 2009 results. 2009 was a good year for Dominion. Operating earnings were $3.27 per share, falling in the upper half of our annual guidance range, and a 3.5% increase over 2008. These results were driven by good performance from our business units, as well as lower financing costs and income taxes. Our operating earnings include a fourth quarter reserve of $50 million after tax, or $0.08 per share related to the proposed rate settlement. I will cover these results in more detail in a moment.Also, late last year, we announced a 4.6% increase in our dividend from the annual rate of $1.75 per share to $1.83 per share. The new rate is consistent with our targeted payout ratio of 55%. We have produced operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 of $0.63 per share. These operating earnings reflect the $0.08 per share reserve, to offset the higher rates implemented September 1. We were able to offset the impact of the proposed rate settlement, as well as the year end on-plan outage at Millstone Unit 3, and still deliver operating earnings in the upper half of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Taxes were somewhat lower than our guidance. We anticipate a 36% effective tax rate, as well as an estimated $30 million further reduction to our income taxes related to a manufacturing deduction. GAAP earnings were $0.28 per share for the fourth quarter, and $2.46 per share for the full year of 2009. The largest differences between GAAP and operating earnings were the fourth quarter impact of the proposed settlement agreement in the Virginia rate proceedings, and the first quarter impairment charge from a ceiling test on our oil and gas properties. A summary of other differences, along with the reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit. Now moving to operating results for our business units. Full year 2009 EBIT for Dominion Virginia Power and Dominion Generation was below our guidance range issued last January, largely due to milder weather and the impact of the proposed settlement agreement, which calls for no increase in base rates. Dominion Virginia Power also experienced higher storm restoration costs and Dominion Generation experienced lower realized power prices. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales for 2009 were down 1.1% from 2008, but for the fourth quarter, we're actually up 0.7%. The detailed sales figures are shown on Page 38 of the earnings release kit. Dominion Energy finished in the upper half of our 2009 EBIT guidance range. Higher-than-expected transportation and storage revenues, as well as lower fuel costs, were key contributors to the strong performance. Operating result for Dominion Energy also include Hope Gas, which had previously been excluded from operating earnings. Its inclusion had less than a $0.01 per share impact. At the consolidated level, interest expenses in our effective tax rate were lower than expected. Interest expenses were $118 million below the bottom of our guidance range, due to strong internal cash flow, lower interest rates and the benefits of pre-issuance hedges. While our full year 2009 guidance issued last January assumed a 38% effective tax rate, our actual effective tax rate for the year was about 35%, slightly below the 36% for 2008. We believe a 36% to 37% tax rate is a reasonable going-forward assumption for our consolidated results.Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. I am pleased to report that we expect to close the sale of Peoples Gas shortly. As you know, we canceled the sale of Hope Gas after the ruling by the West Virginia Public Service Commission. However, we still expect to receive proceeds of $780 million before adjustments for working capital, which is approximately 80% of the combined transaction. The after-tax proceeds from the sale of Peoples Gas will be used to pay down debt. The reduced proceeds will have no impact on our incremental needs for new common equity. Cash flow from operations was $3.8 billion in 2009, compared to $2.7 billion in 2008. Liquidity was very strong at $3.3 billion at year end. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 39 of the earnings release kit. The company's equity needs in 2010 are relatively modest. As we have stated in the past, the equity need for 2010 is approximately $400 million. Early indications from potential purchasers of our Marcellus acreage show a very strong interest in our properties. Since we expect to begin to monetize the Marcellus acreage this year, we expect to reach sufficient after-tax proceeds to offset the need for all $400 million, and plan to use market purchases to satisfy our dividend and reinvestment and other automatic issuance plans. This improves our ability to achieve our 2010 operating earnings guidance, as our original outlook did not include a Marcellus sale, and assume the $400 million would be met with new shares. Our debt needs for the year to cover both maturities and new capital investment are fairly typical. Current plans call for $1.1 billion at Dominion and $850 million at Virginia Power. Recall that all of this planned issuance was hedged early last year, when treasury rates were significantly lower than today. Based on our current value of the hedges, we expect to achieve an effective rate that is approximately 80 basis points lower than current market rates. We expect our interest expense to be lower than previously thought in 2010, which also improves our ability to achieve our 2010 guidance.We are also planning to replace our credit facility sometime in the second or third quarter of this year. We have a $1.7 billion facility terminating in August, a $200 million bilateral facility terminating in December and our $2.9 billion core facility terminating in February of next year. For several reasons, we will be able to operate with less liquidity than we have maintained in recent years.First, these facilities back up commercial paper, and we intend to manage that program at a materially-lower level than in the past. Second, over last year, we have made significant progress in hedging our gas and electricity output in transactions that do not require margin support. And therefore, we need less liquidity to support our commodity hedges. Finally, while improving dramatically over the last two quarters, we all know the bank capacity for traditional credit facilities has decreased and pricing has increased. We believe we can operate comfortably with credit facilities totaling $3 billion to $3.5 billion, and believe our bank groups will be supportive. We have discussed our plans with the rating agencies and they are comfortable with our approach.Now to first quarter and full year 2010 guidance. Dominion expects first quarter 2010 operating earnings in the range of $0.90 to $1 per share, compared to operating earnings of $0.98 per share in the first quarter of 2009. Positive factors for the first quarter of 2010, compared to the prior year, include higher, wider revenues, and the impact of a full quarter's benefit from the Cove Point expansion. Factors offsetting these positives include lower merchant generation margins, normal weather and the impact of an unplanned outage at Millstone Unit 3 in January. We are also affirming our 2010 operating earnings guidance of $3.20 to $3.40 per share. The major drivers include the proposed settlement agreement for the Virginia rate case, our current hedge positions, the lower financing costs and operating expenses. We will not provide additional details supporting our 2010 guidance or the outlook for later years, until we have received a final decision in the base rate proceeding in Virginia. That may not happen until March or April of this year. Assuming we receive a decision by that time, we will be in a position to provide more information at our analyst meeting, which we intended to be scheduled for the morning of May 7 in New York. One of the drivers of our 2010 guidance that we can update is our sensitivity to changes in commodity prices. We have added to our 2010 hedge positions for Millstone and our New England coal units, increasing the coverage of expected output to 90% and 85% respectively. We have now essentially completed our hedging for 2010, and have only minimal exposure to changes in commodity prices. Our sensitivity to a $1 move from natural gas prices in 2010 is now less than $0.05 per share. We also raised our 2011 hedge position for Millstone to 31%. The update of our hedge positions can be found on Pages 32 to 34 of our earnings release kit.We intend to provide some supplemental disclosure of our operating results, beginning with the release of first quarter 2010 earnings. The tendency of format is shown in the slide presentation. In addition to our disclosure by business unit, we will show quarterly EBIT for the legal entity of Virginia Power, which includes generation, transmission and distribution operations. We will also show quarterly EBIT for our Regulated Gas businesses, merchant generation, unregulated natural gas and Dominion retail. We intend to discuss this in detail on our next earnings call, and we hope this provides some of the information that many of you have requested. I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Our operational performance met or exceeded expectations at each business unit in 2009. Our nuclear fleet achieved a 93.1% capacity factor for the year, the highest of combined level since 2005, the year that the last of our seven units was acquired. We also had several successful refueling outages in 2009. A station record of 27 days was set at Kewaunee and a Dominion nuclear fleet record of just under 23 days was achieved at Surry Unit #1. Our fossil and hydrogeneration fleet operated well with an overall equivalent forced outage rate of 3.52% and a record best ever of 3.31% for the Virginia Power fleet. The capacity factor at our Fairless Power Station was 64.3%, the highest in its six-year history. We continue to implement our companywide infrastructure growth program. Dominion Generation added 417 net megawatts of new capacity to its fleet last year. In our regulated operations the completion of Lady Smith 5 added 151 megawatts and numerous upgrades and other changes added another 116. In our Merchant Generation business, the Fowler Ridge Phase I Wind project added 150 megawatts of renewable capacity. At Dominion Virginia Power, our efforts and investment to improve system reliability continue to produce positive results. Average minutes out, excluding major storms for 2009, declined nearly 9% from the prior year. Dominion Virginia Power also added over 31,000 new connects. Although this was below the levels of the past few years, it was still a strong showing in a down economy. We exited 2009 with positive trends in both sales and customer growth. Operations at Dominion Energy's Pipeline and Storage business were highlighted by the completion of the Cove Point Expansion Project and the USA Storage Project. We also began offering interim services at Dominion Hub I in November. Our Small or Nonregulated business has also performed well during the year. Dominion E&P [Exploration and Production] drilled 307 wells in 2009 without a single dry hole, including 22 vertical Marcellus wells. Dominion Retail added 184,000 net new customer accounts during 2009. It also had great success this quarter in the recently opened market in PPL's service area, acquiring an additional 185,000 new customers this month, which is almost 75% of all customers who have switched suppliers.As I have discussed in previous conference calls, the Virginia economy has held up relatively well during the economic downturn. The national unemployment rate remained above 10%. But the rate in Virginia has remained well below the national levels at less than 7%. The unemployment rate in our service area is also below the average for the state. We are looking for a modestly improving economy in 2010. The strength of our service area supports our infrastructure growth program at Virginia Power. PJM confirmed our state's economic strength in its recently published annual forecast of demand growth. The Dominion's zone advanced from the second highest to the highest growth rate among all 19 zones within PJM, covering 13 states and the District of Columbia. PJM projected the 10-year summer peak load to grow at a 2.5% annual rate up from a 2.2% last year. That projection supports the need for over 5,600 megawatts of additional generating capacity by 2020. PJM's projection in 2007 identified only need of 4,000 megawatts by 2017. We continue to progress on a regulated growth projects. At year-end, the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was 55% complete and the Bear Garden Power Station was 48% complete. Both projects remain on schedule and on budget. Our two major transmission projects, the Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun and Carson to Suffolk lines are also on schedule for 2011 in service date. All of these projects totaling over $3 billion in new investment qualify for enhanced rates of return. Our infrastructure growth program extends to our Pipeline and Storage business as well. In our market area, the arrival of the Rockies Express and the potential development of the Marcellus Shale formation create a significant number of opportunities for new infrastructure investment project. One of these is the Appalachian Gateway. The $635 million pipeline project will ensure market access for the participating Appalachian producers by firming up their transportation rates. We prefiled for FERC approval last fall and hope to obtain our certificate early next year. Also the Gathering Enhancement Project estimated an additional $250 million, and which does not require work permits. We'll add critically necessary additional gathering and processing facilities. We expect construction to begin next year and have all of these facilities in service by the fall of 2012. Other projects we're evaluating include the 300,000 dth/d from Marcellus Northeast pipeline where we conducted a favorable open season in August. And the Keystone Connector, a potential joint venture with Transco, which would transport Rockies and Marcellus Shale gas across Pennsylvania to the East Coast markets.We discussed our plans to monetize our 450,000 plus acres in the Marcellus formation over the next two years on our last call. While we have nothing to announce today, as Mark said, the level of interest has been strong. We intend to use the net proceeds from any sale of Marcellus acreage to offset the need to issue new common stock. And now I want to update you on the progress in our regulatory proceedings. Hearings are under way in the proceeding, the said base rates for Virginia Power under the State's 2007 reregulation statute. On November 5, the company, along with Attorney General's Office of Consumer Council and several large commercial and industrial customers submitted a proposed settlement agreement. The agreement provide for no change in base rates from the pre-September 2009 levels at a very significant credit to customers, which will offset rate increases for 2010 from our growth projects. The return on equity would be set at 11.9% for base rates and a 12.3% including the statutory generation premium of 100 basis points for the rate riders for the Virginia City and Bear Garden's generating plants. The commission has agreed to consider this stipulation, while it hears the rest of the evidence in the rate case. Assuming a full hearing of the evidence and the briefing process, we would not expect the final decision from the commission before March or April. Once we receive a final order, we will be in the position to provide further details on our guidance for operating earnings for 2010 and later years. As Mark mentioned, we have tentatively scheduled an Analyst Meeting for the morning of May 7 in New York. We will also file this quarter for increase in base rates for our North Carolina service territory. We expect the decision in that proceeding before the end of the year. Overall, 2009 was a very good year for Dominion. We delivered higher operating earnings, increased our dividend, made substantial progress in our infrastructure growth program and added significantly to our renewable generation portfolio. We are nearly finished with the base rate case in Virginia. We are optimistic about 2010 and look forward to discussing with you in more detail in the near future. Thank you, and we are now ready to for your questions."

In addition to that, our taxes did come in better, that would've given us about a 29% tax rate. We came in at about 22%. It's really driven by two main items. One is that the manufacturing deduction that we anticipate at $30 million came in at about $42 million, and that there were some state allocation issues, the issues is not be the right word but changes that benefited us to the tune of about $23 million. So it's really a lower fourth quarter number. But if you look at it year-over-year, our tax rate consolidates about 35% this year.

Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules. If you have not done so, I encourage you to visit our website, register for email alerts and view our first quarter 2010 earnings documents. Our website address is www.dom.com/investors.</TAG>

In addition to the earnings release kit, we have also included a slide presentation that will guide this morning's discussions that can be accessed through our website. And now, for the usual cautionary language.</TAG>

The earnings release and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including the most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.</TAG>

Also on this call, we will discuss some measures about our Company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Those measures include our second quarter and full year 2010 operating earnings guidance as well as operating earnings before interest and tax, commonly referred to as EBIT. Reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in our earnings release kit.</TAG>

Joining me on the call this morning is our CEO, Tom Farrell and other members of our management team. As most of you know, we will be hosting a meeting for investors and analysts next Friday, May 7th in New York where we will lay out our financial and strategic plans. If you plan to attend, please go to our website and register.</TAG>

On today's call, I will limit my remarks to results for the first quarter and our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2010. Tom will briefly update you on regulatory proceedings and other operational activities. We will then take your questions.</TAG>

Our operating earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $0.96 per share, which was above the midpoint of our guidance range. Earnings from our operating segments were solidly within our range and were also helped by lower interest expenses. When comparing these results to the first quarter of 2009, our operating earnings were $0.02 per share lower than last year. This change was driven by lower merchant generation margins, largely due to lower commodity prices.</TAG>

GAAP earnings were $0.29 per share for the first quarter. The major differences between GAAP and operating earnings were charges related to our workforce reduction programs, a charge related to the new health care reform law and book loss on our sale of Peoples Gas.</TAG>

A summary and reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit.</TAG>

Now, moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, first quarter operating earnings were flat compared to the first quarter of last year. Modestly favorable weather and higher revenues from rate riders were offset by storm restoration cost and slightly lower earnings from Dominion Retail.</TAG>

Results for Dominion Energy in the first quarter were also little changed from the prior period. Dominion Energy's earnings were down due to a lower contribution from Producer Services, which had a very strong first quarter last year, as well as a roll-off of gas and oil production volumes associated with the VPP royalty interest that expired in February 2009. Offsetting the decline were revenues from the Cove Point expansion, which went into service in March 2009.</TAG>

First quarter operating earnings at Dominion Generation were down relative to the first quarter of 2009. Modestly favorable weather and higher rider-related revenues were more than offset by lower margins from our merchant fleet due to commodity prices and an unplanned outage at Millstone in January.</TAG>

In addition to our traditional presentation of operating results from our three business units, we have prepared a number of supplemental schedules in alternative format that can be found on our website following the conclusion of our earnings call. These supplemental schedules show quarterly EBIT for the legal entity Virginia Power, which includes utility generation, electric transmission and distribution operations, as well as quarterly EBIT for our regulated gas businesses, merchant generation and Dominion Retail. We hope this provides some of the supplemental information many of you have requested.</TAG>

Moving to cash flow and treasury activities, on February 1 we closed the sale of Peoples Gas. Net proceeds of $542 million were used to pay down debt. Also, as most of you know, on March 15 we announced the sale of our Appalachian E&P operations to CONSOL for $3.475 billion. We expect to close this sale tomorrow.</TAG>

We plan to use the net proceeds from the sale to offset the impact of the rate case settlement, offset our need to issue equity over the next two years, repurchase shares and fund a contribution to our employee pension plans. We will provide the details of our expected use of proceeds on May 7.</TAG>

However, we have begun to repurchase some of our common shares to offset the absence of earnings from our E&P business, and as of yesterday, have purchased 10.8 million shares. We'll talk more about additional share repurchase activity on May 7. The sale of our E&P business supports our 2010 earnings range and is also accretive in 2011 and beyond.</TAG>

Funds from operations were $878 million in the first quarter compared to $715 million in the first quarter of 2009. Because of the continued strong cash flow, we had no need for our previously planned debt issue. And interest rate hedge related to that planned issue was monetized, reducing total financing costs for the quarter.</TAG>

Liquidity was also very strong at $4.4 billion on March 31. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 16 and 36 of the earnings release kit. Also, as we previously outlined, we will be replacing our credit facilities later this year and expect to operate with $3 million to $3.5 billion in credit support.</TAG>

Now to second quarter and full year 2010 guidance. Dominion expects second quarter 2010 operating earnings in the range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.68 per share in the second quarter of 2009.</TAG>

Positive factors for the second quarter of 2010 compared to the prior year include higher rider revenues, the benefit of recent staff reductions, other O&M expense reductions and a reduced share count. Factors offsetting these positives include lower merchant generation margins, a planned refueling outage at Millstone and the lack of earnings from our E&P business beginning on May 1.</TAG>

The main driver to focus on when comparing the second quarter 2010 to the second quarter of 2009 is the seasonal refueling outage at Millstone. This single item is expected to reduce quarter-on-quarter operating earnings by approximately $0.09 per share. On a year-over-year basis, this is only a timing issue, since we will have no Millstone refueling outages this fall as we did in 2009.</TAG>

GAAP earnings for the second quarter of 2009 were $454 million or $0.76 per share. You should expect second quarter 2010 GAAP earnings to be significantly higher than last year due to the closing of our E&P sale.</TAG>

We are affirming our 2010 operating earnings guidance of $3.20 to $3.40 per share today. Despite the decline in power prices over the past few months, we remain confident in our ability to deliver earnings within the range due to our merchant fleet being almost completely hedged as well as a number of other positive factors. These include a larger than expected number of employees electing to accept a Voluntary Separation Plan offer, additional O&M expense savings and lower financing costs due to strong cash flow. Again, please note that we have no Millstone refueling outage this fall. We plan to discuss the details supporting our 2010 and 2011 guidance and publish our earnings guidance kit on May 7.</TAG>

One driver of our earnings guidance that we can update is our sensitivity to changes in commodity prices. As we mentioned on the last call, we have completed our hedging program for 2010, but continue to see some pressure from lower commodity prices and compressed [torch] spreads on our open positions.</TAG>

Our sensitivity to a $5 change in New England power prices for the remainder of 2010 is less than $0.02 per share. We have added to our 2011 hedge positions for Millstone in our New England coal units increasing the coverage of expected output to 40% and 30% respectively. The update of our hedge positions can be found on page 33 of our earnings release kit.</TAG>

Before turning the call over to Tom Farrell, let me outline the topics for our Analyst Meeting next week. Tom will discuss Dominion's strategic repositioning over the last four years and the steps we plan to take over the next few years. He will also cover our dividend policy and other investment considerations.</TAG>

I will be providing the detailed financial outlook and our consolidated earnings drivers, including our O&M expense management, our CapEx plans and our financing plan. I will discuss the details behind our operating earnings guidance for 2010, our outlook for 2011 and expectations for normalized longer term growth.</TAG>

Once again, I encourage you to go our website and register if you plan to attend.</TAG>

I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.</TAG>

Our operating and safety performance continued to be excellent during the first quarter. Our nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor of 98% and our regulated fossil and Hydro utility fleet had an equivalent availability rate of 90%.</TAG>

Our merchant fossil and hydro fleet achieved an equivalent availability of nearly 94%, its best first quarter since 2006. We also continued to improve the reliability of our Electric Transmission and Distribution Systems. We were recently ranked number one among our southeast peers in transmission system reliability. Our Pipeline business was ranked number one in customer value and customer satisfaction among its pipeline peers in the Northeast in a recent customer survey.</TAG>

We continue to make good progress on our regulated growth projects. At the end of the first quarter, the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was 61% complete and the Bear Garden Power Station was 57% complete. Both of these projects remain on schedule and on budget.</TAG>

Our two major Electric Transmission projects are also on schedule to be fully in service in 2011. All of these major projects totaling over $3 billion in new investment are earning enhanced rates of return.</TAG>

Dominion Energy placed its Rural Valley Gas Transmission Project into service on April 1. Construction of the Pier Expansion at Cove Point started on March 15.</TAG>

Last week we announced the Marcellus 404 project. This project which we target to be in service by 2012 is designed to provide firm uninterruptible transportation as well gathering and processing services for up to 300 million cubic feet a day. We will discuss this effort and our broader infrastructure growth program in greater detail at next week's Analyst Meeting.</TAG>

Now, a few minutes on the progress in our regulatory proceedings. On March 11, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved the settlement agreement that had been breached by all parties in our base rate case. The authorized return on equity for base rates was set at 11.9%, creating an earnings band for the 2011 biannual review earnings test of 11.4% to 12.4%. The agreement also set the ROE at 12.3%, the rate riders for our Virginia City and Bear Garden generation projects.</TAG>

The State Corporation Commission also issued a ruling on our Demand Side Management filing, approving five programs proposed by the company. Riders to recover the $28.1 million annual revenue requirement from the approved programs will be effective on May 1.</TAG>

During the first quarter we also filed for a $46 million increase in base rate and fuel revenues for our North Carolina service territory. We expect a decision in that proceeding before the end of the year.</TAG>

Overall, we are pleased with the results of the first quarter. Despite a soft economy and lower commodity prices, we were able to deliver operating earnings above the midpoint of our guidance range. We look forward to discussing our plans for the next few years with you at next week's meeting.</TAG>

Thank you. And we are now ready for your questions.</TAG>

On the corporate items, the tax rate that we've quoted last year to assume in the guidance for 2010 was 37%. 
That was the tax rate that showed up in corporate this quarter and you should assume about a 37% tax rate for the reminder of the year. The other item in corporate that we referenced was taking advantage of an interest rate hedge that we had on a debt issue that based on the cash flow that we currently have that we did not need to issue and we took that into income in the quarter. It is uncertain whether there will be additional hedges released to income in the remainder of the year and that will depend on what our cash position is as we move throughout the year. 
If you recall, though, in the spring of 2009, we hedged all of our anticipated debt issuances for not only 2009 and 2010. So we will see what our position is as we go out throughout the year and we'll determine whether we need to issue the debt or whether we will take advantage of the [inter-money] hedges that currently exist.</TAG>

The earnings release and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings including the most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.
Also, on this call we will discuss some measures about our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Those measures include our second quarter and full year 2010 operating earnings guidance, as well as operating earnings before interest and tax commonly referred to as EBIT. Reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in our earnings release kit.

Joining me on the call this morning is our CEO, Tom Farrell and other members of our management team.

Joining me on the call this morning is our CEO, Tom Farrell and other members of our management team. As most of you know, we will be hosting a meeting for investors and analysts next Friday, May 7, in New York, where we will lay out our financial and strategic plans. If you plan to attend, please go to our website and register. 
On today's call, I will limit my remarks to the results for the first quarter and our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2010. Tom will briefly update you on regulatory proceedings and other operational activities. We will then take your questions.
Our operating earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $0.96 per share, which was above the mid-point of our guidance range. Earnings from our operating segments were solidly within our range and were also helped by lower interest expenses. When comparing these results to the first quarter of 2009, our operating earnings were $0.02 per share lower than last year. This change was driven by lower merchant generation margins largely due to lower commodity prices.
GAAP earnings were $0.29 per share for the first quarter. The major differences between GAAP and operating earnings were charges related to our workforce reduction programs, a charge related to the new healthcare reform law and a book loss on our sale of Peoples Gas [Peoples Natural Gas Company]. A summary and reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, first quarter operating earnings were flat compared to the first quarter of last year. Modestly favorable weather and higher revenues from rate riders were offset by storm restoration costs and slightly lower earnings from Dominion Retail. 
Results for Dominion Energy in the first quarter were also a little changed from the prior period. Dominion Energy's earnings were down due to a lower contribution from producer services, which had a very strong first quarter last year, as well as a roll-off of gas and oil production volumes associated with the VPP [volumetric production payment] royalty interest that expired in February 2009. Offsetting the decline were revenues from the Cove Point expansion, which went into service in March 2009. 
First quarter operating earnings at Dominion Generation were down relative to the first quarter of 2009. Modestly favorable weather and higher rider-related revenues were more than offset by lower margins from our merchant fleet due to commodity prices and an unplanned outage at Millstone in January. 
In addition to our traditional presentation of operating results from our three business units, we have prepared a number of supplemental schedules in alternative format that can be found on our website following the conclusion of our earnings call. These supplemental schedules show quarterly EBIT for the legal entity Virginia Power, which includes utility generation, electric transmission and distribution operations, as well as quarterly EBIT for our regulated gas businesses, merchant generation and Dominion Retail. We hope this provides some of the supplemental information many of you have requested.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. On February 1, we closed the sale of Peoples Gas. Net proceeds of $542 million were used to pay down debt. Also, as most of you know, on March 15 we announced the sale of our Appalachian E&P operations to CONSOL for $3.475 billion. We expect to close the sale tomorrow. 
We plan to use the net proceeds from the sale to offset the impact of the rate case settlement, offset our need to issue equity over the next two years, repurchase shares and fund a contribution to our employee pension plans. We will provide the details of our expected use of proceeds on May 7. However, we have begun to repurchase some of our common shares to offset the absence of earnings from our E&P business and as of yesterday, have purchased 10.8 million shares. We'll talk more about additional share repurchase activity on May 7. The sale of our E&P business supports our 2010 earnings range, and is also accretive in 2011 and beyond. 
Funds from operations were $878 million in the first quarter, compared to $715 million in the first quarter of 2009. Because of the continued strong cash flow, we had no need for a previously planned debt issue. An interest rate hedge related to that planned issue was monetized, reducing total financing costs for the quarter.
Liquidity was also very strong at $4.4 billion on March 31. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 16 and 36 of the earnings release kit. Also, as we previously outlined, we will be replacing our credit facilities later this year and expect to operate with $3 billion to $3.5 billion in credit support.
Now to second quarter and full year 2010 guidance. Dominion expects second quarter 2010 operating earnings in the range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share, compared to operating earnings of $0.68 per share in the second quarter of 2009. Positive factors for the second quarter of 2010 compared to the prior year include higher rider revenues, the benefit of recent staff reductions, other O&M expense reductions and a reduced share count. Factors offsetting these positives include lower merchant generation margins, a planned refueling outage at Millstone and the lack of our earnings from our E&P business beginning on May 1.
The main driver to focus on when comparing the second quarter 2010 to the second quarter of 2009 is the seasonal refueling outage at Millstone. This single item is expected to reduce quarter-on-quarter operating earnings by approximately $0.09 per share. On a year-over-year basis, this is only a timing issue since we will have no Millstone refueling outages this fall as we did in 2009. 
GAAP earnings for the second quarter of 2009 were $454 million or $0.76 per share. You should expect second quarter 2010 GAAP earnings to be significantly higher than last year due to the closing of our E&P sale. 
We are affirming our 2010 operating earnings guidance of $3.20 to $3.40 per share today. Despite the decline in power prices over the past few months, we remain confident in our ability to deliver earnings within the range due to our merchant fleet being almost completely hedged, as well as a number of other positive factors. These include a larger-than-expected number of employees electing to accept our voluntary separation plan offer, additional O&M expense savings and lower financing cost due to strong cash flow. Again, please note that we have no Millstone refueling outage this fall. We plan to discuss the details supporting our 2010 and 2011 guidance and publish our earnings guidance kit on May 7. 
One driver of our earnings guidance that we can update is our sensitivity to changes in commodity prices. As we mentioned on the last, we have completed our hedging program for 2010, but continue to see some pressure from lower commodity prices and compressed start spreads on our open positions. Our sensitivity to a $5 change in New England power prices for the remainder of 2010 is less than $0.02 per share. We have added to our 2011 hedge positions for Millstone and our New England coal units increasing the coverage of expected output to 40% and 30%, respectively. The update of our hedge positions can be found on Page 33 of our earnings release kit.
Before turning the call over to Tom Farrell, let me outline the topics for our analyst meeting next week. Tom will discuss Dominion's strategic repositioning over the last four years and the steps we plan to take over the next few years. He will also cover our dividend policy and other investment considerations. 
I will be providing the detailed financial outlook and our consolidated earnings drivers, including our O&M expense management, our CapEx plans and our financing plan. I will discuss the details behind our operating earnings guidance for 2010, our outlook for 2011 and expectations for normalized longer-term growth. 
Once again, I encourage you to go to our website and register if you plan to attend. I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Our operating and safety performance continued to be excellent during the first quarter. Our nuclear fleet achieved the capacity factor of 98% and our regulated fossil and hydro utility fleet had an equivalent availability rate of 90%. Our merchant fossil and hydro fleet achieved an equivalent availability of nearly 94%, its best first quarter since 2006.
We also continued to improve the reliability of our electric transmission and distribution systems. We were recently ranked number one among our Southeast peers in transmission system reliability. Our pipeline business was ranked number one in customer value and customer satisfaction among its pipeline peers in the Northeast in a recent customer survey. 
We continue to make good progress on our regulated growth projects. At the end of the first quarter, the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was 61% complete, and the Bear Garden Power Station was 57% complete. Both of these projects remain on schedule and on budget.
Our two major electric transmission projects are also on schedule to be fully in service in 2011. All of these major projects totaling over $3 billion in new investment are earning enhanced rates of return. Dominion Energy placed its Rural Valley gas transmission project into service on April 1.  Construction of the pier expansion at Cove Point started on March 15. 
Last week, we announced the Marcellus 404 Project. This project, which we target to be in service by 2012, is designed to provide firm and interruptible transportation as well as gathering and processing services for up to 300 million cubic feet a day. We will discuss this effort and our broader infrastructure growth program in greater detail at next week's analyst meeting.
Now a few minutes on the progress in our regulatory proceedings. On March 11, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved the settlement agreement that had been breached by all parties in our base rate case. The authorized return on equity for base rates was set at 11.9%, creating an earnings band for the 2011 biannual review earnings test of 11.4% to 12.4%. The agreement also set the ROE at 12.3%, the rate riders for our Virginia City and Bear Garden generation projects.
The State Corporation Commission also issued a ruling on our Demand Side Management filing approving five programs proposed by the company. Riders to recover the $28.1 million annual revenue requirement from the approved programs will be effective on May 1. During the first quarter, we also filed for a $46 million increase in base rate and fuel revenues for our North Carolina service territory. We expect a decision in that proceeding before the end of the year.
Overall, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter. Despite a soft economy and lower commodity prices, we were able to deliver operating earnings above the mid-point of our guidance range. We look forward to discussing our plans for the next few years with you at next week's meeting. Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

On the merchant margins, that will depend on what the outage schedules are quarter-over-quarter. But in general, you should expect that our merchant margins will continue to be down quarter-over-quarter compared to the previous period. It will be tweaked by the number of nuclear fossil outage that we have. On the Corporate items, the tax rate that we quoted last year to assume and the guidance for 2010 was 37%. That was the tax rate that showed up in Corporate this quarter, and you should assume about a 37% tax rate for the remainder of the year. The other item in Corporate that we referenced was taking advantage of an interest rate hedge that we had on a debt issue that based on the cash flow that we currently have that we did not need to issue, and we took that into income in the quarter. It is uncertain whether there will be additional hedges released to income the remainder of the year and that will depend on what our cash position is as we move throughout the year. If you recall though, in the spring of 2009, we hedged all of our anticipated debt issuances for not only 2009 and 2010. So we will see what our position is as we go out throughout the year, and we'll determine whether we need to issue the debt or whether we will take advantage of the indoor [ph] (22:29) money hedges that currently exist."

Joining me on the call this morning is our CEO, Tom Farrell, and the other members of our management team. 
On today's call, I will discuss the earnings results for the second quarter, our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2010 and our financing plans for the remainder of the year. Tom will briefly update you on regulatory proceedings and other operational activities. We will then take your questions.
Dominion had a very strong second quarter. Our operating earnings were $0.72 per share, which was above the top of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Warmer-than-normal weather was the principal positive factor relative to our guidance, adding $0.06 per share. Another factor relative to guidance was lower interest expense. I'll discuss our financing plans in a minute, but because we anticipate not needing all of the long-term debt we have previously planned to issue, the interest rate hedges related to some of those planned issues were closed this quarter.
The associated impact had the effect of lowering our interest expense for the quarter which, increased our operating earnings by $0.03 per share. Excluding these two items, operating earnings for the quarter were still about $0.63 per share at the upper end of our guidance range. Lower interest costs and lower operation and maintenance expenses, which are two principal drivers of our 2010 earnings, came in even better than expected.
When comparing our results to the second quarter of 2009, our operating earnings were $0.04 per share higher than last year. Higher revenues from rate adjustment clauses, favorable weather, lower interest expense and lower outage costs offset reduced merchant generation margins, the absence of earnings from our Appalachian E&P business and a lower contribution from Producer Services.
GAAP earnings were $2.98 per share for the second quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was a $1.4 billion after-tax gain on the sale of our Appalachian E&P operations. We also took a $95 million charge after-tax to impair our State Line power station, triggered by the EPA's new one-hour SO2 rule that was finalized during the quarter. A summary and reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to the results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, second quarter EBIT were $219 million, well above the $188 million $208 million range included in our guidance. Favorable weather was the principal factor behind the improvement.
EBIT for Dominion Energy in the second quarter was $164 million, which was at the midpoint of our guidance range. Higher revenues from our Transmission and Distribution businesses were offset by lower contribution from Producer Services.
Second quarter EBIT from Dominion Generation was $483 million, which was well above the second quarter guidance range of $390 million to $435 million. Favorable weather and lower interest expenses in O&M help offset lower merchant generation margins. We are very pleased with these operating segment results.
In addition to our traditional presentation of operating results from our three business units, we have prepared a number of supplemental schedules in the alternative breakdown structure format that can be found on our website, following the conclusion of our earnings call. These supplemental schedules show quarterly EBIT for the legal entity Virginia Power, which includes Utility Generation, Electric Transmission and Distribution operations, as well as quarterly EBIT for our Regulated Gas businesses, Merchant Generation and Dominion Retail.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. We closed the sale of our Appalachian E&P business to CONSOL Energy on April 30. Net proceeds of $2.2 billion are being used, among other things, to offset our equity financing needs, reduce debt and repurchase shares. At our May 7 Investor and Analyst Meeting, we outlined our specific plans for the proceeds, including $910 million for share repurchases. As of that date, we had purchased 12.2 million shares at a cost of approximately $500 million. We have not repurchased any shares since May 7. However, we intend to be in the market periodically through the remainder of the year to complete our share repurchase program.
Our cash flow has been very strong this year, and as a result, we have almost no outstanding commercial paper and overall amount of floating rate debt is well below our target levels. Because of this, we have modified our financing plans for the remainder of the year, and we will not be moving forward with the number of previously planned debt issues and will increase our use of short-term debt. We now intend to issue term debt of approximately $300 million at Virginia Power and $500 million at the parent company later this year. Liquidity was very strong at $5 billion on June 30. 
For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 16 and 43 of the earnings release kit. 
Also, we are in the midst of replacing our existing credit facilities with two facilities totaling $3.5 billion. We're in the process of receiving commitments to support our credit needs and expect to close the facilities by the end of the third quarter. Bank interest in these two facilities has been very strong.
Now to third quarter and full year 2010 guidance. Dominion expects third quarter 2010 operating earnings in a range of $0.99 to $1.04 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.99 per share in the third quarter of 2009. Positive factors for the third quarter of 2010 compared to the prior year include higher rider revenues and normal weather for the rest of the quarter. 
Recall that weather in the third quarter of 2009 included the mildest July on record, impacting earnings by about $0.05 per share. Up to now, weather for July has been above normal. Factors offsetting these positives include lower merchant generation margins and the absence of earnings from our E&P business.
We are increasing our 2010 operating earnings guidance range to $3.25 to $3.40 per share from $3.20 to $3.40 per share. This change reflects the strong results for the first half of the year, the warm weather in July and assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. Our guidance for 2011 remains $3.10 to $3.40 per share.
GAAP earnings for the full year of 2010 are currently estimated to be about $900 million higher than our projected operating earnings, reflecting the net benefit of recent divestitures and charges related to the workforce reduction plan, the impairment of our State Line plant and the elimination of certain tax deductions associated with the new health care law.
As to hedging, we've added to our hedge positions for Millstone, increasing coverage of expected output to 50% for 2011 and 20% for 2012. We also increased our hedge position at State Line to 60% for 2011. Our sensitivity in 2011 to a $5 change in New England Power prices is currently about $0.07 per share. The update of our hedge positions can be found on Page 33 of our earnings release kit.
Before turning the call over to Tom Farrell, I want to discuss the impact of the recently enacted financial reform legislation on Dominion. The legislation itself was over 2,300 pages long, calls for several hundred new rule-making actions on the part of various federal agencies. The largest potential impact to Dominion would be related to the use of derivatives to hedge our purchase and sale of various energy-related commodities. 
It is our understanding that as an end user, we would not be classified as a swap dealer and would not be required to clear all of our transactions through an exchange and be subject to increased requirements for collateral. The House incentive leaders behind the legislation have made their intentions clear to supplemental correspondents. They do not intend for end users, such as Dominion, to be subject to these additional requirements. We are actively monitoring the implementation of the new legislation and will provide any updates of changes to our assessment. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Our operating and safety performance continue to be excellent during the second quarter. Dominion now ranks number one in total safety performance among the 18 companies in the Southeastern Electric Exchange. This is an improvement from our low second quartile performance just three years ago. 
Our nuclear fleet achieved the capacity factor of 97%, excluding refueling outages, and our regulated fossil and hydro utility fleet had a peak season equivalent availability rate of 96%. We also continue to improve the reliability of our electric transmission and distribution systems. 
Our Pipeline business was ranked number one in customer value and customer satisfaction among its pipeline peers in the Northeast in a recent customer survey. We continue to make good progress on our regulated growth projects.
During the second quarter, we completed a 75-megawatt uprate at our North Anna Nuclear Power Station. At the end of the second quarter, the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was 66% complete. The project is proceeding according to plan, with approximately 1,800 workers on site. Earlier this month, the 400-ton electric generator stator was delivered to the construction site, marking a major milestone in the construction of the 585-megawatt power station, which is scheduled for commercial operation in 2012.
The Bear Garden combined-cycle plant was 70% complete at the end of the second quarter. Construction continues per plant with about 650 workers on site. All major equipment has been delivered. Assembly of the gas and steam turbines and installation of the piping and electrical systems continues on schedule. Transmission line is complete and the switchyard work is in progress. The 580-megawatt combined-cycle plant is scheduled for commercial operation in mid-2011.
Next major addition to our Virginia Power generating fleet is expected to be the Warren County project, a three-on-one combined-cycle facility with a projected capacity in excess of 1,000 megawatts to be located in Northern Virginia. Dominion held its required air permit informational briefing on May 11, with the objective of obtaining the air permit by the end of the year. 
Proposals for the combustion turbines and the steam turbine were received last month. Last week, we received zoning approval from the County Board of Supervisors. We expect to file for approval of this plant with the Virginia State Corporation Commission early next year. 
With respect to North Anna, last month,, we submitted an amended combined operating license incorporating the Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor design for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries as the selected technology. Later this fall, the NRC is expected to post its new schedule for our amended COL, which we now expect to be issued in 2013. 
As we discussed at our May 7 Analyst Meeting, Dominion's options for the project include constructing it now with a partner or constructing it at a later date, either by ourselves or with a partner. We are continuing work with Mitsubishi on licensing and project development as we pursue potential partners.
Our two major electric transmission projects are also on schedule to be fully in service in 2011. Two phases of the 500 kV Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun line are complete and in operation, while work on the final phase is well underway. Work on the 500 kV Carson-to-Suffolk line is also about 30% complete. Several other transmission projects are in various stages of completion. We also have a healthy backlog of transmission projects and anticipate investing over $500 million per year for the foreseeable future.
Dominion Energy also made considerable progress in its infrastructure growth program. Dominion's Natural Gas Pipeline and Storage business has a significant list of projects intended to relieve existing congestion within its market area, as well as facilitating the development of the Marcellus Shale formation. For example, on May 20, Dominion Transmission signed a binding precedent agreement with CONSOL Energy to provide 200,000 decatherms per day of firm transportation service for Marcellus Shale volumes to the market hub at Leidy, Pennsylvania. This is referred to by us as the Marcellus Northeast Project and is expected to be in service by November 2012.
We had also recently signed an agreement to provide 150,000 decatherms per day to move Marcellus Shale volumes to Craigs, New York. This project, too, is expected to be in service by November 2012. 
On June 1, we filed the Appalachian Gateway Project with FERC, with it's approval expected by spring of next year. This project provides nearly 500,000 decatherms per day of firm transportation to the Oakford marketing hub beginning in 2012. The related Gathering Enhancement Project, which does not require FERC approval, increases gathering and processing capacity for producers within the region. It will phase into service during 2011 and 2012.
On April 19, Dominion announced an open season for Marcellus 404, a project designed to provide firm transportation, as well as gathering and processing services for up to 300 million cubic feet per day of high-BTU Marcellus natural gas production in portions of West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Fractionation capacity for up to an additional 32,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids is projected to be added as well.
We are excited about the numerous growth opportunities available to our regulated businesses. These opportunities extend well beyond the projects I have covered this morning. Later this year, we will provide more details about our infrastructure growth plans for the next five years.
Now a few minutes on the progress in our regulatory proceedings and other matters. With respect to EPA's proposed Transport Rule, we are evaluating its potential impact on both our Virginia Power and merchant fleets. It is the complex rule that is likely to be modified as it goes through the process. As Mark noted, however, our decision to take a charge at State Line in the second quarter was not related to this proposed rule making but rather primarily to the one-hour SO2 rule, which will likely require significant environmental expense at that plant in the future. We expect to give you more complete evaluation as the Transport Rule making progresses.
During the first quarter, we filed for a $46 million increase in base rate and fuel revenues for our North Carolina service territory. We expect the decision in that proceeding before the end of the year. 
Last week, we received an order from the Virginia State Corporation Commission approving our request to invest $500 million of equity into Virginia Power. The equity injection is intended to offset the impact of the charges related to the settlement agreement in the company's base rate case and will restore the Virginia Power's equity ratio to about 53%. 
On June 30, we filed our annual update to the riders for Virginia City and Bear Garden Power Stations. These filings cover the financing cost for both projects for 2011, as well as the operating costs for Bear Garden, which is expected to be in service by summer of next year. The change in rates would be effective on April 1, 2011. 
Overall, we are quite pleased with the results for the second quarter. Despite lower commodity prices, we achieved operating earnings well above our guidance range and near the top of the range when weather normalized. Our infrastructure growth program continues to provide the foundation for sustained earnings growth in the future.
Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

If you recall our May 7 presentation and when you look at where our capital spending has flowed in the quarter and will continue to flow out in the foreseeable future, it's almost entirely going into regulated projects. So we will continue to increase our regulated content. There's two ways to increase our regulated content: grow your regulated content and shrink your commodity census content. We have done both over the course of the last few years by disposing of our E&P business. The shale sale, as you mentioned, reduced our commodity exposure by an additional 20% this year. So we focused on both, but our concentration at the moment is on continuing to expand the regulated projects through building out organically."

We talked about May 7 that we have bought back 12 million shares for about $500 million, and that leaves us with a 10 million or 11 million shares left to buy back. We have bought those shares back in a very tight window of about 40 to 45 days. So there was a pressure on that stock from a buying standpoint based on us being in the market. We wanted to stay out of the market for about 30 days or so, let the stock stabilize, trade on its own, and we anticipated getting back into the market in June of this year to continue our stock buyback on a periodic basis. However, it was very apparent to us and early June, that we were going to have a significantly better quarter than what we had previously disclosed in our guidance range. We did not think it would be prudent to buy back stock, knowing that information and that information not being public, so we elected not to buy back any stock until we disclose what our actual earnings were for the second quarter."

So we're comfortable with what we have out there for '10 and '11 on merchant, and the environmental, we see as a much longer-term issue.

Joining me on the call this morning is our CEO, Tom Farrell, and other members of our management team. On today's call, I will discuss the earnings results for the third quarter, our outlook for the fourth quarter, full year 2010 and full year 2011. Tom will briefly update you on regulatory proceedings and operational activities. We will than take your questions. 
Dominion had a very strong third quarter. Our operating earnings were $1.03 per share, which was near the top of our earnings guidance range of $0.99 to $1.04 per share. As we referenced on last quarter's call, our third quarter guidance already reflected the above normal weather for July, but warmer-than-normal weather for August and September added $0.04 per share relative to our guidance range. The impact from weather was partially offset by major storm expense and reliability investments in Virginia. 
When comparing our results to the third quarter of 2009, our operating earnings were $0.04 per share higher. Higher revenues from rate adjustments clauses, favorable weather in our electric service territory and higher PJM ancillary service revenues were all set by reduced merchant generation margins, higher storm damage expenses and the absence of earnings from our Appalachian E&P business. 
GAAP earnings were $0.98 per share for the third quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings is an adjustment to the interim tax provisions in accordance with FIN 18. A summary and a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit. 
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, third quarter EBITDA was $217 million, which was slightly below the $224 million to $244 million range included in our guidance. Favorable weather was offset by higher storm and restoration costs in our distribution operations.
EBIT for Dominion Energy in the third quarter was $165 million, which was well above the third quarter guidance range. The strong results were primarily driven by lower fuel costs in the Gas Transmission business and better-than-expected supply aggregation activities at producer services. Third quarter EBIT from Dominion Generation was $826 million, which was in the upper half of the third quarter guidance range of $761 million to $850 million. Favorable weather and higher PJM ancillary services revenue helped offset lower merchant generation margins. Overall, we are very pleased with all of our operating segment results. 
We have prepared a number of supplemental schedules that can be found on our website following the conclusion of our earnings call. These supplemental schedules show EBIT for the legal entity, Virginia Power, which includes utility generation, electric transmission and distribution operations, as well as quarterly EBIT for our Regulated Gas businesses, merchant generation and Dominion Retail.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. At our May 7 Investor Meeting, we outlined our plans for the proceeds from the sale of our Appalachian E&P business, including approximately $900 million for share repurchases. We completed our share buyback for 2010 in August. And in total, approximately 21.4 million shares were repurchased at an average cost of $42.09 per share. Our cash position continues to be very strong this year. And as a result, we have almost no outstanding commercial paper, and our overall amount of floating rate debt remains well below our targeted levels.
During the third quarter, we issued term debt of $300 million at Virginia Power at an attractive coupon rate of 3.45%. After taking into account the benefit of treasury hedges put in place for our 2010 issuances, the effective rate on this issue is less than 3%. Also, we issued $250 million of parent company debt, due in 2015, for a coupon of 2.25%. The effective deal on this parent debt after incorporating the benefit of treasury hedges is approximately 2.2%. 
I wanted to give you a brief update on our 2011 financing plans. We do not plan to issue new equity in 2011. We have said in the past that we could issue new shares to our Dividend Reinvestment Plan, which typically amounts to $250 million per year. As we have been finalizing our plans for 2011, we have decided not to issue new shares for our DRIP plan and will instead use market purchases. Liquidity was very strong at $4.4 billion on September 30. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 16 and 43 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
During the third quarter, we also replaced our expiring credit facilities with two new three-year credit facilities totaling $3.5 billion. We appreciate the support of our banking partners in securing this new capacity. 
Now the fourth quarter and full year 2010 guidance. Dominion expects fourth quarter 2010 operating earnings in the range of $0.59 to $0.69 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.63 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. Positive factors for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the prior year include a return-to-normal weather, higher rider revenues and lower plant nuclear outage expenses due to the absence of a refueling outage at Millstone. Factors offsetting these positives include lower merchant generation margins, higher fossil and hydro plant outage expenses, the absence of earnings from our E&P business and higher income taxes. Remember that in the fourth quarter of 2009, our effective income tax rate was approximately 22%, which was primarily driven by the manufacturing tax deduction. We're also making a number of investments to maintain and improve the reliability of our electric system, which resulted in higher operating expenses in the third quarter and will lead to higher expenses for the fourth quarter.
Finally, we're advancing some work originally planned to be done during a 2011 outage at our Brayton Point Power Station, which will now be done in the fourth quarter of this year to improve the station's reliability. 
Moving to 2010 full year guidance. We are raising the bottom of our operating guidance range to $3.30 per share from $3.25 per share. We are leading the top end of our range unchanged at $3.40 per share. The operating earnings forecast for 2011 remains unchanged at $3 to $3.30 per share. Please refer to our GAAP reconciliation schedules for corresponding GAAP estimates. 
As to hedges, we've added to our hedged position for Millstone, increasing hedge levels to 90% for 2011 and 30% for 2012. At our New England coal units, we increased our hedge position to 50% for 2011. We also increased our hedge position at State Line to 73% for 2011 and 61% for 2012. Our sensitivity in 2011 to a $5 change in the New England power prices is now approximately $0.025 per share. In addition, we have nearly reached our maximum hedge position for frac spreads for each year through 2013 at levels that support our growth projections. The update of our hedge positions can be found on Page 33 of our Earnings Release Kit. Please note that our power hedge prices for 2011 to 2012 in NEPOOL are fairly flat. This, coupled with current market prices in our regulated growth plan, support our 5% to 6% earnings growth beginning in 2012.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

We've finished the quarter again as the top-rated company in the Southeast in employee safety performance. The fossil and hydro utility fleet achieved a year-to-date equivalent forced outage rate of 2.7% through September, which is it's best on record. Our nuclear fleet achieved a third quarter capacity factor of 97%, excluding refueling outages. Our Kewaunee nuclear power station in Wisconsin won the American Nuclear Society 2010 Utility Achievement Award for Outstanding Performance in Plant Operations. Kewaunee was recognized for demonstrating outstanding performance in operations as the top-performing plant and as the plant showing the most improved and sustainable performance in overall operations. 
We are pleased with our 2011 to 2015 regulated infrastructure growth plan we laid out in early September. Our five-year plan identifies over $2 billion in growth capital investments from across all of our regulated businesses. Our plan continues to develop on schedule and on budget. The Bear Garden combined cycle plant was 85% complete at the end of the third quarter. All major equipment is in place and construction continues per plan, with about 550 workers on site. Assembly of the gas turbine is complete with commissioning progressing to support a perspire later this year. The 580-megawatt combined cycle plant is scheduled for commercial operation in the spring of next year.
Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was 74% complete at the end of the third quarter. The 585-megawatt project is proceeding according to plan with over 2,000 workers on site. The steam turbine generator and the main transformer were delivered and placed under foundations, which represents the last of the major engineered equipment deliveries. The plant is scheduled for commercial operation in 2012. We have had no delays or cost overwork on either of these projects, which in total, represent over $2.4 billion of capital investment. 
We continue to make significant progress on our Warren County project, a three-on-one combined cycle facilities,, with projected capacity of up to 1,300 megawatts. The local county has approved the revised conditional use permit. Dominion held its required air permit informational briefing in May, and the draft air permit was issued for public comment earlier this month. We expect the final air permit in December. We have completed the steam turbine and gas turbine selection process, as well as executed the natural gas transportation perceived agreement to supply fuel to the power station. We plan to file for approval of this plant with the Virginia State Corporation Commission early next year. 
With respect to North Anna 3, we have concluded that the capital required for other new generation, pending environmental compliance and electric transmission upgrades, requires us to slow development of the third reactor at that facility.  Dominion will continue to work toward obtaining our combined operating license for North Anna Unit 3 incorporating the US-APWR designed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. We and MHI will also continue our engineering and preliminary site development work. We intend to reassess the schedule for construction of the unit as we approach the issuance of the CLL, which we expect to obtain in early 2013. We look forward to continuing work on this important project for Virginia. Our $10.2 billion five-year growth plan is unaffected by this decision.
Our two major electric transmission projects are also on schedule to be fully in-service by next summer. Two phases of the 500kV Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun line are complete and in operation, while work continues on the remaining phase. Work on the 500kV Carson-to-Suffolk line is about 50% complete. Yesterday, we energized our Pleasant View-Hamilton 230kV line in Northern Virginia. The project was on time and on budget. Also, yesterday, PJM announced its intention to recommend to the PJM Board the reconductoring of our Mt Storm-Doubs line as part of the 2010 Regional Transmission Expansion Plan. We anticipate formal PJM approval in December, in line with our expectations since we first announced this project at our May financial conference. 
Dominion Energy continues to take advantage of a strategic location in the Marcellus Shale region. For example, recently, DTI signed a new 15-year firm transportation agreement to move 100,000 dekatherms per day of Marcellus Shale volumes. This is our third Marcellus-related project announcement in as many months. Marcellus 404 project also continues to move forward. We have been meeting with producers to gauge interest and have further investigated the front-end engineering and design. Our two major energy construction projects, Gathering Enhancement and the Cove Point Pier Expansion, remain on schedule and on budget.
Now a few minutes on the progress in our regulatory proceedings. In September, parties to the base rate case in North Carolina filed a settlement agreement with the North Carolina Utilities Commission. The stipulated parties agreed that non-fuel based revenues will increase by $7.7 million, our first base rate increase in North Carolina since 1993. Also, a significantly greater percentage of future purchased power expenses will now be recovered through the fuel clause rather than base rates, reducing risk for the company. The settlement, if approved by the commission, would resolve all outstanding issues in the current base and fuel cases in North Carolina. We expect the decision in that proceeding before the end of the year. It is worth noting that our customer rates in both Virginia and North Carolina are well below the averages for the region, as well as the nation as a whole. 
On June 30, we filed our annual update to the riders for the Virginia City and Bear Garden Power Stations. These filings cover the financial cost for both projects for 2011, as well as the operating and maintenance costs for Bear Garden once it goes into commercial operation in the spring of next year. If approved by the State Corporation Commission, the change in rates will be effective on April 1. 
I want to cover a few upcoming events for the fourth quarter. We expect to complete a 60-megawatt upgrade at our Surry Nuclear Power Station and to have a successful perspiring at the Bear Garden Power Station. We expect a final air permit for our Warren County project in December. We also expect PJM approval of the Mt. Storm-Doubs line in December.  On the regulatory front, we look forward to North Carolina commission's consideration of the settlement agreement. Finally, we will submit for approval, by our Board of Directors, our recommendation of a 60% to 65% target dividend payout ratio, including a 7.7% increase in the dividend rate for 2011 over 2010.

So when we had been talking about the dividend payout ratio recommendation, let's go back in time a little bit. In 2007, when we announced the sale of E&P business and our legislature re-regulated in Virginia, we probably could sustain a 55% payout ratio. Under those circumstance, we would work our way to that by 2010, which we achieved this year. As we decided to sell the rest of our E&P business, reducing the commodity exposure by an additional 20% and working out with what our regulated growth plans were, the way the PJM markets were looking at -- the PJM is looking at the Virginia growth rate, et cetera, we believe that the appropriate target for our earnings mix was closer to 75% to 80% regulated, and that the peer group there was more of a 65% dividend payout ratio. So the target became, by '12, 65%. 2011, as we've said for since May and as Mark just reiterated, it's going to be -- we expect lower earnings next year than this year because of the decline in the Merchant business margins. That's exacerbated by the five large outages we have in our merchant fleet in '11, three nuclear refueling outages. As you can see from our hedging program in New England, '12 it's flat to '11. So the decline in the merchant margins should -- well, it's going to be greatly reduced, if not eliminated in '12. And the underlying 7% to 8% growth in the regulated businesses will no longer be dampened by the decline in the merchant margins. Looking at all of those pieces combined and along with our decision on to slow down the development in North Anna, allows us to pay a 65% dividend payout. We're looking through '11 because we know the plans are there. And so '11 should be about a 62.5% payout over the midpoint of this $3, $3.30 range, which will allow continued growth in the dividend payout in '12. And then we expect 5% and 6% growth ongoing '13 through '15 based on the $10.2 billion worth of growth capital that we've explained starting earlier this call."

Joining me on the call this morning is our CEO, Tom Farrell, and other members of our management team. On today's call, I will discuss the earnings results for the third quarter, our outlook for the fourth quarter, full year 2010 and full year 2011. Tom will briefly update you on regulatory proceedings and operational activities. We will then take your questions. 
Dominion had a very strong third quarter. Our operating earnings were $1.03 per share, which was near the top of our earnings guidance range of $0.99 to $1.04 per share. As we referenced on last quarter's call, our third quarter guidance already reflected the above-normal weather for July, but warmer-than-normal weather for August and September added $0.04 per share relative to our guidance range. The impact from weather was partially offset by major storm expense and reliability investments in Virginia. 
When comparing our results to the third quarter of 2009, our operating earnings were $0.04 per share higher. Higher revenues from rate adjustment clauses, favorable weather in our electric service territory and higher PJM ancillary service revenues were offset by reduced merchant generation margins, higher storm damage expenses and the absence of earnings from our Appalachian E&P business. 
GAAP earnings were $0.98 per share for the third quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings is an adjustment to the interim tax provisions in accordance with FIN 18. A summary and a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit. 
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, third quarter EBIT was $217 million, which was slightly below the $224 million to $244 million range included in our guidance. Favorable weather was offset by higher storm and restoration costs in our distribution operations.
EBIT for Dominion Energy in the third quarter was $165 million, which was well above the third quarter guidance range. The strong results were primarily driven by lower fuel costs in the Gas Transmission business and better-than-expected supply aggregation activities at producer services. Third quarter EBIT from Dominion Generation was $826 million, which was in the upper half of the third quarter guidance range of $761 million to $850 million. Favorable weather and higher PJM ancillary services revenue helped offset lower merchant generation margins. Overall, we are very pleased with all of our operating segment results. 
We have prepared a number of supplemental schedules that can be found on our website following the conclusion of our earnings call. These supplemental schedules show EBIT for the legal entity, Virginia Power, which includes utility generation, electric transmission and distribution operations, as well as quarterly EBIT for our regulated gas businesses, merchant generation and Dominion Retail.
Moving to cash flow and Treasury activities. At our May 7 Investor Meeting, we outlined our plans for the proceeds from the sale of our Appalachian E&P business, including approximately $900 million for share repurchases. We completed our share buyback for 2010 in August. And in total, approximately 21.4 million shares were repurchased at an average cost of $42.09 per share. Our cash position continues to be very strong this year. And as a result, we have almost no outstanding commercial paper, and our overall amount of floating rate debt remains well below our targeted levels.
During the third quarter, we issued term debt of $300 million at Virginia Power at an attractive coupon rate of 3.45%. After taking into account the benefit of Treasury hedges put in place for our 2010 issuances, the effective rate on this issue is less than 3%. Also, we issued $250 million of parent company debt, due in 2015, for a coupon of 2.25%. The effective yield on this parent debt after incorporating the benefit of Treasury hedges is approximately 2.2%. 
I wanted to give you a brief update on our 2011 financing plans. We do not plan to issue new equity in 2011. We have said in the past that we could issue new shares to our Dividend Reinvestment Plan, which typically amounts to $250 million per year. As we have been finalizing our plans for 2011, we have decided not to issue new shares for our DRIP plan and will instead use market purchases. Liquidity was very strong at $4.4 billion on September 30. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 16 and 43 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
During the third quarter, we also replaced our expiring credit facilities with two new three-year credit facilities totaling $3.5 billion. We appreciate the support of our banking partners in securing this new capacity. 
Now the fourth quarter and full year 2010 guidance. Dominion expects fourth quarter 2010 operating earnings in a range of $0.59 to $0.69 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.63 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. Positive factors for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the prior year include a return-to-normal weather, higher rider revenues and lower planned nuclear outage expenses due to the absence of a refueling outage at Millstone. Factors offsetting these positives include lower merchant generation margins, higher fossil and hydro plant outage expenses, the absence of earnings from our E&P business and higher income taxes. 
Remember that in the fourth quarter of 2009, our effective income tax rate was approximately 22%, which was primarily driven by the manufacturing tax deduction. We were also making a number of investments to maintain and improve the reliability of our electric system, which resulted in higher operating expenses in the third quarter and will lead to higher expenses for the fourth quarter.
Finally, we're advancing some work originally planned to be done during a 2011 outage at our Brayton Point Power Station, which will now be done in the fourth quarter of this year to improve the station's reliability. 
Moving to 2010 full year guidance. We are raising the bottom of our operating guidance range to $3.30 per share from $3.25 per share. We are leaving the top end of our range unchanged at $3.40 per share. The operating earnings forecast for 2011 remains unchanged at $3 to $3.30 per share. Please refer to our GAAP reconciliation schedules for corresponding GAAP estimates. 
As to hedges, we've added to our hedge position for Millstone, increasing hedge levels to 90% for 2011 and 30% for 2012. At our New England coal units, we increased our hedge position to 50% for 2011. We also increased our hedge position at Stateline to 73% for 2011 and 61% for 2012. Our sensitivity in 2011 to a $5 change in New England power prices is now approximately $0.025 per share. In addition, we have nearly reached our maximum hedge position for frac spreads for each year through 2013 at levels that support our growth projections. The update of our hedge positions can be found on Page 33 of our Earnings Release Kit. Please note that our power hedge prices for 2011 to 2012 in NEPOOL are fairly flat. This, coupled with current market prices in our regulated growth plan, support our 5% to 6% earnings growth beginning in 2012.
I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Our operating and safety performance continued to be strong during the third quarter. We finished the quarter again as the top-rated company in the Southeast in employee safety performance. The fossil",1135,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our operating and safety performance continued to be strong during the third quarter. We finished the quarter again as the top-rated company in the Southeast in employee safety performance. The fossil and hydro utility fleet achieved a year-to-date equivalent forced outage rate of 2.7% through September, which is its best on record. Our nuclear fleet achieved a third quarter capacity factor of 97%, excluding refueling outages. Our Kewaunee Nuclear power station in Wisconsin won the American Nuclear Society 2010 Utility Achievement Award for Outstanding Performance in Plant Operations. Kewaunee was recognized for demonstrating outstanding performance in operations as the top-performing plant and as the plant showing the most improved and sustainable performance in overall operations. 
We are pleased with our 2011 to 2015 regulated infrastructure growth plan we laid out in early September. Our five-year plan identifies over $2 billion in growth capital investments from across all of our regulated businesses. Our plan continues to develop on schedule and on budget. The Bear Garden combined cycle plant was 85% complete at the end of the third quarter. All major equipment is in place and construction continues per plan, with about 550 workers on site. Assembly of the gas turbine is complete with commissioning progressing to support a first fire later this year. The 580-megawatt combined cycle plant is scheduled for commercial operation in the spring of next year.
Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was 74% complete at the end of the third quarter. The 585-megawatt project is proceeding according to plan with over 2,000 workers on site. The steam turbine generator and the main transformer were delivered and placed under foundations, which represents the last of the major engineered equipment deliveries. The plant is scheduled for commercial operation in 2012. We have had no delays or cost overrun on either of these projects, which in total represent over $2.4 billion of capital investment. 
We continue to make significant progress on our Warren County project, a three-on-one combined cycle facility, with projected capacity of up to 1,300 megawatts. The local county has approved the revised conditional use permit. Dominion held its required air permit informational briefing in May, and the draft air permit was issued for public comment earlier this month. We expect the final air permit in December. We have completed the steam turbine and gas turbine selection process, as well as executed the natural gas transportation receive agreement to supply fuel to the power station. We plan to file for approval of this plant with the Virginia State Corporation Commission early next year. 
With respect to North Anna 3, we have concluded that the capital required for other new generation, pending environmental compliance and electric transmission upgrades, requires us to slow development of the third reactor at that facility.  Dominion will continue to work toward obtaining a combined operating license for North Anna Unit 3 incorporating the US-APWR design by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. We and MHI will also continue our engineering and preliminary site development work. We intend to reassess the schedule for construction of the unit as we approach the issuance of the COL, which we expect to obtain in early 2013. We look forward to continuing work on this important project for Virginia. Our $10.2 billion five-year growth plan is unaffected by this decision.
Our two major electric transmission projects are also on schedule to be fully in-service by next summer. Two phases of the 500kV Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun line are complete and in operation, while work continues on the remaining phase. Work on the 500kV Carson-to-Suffolk line is about 50% complete. Yesterday, we energized our Pleasant View-to-Hamilton 230kV line in Northern Virginia. The project was on time and on budget. Also, yesterday, PJM announced its intention to recommend to the PJM Board the reconductoring of our Mt. Storm-to-Doubs line as part of the 2010 Regional Transmission Expansion Plan. We anticipate formal PJM approval in December, in line with our expectations since we first announced this project at our May financial conference. 
Dominion Energy continues to take advantage of its strategic location in the Marcellus Shale region. For example, recently, DTI signed a new 15-year firm transportation agreement to move 100,000 dekatherms per day of Marcellus Shale volumes. This is our third Marcellus-related project announcement in as many months. The Marcellus 404 project also continues to move forward. We have been meeting with producers to gauge interest and have further investigated the front-end engineering and design. Our two major energy construction projects, Gathering Enhancement and the Cove Point Pier Expansion, remain on schedule and on budget.
Now a few minutes on the progress in our regulatory proceedings. In September, parties to the base rate case in North Carolina filed a settlement agreement with the North Carolina Utilities Commission. The stipulating parties agreed that non-fuel based revenues will increase by $7.7 million, our first base rate increase in North Carolina since 1993. Also, a significantly greater percentage of future purchased power expenses will now be recovered through the fuel clause rather than base rates, reducing risk for the company. The settlement, if approved by the Commission, would resolve all outstanding issues in the current base and fuel cases in North Carolina. We expect the decision in that proceeding before the end of the year. It is worth noting that our customer rates in both Virginia and North Carolina are well below the averages for the region, as well as the nation as a whole. 
On June 30, we filed our annual update to the riders for the Virginia City and Bear Garden Power Stations. These filings cover the financing costs for both projects for 2011, as well as the operating and maintenance costs for Bear Garden once it goes into commercial operation in the spring of next year. If approved by the State Corporation Commission, the change in rates will be effective on April 1. 
I want to cover a few upcoming events for the fourth quarter. We expect to complete a 60-megawatt upgrade at our Surry Nuclear Power Station and to have a successful first firing at the Bear Garden Power Station. We expect a final air permit for our Warren County project in December. We also expect PJM approval of the Mt. Storm-Doubs line in December.  On the regulatory front, we look forward to the North Carolina Commission's consideration of the settlement agreement. Finally, we will submit for approval, by our Board of Directors, our recommendation of a 60% to 65% target dividend payout ratio, including a 7.7% increase in the dividend rate for 2011 over 2010. 
Overall, we are pleased with results for the third quarter. Our infrastructure growth program continues to provide the foundation for sustained earnings growth in the future. 
Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

Under those circumstance, we would work our way to that by 2010, which we achieved this year. As we decided to sell the rest of our E&P business, reducing the commodity exposure by an additional 20%, and looking out with what our regulated growth plans were, the way the PJM markets were looking at -- the PJM was looking at the Virginia growth rate, et cetera, we believed that the appropriate target for our earnings mix was closer to 75% to 80% regulated. And that the peer group there was more of a 65% dividend payout ratio. So the target became, by '12, 65%. 2011, as we've said since May, and as Mark just reiterated, it's going to be -- we expect lower earnings next year than this year because of the decline in the merchant business margins. That's exacerbated by the five large outages we have in our merchant fleet in '11, three nuclear refueling outages. As you can see from our hedging program in New England, '12, it's flat to '11. So the decline in the merchant margins should -- well, it's going to be greatly reduced, if not eliminated, in '12. And the underlying 7% to 8% growth in the regulated businesses will no longer be dampened by the decline in the merchant margins. Looking at all of those pieces combined and along with our decision to slow down the development in North Anna, allows us to pay a 65% dividend payout. We're looking through '11 because we know the plans are there. And so '11 should be about a 62.5% payout over the midpoint of this $3, $3.30 range, which will allow continued growth in the dividend payout in '12. And then we expect 5% and 6% growth ongoing, '13 through '15, based on the $10.2 billion worth of growth capital that we've explained starting earlier this call."
