Before I begin, I do want to briefly discuss the leadership and changes we announced in mid-December that Greg just referred to in the opening comments. First of all, Mike Todman, who was previously President of North America is now serving as President of Whirlpool International. In his new role, he will be accountable for our Europe, Latin America and Asia regions, as well as our global information systems. Mike is also accountable for several key global strategic areas, including our innovation and global energy efficiency initiatives. Marc Bitzer, who was previously President of our U.S. Operations has moved into the role of President, North America. Both Mike and Marc are two highly capable leaders, I'm very confident who will do a great good job in their new assignments and they'll be representing their respective region on this call.Turning to the release, as you all know, earlier this morning we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and for the full year. You can see these results on Slide 2. As we outlined for you last year at this time, we faced a very challenging macroeconomic environment on a number of fronts. All major markets were in decline at that time and we felt that we were likely facing the year with significant revenue decline, higher costs and volatile currencies. For the full year, this proved to be accurate as our revenues declined by 10% versus 2008 levels.We also, at that time, outlined the key drivers of our business and separated them into two categories. On one hand, we talked about areas that would positively impact our business and things that would negatively impact our business. The negative impacts were significantly lower demand levels, the impact of foreign currency and very volatile material costs. The positive impacts on our business related to our swift aggressive actions to address this challenging environment, particularly in regarding our cost and working capital initiatives. These actions helped improve our operating margins by 1.1 points to 4% during the year, despite a substantial decline in sales. In addition, we reported for the year a record level of free cash flow of $1.1 billion during 2009, which has significantly strengthened our company's financial position. If you turn to Slide 3, we highlight our execution against the key operating priorities that we established for last year. From a cost standpoint, we had a very strong year. We were able to significantly lower our breakeven point through structural cost reductions across our global organization. We also continue to build the foundation of a very strong global product platform designs and the supporting component harmonization initiatives that go along with them. These actions lowered our costs, improved our quality  and increased our speed to market from design to market launch. And overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in these areas of the business, which will continue to benefit us this year.Moving on to cash, again, we have the best year ever in terms of generating free cash flow. Our aggressive focus on working capital reduction, particularly in the area of inventory, resulted in a substantial source of cash flow during the year. This performance, in addition to our notes issuance and credit agreement extension, significantly improved our financial and liquidity positions. Finally, our market execution goals for the year were to have a good balance between price/mix and market share. And during 2009, we finished the year with positive price/mix and very good share performance in all of our key global markets.Slide 4 highlights one of the most important aspects of our spending initiatives last year. And in this case, as what we didn't cut, now is our investments in new product innovation. We continued to invest in our business during the downturn, as R&D and capital expenditures actually increased as a percent of total sales. These investments will yield a strong gains in new product innovations over the next 12 months and reflects the continued commitment we have to bringing new consumer-relevant innovation to the marketplace on a continuous basis. Turning to Slide 5, we expect to have a strong year for innovation with our pipeline now over $4 billion in future revenues. From a product perspective, you'll see major launches in laundry, cooking and refrigeration. In fact, Marc Bitzer will touch on a few of these products in a moment, that we expect to have a very strong year of innovation globally across our product lines. We do see many great opportunities for growth in markets around the world. We're largely enabled by this record number of new product innovation launches that we have scheduled for this year.On Slide 6, I have summarized our current demand outlook for 2010. Overall, we expect global industry demand will show modest growth globally in 2010. Obviously, there's still a high degree of uncertainty in many facets of the global economy, but we do feel that we'll see in 2010 growth from a low base. In the U.S., we expect major appliance demands to increase by about 2% to 4%. This would mark the first full year of positive growth in four years and is largely driven by a more normal replacement market. In Europe, we expect conditions will remain relatively more difficult, with industry demand being flat to 2009 levels. As you would expect, there's a wide range of outcomes by country. But overall, we're starting to see demand stabilizing and are forecasting flat demand for the year. In Brazil, we continue to see very strong underlying fundamentals. And we're forecasting industry demand growth to be in the range of 5% to 10% off of the strong year this year. Finally, we expect the markets that we serve in Asia will grow in the 3% to 5% range. We expect India to continue to show a very strong growth leading the region.Finally, I would direct your attention to Slide 7, where we provide our 2010 financial outlook and guidance. For the full year, we expect to generate earnings per share in the range of $6.50 to $7 per share. Also for the full year, we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $400 million to $500 million this year. We expect the positive impacts to our operating performance this year will be a continuation of the significant cost reduction and productivity that we had last year, which again will be a significant contributor to our improvement in earnings. In addition, we certainly expect higher unit volumes will contribute in part to our overall revenue growth and aid in improving our margins.For the full year, we expect price/mix and currency impacts will be generally neutral to our operating results. And finally, on the unfavorable side, we still see material and oil cost inflation increasing. And we expect it will impact our operating results in the $200 million to $300 million range compared to last year. At this point in time, I'd stop here and I'll turn it over to Marc Bitzer for his review of our North American operations."

Turning to Slide 9, I would like to briefly go over some of our key accomplishments from 2009. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we maintained a strong commitment to innovation investment, both in the form of R&D and capital expenses. And from a market standpoint, we delivered a strong increase in our branded share during the year and during Q4 in particular. We also made strong progress reducing our cost structure, the double-digit reduction in manufacturing capacity, we reduced the SG&A structure by nearly $200 million or over one percentage point of sales. Finally, we saw a strong improvement in our logistics network. We have completed our move to a new regional distribution center footprint. We have implemented a new home delivery model that we believe is the best in class in our industry. And we expect this will yield both better service levels as well as the reduction in delivery costs. On Slide 10, we detailed fourth quarter results for North America. We marked the first quarter since Q1'07 that we posted a year-over-year sales increase in North America. Our unit shipment growth exceeded the market growth. We reported operating margin at 5.2 percentage points, and that's a six-point improvement over the year before. And that is largely driven by cost and productivity initiatives and higher volume and partially offset by lower price and mix.On Slide 11, you can see some of our newest innovations. As you know, we are focused on providing consumers with the greatest value by offering preferred brand they can depend on with the most innovative features in the most cost-efficient way possible. From a dishwasher and disposal cleaner, to a completely new side-by-side refrigerator platform, our cadence of new product introductions remains very strong. There's one product on this slide that I'll talk about in more detail. And that is our new global brand, Vantage top-load laundry pair. You will see on the next slide that this product features an LCD touchscreen control, it's the industry-first USB port that allows consumers to update and customize washing cycles and other controls. And finally, the fit, finish and design of its body will lead forward from industry-setting class model. Turning now to our industry outlook for 2010 on Slide 12, I'll review some of the background on the components of demand. As part of our forecast, we expect to see a 27% increase in new housing starts, or approximately just slightly above 700,000 units. We expect existing home sales to improve approximately 7% during the year. And we're looking for consumer confidence to be stable to slightly up, and they will remain at historically low levels or slightly above that. Consumers are still very cautious, given many uncertainties in the economy. And we expect that to remain the case as our 10% unemployment assumptions. So while general consumers' uneasiness lingers, we expect stable replacement demand for the year versus some delay purchases during the beginning of 2009.So summarizing, based on our current estimates of these economic variables, we believe the U.S. industry demand will increase 2% to 4% in 2010, which is still well below historic or long-term trend demand levels. And now, I would like to turn it over to Mike for his review of international operations."

Let me begin with a general overview on Slide 14. During 2009, we saw our return to strong economic growth in Brazil and India.

During 2009, we saw our return to strong economic growth in Brazil and India. These markets not only had a much faster return to general economic growth rates, but they also saw appliance demand return to growth rates well above the general economy. Europe remained the most challenging region from an international perspective, as we managed through a broad contraction in both economies. From a Whirlpool perspective, we focused significant restructuring resources on the European region during the fourth quarter to better align our cost structure with industry demand levels and ensure an appropriate structure for 2010 and beyond. Overall, during 2009, we made strong progress toward our cost reduction goals across the region and strengthened our share position.Turning to Slide 15, our European sales improved 2% in the quarter. In local currency, sales declined approximately 9% from the prior year. Our unit shipments declined approximately 9% year-over-year, which was largely in line with the estimated industry demand levels during the quarter. The region reported an operating profit of $19 million compared with the $2 million earned in 2008. Results were unfavorably impacted by lower volumes, while lower costs and higher-priced product mix partially offset these challenges. While we have taken necessary actions and made progress in our European region, results remained below satisfactory levels and we will continue to adjust our cost structure accordingly.Fourth quarter results from our Latin American business can be found on Slide 16. The region reported sales of $1.2 billion compared to $777 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact from currency, sales increased approximately 28%. The sales increase was driven by favorable foreign currency exchange and strong demand for our appliances in the Brazilian market. Results were partially offset by lower tax credit monetization levels and product price/mix. Operating profit totaled $138 million compared to $110 million reported during the prior-year period. Our fourth quarter results in the Asia region are showed on Slide 17. Net sales increased 34% during the quarter to $188 million, up from $140 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 27% compared with the prior-year period. The sales increase was driven by strong results across the region. With our new industrial joint venture in China and our strong presence in India, we are well positioned to benefit from the growth trends in these markets. Operating profit during the quarter was $6 million compared with $3 million reported in the prior year. The operational improvement was primarily related to higher unit volumes. These improvements were partially offset by lower price/mix.A few minutes ago, Marc talked about our ongoing investment in our brand portfolio and strong cadence of new product introductions. That is the case not just in North America but around the world, as we continue to provide consumer-relevant innovations to consumers everywhere. On Slide 18, you will see just a few of our international product launches. Slide 19 summarizes our outlook for international operations. Overall, appliance industry demand in Brazil and India remains strong and ahead of general economic growth rates. We are seeing some commonalities in both these markets, including improved affordability, a developing middle class, a low base of appliance penetration rates compared to the U.S. and Europe and solid economic fundamentals. These factors, combined with Brazil's applied stimulus program, have strengthened our position in those markets. The Brazil stimulus program ended effective February 1. Although we do not yet understand the impact of this change, it is important to note that all trade inventory prior to that date still qualifies for the tax holiday.In addition, we believe that the underlying demand is strong, irrespective of the stimulus program because of low interest rates and underlying economic conditions. And we continue to be very positive about the prospects for our Latin American business in 2010.In Europe, however, we expect demand to stabilize during 2010 and we continue to pursue aggressive actions to improve our results in the region. And finally, in Asia, our strong performance in the quarter highlights the early success of our joint venture that allows us to continue to add new product offerings. And we see significant growth opportunities in the region, particularly in India and China. And now with that, I'd like to turn it over to Roy Templin for his financial review."

Beginning on Slide 21, I'll walk you through a summary of our fourth quarter performance. Our net sales performance mark the first global unit volume increase we have had since the first quarter of 2007, with o",1023,"Thank you, Mike. And good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 21, I'll walk you through a summary of our fourth quarter performance. Our net sales performance mark the first global unit volume increase we have had since the first quarter of 2007, with our units increasing approximately 9½% from the prior year. Our revenue was also favorably impacted by foreign exchange translation, which accounted for approximately seven points of the year-over-year increase. The favorable impact from currency was primarily related to a stronger Brazilian real and the euro when compared to the prior year. Looking at our margins during the fourth quarter, the positive year-over-year increase was primarily from our productivity and cost reduction actions. These actions were partially offset by lower price/mix and BEFIEX monetization, which declined $21 million from the prior year.Finally, before we take a look at the income statement in detail, there are a few items I would like to highlight. The first is a $46 million accrual related to a previously disclosed legal action pertaining to a collection dispute in Brazil. This was recorded in interest and sundry expense. The second item related to interest and sundry was a $13 million expense related to previously capitalized transaction costs. We also recorded a net favorable $13 million adjustment related to operating and income tax settlements in Brazil in response to revised government options.Turning to the income statement on Slide 22, we reported net sales of just over $4.8 billion, an increase of 13% from the prior year. Our gross margin rose 3.1 points to a 14.1%. As I mentioned previously, the most significant favorable impact on our gross margin improvement related to our cost and productivity actions, which were partially offset by lower price/mix.SG&A expense totaled $427 million. Foreign currency translation and the non-recurrence of an asset sale gain in the prior year accounted for over 90% of the year-over-year dollar increase. Restructuring expenses totaled $55 million during the quarter and were largely related to cost reduction actions in Europe. We currently anticipate recording restructuring expenses in the $100 million range during 2010. This amount will be partially offset by curtailment gains due to a previously announced facility closure.  Finally, our operating margin expanded to 4.1% from 0.2% in the prior year. Turning to Slide 23, I wanted to touch briefly on interest expense. Related to the revised tax settlement terms in Brazil, noted in my earlier remarks, part of the settlement adjustment was recorded in interest expense. Excluding this settlement, our interest expense would have increased mainly due to higher average borrowing rates due to our notes issuance during the second quarter.Turning to interest and sundry expense, the items I mentioned earlier substantially offset favorable year-over-year currency resulting from prior-year losses on balance sheet positions and an asset impairment, again recorded in the prior year.Finally, turning to our tax rate. We recorded an income tax credit of $10 million during the quarter, corresponding to an effective tax rate benefit of 11%. The fourth quarter credit was slightly below our previous quarterly expectation, largely as a result of higher pre-tax income and the establishment of reserves for foreign tax audits. Our annual tax credit of 21% fell within our previously disclosed range. For the full year 2010, we are currently estimating a tax credit in the range of 15% to 25%.  Finally, we reported EPS of $1.24 per share, including a $0.40 per share negative impact from the legal accrual that I noted earlier.Moving to our full year free cash flow results on Slide 24. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we had an outstanding year. The strong working capital performance during the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations in every part of the world. As a percentage of sales, our full year free cash flow was 6.4%, which is well ahead of our long-term objective in the 4% to 5% range.Our full year free cash flow generation of approximately $1.1 billion, in addition to our term note issuance during the second quarter and the extension of our revolving credit facility through August of 2012, has substantially improved our financial position.Turning to Slide 25, we show our net liquidity position. As you can see from this chart, our net liquidity position has improved to approximately $3.3 billion from $2.1 billion at the end of 2008. At year end, our cash balance stood at $1.4 billion and we had full availability under our revolving credit facility.On Slide 26, you can see we have significantly reduced our net debt balance to the lowest level in four years. We feel very good about our ability to continue to fund our restructuring and product innovation initiatives. We have also consistently paid our dividend throughout 2009. After funding these operating initiatives, a key priority going forward is improving our credit metrics with the goal of returning our credit ratings to pre-recession levels.Finally, turning to our financial outlook on Slide 27, we are expecting to report earnings per share in the range of $6.50 and $7 per share. This compares to the $4.34 we reported for 2009. As Jeff reviewed previously, we expect to have favorable impacts from increased global unit volume, as well as our ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives. In addition to these factors, the Brazilian government recently announced that it will not renew the IPI tax holiday program that has been renewed several times since mid-April. While there will likely be some lag until all lower IPI-based products clears the inventory pipe, as Mike referenced earlier, we have anticipated this change in our outlook.From a headwind perspective, we are assuming material and oil-related costs to increase in the range of $200 million to $300 million in 2010. And turning to our cash flow outlook, we are projecting free cash flow between $400 million to $500 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million during the year. After our strong working capital performance in 2009, and with our expectation of higher global unit volumes, we expect working capital will be a use of cash during 2010. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

As you will notice, many of these priorities remain unchanged for what we outlined for 2009. We continue to have a very strong focus on cost reduction across our global enterprise. As Roy previously mentioned, we'll be taking additional restructuring actions during 2010 from previously announced actions, as well as some new actions to continue to drive lower structural costs, lower capacity levels and taking productivity and other cost initiatives to offset material costs. In total, we think we will be able to expand our operating margins from our cost activities. Cash flow also remains a very high priority for us in 2010. As we mentioned, we had a record year for cash flow last year and we expect to generate solid free cash flow during 2010. This is despite our expectation that we will have some working capital build during the course of the year, as we return to sales growth. And certainly, given the amount of uncertainty that remains across the globe and the effects that we've seen over the last year to global financial crisis, you should expect that we will carry a higher cash balance over the course of the year than we maybe historically have, and we think it's appropriate in this period of time. From a market execution standpoint, we will continue to balance our share of price/mix as we manage our business in 2010. We feel very good about our innovation pipeline, the cadence of new products that we'll bring in the market during the course of the year. We expect these new products to help us build our branded position during the year. Our successful execution on these priorities will enable us to deliver strong earnings growth during the course of the year. I'd now like to turn to Slide 30 and take the moment to discuss our long-term value creating objectives. We view 2010 as a year of full recovery for our company, where we regain a large portion of our revenues that's declined in both '08 and '09 and improving our operating margins. From this base, we expect to build in 2010, we're re-committing to our value-creation objectives for revenue, for earnings, or for cash. And that means, from a top line perspective, we would expect to continue to target annual sales growth in the 5% to 7% range, earnings growth in the 10% to 15% range and continue to improve our free cash flow as a percentage to sales and try to manage it between the 4% to 5% range. We are emerging from one of the most challenging economic environments that we've seen in decades. I think the very strong message for us is that I believe we are emerging this period as a much stronger company. We have substantially lowered our break even point, substantially improved our financial strength and expect to bring a very strong cadence of new products to the market during 2010 and beyond. While the economy remains volatile, we feel we are well positioned to meet our long-term value creating objectives and we'll reposition ourselves for significant values for our shareholders in 2010 and beyond. I'm going to end here. And I'd now like to open this up to call out for any questions you may have."

If you remember, the IPI tax holiday was actually put on in April of 2009. And we still saw growth in the Brazil business of over 30%, which essentially says that it was not -- that growth rate was not all driven just from the IPI tax. Now they've just repealed the, if you will, that tax. So it's hard for us to know exactly what the outcome's going to be. But suffice it to say, there's probably about 30 to 45 days of inventory in the system that will qualify for the tax. And then after that, our view is that the underlying economics, both with low interest rates and the general economic conditions, is going to drive favorable -- could continue to drive a favorable market environment for us. So I feel pretty confident about that. The other piece is that we've got the International businesses, the Chiles and Colombias, et cetera, which as you know were down significantly in 2009. And we expect to have some recovery in those markets. So I can't give you an exact number of what the IPI tax drove, but we feel very comfortable about the 5% to 10% range."

And last year, 2009, was our third year in a row where we've been able to manage positive price mix in a very competitive global marketplace. So our attention is no different in 2010. I would also say that every year, we get there in a different way, would it be the pricing, or like-for-like pricing, regional and product and brand mix and that sort of thing. Way I would describe it is that the story for 2010 is a little bit different. In some high-inflation markets like India, we've already announced and taken price increase for 2010. We did that in December. In other regions like Europe, we finished the year driving very positive price mix. The U.S. gets a lot of attention where we had negative price mix in the fourth quarter. Again, we're very pleased with where we are today. Last year, in the first half of the year and fourth quarter of '08, we have some very high comparisons year over year so we're topping against our highest levels the previous year. And I see innovation as being the driver of our ability to drive mix in the U.S. So if you put them all together, it's hard to predict at the beginning of the year but we have -- and given our track record over the last three years, I feel pretty good that we're going to be able to manage that at least to neutral for 2010."

And I think I said on prior calls, the normal run rate for us right now with the basic interest we have is about $60 million a quarter or $240 million for the year. Now, Laura, We obviously have the capability to use cash should we decide to do so in the 1st of May, when our $325 million, that 8% senior note becomes due, obviously, if we use cash, That will change the trend that I've just given you. But net-net, it's about $60 million a quarter. Interest in sundry, you're right. We've had some one-time events this year, particularly with -- now this legal dispute in the fourth quarter and of course the compressor settlement earlier in year. Laura, you know over the years, our other income, other expense or interest in sundry has been about $50 million to $60 million of expense. If you wanted to increase that somewhat for higher legal cost related to compressor investigation, that might be prudent to do so, which might take you to more of a run rate like $70 million  to $80 million as you look at going forward in the very near term. From a tax rate perspective, again, I said in my script, that we're projecting the tax rate for next year at about the same level of credit that we had this year. Now initially, that may not seem real intuitive but there's two cases, Laura, that really offset one another: One is, logically, the credit would get smaller year-over-year because we're going to have a much higher base of earnings. And therefore, that brings down the overall credit that we have as a company. Offsetting that though, Laura, are two things: One, we do think that given the innovation and the energy efficiency backed around the innovation that will deliver the market in 2010, that we will earn higher energy tax credits. And as Mike indicated earlier, now with the repeal of the IPI tax holiday while we -- will be some volume impact from that, we do expect to see and experience higher BPX tax credit in Brazil in 2010."

But we do expect it in all parts of the world. I'll speak just a moment for Latin America and then I'll let Marc Bitzer to make some general comments about North America. And also, I'll mention Europe. Europe, obviously, kind of hit the low point. They were negative in second quarter of last year. They've improved every quarter since. So obviously, we're expecting a good improvement in Europe. Latin America is at a very strong level. In fact, x BPX [business process expert], they're at or near some of our highest margins ever, but yet given the robustness in that economy, given our market position and our product pipeline and innovation, we expect to continue to improve our operating margins. So if we have more BPX, that will only help those margins. But we look at it with or without and certainly, without, we're driving for some margin expansion.

As you go out into 2011, two things that you need to think about, Todd. One is, as I said before, piercing through the credits that exist in today's rate, this company's normalized run rate would be a tax expense of about 30%, high-20s to 30%, Todd. So that's point number one. Point number two would be, keep in mind that under the current legislation, the energy tax credits will end this year.

And here it is, Jeff. If you look carefully at the last extension, they basically did the extension by energy efficiency category. They had categories A through E, more energy-efficient to less energy efficient. So on those lesser energy-efficient models, the holiday went away. And so what you're seeing is, it's the impact of the mix of business we had. But you're right, net-net, we had more IPI tax and therefore an incremental ability to monetize, although nowhere near where we've been in the recent past, it's certainly greater than Q2 and Q3."

So as you look at the value creation objectives as Jeff shared, obviously,  you get the higher margin. As you know, Jeff, our principal sort of year in and year out, the principal pipe for cash flow in any business, of course, if your after tax earnings. And so that's a very important element with respect to that. I'll come back to the second part of your question now. In your right, as you look at next year's guidance, it sort of falls in the level of what we've seen combined the last two years. I think it's couple of key things. One is we are expecting and of course, it's clear in the guidance that add higher cash earnings in 2010. But that is going to be offset by working capital. Working capital will be a use of cash as we, again, grow our working capital to support elevated demand levels. But remember now, that's coming off of a $618 million source of cash in 2009. So it makes the comparables a little bit hard to follow. The other area that's important, Jeff, to your question is the other operating accounts. And as you know, and you've asked me, I think, in the prior quarters, that's been a big line item for us in this year because of two things. One, we've had non-cash charges that are negative and the earnings have been positive and other operating because there is no cash associated with them. And second area is, as you would have expected, and as we did experience, we had lower promotional payments coming into the year, for sample. I mean that was roughly $100 million when you take our normal trended cash flow, better improvement in 2009 that won't be there in 2010. And of course, it wasn't there in the prior years before that. Pension funding, which was the third piece of your question, all of up, I think two things. One, we did make a voluntary pension contribution of $74 million, which is embedded in the 2009 cash flow. As a result of that, Jeff, we will have no required minimum contributions in 2010 for the U.S. pensions. We may, or may not, elect to fund some moneys. But again, there is no required minimums. When you look at the all up funding for -- let's go looking at pensions 401K  And I'll that's really the relevant question given the frozen status of our plans, we'll be at about 160 all in fundings for all benefit plans versus 290 in 2009."

In his new role, he will be accountable for our Europe, Latin America and Asia regions, as well as our global information systems. Mike is also accountable for several key global strategic areas, including our innovation and global energy efficiency initiatives.

Both Mike and Marc are two highly capable leaders, I'm very confident who will do a great good job in their new assignments and they'll be representing their respective region on this call.Turning to the release, as you all know, earlier this morning we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and for the full year. You can see these results on Slide 2. As we outlined for you last year at this time, we faced a very challenging macroeconomic environment on a number of fronts. All major markets were in decline at that time and we felt that we were likely facing the year with significant revenue decline, higher costs and volatile currencies. For the full year, this proved to be accurate as our revenues declined by 10% versus 2008 levels.We also, at that time, outlined the key drivers of our business and separated them into two categories. On one hand, we talked about areas that would positively impact our business and things that would negatively impact our business. The negative impacts were significantly lower demand levels, the impact of foreign currency and very volatile material costs. The positive impacts on our business related to our swift aggressive actions to address this challenging environment, particularly in regarding our cost and working capital initiatives. These actions helped improve our operating margins by 1.1 points to 4% during the year, despite a substantial decline in sales. In addition, we reported for the year a record level of free cash flow of $1.1 billion during 2009, which has significantly strengthened our company's financial position. If you turn to Slide 3, we highlight our execution against the key operating priorities that we established for last year. From a cost standpoint, we had a very strong year. We were able to significantly lower our breakeven point through structural cost reductions across our global organization. We also continue to build the foundation of a very strong global product platform designs and the supporting component harmonization initiatives that go along with them. These actions lowered our costs, improved our quality  and increased our speed to market from design to market launch. And overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in these areas of the business, which will continue to benefit us this year.Moving on to cash, again, we have the best year ever in terms of generating free cash flow. Our aggressive focus on working capital reduction, particularly in the area of inventory, resulted in a substantial source of cash flow during the year. This performance, in addition to our notes issuance and credit agreement extension, significantly improved our financial and liquidity positions. Finally, our market execution goals for the year were to have a good balance between price/mix and market share. And during 2009, we finished the year with positive price/mix and very good share performance in all of our key global markets.Slide 4 highlights one of the most important aspects of our spending initiatives last year. And in this case, as what we didn't cut, now is our investments in new product innovation. We continued to invest in our business during the downturn, as R&D and capital expenditures actually increased as a percent of total sales. These investments will yield a strong gains in new product innovations over the next 12 months and reflects the continued commitment we have to bringing new consumer-relevant innovation to the marketplace on a continuous basis. Turning to Slide 5, we expect to have a strong year for innovation with our pipeline now over $4 billion in future revenues. From a product perspective, you'll see major launches in laundry, cooking and refrigeration. In fact, Marc Bitzer will touch on a few of these products in a moment, that we expect to have a very strong year of innovation globally across our product lines. We do see many great opportunities for growth in markets around the world. We're largely enabled by this record number of new product innovation launches that we have scheduled for this year.On Slide 6 I summarize our current demand outlook for 2010. Overall, we expect global industry demand will show modest growth globally in 2010. Obviously, there's still a high degree of uncertainty in many facets of the global economy, but we do feel that we'll see in 2010 growth from a low base. In the U.S., we expect major appliance demand to increase by about 2% to 4%. This would mark the first full year of positive growth in four years, and is largely driven by a more normal replacement market. In Europe, we expect conditions will remain relatively more difficult, with industry demand being flat to 2009 levels. As you would expect, there's a wide range of outcomes by country. But overall, we're starting to see demand stabilizing, and are forecasting flat demand for the year. In Brazil, we continue to see very strong underlying fundamentals. And we're forecasting industry demand growth to be in the range of 5% to 10% off of a strong year this year. Finally, we expect the markets that we serve in Asia will grow in the 3% to 5% range. We expect India to continue to show very strong growth leading the region.Finally, I would direct your attention to Slide 7, where we provide our 2010 financial outlook and guidance. For the full year, we expect to generate earnings per share in the range of $6.50 to $7 per share. Also for the full year, we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $400 million to $500 million this year. We expect the positive impacts to our operating performance this year will be a continuation of the significant cost reduction, and productivity that we had last year, which again will be a significant contributor to our improvement in earnings. In addition, we certainly expect higher unit volumes will contribute in part to our overall revenue growth, and aid in improving our margins.For the full year, we expect price/mix, and currency impacts will be generally neutral to our operating results. And finally, on the unfavorable side, we still see material, and oil cost inflation increasing. And we expect it will impact our operating results in the $200 million to $300 million range compared to last year. At this point in time, I'd stop here, and I'll turn it over to Marc Bitzer for his review of our North American operations."

We also made strong progress reducing our cost structure, a double-digit reduction in manufacturing capacity, we reduced the SG&A structure by nearly $200 million or over one percentage point of sales. Finally, we saw a strong improvement in our logistics network. We have completed our move to a new regional distribution center footprint. We have implemented a new home delivery model that we believe is best in class in our industry. And we expect this will yield both better service level, as well as a reduction in delivery cost.

Our unit shipment growth exceeded the market growth. We reported operating margin of 5.2 percentage points, and that's a six-point improvement over the year before. And that is largely driven by cost, and productivity initiatives, and higher volume, and partially offset by lower price and mix.On Slide 11, you can see some of our newest innovations. As you know, we are focused on providing consumers with the greatest value by offering preferred brands they can depend on with the most innovative features in the most cost-efficient way possible. From a dishwasher and disposal cleaner, to a completely new side-by-side refrigerator platform, our cadence of new product introductions remains very strong. There's one product on this slide that I'll talk about in more detail. And that is our new Whirlpool brand, Vantage top-load laundry pair. You will see on the next slide that this product features an LCD touchscreen control, it's the industry-first USB port that allows consumers to update, and customize washing cycles and other controls. And finally, the fit, finish and design of its body is a leap forward from industry-setting class model. Turning now to our industry outlook for 2010 on Slide 12, I'll review some of the background on the components of demand. As part of our forecast, we expect to see a 27% increase in new housing starts, or approximately just slightly above 700,000 units. We expect existing home sales to improve approximately 7% during the year. And we're looking for consumer confidence to be stable to slightly up, and they will remain at historically low levels or slightly above that. Consumers are still very cautious, given many uncertainties in the economy. And we expect that to remain the case as our 10% unemployment assumptions. So while general consumers' uneasiness lingers, we expect stable replacement demand for the year versus some delay purchases during the beginning of 2009.So summarizing, based on our current estimates of these economic variables, we believe the U.S. industry demand will increase 2% to 4% in 2010, which is still well below historic or long-term trend demand levels. And now, I would like to turn it over to Mike for his review of international operations."

Let me begin with a general overview on Slide 14. During 2009, we saw our return to strong economic growth in Brazil and India. These markets not only had a much faster return to general economic growth rates, but",734,"Thanks, Marc. And good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a general overview on Slide 14. During 2009, we saw our return to strong economic growth in Brazil and India. These markets not only had a much faster return to general economic growth rates, but they also saw appliance demand return to growth rates well above the general economy. Europe remained the most challenging region from an international perspective, as we managed through a broad contraction in both economies. From a Whirlpool perspective, we focused significant restructuring resources on the European region during the fourth quarter to better align our cost structure with industry demand levels and ensure an appropriate structure for 2010 and beyond. Overall, during 2009, we made strong progress toward our cost reduction goals across the region and strengthened our share position.Turning to Slide 15, our European sales improved 2% in the quarter. In local currency, sales declined approximately 9% from the prior year. Our unit shipments declined approximately 9% year-over-year, which was largely in line with the estimated industry demand levels during the quarter. The region reported an operating profit of $19 million compared with the $2 million earned in 2008. Results were unfavorably impacted by lower volumes, while lower costs and higher-priced product mix partially offset these challenges. While we have taken necessary actions and made progress in our European region, results remained below satisfactory levels and we will continue to adjust our cost structure accordingly.Fourth quarter results from our Latin American business can be found on Slide 16. The region reported sales of $1.2 billion compared to $777 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact from currency, sales increased approximately 28%. The sales increase was driven by favorable foreign currency exchange and strong demand for our appliances in the Brazilian market. Results were partially offset by lower tax credit monetization levels and product price/mix. Operating profit totaled $138 million compared to $110 million reported during the prior-year period. Our fourth quarter results in the Asia region are showed on Slide 17. Net sales increased 34% during the quarter to $188 million, up from $140 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 27% compared with the prior-year period. The sales increase was driven by strong results across the region. With our new industrial joint venture in China and our strong presence in India, we are well positioned to benefit from the growth trends in these markets. Operating profit during the quarter was $6 million compared with $3 million reported in the prior year. The operational improvement was primarily related to higher unit volumes. These improvements were partially offset by lower price/mix.A few minutes ago, Marc talked about our ongoing investment in our brand portfolio and strong cadence of new product introductions. That is the case not just in North America but around the world, as we continue to provide consumer-relevant innovations to consumers everywhere. On Slide 18, you will see just a few of our international product launches. Slide 19 summarizes our outlook for our international operations. Overall, appliance industry demand in Brazil and India remains strong, and ahead of general economic growth rates. We are seeing some commonalities in both these markets, including improved affordability, a developing middle class, a low base of appliance penetration rates compared to the U.S. and Europe and solid economic fundamentals. These factors, combined with Brazil's applied stimulus program, have strengthened our position in those markets. The Brazil stimulus program ended effective February 1. Although we do not yet understand the impact of this change, it is important to note that all trade inventory prior to that date still qualifies for the tax holiday.In addition, we believe that the underlying demand is strong, irrespective of the stimulus program because of low interest rates, and underlying economic conditions. And we continue to be very positive about the prospects for our Latin American business in 2010.In Europe, however, we expect demand to stabilize during 2010, and we continue to pursue aggressive actions to improve our results in the region. And finally, in Asia, our strong performance in the quarter highlights the early success of our joint venture that allows us to continue to add new product offerings. And we see significant growth opportunities in the region, particularly in India and China. And now with that, I'd like to turn it over to Roy Templin for his financial review."

Beginning on Slide 21, I'll walk you through a summary of our fourth quarter performance. Our net sales performance marked the first global unit volume increase we have had since the first quarter of 2007, with",1023,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 21, I'll walk you through a summary of our fourth quarter performance. Our net sales performance marked the first global unit volume increase we have had since the first quarter of 2007, with our units increasing approximately 9½% from the prior year. Our revenue was also favorably impacted by foreign exchange translation, which accounted for approximately seven points of the year-over-year increase. The favorable impact from currency was primarily related to a stronger Brazilian real, and the euro when compared to the prior year. Looking at our margins during the fourth quarter, the positive year-over-year increase was primarily from our productivity, and cost reduction actions. These actions were partially offset by lower price/mix, and BEFIEX monetization, which declined $21 million from the prior year.Finally, before we take a look at the income statement in detail, there are a few items I would like to highlight. The first is a $46 million accrual related to a previously disclosed legal action pertaining to a collection dispute in Brazil. This was recorded in interest and sundry expense. The second item related to interest and sundry was a $13 million expense related to previously capitalized transaction costs. We also recorded a net favorable $13 million adjustment related to operating and income tax settlements in Brazil in response to revised government options.Turning to the income statement on Slide 22, we reported net sales of just over $4.8 billion, an increase of 13% from the prior year. Our gross margin rose 3.1 points to a 14.1%. As I mentioned previously, the most significant favorable impact on our gross margin improvement related to our cost and productivity actions, which were partially offset by lower price/mix.SG&A expense totaled $427 million. Foreign currency translation and the non-recurrence of an asset sale gain in the prior year accounted for over 90% of the year-over-year dollar increase. Restructuring expenses totaled $55 million during the quarter and were largely related to cost reduction actions in Europe. We currently anticipate recording restructuring expenses in the $100 million range during 2010. This amount will be partially offset by curtailment gains due to a previously announced facility closure.  Finally, our operating margin expanded to 4.1% from 0.2% in the prior year. Turning to Slide 23, I wanted to touch briefly on interest expense. Related to the revised tax settlement terms in Brazil, noted in my earlier remarks, part of the settlement adjustment was recorded in interest expense. Excluding this settlement, our interest expense would have increased mainly due to higher average borrowing rates due to our notes issuance during the second quarter.Turning to interest and sundry expense, the items I mentioned earlier substantially offset favorable year-over-year currency resulting from prior-year losses on balance sheet positions and an asset impairment, again recorded in the prior year.Finally, turning to our tax rate. We recorded an income tax credit of $10 million during the quarter, corresponding to an effective tax rate benefit of 11%. The fourth quarter credit was slightly below our previous quarterly expectation, largely as a result of higher pre-tax income and the establishment of reserves for foreign tax audits. Our annual tax credit of 21% fell within our previously disclosed range. For the full year 2010, we are currently estimating a tax credit in the range of 15% to 25%.  Finally, we reported EPS of $1.24 per share, including a $0.40 per share negative impact from the legal accrual that I noted earlier.Moving to our full year free cash flow results on Slide 24. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we had an outstanding year. The strong working capital performance during the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations in every part of the world. As a percentage of sales, our full year free cash flow was 6.4%, which is well ahead of our long-term objective in the 4% to 5% range.Our full year free cash flow generation of approximately $1.1 billion, in addition to our term note issuance during the second quarter and the extension of our revolving credit facility through August of 2012, has substantially improved our financial position.Turning to Slide 25, we show our net liquidity position. As you can see from this chart, our net liquidity position has improved to approximately $3.3 billion from $2.1 billion at the end of 2008. At year end, our cash balance stood at $1.4 billion and we had full availability under our revolving credit facility.On Slide 26, you can see we have significantly reduced our net debt balance to the lowest level in four years. We feel very good about our ability to continue to fund our restructuring and product innovation initiatives. We have also consistently paid our dividend throughout 2009. After funding these operating initiatives, a key priority going forward is improving our credit metrics with the goal of returning our credit ratings to pre-recession levels.Finally, turning to our financial outlook on Slide 27, we are expecting to report earnings per share in the range of $6.50 and $7 per share. This compares to the $4.34 we reported for 2009. As Jeff reviewed previously, we expect to have favorable impacts from increased global unit volume, as well as our ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives. In addition to these factors, the Brazilian government recently announced that it will not renew the IPI tax holiday program that has been renewed several times since mid-April. While there will likely be some lag until all lower IPI-based products clears the inventory pipe, as Mike referenced earlier, we have anticipated this change in our outlook.From a headwind perspective, we are assuming material and oil-related costs to increase in the range of $200 million to $300 million in 2010. And turning to our cash flow outlook, we are projecting free cash flow between $400 million to $500 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million during the year. After our strong working capital performance in 2009, and with our expectation of higher global unit volumes, we expect working capital will be a use of cash during 2010. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

As you will notice, many of these priorities remain unchanged for what we outlined for 2009. We continue to have a very strong focus on cost reduction across our global enterprise. As Roy previously mentioned, we'll be taking additional restructuring actions during 2010 from previously announced actions, as well as some new actions to continue to drive lower structural costs, lower capacity levels and taking productivity and other cost initiatives to offset material costs. In total, we think we will be able to expand our operating margins from our cost activities. Cash flow also remains a very high priority for us in 2010. As we mentioned, we had a record year for cash flow last year, and we expect to generate solid free cash flow during 2010. This is despite our expectation that we will have some working capital build during the course of the year, as we return to sales growth. And certainly, given the amount of uncertainty that remains across the globe, and the effects that we've seen over the last year of the global financial crisis, you should expect that we will carry a higher cash balance over the course of the year than we maybe historically have, and we think it's appropriate in this period of time. From a market execution standpoint, we will continue to balance our share of price/mix as we manage our business in 2010. We feel very good about our innovation pipeline, and the cadence of new products that we’re bringing to market during the course of the year. We expect these new products to help us build our branded position during the year. Our successful execution on these priorities will enable us to deliver strong earnings growth during the course of the year. I'd now like to turn to Slide 30, and take a moment to discuss our long-term value creating objectives. We view 2010 as a year of full recovery for our company, where we regain a large portion of our revenues that declined in both '08 and '09, and improving our operating margins. From this base we expect to build in 2010, we're re-committing to our value-creation objectives for revenue, for earnings and for cash. And that means, from a top line perspective, we would expect to continue to target annual sales growth in the 5% to 7% range, earnings growth in the 10% to 15% range and continue to improve our free cash flow as a percentage to sales and try to manage it between the 4% to 5% range. We are emerging from one of the most challenging economic environments that we've seen in decades. I think the very strong message for us is that I believe we are emerging this period as a much stronger company. We have substantially lowered our break even point, substantially improved our financial strength and expect to bring a very strong cadence of new products to the market during 2010 and beyond. While the economy remains volatile, we feel we are well positioned to meet our long-term value creating objectives and we'll reposition ourselves for significant values for our shareholders in 2010 and beyond. I'm going to end here. And I'd now like to open this up to call out for any questions you may have."

If you remember, the IPI tax holiday was actually put on in April of 2009. And we still saw growth in the Brazil business of over 30%, which essentially says that it was not -- that growth rate was not all driven just from the IPI tax. Now they've just repealed the, if you will, that tax. So it's hard for us to know exactly what the outcome's going to be. But suffice it to say, there's probably about 30 to 45 days of inventory in the system that will qualify for the tax. And then after that, our view is that the underlying economics, both with low interest rates and the general economic conditions, is going to drive favorable -- could continue to drive a favorable market environment for us. So I feel pretty confident about that. The other piece is that we've got the International businesses, the Chiles and Colombias, et cetera, which as you know were down significantly in 2009.

And last year, 2009, was our third year in a row where we've been able to manage positive price mix in a very competitive global marketplace. So our attention is no different in 2010. I would also say that every year, we get there in a different way, would it be the pricing, or like-for-like pricing, regional and product and brand mix and that sort of thing. Way I would describe it is that the story for 2010 is a little bit different. In some high-inflation markets like India, we've already announced and taken price increase for 2010. We did that in December. In other regions like Europe, we finished the year driving very positive price mix. The U.S. gets a lot of attention where we had negative price mix in the fourth quarter. Again, we're very pleased with where we are today. Last year, in the first half of the year and fourth quarter of '08, we have some very high comparisons year over year so we're topping against our highest levels the previous year. And I see innovation as being the driver of our ability to drive mix in the U.S. So if you put them all together, it's hard to predict at the beginning of the year but we have -- and given our track record over the last three years, I feel pretty good that we're going to be able to manage that at least to neutral for 2010."

But net-net, it's about $60 million a quarter. Interest in sundry, you're right. We've had some one-time events this year, particularly with -- now this legal dispute in the fourth quarter and of course the compressor settlement earlier in year. Laura, you know over the years, our other income, other expense or interest in sundry has been about $50 million to $60 million of expense. If you wanted to increase that somewhat for higher legal cost related to compressor investigation, that might be prudent to do so, which might take you to more of a run rate like $70 million  to $80 million as you look at going forward in the very near term. From a tax rate perspective, again, I said in my script, that we're projecting the tax rate for next year at about the same level of credit that we had this year. Now initially, that may not seem real intuitive but there's two cases, Laura, that really offset one another: One is, logically, the credit would get smaller year-over-year because we're going to have a much higher base of earnings. And therefore, that brings down the overall credit that we have as a company. Offsetting that though, Laura, are two things: One, we do think that given the innovation and the energy efficiency backed around the innovation that will deliver the market in 2010, that we will earn higher energy tax credits. And as Mike indicated earlier, now with the repeal of the IPI tax holiday while we -- will be some volume impact from that, we do expect to see and experience higher BPX tax credit in Brazil in 2010."

And so what you're seeing is, it's the impact of the mix of business we had.

So as you look at the value creation objectives as Jeff shared, obviously,  you get the higher margin. As you know, Jeff, our principal sort of year in and year out, the principal pipe for cash flow in any business, of course, if your after tax earnings. And so that's a very important element with respect to that. I'll come back to the second part of your question now. In your right, as you look at next year's guidance, it sort of falls in the level of what we've seen combined the last two years. I think it's couple of key things. One is we are expecting and of course, it's clear in the guidance that add higher cash earnings in 2010. But that is going to be offset by working capital. Working capital will be a use of cash as we, again, grow our working capital to support elevated demand levels. But remember now, that's coming off of a $618 million source of cash in 2009. So it makes the comparables a little bit hard to follow. The other area that's important, Jeff, to your question is the other operating accounts. And as you know, and you've asked me, I think, in the prior quarters, that's been a big line item for us in this year because of two things. One, we've had non-cash charges that are negative and the earnings have been positive and other operating because there is no cash associated with them. And second area is, as you would have expected, and as we did experience, we had lower promotional payments coming into the year, for sample. I mean that was roughly $100 million when you take our normal trended cash flow, better improvement in 2009 that won't be there in 2010. And of course, it wasn't there in the prior years before that. Pension funding, which was the third piece of your question, all of up, I think two things. One, we did make a voluntary pension contribution of $74 million, which is embedded in the 2009 cash flow. As a result of that, Jeff, we will have no required minimum contributions in 2010 for the U.S. pensions. We may, or may not, elect to fund some moneys. But again, there is no required minimums. When you look at the all up funding for -- let's go looking at pensions 401K  And I'll that's really the relevant question given the frozen status of our plans, we'll be at about 160 all in fundings for all benefit plans versus 290 in 2009."

First of all, Mike Todman, who was previously President of North America is now serving as President of Whirlpool International. In his new role, he will be accountable for our Europe, Latin America and Asia regions, as well as our global information systems. Mike is also accountable for several key global strategic areas, including our innovation and global energy efficiency initiatives. Marc Bitzer, who was previously President of our U.S. Operations has moved into the role of President, North America. Both Mike and Marc are two highly capable leaders, I'm very confident who will do a great good job in their new assignments and they'll be representing their respective region on this call.Turning to the release, as you all know, earlier this morning we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and for the full year. You can see these results on Slide 2. As we outlined for you last year at this time, we faced a very challenging macroeconomic environment on a number of fronts. All major markets were in decline at that time and we felt that we were likely facing the year with significant revenue decline, higher costs and volatile currencies. For the full year, this proved to be accurate as our revenues declined by 10% versus 2008 levels.We also, at that time, outlined the key drivers of our business and separated them into two categories. On one hand, we talked about areas that would positively impact our business and things that would negatively impact our business. The negative impacts were significantly lower demand levels, the impact of foreign currency and very volatile material costs. The positive impacts on our business related to our swift aggressive actions to address this challenging environment, particularly in regarding our cost and working capital initiatives. These actions helped improve our operating margins by 1.1 points to 4% during the year, despite a substantial decline in sales. In addition, we reported for the year a record level of free cash flow of $1.1 billion during 2009, which has significantly strengthened our company's financial position. If you turn to Slide 3, we highlight our execution against the key operating priorities that we established for last year. From a cost standpoint, we had a very strong year. We were able to significantly lower our breakeven point through structural cost reductions across our global organization. We also continue to build the foundation of a very strong global product platform designs and the supporting component harmonization initiatives that go along with them. These actions lowered our costs, improved our quality  and increased our speed to market from design to market launch. And overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in these areas of the business, which will continue to benefit us this year.Moving on to cash, again, we have the best year ever in terms of generating free cash flow. Our aggressive focus on working capital reduction, particularly in the area of inventory, resulted in a substantial source of cash flow during the year. This performance, in addition to our notes issuance and credit agreement extension, significantly improved our financial and liquidity positions. Finally, our market execution goals for the year were to have a good balance between price/mix and market share. And during 2009, we finished the year with positive price/mix and very good share performance in all of our key global markets.Slide 4 highlights one of the most important aspects of our spending initiatives last year. And in this case, as what we didn't cut, now is our investments in new product innovation. We continued to invest in our business during the downturn, as R&D and capital expenditures actually increased as a percent of total sales. These investments will yield a strong gains in new product innovations over the next 12 months and reflects the continued commitment we have to bringing new consumer-relevant innovation to the marketplace on a continuous basis. Turning to Slide 5, we expect to have a strong year for innovation with our pipeline now over $4 billion in future revenues. From a product perspective, you'll see major launches in laundry, cooking and refrigeration. In fact, Marc Bitzer will touch on a few of these products in a moment, that we expect to have a very strong year of innovation globally across our product lines. We do see many great opportunities for growth in markets around the world. We're largely enabled by this record number of new product innovation launches that we have scheduled for this year.On Slide 6 I summarize our current demand outlook for 2010. Overall, we expect global industry demand will show modest growth globally in 2010. Obviously, there's still a high degree of uncertainty in many facets of the global economy, but we do feel that we'll see in 2010 growth from a low base. In the U.S., we expect major appliance demand to increase by about 2% to 4%. This would mark the first full year of positive growth in four years, and is largely driven by a more normal replacement market. In Europe, we expect conditions will remain relatively more difficult, with industry demand being flat to 2009 levels. As you would expect, there's a wide range of outcomes by country. But overall, we're starting to see demand stabilizing, and are forecasting flat demand for the year. In Brazil, we continue to see very strong underlying fundamentals. And we're forecasting industry demand growth to be in the range of 5% to 10% off of a strong year this year. Finally, we expect the markets that we serve in Asia will grow in the 3% to 5% range. We expect India to continue to show very strong growth leading the region.Finally, I would direct your attention to Slide 7, where we provide our 2010 financial outlook and guidance. For the full year, we expect to generate earnings per share in the range of $6.50 to $7 per share. Also for the full year, we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $400 million to $500 million this year. We expect the positive impacts to our operating performance this year will be a continuation of the significant cost reduction, and productivity that we had last year, which again will be a significant contributor to our improvement in earnings. In addition, we certainly expect higher unit volumes will contribute in part to our overall revenue growth, and aid in improving our margins.For the full year, we expect price/mix, and currency impacts will be generally neutral to our operating results. And finally, on the unfavorable side, we still see material, and oil cost inflation increasing. And we expect it will impact our operating results in the $200 million to $300 million range compared to last year. At this point in time, I'd stop here, and I'll turn it over to Marc Bitzer for his review of our North American operations."

I would like to briefly go over some of our key accomplishments from 2009. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we maintained a strong commitment to innovation investment, both in the form of R&D, and capital expenses. And from a market standpoint, we delivered a strong increase in our branded share during the year, and during Q4 in particular. We also made strong progress reducing our cost structure, a double-digit reduction in manufacturing capacity, we reduced the SG&A structure by nearly $200 million or over one percentage point of sales. Finally, we saw a strong improvement in our logistics network. We have completed our move to a new regional distribution center footprint. We have implemented a new home delivery model that we believe is best in class in our industry. And we expect this will yield both better service level, as well as a reduction in delivery cost. On Slide 10, we detailed fourth quarter results for North America. We marked the first quarter since Q1'07 that we posted a year-over-year sales increase in North America. Our unit shipment growth exceeded the market growth. We reported operating margin of 5.2 percentage points, and that's a six-point improvement over the year before. And that is largely driven by cost, and productivity initiatives, and higher volume, and partially offset by lower price and mix.On Slide 11, you can see some of our newest innovations. As you know, we are focused on providing consumers with the greatest value by offering preferred brands they can depend on with the most innovative features in the most cost-efficient way possible. From a dishwasher and disposal cleaner, to a completely new side-by-side refrigerator platform, our cadence of new product introductions remains very strong. There's one product on this slide that I'll talk about in more detail. And that is our new Whirlpool brand, Vantage top-load laundry pair. You will see on the next slide that this product features an LCD touchscreen control, it's the industry-first USB port that allows consumers to update, and customize washing cycles and other controls. And finally, the fit, finish and design of its body is a leap forward from industry-setting class model. Turning now to our industry outlook for 2010 on Slide 12, I'll review some of the background on the components of demand. As part of our forecast, we expect to see a 27% increase in new housing starts, or approximately just slightly above 700,000 units. We expect existing home sales to improve approximately 7% during the year. And we're looking for consumer confidence to be stable to slightly up, and they will remain at historically low levels or slightly above that. Consumers are still very cautious, given many uncertainties in the economy. And we expect that to remain the case as our 10% unemployment assumptions. So while general consumers' uneasiness lingers, we expect stable replacement demand for the year versus some delay purchases during the beginning of 2009.So summarizing, based on our current estimates of these economic variables, we believe the U.S. industry demand will increase 2% to 4% in 2010, which is still well below historic or long-term trend demand levels. And now, I would like to turn it over to Mike for his review of international operations."

Let me begin with a general overview on Slide 14. During 2009, we saw our return to strong economic growth in Brazil and India. These markets not only had a much faster return to general economic growth rates, but",734,"Thanks, Marc. And good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a general overview on Slide 14. During 2009, we saw our return to strong economic growth in Brazil and India. These markets not only had a much faster return to general economic growth rates, but they also saw appliance demand return to growth rates well above the general economy. Europe remained the most challenging region from an international perspective, as we managed through a broad contraction in both economies. From a Whirlpool perspective, we focused significant restructuring resources on the European region during the fourth quarter to better align our cost structure with industry demand levels and ensure an appropriate structure for 2010 and beyond. Overall, during 2009, we made strong progress toward our cost reduction goals across the region and strengthened our share position.Turning to Slide 15, our European sales improved 2% in the quarter. In local currency, sales declined approximately 9% from the prior year. Our unit shipments declined approximately 9% year-over-year, which was largely in line with the estimated industry demand levels during the quarter. The region reported an operating profit of $19 million compared with the $2 million earned in 2008. Results were unfavorably impacted by lower volumes, while lower costs and higher-priced product mix partially offset these challenges. While we have taken necessary actions and made progress in our European region, results remained below satisfactory levels and we will continue to adjust our cost structure accordingly.Fourth quarter results from our Latin American business can be found on Slide 16. The region reported sales of $1.2 billion compared to $777 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact from currency, sales increased approximately 28%. The sales increase was driven by favorable foreign currency exchange and strong demand for our appliances in the Brazilian market. Results were partially offset by lower tax credit monetization levels and product price/mix. Operating profit totaled $138 million compared to $110 million reported during the prior-year period. Our fourth quarter results in the Asia region are showed on Slide 17. Net sales increased 34% during the quarter to $188 million, up from $140 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 27% compared with the prior-year period. The sales increase was driven by strong results across the region. With our new industrial joint venture in China and our strong presence in India, we are well positioned to benefit from the growth trends in these markets. Operating profit during the quarter was $6 million compared with $3 million reported in the prior year. The operational improvement was primarily related to higher unit volumes. These improvements were partially offset by lower price/mix.A few minutes ago, Marc talked about our ongoing investment in our brand portfolio and strong cadence of new product introductions. That is the case not just in North America but around the world, as we continue to provide consumer-relevant innovations to consumers everywhere. On Slide 18, you will see just a few of our international product launches. Slide 19 summarizes our outlook for our international operations. Overall, appliance industry demand in Brazil and India remains strong, and ahead of general economic growth rates. We are seeing some commonalities in both these markets, including improved affordability, a developing middle class, a low base of appliance penetration rates compared to the U.S. and Europe and solid economic fundamentals. These factors, combined with Brazil's applied stimulus program, have strengthened our position in those markets. The Brazil stimulus program ended effective February 1. Although we do not yet understand the impact of this change, it is important to note that all trade inventory prior to that date still qualifies for the tax holiday.In addition, we believe that the underlying demand is strong, irrespective of the stimulus program because of low interest rates, and underlying economic conditions. And we continue to be very positive about the prospects for our Latin American business in 2010.In Europe, however, we expect demand to stabilize during 2010, and we continue to pursue aggressive actions to improve our results in the region. And finally, in Asia, our strong performance in the quarter highlights the early success of our joint venture that allows us to continue to add new product offerings. And we see significant growth opportunities in the region, particularly in India and China. And now with that, I'd like to turn it over to Roy Templin for his financial review."

Beginning on Slide 21, I'll walk you through a summary of our fourth quarter performance. Our net sales performance marked the first global unit volume increase we have had since the first quarter of 2007, with",1023,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 21, I'll walk you through a summary of our fourth quarter performance. Our net sales performance marked the first global unit volume increase we have had since the first quarter of 2007, with our units increasing approximately 9½% from the prior year. Our revenue was also favorably impacted by foreign exchange translation, which accounted for approximately seven points of the year-over-year increase. The favorable impact from currency was primarily related to a stronger Brazilian real, and the euro when compared to the prior year. Looking at our margins during the fourth quarter, the positive year-over-year increase was primarily from our productivity, and cost reduction actions. These actions were partially offset by lower price/mix, and BEFIEX monetization, which declined $21 million from the prior year.Finally, before we take a look at the income statement in detail, there are a few items I would like to highlight. The first is a $46 million accrual related to a previously disclosed legal action pertaining to a collection dispute in Brazil. This was recorded in interest and sundry expense. The second item related to interest and sundry was a $13 million expense related to previously capitalized transaction costs. We also recorded a net favorable $13 million adjustment related to operating and income tax settlements in Brazil in response to revised government options.Turning to the income statement on Slide 22, we reported net sales of just over $4.8 billion, an increase of 13% from the prior year. Our gross margin rose 3.1 points to a 14.1%. As I mentioned previously, the most significant favorable impact on our gross margin improvement related to our cost and productivity actions, which were partially offset by lower price/mix.SG&A expense totaled $427 million. Foreign currency translation and the non-recurrence of an asset sale gain in the prior year accounted for over 90% of the year-over-year dollar increase. Restructuring expenses totaled $55 million during the quarter and were largely related to cost reduction actions in Europe. We currently anticipate recording restructuring expenses in the $100 million range during 2010. This amount will be partially offset by curtailment gains due to a previously announced facility closure.  Finally, our operating margin expanded to 4.1% from 0.2% in the prior year. Turning to Slide 23, I wanted to touch briefly on interest expense. Related to the revised tax settlement terms in Brazil, noted in my earlier remarks, part of the settlement adjustment was recorded in interest expense. Excluding this settlement, our interest expense would have increased mainly due to higher average borrowing rates due to our notes issuance during the second quarter.Turning to interest and sundry expense, the items I mentioned earlier substantially offset favorable year-over-year currency resulting from prior-year losses on balance sheet positions and an asset impairment, again recorded in the prior year.Finally, turning to our tax rate. We recorded an income tax credit of $10 million during the quarter, corresponding to an effective tax rate benefit of 11%. The fourth quarter credit was slightly below our previous quarterly expectation, largely as a result of higher pretax income and the establishment of reserves for foreign tax audits. Our annual tax credit of 21% fell within our previously disclosed range. For the full year 2010, we are currently estimating a tax credit in the range of 15% to 25%.  Finally, we reported EPS of $1.24 per share, including a $0.40 per share negative impact from the legal accrual that I noted earlier.Moving to our full year free cash flow results on Slide 24. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we had an outstanding year. The strong working capital performance during the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations in every part of the world. As a percentage of sales, our full year free cash flow was 6.4%, which is well ahead of our long-term objective in the 4% to 5% range.Our full year free cash flow generation of approximately $1.1 billion, in addition to our term note issuance during the second quarter and the extension of our revolving credit facility through August of 2012, has substantially improved our financial position.Turning to Slide 25, we show our net liquidity position. As you can see from this chart, our net liquidity position has improved to approximately $3.3 billion from $2.1 billion at the end of 2008. At year end, our cash balance stood at $1.4 billion and we had full availability under our revolving credit facility.On Slide 26, you can see we have significantly reduced our net debt balance to the lowest level in four years. We feel very good about our ability to continue to fund our restructuring and product innovation initiatives. We have also consistently paid our dividend throughout 2009. After funding these operating initiatives, a key priority going forward is improving our credit metrics with the goal of returning our credit ratings to pre-recession levels.Finally, turning to our financial outlook on Slide 27, we are expecting to report earnings per share in the range of $6.50 and $7 per share. This compares to the $4.34 we reported for 2009. As Jeff reviewed previously, we expect to have favorable impacts from increased global unit volume, as well as our ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives. In addition to these factors, the Brazilian government recently announced that it will not renew the IPI tax holiday program that has been renewed several times since mid-April. While there will likely be some lag until all lower IPI-based products clears the inventory pipe, as Mike referenced earlier, we have anticipated this change in our outlook.From a headwind perspective, we are assuming material and oil-related costs to increase in the range of $200 million to $300 million in 2010. And turning to our cash flow outlook, we are projecting free cash flow between $400 million to $500 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million during the year. After our strong working capital performance in 2009, and with our expectation of higher global unit volumes, we expect working capital will be a use of cash during 2010. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

As you will notice, many of these priorities remain unchanged for what we outlined for 2009. We continue to have a very strong focus on cost reduction across our global enterprise. As Roy previously mentioned, we'll be taking additional restructuring actions during 2010 from previously announced actions, as well as some new actions to continue to drive lower structural costs, lower capacity levels and taking productivity and other cost initiatives to offset material costs. In total, we think we will be able to expand our operating margins from our cost activities. Cash flow also remains a very high priority for us in 2010. As we mentioned, we had a record year for cash flow last year, and we expect to generate solid free cash flow during 2010. This is despite our expectation that we will have some working capital build during the course of the year, as we return to sales growth. And certainly, given the amount of uncertainty that remains across the globe, and the effects that we've seen over the last year of the global financial crisis, you should expect that we will carry a higher cash balance over the course of the year than we maybe historically have, and we think it's appropriate in this period of time. From a market execution standpoint, we will continue to balance our share of price/mix as we manage our business in 2010. We feel very good about our innovation pipeline, and the cadence of new products that we’re bringing to market during the course of the year. We expect these new products to help us build our branded position during the year. Our successful execution on these priorities will enable us to deliver strong earnings growth during the course of the year. I'd now like to turn to Slide 30, and take a moment to discuss our long-term value creating objectives. We view 2010 as a year of full recovery for our company, where we regain a large portion of our revenues that declined in both '08 and '09, and improving our operating margins. From this base we expect to build in 2010, we're re-committing to our value-creation objectives for revenue, for earnings and for cash. And that means, from a top line perspective, we would expect to continue to target annual sales growth in the 5% to 7% range, earnings growth in the 10% to 15% range and continue to improve our free cash flow as a percentage to sales and try to manage it between the 4% to 5% range. We are emerging from one of the most challenging economic environments that we've seen in decades. I think the very strong message for us is that I believe we are emerging this period as a much stronger company. We have substantially lowered our break even point, substantially improved our financial strength and expect to bring a very strong cadence of new products to the market during 2010 and beyond. While the economy remains volatile, we feel we are well positioned to meet our long-term value creating objectives and we'll reposition ourselves for significant values for our shareholders in 2010 and beyond. I'm going to end here. And I'd now like to open this up to call out for any questions you may have."

If you remember, the IPI tax holiday was actually put on in April of 2009. And we still saw growth in the Brazil business of over 30%, which essentially says that it was not -- that growth rate was not all driven just from the IPI tax. Now they've just repealed the, if you will, that tax. So it's hard for us to know exactly what the outcome's going to be. But suffice it to say, there's probably about 30 to 45 days of inventory in the system that will qualify for the tax. And then after that, our view is that the underlying economics, both with low interest rates and the general economic conditions, is going to drive favorable -- could continue to drive a favorable market environment for us. So I feel pretty confident about that. The other piece is that we've got the International businesses, the Chiles and Colombias, et cetera, which as you know were down significantly in 2009. And we expect to have some recovery in those markets. So I can't give you an exact number of what the IPI tax drove, but we feel very comfortable about the 5% to 10% range."

First of all, we view managing price mix as very important capability to our global operations. And last year, 2009, was our third year in a row where we've been able to manage positive price mix in a very competitive global marketplace. So our attention is no different in 2010. I would also say that every year, we get there in a different way, whether it be price or like-for-like pricing, regional and product and brand mix and that sort of thing. Way I would describe it is that the story for 2010 is a little bit different. In some high-inflation markets like India, we've already announced and taken a price increase for 2010. We did that in December. In other regions like Europe, we finished the year driving very positive price mix. The U.S. gets a lot of attention where we had negative price mix in the fourth quarter. Again, we're very pleased with where we are today. Last year, in the first half of the year and fourth quarter of '08, we had some very high comparisons year over year so we're topping against our highest levels the previous year. And I see innovation as being the driver of our ability to drive mix in the U.S. So if you put it all together, it's hard to predict at the beginning of the year, but we have -- and given our track record over the last three years, I feel pretty good that we're going to be able to manage that at least to neutral for 2010."

And I think I've said on prior calls, the normal run rate for us right now with the base of interest we have is about $60 million a quarter or $240 million for the year. Now, Laura, we obviously have the capability to use cash should we decide to do so in the 1st of May, when our $325 million, 8% senior note becomes due. Obviously, if we use cash, that will change the trend that I've just given you, but net-net, it's about $60 million a quarter. Interest in sundry, you're right. We've had some one-time events this year, particularly with -- now this legal dispute in the fourth quarter and, of course, the compressor settlement earlier in year. Laura, you know over the years, our other income, other expense or interest in sundry has been about $50 million to $60 million of expense. If you wanted to increase that somewhat for higher legal cost related to compressor investigation, that might be prudent to do so, which might take you to more of a run rate like $70 million to $80 million as you look at going forward in the very near term. From a tax rate perspective, again, I said in my script, that we're projecting the tax rate for next year at about the same level of credit that we had this year. Now initially, that may not seem real intuitive, but there's two pieces, Laura, that really offset one another: One is, logically, the credit would get smaller year-over-year because we're going to have a much higher base of earnings. And therefore, that brings down the overall credit that we have as a company. Offsetting that though, Laura, are two things: One, we do think that given the innovation and the energy efficiency wrapped around the innovation that will deliver the market in 2010, that we will earn higher energy tax credits. And as Mike indicated earlier, now with the repeal of the IPI tax holiday while we -- there'll be some volume impact from that, we do expect to see and experience higher BPX tax credits in Brazil in 2010."

I'll speak just a moment for Latin America, and then let Marc Bitzer make some general comments about North America. And also, I'll mention Europe. Europe, obviously, kind of hit the low point. They were negative in second quarter of last year. They've improved every quarter since. So obviously, we're expecting a good improvement in Europe. Latin America is at a very strong level. In fact, x BPX [business process expert], they're at or near some of our highest margins ever, but yet given the robustness in that economy, given our market position and our product pipeline of innovation, we expect to continue to improve our operating margins.

And here it is, Jeff. If you look carefully at the last extension, they basically did the extension by energy efficiency category. They had categories A through E, more energy-efficient to less energy efficient. So on those lesser energy-efficient models, the holiday went away. And so what you're seeing is, it's the impact of the mix of business we had.

So as you look at the value creation objectives as Jeff shared, obviously,  you get the higher margin. As you know, Jeff, our principal sort of year in and year out, the principal pipe for cash flow in any business, of course, if your after tax earnings. And so that's a very important element with respect to that. I'll come back to the second part of your question now. In your right, as you look at next year's guidance, it sort of falls in the level of what we've seen combined the last two years. I think it's couple of key things. One is we are expecting and of course, it's clear in the guidance that add higher cash earnings in 2010. But that is going to be offset by working capital. Working capital will be a use of cash as we, again, grow our working capital to support elevated demand levels. But remember now, that's coming off of a $618 million source of cash in 2009. So it makes the comparables a little bit hard to follow. The other area that's important, Jeff, to your question is the other operating accounts. And as you know, and you've asked me, I think, in the prior quarters, that's been a big line item for us in this year because of two things. One, we've had non-cash charges that are negative and the earnings have been positive and other operating because there is no cash associated with them. And second area is, as you would have expected, and as we did experience, we had lower promotional payments coming into the year, for sample. I mean that was roughly $100 million when you take our normal trended cash flow, better improvement in 2009 that won't be there in 2010. And of course, it wasn't there in the prior years before that. Pension funding, which was the third piece of your question, all of up, I think two things. One, we did make a voluntary pension contribution of $74 million, which is embedded in the 2009 cash flow. As a result of that, Jeff, we will have no required minimum contributions in 2010 for the U.S. pensions. We may, or may not, elect to fund some moneys. But again, there is no required minimums. When you look at the all up funding for -- let's go looking at pensions 401K  And I'll that's really the relevant question given the frozen status of our plans, we'll be at about 160 all in fundings for all benefit plans versus 290 in 2009."

Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Mark Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Roy Templin, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool’s future expectations.  Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10K and 10Q. 
Turning to Slide Two, we want to remind you that today’s presentation includes non-GAAP measures.  As many of you will note, we’ve added some additional non-GAAP disclosures this quarter.  We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of our core operating results.  We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better base line for analyzing trends in our underlying business.
Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 27 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.  Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the investor’s section of our website at www.WhirlpoolCorp.com.  With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.

These results are summarized and you can see them on Slide Four.  Overall, I believe we had a very strong quarter with sales reaching $4.3 billion which represents a 20% increase versus last year.  If you exclude the impact of foreign exchange translation revenues increased approximately 11%.  Our earnings per share was $2.13 per diluted share compared to $0.91 in the prior year.  
  Overall, I think we saw strong operational performance in each of our regions and I’m very encouraged by the 18% increase in our global unit volumes that we had during the quarter.  Our adjusted operating margin improvement was 3.2 points over the same quarter last year.  Also for the quarter, free cash flow improved by approximately $300 million year-over-year.  Our overall results reflect our lower breakeven point, our continued investment in innovation and our ability to expand our global product offerings.  By continuing to drive our operating priorities throughout the business, we’ve been able to expand our operating margins at the same time we’re accelerating growth.  
Now, turning to Slide Five, I’d like to provide you with an update on our regional demand outlook revisions for 2010.  While there is still some degree of uncertainty in many facets of the global economy, we continue to expect growth throughout this year in almost all the markets around the world.  In the United States, we saw much stronger demand in the first quarter and we now expect major appliance demand to increase between 3% and 5% versus the previous guidance of 2% to 4%.
Assuming this will occur, which we believe it will, this would mark the first full year of positive growth in consumer demand that we’ve seen in the US market in over four years.  In Europe we continue to expect conditions will remain relatively challenging compared to other parts of the world and while our overall demand appears now to be stabilizing and we did post a modest increase in unit volume during the quarter, we continue to expect flat demand for the balance of the year.  
In Latin America, the underlying fundamentals remain very strong and we’re now forecasting industry growth of approximately 10% versus the previous estimate of 5% to 10%.  We expect industry growth to remain positive as the year progresses though our outlook does imply a slowing of the rate of growth in the region over the balance of the year compared to what we saw in the first quarter and of course, the year-over-year comps start to change after the first quarter as we saw growth in the later part of last year.  
Finally, we now expect our served markets in Asia to grow in the 5% to 8% range versus our previous guidance of 3% to 5%.  We continue to expect India to show strong growth trends during 2010, somewhat offset by lower growth rates in some of the other markets.  
Turning to Slide Six, you’ll see the key factors impacting our business for the year which we showed previously.  We believe our cost reduction and productivity will continue to drive improved earnings while higher unit volumes will contribute overall to both the improvement of our overall revenue growth and help the expansion of our margins.  We continue to anticipate price mix and foreign currency impacts will generally be neutral to our operating results for the year.
Finally, we continue to expect material and oil related cost inflation will negatively impact our operating results during the year.  While you’ve seen the recent trends in raw material prices which have been higher, we expect material cost inflation to still fall within our $200 to $300 million range that we previously provided although now we see it towards the higher end of that range.
Given this backdrop, we now expect to generate earnings per share for the year in the range of $8.00 to $8.50 per year versus our previous guidance of $6.50 to $7.00 per share.  Our free cash flow guidance for the year is now $500 to $600 million compared to our previous guidance of $400 to $500 million.  Roy will go in to more detail later on in our outlook later in the call.
At this time I’m going to turn it over to Mark Bitzer for his review of our North American operations.

We saw solid improvement in industry volume, we had a favorable impact during the quarter from healthy replacement demand and the cash for appliances program.  This was particularly visible in March and to date the industry remains robust.  
From a full year perspective, we still see a modest positive contribution from the cash for appliances program and have incorporated this in our outlook.  As Jeff mentioned, we have raised our full year outlook slightly to 3% to 5%.  From a market share standpoint, we delivered a strong increase in our share compared to last year.  This improvement was driven by significant improvement in our branded share growth and partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the expected lower OEM share in the quarter.
During Q1, we have had numerous new home builder contracts.  Some of our notable wins include new business with Ashton Woods, Beezer Homes, Equity Residential, Shea Homes and Toll Brothers.  We feel that we are making good progress in gaining a larger presence with new home construction.  As home construction returns we believe we will be very well positioned to fully participate in the industry upturn.
On Slide Nine, we detail first quarter results for North America.  Our net sales have increased 7% to $2.3 billion and excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, sales improved 5%.  Our unit shipments increased 11% while US industry demand for key seven appliances improved 6%.  On an adjusted base, our operating margin was 6.2% compared to 4.8% in the prior year.  This profit growth was driven by cost and productivity initiative and higher volumes partially offset by lower price and mix.
On Slide 10, you can see some example of some of the products we introduced in the quarter including a Whirlpool brand tall cup dishwasher for the value conscious consumer segment which sold exceptionally well during the first quarter.  It holds up to 12 place settings, features a one hour wash cycle and is the most energy and water efficient in its class or you will see also a Whirlpool brand [Calvary] high efficiency top load washing machine which features the largest capacity in the market and a low water wash system that uses less water per load yet delivers better cleaning performance.
Lastly, in the middle you see a KitchenAid brand French door refrigerator featuring a large capacity, a full door LCD screen that displays use and care information and offers a kitchen timer, access to suggest ingredient substitution and USB support.  In summary, we’re off to a very good start.  We have positive momentum as demand levels improve, our strong productivity throughout the business and we’ll be launching a number of our new product innovations in the second half of the year.  
  Now, I’d like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations.

During the first quarter we saw a continuation of the favorable trends in our key emerging market businesses. Latin America and Asia reported strong results as these regions continued to report solid economic growth, particularly in Brazil and India.  More importantly for our business, consumers are increasingly benefitting from the quality of life improvements that our products provide.
European market conditions remain challenging during the quarter, however, we did begin to see moderate demand improvement in Western Europe during March.  As the region begins stabilizing our focus remains on continuing to improve our cost structure.  
Turning to Slide 13, our European sales improved 6% year-over-year to $739 million in the quarter with unit shipments increasing 1% from the prior year period.  In local currency sales declined approximately 2% from the prior year.  The region reported an operating margin of 3.6% as a results were driven by cost and productivity initiatives.  
First quarter results from Latin America are summarized on Slide 14.  The region reported sales of $1.1 billion, a 65% increase from the $689 million reported in 2009 as appliance unit shipments increased 50%.  Excluding the impact from currency sales, sales increased approximately 40%.  The sales increase was driven by strong demand across most of our served markets in the region and favorable foreign currency exchange.  On and adjusted basis, operating profit increased $167 million compared to $83 million reported during the prior year period.  
Our first quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 15.  Net sales increased 60% during the quarter to $192 million up from $120 million in the prior year period.  Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 49%.  Unit shipments also increased 49% during the quarter.  Our increased unit shipments are being driven by continued strong growth in India as well as growth from our expanded product offering and strong product sales in China.
Operating profit during the quarter was $11 million compared with $5 million reported in the prior year.  The operational improvement was primarily related to higher unit volumes.  These improvements were partially offset by lower priced mix.  Our international businesses also produced a strong cadence of product introductions in the quarter.  On Slide 16 you’ll see just a few of our international product launches including a line of built in steam ovens in Europe, the first echo efficient refrigerators in India, with these premium frost free refrigerators coming in in both two door and three door models, and water purifiers in Latin America that can be both installed and maintained by consumers. 
Our global innovation pipeline continues to be strong and we are meeting the needs of our consumers everywhere in the world in more ways than ever before.  In summary, for the international business we are seeing strong demand in the key emerging markets which is supported by a strong product offering and increasing consumer demand while productivity improvements are offsetting higher material costs in those markets which is contributing to improved operating margin and we are seeing a stabilizing European market in which our cost focus is now contributing to improved operating earnings.
Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Roy Templin for his financial review.

Our net sales marked the second consecutive quarter of strong  year-over-year increases with our first quarter units increasing approximately 18% in the prior year.  Our revenue was also favorably impacted by foreign exchange translation which accounted for approximately eight points of the year-over-year increase.  The favorable impact was primarily related to a stronger Brazilian Real and the Euro compared with the prior year.  
Looking at our margins during the first quarter, the positive year-over-year increase was primarily from our productivity and cost reduction actions as well as higher sales volumes.  These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower price mix.  Finally, before we take a look at the income statement in detail, there are a couple of items that I would like to highlight that impacted our first quarter.  The first is a $75 million accrual for a supplier related quality issue.  Second, we recorded a $29 million curtailment gain related to a post retirement benefit plan.  Finally, we monetized $41 million of BPX credits during the first quarter.
Turning to the income statement on Slide 19, we reported net sales of just under $4.3 billion, an increase of 20% from the prior year.  Our gross margin rose three tenths of a point to 15.0%.  As I mentioned previously the most significant favorable impact on our gross margin improvement related to our cost and productivity actions which were partially offset by lower price mix.
SG&A expense totaled $371 million.  Foreign currency translation and the non-recurrence of the prior year curtailment gain accounted for approximately 80% of the dollar variance compared with the prior year.  As a percentage of sales SG&A declined to 8.7% from 9.2% in the prior year.  Restructuring expenses totaled $20 million during the quarter and were largely related to cost reduction actions in Europe and a previously announced facility closure.  We continue to expect to record restructuring expenses of approximately $100 million during 2009.  Finally, our operating margin expanded one point from the prior year to 5.6%.  On an adjusted basis, our operating margin was 6.7%.
Turning to Slide 20, I wanted to briefly discuss interest in sundry expense.  The main favorable variances from the prior year’s level relate to foreign exchange and higher interest income from our overall higher cash balance.  Turning to our tax rate, we recorded an income tax credit of $3 million during the quarter, corresponding to an effective tax rate benefit of approximately 2%.  The first quarter credit was below our previous expectation largely as a result of higher pre-tax income.  Given our revised earnings outlook we are currently estimating our full year tax rates to approximate zero plus or minus 5%.  Finally, we reported diluted earnings per share of $2.13 per share.  On an adjusted basis, our EPS totaled $2.51 per share.  
Moving to our first quarter free cash flow results on Slide 21 and as Jeff mentioned earlier, we had a strong year-over-year improvement.  This improvement was driven by a year-over-year increase in cash earnings and a lower amount of working capital investment as we increased our production levels.  These items were partially offset by higher capital spending levels during the quarter.  
Turning to Slide 22, we summarize our net liquidity position.  As you can see from this table, our net liquidity position remained over $3 billion at the end of the quarter.  Our cash balance was just under $1.2 billion and we had full availability under our revolving credit facility.  Given our strong liquidity position, we are planning to repay our $325 million 8.6% coupon note which is due on May 1st to further improve our credit metrics and generate interest expense savings.
On Slide 23, you can see a summary of our revised full year outlook.  We are now expecting to report earnings per share in the range of $8 and $8.50 per share.  This outlook includes approximately $0.10 of net expenses related to the $75 million accrual for a supplier related quality issue recorded in the first quarter and a $62 million gain related to the full year impact of an [OPAD] curtailment gain.
As Jeff reviewed previously, we expect to have a more favorable impact from increased global volumes as well as our ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives.  From a headwind perspective, we continue to see cost inflation as our main challenge this year.  Given the recent trends in some raw material prices, we now see our material costs trending towards the higher end of the $200 to $300 million range for the full year.  Turning to our cash flow outlook, we are projecting free cash flow between $500 million to $600 million up from our previous expectation of $400 to $500 million due to higher cash earnings.  
Now, I’ll turn the call back over to Jeff.

We are pleased with our progress and results so far in the first part of this year.  As you know over the last two years we have been challenged with both significant volume and production declines due to lower consumer demand and as we’ve discussed many times over this period of time, we’ve taken very strong steps to structurally align our cost structure and improve our asset utilization.
Slide 26 illustrates what we have done and I think importantly what we’re continuing to do.  I believe our first quarter results reflect the impact of what some demand growth enables us to do with a very efficient cost structure.  Going forward we are remaining very focused on cost reduction and cash generation as we did last year and in addition we will benefit from revenue growth due to both our strong new product innovations which we’re bringing to the marketplace throughout the course of this year and improved demand levels.
I truly believe this combination will produce very strong operating results and we look forward to continuing these trends as we go forward.  I’m going to end here now and I’d like to open this up for questions and answers.

First and foremost we continue to be very focused on cost reduction productivity initiatives.  Typically, and this year is what I would call so far a typical year, these ramp up throughout the course of the year as you execute projects and that sort of thing.  Obviously, increased volume and production is immediate because we see that in the conversion costs, so that’s really dependent upon that.  But, I would expect we would continue to execute very well in productivity and if anything probably accelerate the rate of productivity throughout the course of the year.
The flip side of that is of course material costs.  We said it’s in the $200 to $300 million range.  Probably at the higher end of that range as we see it right now, those two will probably ramp up as we go throughout the course of the year.  Regarding volume, volumes positive to our margins so you saw the outlook, we’ve increased that so that should help and then PMR or price mix if you will, first of all we’re very pleased with the results we saw in Q1.  Year-over-year comparisons are tough because we had such a big increase Q1 of last year but sequentially from Q4 we’ve actually improved our price mix.
We’re seeing very strong mix in our business.  I think we have some very impactive product introductions throughout the course of the year which are high volume which should have a positive impact on the mix.  That’s why even with a negative first quarter comparison on price mix we think for the full year it will be generally neutral.  Again, how we get there is slightly different per region only because environment is different but I would say in general those are all the same characteristics we’re focusing on everywhere.

So, the starting point is we’re comping against a very strong comparison.  We’re down two points versus Q1, so two points versus that up three last year.  We’re up about a point from Q4 so sequentially we’re improving our price mix.  You may or may not recall but in Q3 last year and a little bit in Q4.  
We did say that we did do some structural price repositioning and particularly in the North American market place on certain very competitively intense categories.  We did that, you saw the momentum we got by doing that both in Q4 and Q1 but at the same time we continue to drive mix and we had a again, a very favorable mix period improvement almost over a full point versus even Q4.  So the trends are I would say pricing stable, mix growing as we start comping against last year’s numbers that’s how we’ll get to be neutral plus or minus a little.
In terms of pricing now, I can say is we’ve done pricing and we talk about some markets like India where we’ve had very high material cost inflation.  I believe we announced two price increases so far one in December and one a month or so ago.  Some of the emerging markets have slightly different dynamics with both material cost and pricing and we’re managing them appropriately.

Recall that the BPX credits are not taxable, that’s about a six point benefit on our overall tax rate and then we get roughly four points of benefit from global R&D credits that we earn around the world.

As I said, as you look at the variables if you will, we still think it is a gradual economy.  Four months in to the year we’re not completely convinced that the growth trends are stable enough to say that they’re going to continue at these rates, it’s early.  I think as I said earlier, the biggest variable is really demand.  If demand is better we’ll do better.  If demand is worse we’ll have to find ways to make it up.

We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying business.

These results are summarized and you can see them on Slide 4.   Overall, I believe we had a very strong quarter with sales reaching $4.3 billion, which represents a 20% increase versus last year. If you exclude the impact of foreign exchange translation, revenues increased approximately 11%. Our earnings per share was $2.13 per diluted share compared to $0.91 the prior year. Overall, I think we saw a strong operational performance in each of our regions, and I'm very encouraged by the 18% increase in our global unit volumes that we had during the quarter.  
Our adjusted operating margin improvement was 3.2 points over the same quarter last year. Also for the quarter, free cash flow improved by approximately $300 million year-over-year. Our overall results reflect our lower breakeven point, our continued investment in innovation, and our ability to expand our global product offerings. By continuing to drive our operating priorities throughout the business, we've been able to expand our operating margins at the same time that we're accelerating growth. Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to provide you with an update on our regional demand outlook revisions for 2010.  
While there is still some degree of uncertainty in many facets of the global economy, we continue to expect growth throughout this year in almost all the markets around the world. In the United States, we saw much stronger demand in the first quarter, and we now expect major appliance demand to increase between 3% and 5% versus the previous guidance of 2% to 4%. Assuming this will occur, which we believe it will, this would mark the first full year of positive growth in consumer demand that we see in the U.S. market in over four years.   
In Europe, we continue to expect conditions will remain relatively challenging compared to other parts of the world. And while our overall demand appears now to be stabilizing, and we did post a modest increase in unit volume during the quarter, we continue to expect flat demand for the balance of the year.  
In Latin America, the underlying fundamentals remain very strong, and we're now forecasting industry growth of approximately 10% versus the previous estimate of 5% to 10%. We expect industry growth will remain positive as the year progresses, though our outlook does imply a slowing of the rate of growth in the region over the balance of the year compared to what we saw in the first quarter. And of course, the year-over-year comps start to change after the first quarter as we saw growth in the latter part of last year.  
Finally, we now expect our served markets in Asia to grow in the 5% to 8% range versus our previous guidance of 3% to 5%. We continue to expect India to show strong growth trends during 2010, somewhat offset by lower growth rates in some of the other markets.  
Turning to Slide 6, you'll see the key factors impacting our business for the year, which we showed previously. We believe our cost reduction and productivity will continue to drive improved earnings while higher unit volumes will contribute to overall, to both the improvement of our overall revenue growth and healthy expansion of our margins.   We continue to anticipate price/mix and foreign currency impacts will generally be neutral to our operating results for the year. And finally, we continue to expect material and oil-related cost inflation will negatively impact our operating results during the year.  
And while you've seen the recent trends in raw material prices, which have been higher, we expect material cost inflation to still fall within our $200 million to $300 million range that we previously provided, although now we see it towards the higher end of that range. Given this backdrop, we now expect to generate earnings per share for the year in the range of $8 to $8.50 per share versus our previous guidance of $6.50 to $7 a share. Our free cash flow guidance for the year is now $500 million to $600 million compared with our previous guidance of $400 million to $500 million. 
Roy will go into more detail later on in our outlook later in the call.  So at this time, I'm going to turn it over to Marc Bitzer for his review of our North America operations."

Turning to Slide 8, I would like to briefly go over some of the highlights during the quarter. We showed solid improvement in industry volume. We had a favorable impact during the quarter from healthy replacement demand and the Cash for Appliances program. This was particularly visible in March, and to date, the industry remains robust.   
From a full year perspective, we still see a modest positive contribution from the Cash for Appliances program and have incorporated this in our outlook. As Jeff mentioned, we have raised our full year outlook slightly to 3% to 5%. From a market share standpoint, we delivered a strong increase in our share compared to last year. This improvement was driven by significant improvement in our branded share growth and partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the expected lower OEM share in the quarter.   
During Q1, we have had numerous new homebuilder contracts. Some of the notable wins include new business with Ashton Woods, Beazer Homes, Equity Residential, Shea Homes, Toll Brothers'. We feel that they're making good progress in gaining a larger presence with the new home construction side. As home construction returns, we believe we will be very well positioned to fully participate in the industry upturn.   
On Slide 9, we detail first quarter results for North America. Our net sales have increased 7% to $2.3 billion, and excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, sales improved 5%. Our unit shipments increased 11%, while U.S. industry demand for T-7 appliances improved 6%. On an adjusted base, our operating margin was 6.2% compared to the 4.8% in the prior year. This profit growth was driven by cost and productivity initiatives and higher volumes partially offset by lower price and mix.   
On Slide 10, you can see some example of some of the products introduced during the quarter, including a Whirlpool brand tall-tub dishwasher for the value consumer segment, which sold exceptionally well during the first quarter. It holds up to 12 place settings, features a one-hour wash cycle and it's the most energy and water efficient in its class.  
Or you will see also a Whirlpool brand Cabrio high efficiency top-load washing machine, which features the largest capacity in the market and a low water wash system that uses less water per load yet delivers better cleaning performance. And lastly, in the middle, you see a KitchenAid brand French-door refrigerator featuring a larger capacity, a full door LCD screen that displays use and care information and offers a kitchen timer, access to suggested ingredient substitution, and a USB support.  
In summary, we are off to a very good start. We have a positive momentum as demand levels improve, a strong productivity throughout the business, and we'll be launching a number of our new product innovations in the second half of the year. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations."

During the first quarter, we saw a continuation of the favorable trends in our key emerging market businesses. Latin America and Asia reported strong results as these regions continue to report solid economic growth, particularly in Brazil and India. And more importantly for our business, consumers are increasingly benefiting from the quality of life improvements that our products provide. The European market conditions remain challenging during the quarter. However, we did begin to see moderate demand improvement in Western Europe during March. As the region begins stabilizing, our focus remains on continuing to improve our cost structure.  
Turning to Slide 13, our European sales improved 6% year-over-year to $739 million in the quarter, with unit shipments increasing 1% from the prior-year period. In local currency, sales declined approximately 2% from the prior year. The region reported an operating margin of 3.6% as results were driven by cost and productivity initiatives.   
First quarter results from Latin America are summarized on Slide 14. The region reported sales of $1.1 billion, a 65% increase from the $689 million reported in 2009 as appliance unit shipments increased 50%. Excluding the impact on currency sales, sales increased approximately 40%. The sales increase was driven by strong demand across most of our served markets in the region and favorable foreign currency exchange. On an adjusted basis, operating profit reached $167 million compared to $83 million reported during the prior-year period.   
Our first quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 15. Net sales increased 60% during the quarter to $192 million, up from $120 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 49%. Unit shipments also increased 49% during the quarter. Our increased unit shipments are being driven by continued strong growth in India, as well as growth from our expanded product offering and strong product sales in China. Operating profit during the quarter was $11 million compared with $5 million reported in the prior year. The operational improvement was primarily related to higher unit volumes. These improvements were partially offset by lower price/mix. Our international businesses also produced a strong cadence of product introductions in the quarter.   
On Slide 16, you'll see just a few of our international product launches, including a line of built-in steam ovens in Europe, the first eco-efficient refrigerators in India, with these premium frost-free refrigerators coming in both two-door and three-door models, and water purifiers in Latin America that can be both installed and maintained by consumers. Our global innovation pipeline continues to be strong, and we are meeting the needs of our consumers everywhere in the world in more ways than ever before. 
In summary, for the international business, we are seeing strong demand in the key emerging markets, which is supported by a strong product offering and increasing consumer demand, while productivity improvements are offsetting higher material costs in those markets, which is contributing to improved operating margin.  And we are seeing a stabilizing European market, in which our cost focus is now contributing to improved operating earnings. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roy Templin for his financial review."

Beginning on Slide 18, I'll walk you through a summary of our first quarter performance. Our net sales marked the second consecutive quarter of strong year-over-year increases with our first quarter units increasing approximately 18% from the prior year. Our revenue was also favorably impacted by foreign exchange translation, which accounted for approximately eight points of the year-over-year increase. The favorable impact was primarily related to a stronger Brazilian real and the euro compared with the prior year.  
Looking at our margins during the first quarter, the positive year-over-year increase was primarily from our productivity and cost-reduction actions, as well as higher sales volumes. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower price/mix.   
Finally, before we take a look at the income statement in detail, there are a couple of items I would like to highlight that impacted our first quarter. The first is a $75 million accrual for a supplier-related quality issue. Second, we recorded a $29 million curtailment gain related to a post-retirement benefit plan. And finally, we monetized $41 million of BPX credits during the first quarter.  
Turning to the income statement on Slide 19, we reported net sales of just under $4.3 billion, an increase of 20% from the prior year. Our gross margin rose 0.3 of a point to 15.0%. As I mentioned previously, the most significant favorable impact on our gross margin improvement related to our cost and productivity actions, which were partially offset by lower price/mix. SG&A expense totaled $371 million. Foreign currency translation and the non-recurrence of the prior-year curtailment gain, accounted for approximately 80% of the dollar variance compared with the prior year. 
As a percentage of sales, SG&A declined to 8.7% from 9.2% in the prior year.  Restructuring expenses totaled $20 million during the quarter and were largely related to cost reduction actions in Europe and a previously announced facility closure. We continue to expect to record restructuring expenses of approximately $100 million during 2010.  Finally, our operating margin expanded one point from the prior year to 5.6%. On an adjusted basis, our operating margin was 6.7%.  
Turning to Slide 20, I wanted to briefly discuss interest and sundry expense. The main favorable variances from the prior-year's level relate to foreign exchange and higher interest income from our overall higher cash balance. Turning to our tax rate, we recorded an income tax credit of $3 million during the quarter, corresponding to an effective tax rate benefit of approximately 2%. The first quarter credit was below our previous expectation, largely as a result of higher pretax income. Given our revised earnings outlook, we are currently estimating our full year tax rate to approximate zero plus or minus 5% finally, we reported diluted earnings per share of $2.13 per share. On an adjusted basis, our EPS totaled $2.51 per share.   
Moving to our first quarter free cash flow results on Slide 21, and as Jeff mentioned earlier, we had a strong year-over-year improvement. This improvement was driven by a year-over-year increase in cash earnings and a lower amount of working capital investment as we increased our production levels. These items were partially offset by higher capital spending levels during the quarter.  
Turning to Slide 22, we summarize our net liquidity position. As you can see from this table, our net liquidity position remained over $3 billion at the end of the quarter. Our cash balance was just under $1.2 billion, and we had full availability under our revolving credit facility. Given our strong liquidity position, we are planning to repay our $325 million 8.6% coupon note, which is due on May 1, to further improve our credit metrics and generate interest expense savings.  
On Slide 23, you can see a summary of our revised full year outlook. We are now expecting to report earnings per share in the range of $8 and $8.50 per share. This outlook includes approximately $0.10 of net expenses related to the $75 million accrual for a supplier-related quality issue recorded in the first quarter and a $62 million gain related to the full year impact of an OPEB curtailment gain. As Jeff reviewed previously, we expect to have a more favorable impact on increased global volumes, as well as our ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives.   
From a headwind perspective, we continue to see cost inflation as our main challenge this year. Given the recent trends in some raw material prices, we now see our material costs trending toward the higher end of the $200 million to $300 million range for the full year.  Turning to our cash flow outlook, we are projecting free cash flow between $500 million to $600 million, up from our previous expectation of $400 million to $500 million, due to higher cash earnings. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

Let me summarize, we are pleased with our progress and results so far in the first part of this year. As you know, over the last two years, we've been challenged with both significant volume and production declines due to lower consumer demand. And as we've discussed many times over this period of time, we've taken very strong steps to structurally align our cost structure and improve our asset utilization.   
Slide 26 illustrates what we've done, and I think importantly what we're continuing to do. I believe our first quarter results reflect the impact of what some demand growth enables us to do with a very efficient cost structure. Going forward, we are remaining very focused on cost reduction and cash generation, as we did last year. And in addition, we will benefit from revenue growth due to both our strong, new product innovations, which will bring the marketplace throughout the course of this year, and improved demand levels.  
I truly believe this combination will produce very strong operating results and we look forward to continuing these trends as we go forward. I'm going to end here now and I'd like to open this up for questions and answers."

First and foremost, we continue to be very focused on cost reduction productivity initiatives. And typically, and this year is what I would call so far a typical year, these ramp up throughout the course of the year as you execute projects and that sort of thing. And obviously, increased volume and production is immediate, because we see that in the conversion costs, so that's really dependent upon it. But I would expect we will continue to execute very well in productivity. And if anything, probably accelerate the rate of productivity throughout the course of the year. The flip side of that, is of course, material cost. We've said that it's in the $200 million to $300 million range. Probably the higher end of that range as we see it right now. Those, too, will probably ramp up as we go throughout the course of the year. Regarding volume, volume's positive to our margins, so you saw the outlook, we've increased that, so that should help. And then PMR, price/mix if you will, first of all, we are very pleased with the results we saw in Q1. Year-over-year comparisons are tough because we had such a big increase Q1 of last year. But sequentially from Q4 we've actually improved our price/mix. We're seeing very strong mix in our business. I think we had some very impactive product introductions throughout the course of the year, which are high-volume, which should have a positive impact on the mix. That's why, even with a negative first quarter comparison on price/mix, we think for the full year it will be generally neutral. So and again, how we get there is slightly different per region only because the environment is different. But I would say in general, those are all the same characteristics we're focusing on everywhere."

So this is really a quarter, this quarter this year, running through that. And if you remember, it ended in January, but there was inventory in the pipeline. So that inventory has kind of come through the system. As we look forward, therefore, what we think is we're going to see some moderation in the growth because we're now at fairly high levels. And so that's why we're saying the growth for the balance of the year is going to be more moderate, but think about, it's more moderate on already pretty high levels as that stimulus program kicked in over the remainder of the year. But the last point that I'd like to make is just that the underlying economics in Brazil and frankly, for many of the other Latin American countries, is pretty strong.

So its not one channel, which we will point out, there's a number of trade parts across all channels where we expanded our floor space. So we feel overall, very good about our share momentum coming out of Q4 into Q1, in particular, branded side.

So sequentially, we're improving our price/mix. And if you may or may not recall, but in Q3 last year, and a little bit in Q4, we did say that we did do some structural price repositioning and particularly in the North American marketplace, on certain very competitive, really intense categories. We did that. You saw the momentum we got by doing that both in Q4 and Q1. But at the same time, we continue to drive mix. And we had a very favorable, again, favorable mix period improvement over almost a full point versus even Q4. So the trends are, I would say pricing stable, mix growing, as we start comping against last year's numbers. That's how we think we'll get to the neutral plus or minus a little.

Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q.  Turning to Slide 2, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. As many of you will note, we have added some additional non-GAAP disclosures this quarter. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying business.   
Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 27 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

These results are summarized and you can see them on Slide 4.   Overall, I believe we had a very strong quarter with sales reaching $4.3 billion, which represents a 20% increase versus last year. If you exclude the impact of foreign exchange translation, revenues increased approximately 11%. Our earnings per share was $2.13 per diluted share compared to $0.91 the prior year. Overall, I think we saw a strong operational performance in each of our regions, and I'm very encouraged by the 18% increase in our global unit volumes that we had during the quarter.  
Our adjusted operating margin improvement was 3.2 points over the same quarter last year. Also for the quarter, free cash flow improved by approximately $300 million year-over-year. Our overall results reflect our lower break-even point, our continued investment in innovation, and our ability to expand our global product offerings. By continuing to drive our operating priorities throughout the business, we've been able to expand our operating margins at the same time that we're accelerating growth. Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to provide you with an update on our regional demand outlook revisions for 2010.  
And while there is still some degree of uncertainty in many facets of the global economy, we continue to expect growth throughout this year in almost all the markets around the world. In the United States, we saw much stronger demand in the first quarter, and we now expect major appliance demand to increase between 3% and 5% versus the previous guidance of 2% to 4%. Assuming this will occur, which we believe it will, this would mark the first full year of positive growth in consumer demand that we see in the U.S. market in over four years.   
In Europe, we continue to expect conditions will remain relatively challenging compared to other parts of the world. And while our overall demand appears now to be stabilizing, and we did post a modest increase in unit volume during the quarter, we continue to expect flat demand for the balance of the year.  
In Latin America, the underlying fundamentals remain very strong, and we're now forecasting industry growth of approximately 10% versus the previous estimate of 5% to 10%. We expect industry growth to remain positive as the year progresses, though our outlook does imply a slowing of the rate of growth in the region over the balance of the year compared to what we saw in the first quarter. And of course, the year-over-year comps start to change after the first quarter as we saw growth in the latter part of last year.  
Finally, we now expect our served markets in Asia to grow in the 5% to 8% range versus our previous guidance of 3% to 5%. We continue to expect India to show strong growth trends during 2010, somewhat offset by lower growth rates in some of the other markets.  
Turning to Slide 6, you'll see the key factors impacting our business for the year that which we showed previously. We believe our cost reduction and productivity will continue to drive improved earnings while higher unit volumes will contribute overall, to both the improvement of our overall revenue growth and help the expansion of our margins. We continue to anticipate price/mix and foreign currency impacts will generally be neutral to our operating results for the year. And finally, we continue to expect material and oil-related cost inflation will negatively impact our operating results during the year.  
And while you've seen the recent trends in raw material prices, which have been higher, we expect material cost inflation to still fall within our $200 million to $300 million range that we previously provided, although now we see it towards the higher end of that range. Given this backdrop, we now expect to generate earnings per share for the year in the range of $8 to $8.50 per share versus our previous guidance of $6.50 to $7 a share. Our free cash flow guidance for the year is now $500 million to $600 million compared with our previous guidance of $400 million to $500 million. 
Roy will go into more detail later on in our outlook later in the call. So at this time, I'm going to turn it over to Marc Bitzer for his review of our North America operations."
314515,100674011,58185,"Whirlpool Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2010",2010-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 8, I would like to briefly go over some of the highlights during the quarter. We showed solid improvement in industry volumes. We had a favorable impact during the quarter from healthy replacement",491,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 8, I would like to briefly go over some of the highlights during the quarter. We showed solid improvement in industry volumes. We had a favorable impact during the quarter from healthy replacement demand and the Cash for Appliances program. This was particularly visible in March, and to date, the industry remains robust.   
From a full year perspective, we still see a modest positive contribution from the Cash for Appliances program and have incorporated this in our outlook. As Jeff mentioned, we have raised our full year outlook slightly from 3% to 5%. From a market share standpoint, we delivered a strong increase in our share compared to last year. This improvement was driven by significant improvement in our branded share growth and partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the expected lower OEM share in the quarter.   
During Q1, we have had numerous new homebuilder contracts. Some of the notable wins includes new business with Ashton Woods, Beazer Homes, Equity Residential, Shea Homes, Toll Brothers. We feel that they're making good progress in gaining a larger presence with the new home construction side. As home construction returns, we believe we will be very well positioned to fully participate in the industry upturn.   
On Slide 9, we detailed first quarter results for North America. Our net sales have increased 7% to $2.3 billion, and excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, sales improved 5%. Our unit shipments increased 11%, while U.S. industry demand for T7 appliances improved 6%. On an adjusted base, our operating margin was 6.2% compared to the 4.8% in the prior year. And this profit growth was driven by cost and productivity initiatives and higher volumes, partially offset by lower price and mix.   
On Slide 10, you can see a sample of some of the products we introduced during the quarter, including a Whirlpool brand tall-tub dishwasher for the value-conscious consumer segment, which sold exceptionally well during the first quarter. It holds up to 12 place settings, features a one-hour wash cycle and is the most energy and water efficient in its class. Or you will see also Whirlpool brand Cabrio high efficiency top-load washing machine, which features the largest capacity in the market and a low water wash system that uses less water per load yet delivers better cleaning performance. And lastly, in the middle, you see KitchenAid brand French-door refrigerator featuring a larger capacity, a full door LCD screen that displays use and care information and offers a kitchen timer, access to suggested ingredient substitution and a USB support.  
In summary, we're off to a very good start. We have a positive momentum as demand levels improve, a strong productivity throughout the business, and we'll be launching a number of our new product innovations in the second half of the year. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations."

During the first quarter, we saw a continuation of the favorable trends in our key emerging market businesses. Latin America and Asia reported strong results as these regions continue to report solid economic growth, particularly in Brazil and India. And more importantly for our business, consumers are increasingly benefiting from the quality-of-life improvements that our products provide. European market conditions remained challenging during the quarter. However, we did begin to see moderate demand improvement in Western Europe during March. As the region begins stabilizing, our focus remains on continuing to improve our cost structure.  
Turning to Slide 13, our European sales improved 6% year-over-year to $739 million in the quarter, with unit shipments increasing 1% from the prior-year period. In local currency, sales declined approximately 2% from the prior year. The region reported an operating margin of 3.6% as results were driven by cost and productivity initiatives.   
First quarter results from Latin America are summarized on Slide 14. The region reported sales of $1.1 billion, a 65% increase from the $689 million reported in 2009 as appliance unit shipments increased 50%. Excluding the impact on currency sales, sales increased approximately 40%. The sales increase was driven by strong demand across most of our served markets in the region and favorable foreign currency exchange. On an adjusted basis, operating profit reached $167 million compared to $83 million reported during the prior-year period.   
Our first quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 15. Net sales increased 60% during the quarter to $192 million, up from $120 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 49%. Unit shipments also increased 49% during the quarter. Our increased unit shipments are being driven by continued strong growth in India as well as growth from our expanded product offering and strong product sales in China. Operating profit during the quarter was $11 million compared with $5 million reported in the prior year. The operational improvement was primarily related to higher unit volumes. These improvements were partially offset by lower price/mix. Our international businesses also produced a strong cadence of product introductions in the quarter.   
On Slide 16, you'll see just a few of our international product launches, including a line of built-in steam ovens in Europe, the first eco-efficient refrigerators in India, with these premium frost-free refrigerators coming in both two-door and three-door models, and water purifiers in Latin America that can be both installed and maintained by consumers. Our global innovation pipeline continues to be strong, and we are meeting the needs of our consumers everywhere in the world in more ways than ever before. 
In summary, for the international business, we are seeing strong demand in the key emerging markets, which is supported by a strong product offering and increasing consumer demand, while productivity improvements are offsetting higher material costs in those markets, which is contributing to improved operating margin.  And we are seeing a stabilizing European market, in which our cost focus is now contributing to improved operating earnings. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roy Templin for his financial review."

Beginning on Slide 18, I'll walk you through a summary of our first quarter performance. Our net sales marked the second consecutive quarter of strong year-over-year increases with our first quarter units increasing approximately 18% from the prior year. Our revenue was also favorably impacted by foreign exchange translation, which accounted for approximately eight points of the year-over-year increase. The favorable impact was primarily related to a stronger Brazilian real and the euro compared with the prior year.  
Looking at our margins during the first quarter, the positive year-over-year increase was primarily from our productivity and cost-reduction actions, as well as higher sales volumes. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower price/mix.   
Finally, before we take a look at the income statement in detail, there are a couple of items I would like to highlight that impacted our first quarter. The first is a $75 million accrual for a supplier-related quality issue. Second, we recorded a $29 million curtailment gain related to a post-retirement benefit plan. And finally, we monetized $41 million of BPX credits during the first quarter.  
Turning to the income statement on Slide 19, we reported net sales of just under $4.3 billion, an increase of 20% from the prior year. Our gross margin rose 0.3 of a point to 15.0%. As I mentioned previously, the most significant favorable impact on our gross margin improvement related to our cost and productivity actions, which were partially offset by lower price/mix. SG&A expense totaled $371 million. Foreign currency translation and the non-recurrence of the prior-year curtailment gain, accounted for approximately 80% of the dollar variance compared with the prior year. 
As a percentage of sales, SG&A declined to 8.7% from 9.2% in the prior year.  Restructuring expenses totaled $20 million during the quarter and were largely related to cost reduction actions in Europe and a previously announced facility closure. We continue to expect to record restructuring expenses of approximately $100 million during 2010.  Finally, our operating margin expanded one point from the prior year to 5.6%. On an adjusted basis, our operating margin was 6.7%.  
Turning to Slide 20, I wanted to briefly discuss interest and sundry expense. The main favorable variances from the prior-year's level relate to foreign exchange and higher interest income from our overall higher cash balance. Turning to our tax rate, we recorded an income tax credit of $3 million during the quarter, corresponding to an effective tax rate benefit of approximately 2%. The first quarter credit was below our previous expectation, largely as a result of higher pretax income. Given our revised earnings outlook, we are currently estimating our full year tax rate to approximate zero plus or minus 5% finally, we reported diluted earnings per share of $2.13 per share. On an adjusted basis, our EPS totaled $2.51 per share.   
Moving to our first quarter free cash flow results on Slide 21, and as Jeff mentioned earlier, we had a strong year-over-year improvement. This improvement was driven by a year-over-year increase in cash earnings and a lower amount of working capital investment as we increased our production levels. These items were partially offset by higher capital spending levels during the quarter.  
Turning to Slide 22, we summarize our net liquidity position. As you can see from this table, our net liquidity position remained over $3 billion at the end of the quarter. Our cash balance was just under $1.2 billion, and we had full availability under our revolving credit facility. Given our strong liquidity position, we are planning to repay our $325 million 8.6% coupon note, which is due on May 1, to further improve our credit metrics and generate interest expense savings.  
On Slide 23, you can see a summary of our revised full year outlook. We are now expecting to report earnings per share in the range of $8 and $8.50 per share. This outlook includes approximately $0.10 of net expenses related to the $75 million accrual for a supplier-related quality issue recorded in the first quarter and a $62 million gain related to the full year impact of an OPEB curtailment gain. As Jeff reviewed previously, we expect to have a more favorable impact on increased global volumes, as well as our ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives.   
From a headwind perspective, we continue to see cost inflation as our main challenge this year. Given the recent trends in some raw material prices, we now see our material costs trending toward the higher end of the $200 million to $300 million range for the full year.  Turning to our cash flow outlook, we are projecting free cash flow between $500 million to $600 million, up from our previous expectation of $400 million to $500 million, due to higher cash earnings. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

Let me summarize, we are pleased with our progress and results so far in the first part of this year. As you know, over the last two years, we've been challenged with both significant volume and production declines due to lower consumer demand. And as we've discussed many times over this period of time, we've taken very strong steps to structurally align our cost structure and improve our asset utilization.   
Slide 26 illustrates what we've done, and I think importantly what we're continuing to do. I believe our first quarter results reflect the impact of what some demand growth enables us to do with a very efficient cost structure. Going forward, we are remaining very focused on cost reduction and cash generation, as we did last year. And in addition, we will benefit from revenue growth due to both our strong, new product innovations, which will bring the marketplace throughout the course of this year, and improved demand levels.

First and foremost, we continue to be very focused on cost reduction productivity initiatives. And typically, and this year is what I would call so far a typical year, these ramp up throughout the course of the year as you execute projects and that sort of thing. And obviously, increased volume and production is immediate, because we see that in the conversion costs, so that's really dependent upon it. But I would expect we will continue to execute very well in productivity. And if anything, probably accelerate the rate of productivity throughout the course of the year. The flip side of that, is of course, material cost. We've said that it's in the $200 million to $300 million range. Probably the higher end of that range as we see it right now. Those, too, will probably ramp up as we go throughout the course of the year. Regarding volume, volume's positive to our margins, so you saw the outlook, we've increased that, so that should help. And then PMR, price/mix if you will, first of all, we are very pleased with the results we saw in Q1. Year-over-year comparisons are tough because we had such a big increase Q1 of last year. But sequentially from Q4 we've actually improved our price/mix. We're seeing very strong mix in our business. I think we had some very impactive product introductions throughout the course of the year, which are high-volume, which should have a positive impact on the mix. That's why, even with a negative first quarter comparison on price/mix, we think for the full year it will be generally neutral. So and again, how we get there is slightly different per region only because the environment is different.

Through this IPI tax holiday really began in late April. That's when it was initially initiated. So if you just think of the first quarter of last year, it was not impacted by the stimulus program. So this is really a quarter, this quarter this year, running through that. And if you remember, it ended in January, but there was inventory in the pipeline. So that inventory has kind of come through the system. As we look forward, therefore, what we think is we're going to see some moderation in the growth because we're now at fairly high levels. And so that's why we're saying the growth for the balance of the year is going to be more moderate, but think about, it's more moderate on already pretty high levels as that stimulus program kicked in over the remainder of the year. But the last point that I'd like to make is just that the underlying economics in Brazil and frankly, for many of the other Latin American countries, is pretty strong. And so we're seeing kind of positive momentum throughout those markets although maybe at a slightly moderated rate."

So from a market share perspective, these OEM losses are pretty much a non-event. That is largely driven by increased floor space pretty much across all retailers, in particular in our branded side. So its not one channel, which we will point out, there's a number of trade parts across all channels where we expanded our floor space. So we feel overall, very good about our share momentum coming out of Q4 into Q1, in particular, branded side.

So sequentially, we're improving our price/mix. And if you may or may not recall, but in Q3 last year, and a little bit in Q4, we did say that we did do some structural price repositioning and particularly in the North American marketplace, on certain very competitive, really intense categories. We did that. You saw the momentum we got by doing that both in Q4 and Q1. But at the same time, we continue to drive mix. And we had a very favorable, again, favorable mix period improvement over almost a full point versus even Q4. So the trends are, I would say pricing stable, mix growing, as we start comping against last year's numbers. That's how we think we'll get to the neutral plus or minus a little. In terms of pricing, and all I can say is well we've done pricing and we talked about some markets like India, where we've had very high material cost inflation. I believe we announced two price increases so far, one in December, one a month or so ago. So some of the emerging markets have slightly different dynamics with both material cost and pricing, and we're managing them appropriately."

What we've seen, pretty much as we indicated before, obviously with different degrees, but it was very successful in most states. But, as I said before, the demand stayed up pretty high in most states. People came back in to the stores, it brought quite a bit of traffic. We're also seeing that retailers came very, very low on main inventory levels into the first quarter but it's now more balanced. So you have a couple of elements coming in to this Q1 which we foresee also maintaining throughout Q2. So we've basically seen elevated demand coming out of the stimulus program."

Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q.

We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying business.

These results are summarized and you can see them on Slide 4.   Overall, I believe we had a very strong quarter with sales reaching $4.3 billion, which represents a 20% increase versus last year. If you exclude the impact of foreign exchange translation, revenues increased approximately 11%. Our earnings per share was $2.13 per diluted share compared to $0.91 the prior year. Overall, I think we saw a strong operational performance in each of our regions, and I'm very encouraged by the 18% increase in our global unit volumes that we had during the quarter.  
Our adjusted operating margin improvement was 3.2 points over the same quarter last year. Also for the quarter, free cash flow improved by approximately $300 million year-over-year. Our overall results reflect our lower break-even point, our continued investment in innovation, and our ability to expand our global product offerings. By continuing to drive our operating priorities throughout the business, we've been able to expand our operating margins at the same time that we're accelerating growth. Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to provide you with an update on our regional demand outlook revisions for 2010.  
And while there is still some degree of uncertainty in many facets of the global economy, we continue to expect growth throughout this year in almost all the markets around the world. In the United States, we saw much stronger demand in the first quarter, and we now expect major appliance demand to increase between 3% and 5% versus the previous guidance of 2% to 4%. Assuming this will occur, which we believe it will, this would mark the first full year of positive growth in consumer demand that we see in the U.S. market in over four years.   
In Europe, we continue to expect conditions will remain relatively challenging compared to other parts of the world. And while our overall demand appears now to be stabilizing, and we did post a modest increase in unit volume during the quarter, we continue to expect flat demand for the balance of the year.  
In Latin America, the underlying fundamentals remain very strong, and we're now forecasting industry growth of approximately 10% versus the previous estimate of 5% to 10%. We expect industry growth to remain positive as the year progresses, though our outlook does imply a slowing of the rate of growth in the region over the balance of the year compared to what we saw in the first quarter. And of course, the year-over-year comps start to change after the first quarter as we saw growth in the latter part of last year.  
Finally, we now expect our served markets in Asia to grow in the 5% to 8% range versus our previous guidance of 3% to 5%. We continue to expect India to show strong growth trends during 2010, somewhat offset by lower growth rates in some of the other markets.  
Turning to Slide 6, you'll see the key factors impacting our business for the year that which we showed previously. We believe our cost reduction and productivity will continue to drive improved earnings while higher unit volumes will contribute overall, to both the improvement of our overall revenue growth and help the expansion of our margins. We continue to anticipate price/mix and foreign currency impacts will generally be neutral to our operating results for the year. And finally, we continue to expect material and oil-related cost inflation will negatively impact our operating results during the year.  
And while you've seen the recent trends in raw material prices, which have been higher, we expect material cost inflation to still fall within our $200 million to $300 million range that we previously provided, although now we see it towards the higher end of that range. Given this backdrop, we now expect to generate earnings per share for the year in the range of $8 to $8.50 per share versus our previous guidance of $6.50 to $7 a share. Our free cash flow guidance for the year is now $500 million to $600 million compared with our previous guidance of $400 million to $500 million. 
Roy will go into more detail later on in our outlook later in the call. So at this time, I'm going to turn it over to Marc Bitzer for his review of our North America operations."

Turning to Slide 8, I would like to briefly go over some of the highlights during the quarter. We showed solid improvement in industry volumes. We had a favorable impact during the quarter from healthy replacement",491,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 8, I would like to briefly go over some of the highlights during the quarter. We showed solid improvement in industry volumes. We had a favorable impact during the quarter from healthy replacement demand and the Cash for Appliances program. This was particularly visible in March, and to date, the industry remains robust.   
From a full year perspective, we still see a modest positive contribution from the Cash for Appliances program and have incorporated this in our outlook. As Jeff mentioned, we have raised our full year outlook slightly from 3% to 5%. From a market share standpoint, we delivered a strong increase in our share compared to last year. This improvement was driven by significant improvement in our branded share growth and partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the expected lower OEM share in the quarter.   
During Q1, we have had numerous new homebuilder contracts. Some of the notable wins includes new business with Ashton Woods, Beazer Homes, Equity Residential, Shea Homes, Toll Brothers. We feel that they're making good progress in gaining a larger presence with the new home construction side. As home construction returns, we believe we will be very well positioned to fully participate in the industry upturn.   
On Slide 9, we detailed first quarter results for North America. Our net sales have increased 7% to $2.3 billion, and excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, sales improved 5%. Our unit shipments increased 11%, while U.S. industry demand for T7 appliances improved 6%. On an adjusted base, our operating margin was 6.2% compared to the 4.8% in the prior year. And this profit growth was driven by cost and productivity initiatives and higher volumes, partially offset by lower price and mix.   
On Slide 10, you can see a sample of some of the products we introduced during the quarter, including a Whirlpool brand tall-tub dishwasher for the value-conscious consumer segment, which sold exceptionally well during the first quarter. It holds up to 12 place settings, features a one-hour wash cycle and is the most energy and water efficient in its class. Or you will see also Whirlpool brand Cabrio high efficiency top-load washing machine, which features the largest capacity in the market and a low water wash system that uses less water per load yet delivers better cleaning performance. And lastly, in the middle, you see KitchenAid brand French-door refrigerator featuring a larger capacity, a full door LCD screen that displays use and care information and offers a kitchen timer, access to suggested ingredient substitution and a USB support.  
In summary, we're off to a very good start. We have a positive momentum as demand levels improve, a strong productivity throughout the business, and we'll be launching a number of our new product innovations in the second half of the year. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations."

During the first quarter, we saw a continuation of the favorable trends in our key emerging market businesses. Latin America and Asia reported strong results as these regions continue to report solid economic growth, particularly in Brazil and India. And more importantly for our business, consumers are increasingly benefiting from the quality-of-life improvements that our products provide. European market conditions remained challenging during the quarter. However, we did begin to see moderate demand improvement in Western Europe during March. As the region begins stabilizing, our focus remains on continuing to improve our cost structure.  
Turning to Slide 13, our European sales improved 6% year-over-year to $739 million in the quarter, with unit shipments increasing 1% from the prior-year period. In local currency, sales declined approximately 2% from the prior year. The region reported an operating margin of 3.6% as results were driven by cost and productivity initiatives.   
First quarter results from Latin America are summarized on Slide 14. The region reported sales of $1.1 billion, a 65% increase from the $689 million reported in 2009 as appliance unit shipments increased 50%. Excluding the impact on currency sales, sales increased approximately 40%. The sales increase was driven by strong demand across most of our served markets in the region and favorable foreign currency exchange. On an adjusted basis, operating profit reached $167 million compared to $83 million reported during the prior-year period.   
Our first quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 15. Net sales increased 60% during the quarter to $192 million, up from $120 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 49%. Unit shipments also increased 49% during the quarter. Our increased unit shipments are being driven by continued strong growth in India as well as growth from our expanded product offering and strong product sales in China. Operating profit during the quarter was $11 million compared with $5 million reported in the prior year. The operational improvement was primarily related to higher unit volumes. These improvements were partially offset by lower price/mix. Our international businesses also produced a strong cadence of product introductions in the quarter.   
On Slide 16, you'll see just a few of our international product launches, including a line of built-in steam ovens in Europe, the first eco-efficient refrigerators in India, with these premium frost-free refrigerators coming in both two-door and three-door models, and water purifiers in Latin America that can be both installed and maintained by consumers. Our global innovation pipeline continues to be strong, and we are meeting the needs of our consumers everywhere in the world in more ways than ever before. 
In summary, for the international business, we are seeing strong demand in the key emerging markets, which is supported by a strong product offering and increasing consumer demand, while productivity improvements are offsetting higher material costs in those markets, which is contributing to improved operating margin.  And we are seeing a stabilizing European market, in which our cost focus is now contributing to improved operating earnings. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roy Templin for his financial review."
314515,100674011,58203,"Whirlpool Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2010",2010-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone.

Beginning on Slide 18, I'll walk you through a summary of our first quarter performance. Our net sales marked the second consecutive quarter of strong year-over-year increases with our first quarter units increasing approximately 18% from the prior year. Our revenue was also favorably impacted by foreign exchange translation, which accounted for approximately eight points of the year-over-year increase. The favorable impact was primarily related to a stronger Brazilian real and the euro compared with the prior year.  
Looking at our margins during the first quarter, the positive year-over-year increase was primarily from our productivity and cost-reduction actions, as well as higher sales volumes. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower price/mix.   
Finally, before we take a look at the income statement in detail, there are a couple of items I would like to highlight that impacted our first quarter. The first is a $75 million accrual for a supplier-related quality issue. Second, we recorded a $29 million curtailment gain related to a post-retirement benefit plan. And finally, we monetized $41 million of BPX credits during the first quarter.  
Turning to the income statement on Slide 19, we reported net sales of just under $4.3 billion, an increase of 20% from the prior year. Our gross margin rose 0.3 of a point to 15.0%. As I mentioned previously, the most significant favorable impact on our gross margin improvement related to our cost and productivity actions, which were partially offset by lower price/mix. SG&A expense totaled $371 million. Foreign currency translation and the non-recurrence of the prior-year curtailment gain, accounted for approximately 80% of the dollar variance compared with the prior year. 
As a percentage of sales, SG&A declined to 8.7% from 9.2% in the prior year.  Restructuring expenses totaled $20 million during the quarter and were largely related to cost reduction actions in Europe and a previously announced facility closure. We continue to expect to record restructuring expenses of approximately $100 million during 2010.  Finally, our operating margin expanded one point from the prior year to 5.6%. On an adjusted basis, our operating margin was 6.7%.  
Turning to Slide 20, I wanted to briefly discuss interest and sundry expense. The main favorable variances from the prior-year's level relate to foreign exchange and higher interest income from our overall higher cash balance. Turning to our tax rate, we recorded an income tax credit of $3 million during the quarter, corresponding to an effective tax rate benefit of approximately 2%. The first quarter credit was below our previous expectation, largely as a result of higher pretax income. Given our revised earnings outlook, we are currently estimating our full year tax rate to approximate zero plus or minus 5% finally, we reported diluted earnings per share of $2.13 per share. On an adjusted basis, our EPS totaled $2.51 per share.   
Moving to our first quarter free cash flow results on Slide 21, and as Jeff mentioned earlier, we had a strong year-over-year improvement. This improvement was driven by a year-over-year increase in cash earnings and a lower amount of working capital investment as we increased our production levels. These items were partially offset by higher capital spending levels during the quarter.  
Turning to Slide 22, we summarize our net liquidity position. As you can see from this table, our net liquidity position remained over $3 billion at the end of the quarter. Our cash balance was just under $1.2 billion, and we had full availability under our revolving credit facility. Given our strong liquidity position, we are planning to repay our $325 million 8.6% coupon note, which is due on May 1, to further improve our credit metrics and generate interest expense savings.  
On Slide 23, you can see a summary of our revised full year outlook. We are now expecting to report earnings per share in the range of $8 and $8.50 per share. This outlook includes approximately $0.10 of net expenses related to the $75 million accrual for a supplier-related quality issue recorded in the first quarter and a $62 million gain related to the full year impact of an OPEB curtailment gain. As Jeff reviewed previously, we expect to have a more favorable impact on increased global volumes, as well as our ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives.   
From a headwind perspective, we continue to see cost inflation as our main challenge this year. Given the recent trends in some raw material prices, we now see our material costs trending toward the higher end of the $200 million to $300 million range for the full year.  Turning to our cash flow outlook, we are projecting free cash flow between $500 million to $600 million, up from our previous expectation of $400 million to $500 million, due to higher cash earnings. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

Let me summarize, we are pleased with our progress and results so far in the first part of this year. As you know, over the last two years, we've been challenged with both significant volume and production declines due to lower consumer demand. And as we've discussed many times over this period of time, we've taken very strong steps to structurally align our cost structure and improve our asset utilization.   
Slide 26 illustrates what we've done, and I think importantly what we're continuing to do. I believe our first quarter results reflect the impact of what some demand growth enables us to do with a very efficient cost structure. Going forward, we are remaining very focused on cost reduction and cash generation, as we did last year. And in addition, we will benefit from revenue growth due to both our strong, new product innovations, which will bring the marketplace throughout the course of this year, and improved demand levels.  
I truly believe this combination will produce very strong operating results and we look forward to continuing these trends as we go forward. I'm going to end here now and I'd like to open this up for questions and answers."

First and foremost, we continue to be -- we're very focused on cost reduction productivity initiatives. And typically, and this year is what I would call so far a typical year, these ramp up throughout the course of the year as you execute projects and that sort of thing. And obviously, increased volume and production is immediate, because we see that in the conversion costs, so that's really dependent upon it. But I would expect we will continue to execute very well in productivity. And if anything, probably accelerate the rate of productivity throughout the course of the year. The flip side of that, is of course, material cost. We've said that it's in the $200 million to $300 million range. Probably the higher end of that range as we see it right now. Those, too, will probably ramp up as we go throughout the course of the year. Regarding volume, volume's positive to our margins, so you saw the outlook, we've increased that, so that should help. And then PMR, price/mix if you will, first of all, we're very pleased with the results we saw in Q1. Year-over-year comparisons are tough because we had such a big increase Q1 of last year. But sequentially from Q4, we actually improved our price/mix. We're seeing very strong mix in our business. I think we had some very impactive product introductions throughout the course of the year, which are high volume, which should have a positive impact on the mix. That's why, even with a negative first quarter comparison on price/mix, we think for the full year it will be generally neutral. So -- and again, how we get there is slightly different per region only because the external environment is different. But I would say in general, those are all the same characteristics we're focusing on everywhere."

So if you just think of the first quarter of last year, it was not impacted by the stimulus program. So this is really a quarter, this quarter this year, running through that. And if you remember, it ended in January, but there was inventory in the pipeline. So that inventory has kind of come through the system. As we look forward, therefore, what we think is we're going to see some moderation in the growth because we're now at fairly high levels. And so that's why we're saying the growth for the balance of the year is going to be more moderate, but think about it's more moderate on already pretty high levels as that stimulus program kicked in over the remainder of the year. The last point that I'd like to make is just the underlying economics in Brazil, and frankly, for many of the other Latin American countries, is pretty strong.

So from a market share perspective, these OEM losses are pretty much a non-event. That is largely driven by increased floor space pretty much across all retailers, in particular in our branded side. So its not one channel, which we will point out, there's a number of trade parts across all channels where we expanded our floor space. So we feel overall, very good about our share momentum coming out of Q4 into Q1, in particular, branded side.

So sequentially, we're improving our price/mix. And if you may or may not recall, but in Q3 last year, and a little bit in Q4, we did say that we did do some structural price repositioning and particularly in the North American marketplace, on certain very competitive, really intense categories. We did that. You saw the momentum we got by doing that both in Q4 and Q1. But at the same time, we continue to drive mix. And we had a very favorable, again, favorable mix period improvement over almost a full point versus even Q4. So the trends are, I would say pricing stable, mix growing, as we start comping against last year's numbers. That's how we think we'll get to the neutral plus or minus a little. In terms of pricing, and all I can say is well we've done pricing and we talked about some markets like India, where we've had very high material cost inflation. I believe we announced two price increases so far, one in December, one a month or so ago.

So then you have North America and Europe, as we've talked in the past, in the large majority of our needs, we typically contract with multiple suppliers. We pretty much know the range of outcomes, certainly for the balance of this year. And we're comfortable those are well represented in our guidance.

Now you say, well how do you get to zero this year and the math is, it's a little bigger than energy credits because you have energy tax credits at about 18 points. Recall that the BPX credits are not taxable, that's about a 6 point benefit on our overall tax rate. And then we get roughly four points of benefit from global R&D credits that we earn around the world. And so that's how you get from sort of the blended rate back down to zero and you can think of those as you look forward as well."

Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation's second quarter conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Roy Templin, our Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call we will make - be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to the many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q.
Turning to Slide 2, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying business.
Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation on Slide 29 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.
With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.

I think as you saw, earlier this morning, we released our second quarter financial results. You can find these results on Slide 4.
Overall, we had another solid quarter of top line growth with sales reaching $4.5 billion, which was a 9% increase versus last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, revenues increased by about 6%. Our earnings per share were $2.64 per share compared with $1.04 in the prior year.
We are very happy to see strong improvement in operating performance in each of our regions during the quarter, which was primarily a result of the successful execution of our cost and productivity initiatives. Our adjusted operating margin improved to 6.6% during the second quarter, making good progress towards our mid-term target of 8%. Overall, I feel very good about the progress we made in margin improvement during the first half of the year.
Also during the first half of the year, free cash flow improved by about $100 million. This year-over-year improvement in free cash flow is a result of our continued focus on cash generation, which is being driven by earnings improvement and strong working capital management.
Turning now to Slide 5, I would like to provide an update on our global and regional demand outlook for the year. While overall our demand outlook is essentially unchanged from our previous outlook, I would like to highlight a few key trends we are seeing across the globe.
Overall for the quarter, we did see better-than-expected unit shipments on a global basis. In many of our global regions, you will note that we are expecting positive growth in the second half of the year, but at a lower rate than we had in the first half of the year.
In the U.S., you have to go back to 2004 to find three consecutive quarters of industry growth and a comparable growth rate to what we've seen over the last nine months. There are several factors that have impacted this industry growth that Marc Bitzer will cover in detail in a moment.
Overall, we continue to anticipate positive industry growth for the remainder of the year. In the U.S., we do expect the rate of growth to be in the 1% to 2% versus what we saw in the first half.
In Europe, we continue to expect conditions will remain relatively stable. The industry produced a modest rate of growth through the first half of the year and we continue to anticipate full-year industry demand to be about equal to last year.
In Latin America, the underlying economic fundamentals remain strong and we continue to see full-year growth in the range of 10%. And as we expected, we did see moderation in the Brazilian demand as we are now comparing against significant unit gains that we saw a year ago. We do expect industry growth there as well to remain positive as the year progresses, but our outlook does imply a slowing of growth as we comp against very strong results and demand reported in the second half of last year.
And finally, we continue to expect our markets in Asia to grow in the 5% to 8% range. India continues to see the strongest growth rate and - but we are also - we are experiencing growth in China as well.
Turning to Slide 6, you will see the key drivers which are impacting our business for the year really are unchanged. We do expect our cost reduction and productivity initiatives will continue to drive improved earnings. And while our unit volumes will be positive, that will be less of a contributor to margins in the second of the year as they were in the first half of the year. We continue to anticipate that currency impacts for the year will generally be neutral to our operating results and given some first half trends, we do expect price mix to have a flat to modestly unfavorable impact on our full-year results.
Finally, we continue to see a lot of volatility in raw materials costs. And while we are encouraged by recent trends, we still expect material cost inflation to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million for the year. Based on current market prices, we expect our full-year costs will be about in the middle of this range, which has somewhat improved from our previous outlook at the high-end of the range.
  Given our first half performance and these economic indicators that we are forecasting, we have raised our guidance and we now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $9 to $9.50 per share compared to our previous outlook of $8 to $8.50 a share. We've also increased our free cash flow guidance for the year, which is now $550 million to $650 million compared to our previous guidance of $500 million to $600 million. Roy will go into more detail on this outlook later in the call.
So at this point in time, I would like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer for his review of our North America operations.

First half industry shipment volumes were stronger than expected. Going forward, we see a moderating growth - rate of growth over second half, driven by a number of elements; relatively more difficult comparison, the end of the appliance stimulus program, and a lack of inventory rebuilding we experienced in the retail channel during the first half.
Overall, we made good progress and strong progress towards profitability improvement in our North American business. We successfully implemented a number of operating initiatives to drive strong cost and productivity and we feel very good about the new innovations which we are bringing to the market across our entire product portfolio. Early consumer acceptance of some of these has been very strong. Going forward, we remain focused on the successful execution of these programs.
On Slide 9, we detail second quarter results for North America. Our net sales increased 6% to $2.5 billion. Excluding the impact of the foreign currency exchange, sales improved 4%. Our unit shipments increased 7%, while U.S. industry demand for T7 appliance improved 12%. As we noted on the last conference call, we did continue to experience availability issues on some of our key products during the quarter, which negatively impacted our overall share during the quarter compared to prior year. We did see higher branded share, while our OEM share declined year-over-year.
Our operating margin on an adjusted base was 6.6% compared to 5.0% in the prior year. Overall, our profit growth was driven by cost and productivity initiatives and higher volume, partially offset by lower price mix and higher material and oil-related costs.
On Slide 10, you can see some of our new products that we've unveiled, including the Maytag brand Bravos X high efficiency laundry - top-load laundry pair that offers exceptionally energy efficiency and powerful stain removal. Bravos X can realize more than 70% water and energy savings with its low water wash system.
You will see also the KitchenAid brand electric and gas downdraft cooktop; this marks the first time KitchenAid has offered a gas downdraft cooktop; and the Whirlpool brand side-by-side refrigerator featuring MicroEtch Spill Control Shelves and 25% more usable shelf space than other Whirlpool side-by-side models.
On Slide 11, the chart depicts some of the most recent demand trends in the U.S. The yellow line depicts our current industry outlook of 5%. You can see the first half industry demand was well in excess of it as a result of some of the impact from the cash for appliance program, the inventory rebuild in the retail channel, and higher replacement demand. We expect replacement demand to drive 1% to 2% industry growth, which we will see in the second half of this year.
Let me just summarize here. We had a very strong start of the year for our North American business. We made good progress restoring our operating margins and we are focused on successful execution of a number of significant new product innovations in the second half of the year.
Now, I would like to turn it over to Mike for his review of international operations.

Before I move to our European results, let me begin with a general overview of our international business. While our international operations were mixed during the second quarter, we continued to benefit from our ongoing cost reduction and productivity efforts. During the second quarter, we continued to see stabilizing market conditions in our Europe region, while our India and Brazil businesses were very strong.
Turning to Slide 13, our European sales declined 6% year-over-year to $739 million in the quarter with unit shipments increasing 5%. In local currency, sales were essentially flat compared to the prior year. The region reported an operating profit of $20 million during the second quarter compared to an operating loss of $12 million in the previous year. The profitability improvement was driven by continued cost reductions and productivity improvements.
Second quarter results from Latin America are summarized on Slide 14. The region reported sales of $1 billion, a 24% increase from the $844 million reported in 2009. And we saw a 2% decline in appliance unit shipments. Excluding the impact from currency, sales increased approximately 13%. On an adjusted basis, operating profit reached $165 million compared to $75 million reported during the prior-year period. The profitability improvement is primarily related to cost reduction and productivity initiatives, increased monetization of certain tax credits, and favorable price product mix.
While our Brazilian appliance business continued to have strong profitability, we also saw strong improvements in our served appliance markets outside Brazil and our compressor business during the second quarter. In Brazil, we did see reduced demand as a result of the expiration of the of IPI tax-reduction incentive program and to a lesser extent, the World Cup as retailers shifted their focus to brown goods from white goods during that period.
Our second quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 15. Net sales increased 43% during the quarter to $263 million, up from $184 million in the prior-year period as unit shipments increased 28%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 34%. Operating profit during the quarter was $15 million compared with $11 million reported in the prior year. The operational improvement was primarily related to higher unit volumes. These improvements were partially offset by higher material and oil-related costs.
Our international businesses also produced a strong cadence of product introductions in the quarter. Through these launches and our ongoing consumer-relevant product introductions, we continue to find ways to meet the needs of our consumers everywhere in the world.
On Slide 16, you will see just a few of our international product launches during the quarter, including a three-door refrigerator in China, featuring a middle door that can be used as a refrigerator or a freezer; the Whirlpool brand side-by-side refrigerator in Europe that features asymmetrical fully flushed handles, glass panels, and modern color options; and the EcoStyle dishwasher in Europe that features 24 rotating spray jets and Green sensor technology to reduce energy and water consumption by up to 50%.
Turning to Slide 17, I would like to summarize our international outlook. Through the first half, we have reported improved operating results across all of our regions. This improvement was due to a strong focus on cost reduction and driving strong productivity from improved volume levels. Overall, we do expect moderating, yet positive demand in the second half and are confident we can continue to generate strong results.
On Slide 18, we show the year-over-year trends within our Latin American business. As you can see, we are now comping against the strong volume growth we had in the final nine months of 2009. Despite this, however, we are expecting to see a moderately positive growth rate in the second half, which equates to a full-year demand increase of approximately 10%. I would like to highlight for you that we continue to see solid economic indicators in Brazil and remain very positive on the long-term economic prospects of that country.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Roy Templin for his financial review.

Appliance unit",947,"Thanks, Mike and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 20, I would like to summarize our second quarter results. For the third consecutive quarter, our net sales showed a strong year-over-year improvement with our net sales rising 9%. Appliance unit volumes increased 6.3% from the prior year. This performance was largely driven by increased unit volumes in our Asia and North America regions.
Our revenue was favorably impacted by foreign exchange translation, which accounted for approximately 2.5 points of the improvement. This favorable impact was largely driven by movements in the Brazilian reais, which appreciated approximately 15% against the dollar. Much like the first quarter performance, our second quarter operating margins improved as a result of our productivity and cost reduction initiatives.
  During the second quarter, we monetized $47 million of BEFIEX tax credits compared to $9 million in the prior year. If you recall, in the prior year we saw a significant reduction in our BEFIEX monetization due to the IPI tax reduction legislated by the Brazilian government, which expired on February 1st. Finally, as we had previously indicated, these favorable effects were partially offset by lower price mix as we comped against strong prior-year results in this area.
Before we take a look at the income statement in detail, there are a few items I would like to highlight. The first is a $53 million accrual for legal costs and contingencies related to a several-decades-old case pertaining to a collection dispute. Second, we reported a $33 million curtailment gain related to a post-retirement benefit plan.
Turning to the income statement on Slide 21, we reported net sales of just over $4.5 billion. Our gross margin rose 3.5 points to 16.8%. The most significant favorable impact on our gross margin improvement related to our cost and productivity actions, which were partially offset by lower price mix and higher material costs.
SG&A expenses totaled $401 million. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $6 million of the $11 million year-over-year increase. Given the growth in the quarter, we saw a good SG&A leverage as SG&A as a percentage of sales declined half a point to 8.8% of net sales.
Restructuring expenses totaled $22 million during the quarter and were largely related to cost reduction actions in Europe and a previously announced facility closure. We continue to expect to record restructuring expenses of approximately $100 million during 2010.
  Finally, our operating margin expanded 4.1 points from the prior year to 7.3%. On an adjusted basis, our operating margin was 6.6%.
Turning to Slide 22, I wanted to briefly discuss interest and sundry expense. The $53 million legal accrual I noted previously accounted for nearly all of the $57 million year-to-year increase.
Turning to our tax rate, we recorded an income tax credit of $8 million during the quarter, corresponding to an effective tax rate benefit of approximately 4%. The second quarter credit was in line with our previous expectation of a tax rate of approximately zero, plus or minus 5%. For the full year, we are currently estimating our rate will be more towards the 5 credit end of the range versus the midpoint.
Finally, we reported diluted earnings per share of $2.64 per share. On an adjusted basis, our EPS totaled $2.82 per share.
Moving to our free cash flow results on Slide 23, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we had a $174 million improvement in our cash flow provided by operating activities. This improvement was driven by a year-over-year improvement in our cash earnings. This was partially offset by higher net working capital, predominantly related to higher inventory levels. However, overall working capital levels were down significantly when compared to the prior year on both an absolute and relative basis. Our capital spending has increased $38 million, largely as a result of new product launch spending in the North America region.
Turning to Slide 24, I would like to highlight our continued progress in debt reduction. During the second quarter, we repaid our $325 million 8.6% note, which reduced our total debt by approximately 11% from the March 31st level. While our net debt levels increased slightly during the quarter, given our free cash flow outlook and lack of debt maturing over the balance of the year, we expect to continue to reduce our net debt balance by year-end.
On Slide 25, we summarize our net liquidity position. As you can see from this table, our net liquidity position was over $2.7 billion at the end of the quarter. Based on our new credit agreement that was signed last year, our revolving credit facility will downsize by approximately $522 million in December. Even taking this into account, our liquidity will remain a very strong $2.2 billion at the end of the year.
On Slide 26, you can see a summary of our revised full-year outlook. We are now expecting to report earnings per share in the range of $9 and $9.50 per share. This outlook includes approximately $0.56 of net expenses related to our previous disclosed product recall, the legal accrual, and the OPEB curtailment gain.
While we see material cost inflation more towards the midpoint of our $200 million to $300 million range compared to the previous outlook of the high-end of this range, it is important to note that the majority of these costs will be realized in the second half of the year when compared with the first.
Turning to our cash flow outlook, we are projecting free cash flow between $550 million to $650 million, up from our previous expectation of $500 million to $600 million, due predominantly to higher cash earnings.
At this point, I will turn the call back over to Jeff.

We feel good about our ability to continue to deliver strong performance by executing our key operating priorities, which we outlined earlier in the year.

With that, we expect to deliver a record year of operating results and value creation for our shareholders.

Sure, Eric. Let me start with the margin progression. We've been saying for some time that our strong focus was to expand our operating margins in the business and that we would do that through driving product innovation, which enables our ability to get price margin realization throughout the business and through continuing our global cost management program, which we made very good progress in the last two years and we expect to - this to continue in the future.
So what you see in margin expansion, I would say, is still largely driven from that. We did have some volume benefit in the first half of the year as it related to conversion productivity. We have a lot of levers that we drive from new product design to procurement to lean manufacturing in our factories to lean in our supply chain and so on. And so we get there in a different way throughout the year, but we still are very confident in our ability, certainly at positive demand levels to drive very strong levels of cost productivity throughout our business. So that will be a big driver.
Price margin realization has been a positive in the last two years. It's running - we are running against some big comps this year. So it's negative in the first half of the year. Underlying that, we are seeing some very positive mix trends. We have very significant and impactful new product innovation, high volume, I would add, particularly in North America in the second half of this year. So I expect that to continue as well. So overall, our two big drivers are really - margin realization through innovation and cost productivity are the big drivers to get us there.
Related to the growth rates in North America, let me - I'll ask Marc Bitzer to answer that.

It's important to highlight that our branded business is still growing, but it has not been able to fully offset our OEM losses.
A key driver behind this one was and we indicated that in the last earnings call, we had availability issues on key components throughout the second quarter. I would like to point out we are at the tail-end of these availability issues. So obviously, as we restore availability, we have a certain - we are feeling comfortable about the ability to regain share.
In addition, and adding to what Jeff was saying, is these product launches which we have are significant and maybe the pictures don't do justice to explaining what it really means to our core business. For example is top-loader. That brings the entire appeal of high-efficiency laundry, which was previously on high-end top-loaders and front-loaders to entire mass market of top-loaders, which is at a very core of our business.
So we feel very comfortable and confident about these product launches as a key driver to bring the share levels back to a very strong Q1 run rate.

In terms of the overall Latin American business, we saw very strong growth outside of Brazil. So we've got many markets that we do business outside of Brazil and we did see significant growth in those markets. Obviously in Brazil, we did see demand reduce, but the reason why we are confident that going forward we will see a slightly positive increase is because the overall fundamentals in the Brazil economy are very strong.
We expect to continue to see strong growth outside of Brazil as well and we believe that even though we are comping kind of over very high levels that those fundamentals will overlay, if you will, negative comps overall. I did mention very briefly that we did see some declines in May and June, but they were probably more significant than normal just because of retailers focusing more on brown goods than white goods just during that period. So we are actually fairly confident that we are going to see flat to slightly up growth in that market - those markets.

When we talk about price margin realization, we are talking largely about the positive or negative impact on our operating margins. And so that this different than what, for example, you were talking about in Europe where you saw a - on a current local currency basis, a 3% to 4% change in average selling price.
In - in the - just in Europe, we had a - I would say, a very minor change in what we would consider price mix on the margin level, very, very modestly - modest change. The average selling price difference was really in over 32 countries - there have been wildly different demand levels in those 32 different countries. So the country mix really impacted the ASP. You can shift back, if the demand comes back in certain markets we sell at higher average ASP products, not necessarily higher-margin products. So that's really the ASP issue; Europe, which is very mildly negative.
In the case of North America, we talked really for some time about two things. One, we had substantial positive price mix realization a year ago in the first half of the year. So we are comping against very tough numbers on that regard. And the second, we also talked about the third quarter last year. We did, based on competitive pressures, take some price adjustments on certain key models, high-volume models, which turned that price mix negative, which was carried forward.
Underlying that, we don't - haven't seen a lot of changes at all on prices since then. And I would say, our mix is actually continues to be positive and adding to that. So I think part of it's the comp and the trends actually have been positive. And we said all along, first half of the year would be negative because of the weight of the comparison in North America.

And in the overall price mix, which is sort of the source of your question, was negative nine-tenths of a point.
Now, Michael, the interesting thing that you have to put in perspective here is the international business grew relative to the total Whirlpool business and the ASVs in our international business are obviously lower than North America. And so a big chunk of that, roughly two-thirds of that, nine-tenths of a point was due to our inter-regional sales mix shift year-over-year.

Well, first of all, Michael, you know I really can't predict 2011 at this point. We will do that in next February. But I can certainly give you some perspective and color with respect to your question.
First of all, as I said in my script, we still maintain the range that we shared with you last quarter, albeit we think we will be at more of the credit end of the range versus the debit. And you probably saw that fairly intuitively, we had a couple of points credit in the first quarter, 4 point credit in the second quarter. So we are right about 3% credit at the mid-year. We see that sort of trending into the future as well.
To the second part of your question though, which is next year, again I would take you back to - if you look at Whirlpool Corporation and you look at the dispersion of our earnings sort of year-end and year-out and I'm not getting specific yet on 2011, Michael, because it - I'm just not ready yet. But if you sort of look at this blended trend line, you would expect to see our tax rate in the high 20s to 30% in terms of an expense as a tax rate on an ongoing run rate basis.
You are correct that based upon current legislation, the energy tax credits would go away. And so you - I would expect to see that tax rate go back in that mid-20s kind of range or upper-20s kind of range; again, absent having any specificity on '11 earnings dispersion.

We had some other issues.

We made those and those between - they've already been happening between now and September. Those will be readjusted.

So your perspective and point on working capital is true. We do anticipate staying lean with working capital. We've said that in our guidance earlier in the year. As I mentioned in my script, Jeff, that we continue to maintain low working capital levels relative to historical levels or run rate levels, but then we have the earnings piece, as well as the continued improvement in working capital in the back half of the year.
We are also front half of the year, as you know, loaded in terms of compensation disbursements, some of our marketing program disbursements. So you tend to see that cash disbursement come out very quickly in the first part of the year and then of course you build accruals in the back part of the year, which are non-cash.

We need to bear in mind in this context is the housing side of that growth is still very depressed and you all see the housing start number and that's pretty much defined what we see from that part in 2010. So that also means on the retail side we see moderate but solid growth in the second half.

Before we began let me remind you that we conduct this call we will be making forward looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation’s future expectations. Our actual results could differ maturely from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10K and 10Q.
Turning to slide 2, we want to remind you that today’s presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as the exclude items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with the better baseline for understanding trends in our underlying business.
Listeners are directed to the pending section of our presentation on slight 28 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items the most directly comparable gap measures. Our remarks track with the presentation available on the investor section of our website at Whirlpoolcorp.com.

During the quarter, as we expected, we faced the challenge in environment in some markets which resulted in slowing the sales growth compared to the first half of the year. We were able to quickly adapt to these economic changes due to our ongoing focus on cost reductions, productivity, and our innovative new product launches.
Revenues for the quarter came in $4.5 billion and that is flat versus last year. On an adjusted basis, our EPS was $2.22 per share compared to $1.67 in prior year. Our productivity results were very positive during the quarter enabled us to meet the challenges related to volume in some markets, price mix and higher material cost. On a year-to-date basis free cash flow was flat which was an improvement from the first half usage of $80 million.
Turning to slide 5, I would like to provide you with an update for the full year on our regional demand outlook. In the US, we now expect our full year demand in shipments to be up approximately 3% versus the 5% that we had discussed early this year. We did see some softness in demand here in the third quarter. In spite of this weakening demand environment, overall we performed very well from a brand and share perspective.
In Europe, we continue to see industry growth improvement during the quarter. We increased our full year outlook to a demand growth of 1 to 3% as we now see demand growth for three consecutive quarters across the region.
In Latin America, we saw appliance demand rebound after some moderation in demand late in the second quarter. As you may recall, we had some significant events and results during the second quarter related to the expiration of the IPI tax holiday and the effects of the World Cup. We see the underlying economic fundamentals there remaining very strong and we continue to see full year growth in demand in the range of 10%.
Finally, we saw healthy growth again in Asia. Our businesses there continued to grow at a strong double digit rate during the quarter. We have increased our full year industry outlook for Asia to 8% to 10% for the full year.
I will now turn to slide 6, where you see the key drivers which are impacting our business for the year. We expect our cost reduction and productivity initiatives will continue to be the main driver behind our overall improvement as they have throughout the year. We managed our cost reductions efforts effectively and we expect to continue to benefit from these actions for the balance of this year.
As you know, we have seen foreign currency exchange become very volatile during the quarter but we’ve been able to contain and mitigate these risks and expect foreign currency impacts will be manageable at today’s (inaudible).
Finally, as we expected, we continue to see unfavorability in the area of material cost for the third quarter. For the full year we now see material cost trailing towards the lower end of the $200 million to $300 million estimate that we gave you throughout the year.
Finally, given the trends that we saw in the third quarter, we now expect price mix to have an unfavorable impact on our full year results, and while we have had a very positive consumer receptions to our new product innovation launch during the third quarter, the overall price mix environment was more challenging than our previous expectations particularly in North America.
Looking all these factors in total, we’ve been able to offset the negatives that we saw in the external environment with the internal actions that we’re driving. We continue to expect to generate our adjusted earnings per share for the year in the range of $9.56 to $10.06 per share. Our free cash flow gains remains unchanged for the year, which is $550 million to $650 million.
At this point in time, I’d like to turn it over to, Marc Bitzer for his review of the North America operations.

As shown on slide 8, we saw strong branded share growth during the quarter, driven by our consumer relevant innovation and improvement in some of the product availability issues we experienced during the second quarter.
Our three new product launches are well-received by consumers, but on the same time industry volumes and the pricing environment were more challenging than expected and we took actions to meet some aggressive competitive pricing pressure.
On slide nine, we detailed North America’s performance in the third quarter. Net sales decreased 3% to $2.4 billion driven by lower average sales values in the quarter. I will touch on this momentarily, but this decline is largely related to reductions in three major product categories.
Our North America unit shipments increased approximately 1%, while U.S. industry unit shipments of major T7 appliances decreased 3% during the third quarter. We had, as mentioned before, a strong increase in brand and share during the quarter. Our operating margin was 4.7% compared to 5.9% in the prior year. Overall the results were unfavorably impacted by lower price mix and higher material costs. Favorable cost reductions and productivity initiatives partially offset the unfavorable items.
On slide 10, you can see some of our new products that we expect to continue to support our branded share growth. The Maytag brand Ice20 Easy Access Refrigerator which is the industry’s most efficient four-door refrigerator. It features an external counter height refrigerator door that holds up to five bags of groceries. We also launched the Whirlpool brand most premium front load Duet (inaudible). This is the industry resource efficient washer and dryer.
Finally, the KitchenAid brand dishwasher featuring a modern version of a recessed handle found on (inaudible). I would like to point out that all of these new launches happened towards the end of the first quarter.
On slide 11, the chart depicts ASU, average sales value industry trend by category. First thing you will note is that we generally buy distribution on a year-over-year basis; there is some categories up and others down. You will also note that the overall reduction is mainly attributable to two categories. We like to rest some of our price points in these categories given the competitive environment and we saw subsequently a strong in our brand and share performance.
It is also important to note that our new products innovations start to provide an overall ASV lift and we continue to focus on successfully launching our new products and continuing to generate more new products in the future.
Overall, I would sum the third quarter as challenging from a demand and price environment. We continue to address the green consumer relevancy product to market and keeping a strong focus on cost control and productivity.
Now, I would like to turn over to Mike for a review of our international operations.

Our international operating results continued to benefit from our ongoing cost reduction and productivity efforts and solid volume growth from our emerging markets. During the third quarter we experienced improved market conditions in Brazil, slight improvement in Europe while Asia unit volumes remained very strong.
Turning to slide 13, our European sales declined 8% year-over-year to $827 million in the quarter with unit shipments increasing 6%. Excluding the effects of currency, sales were essentially flat compared to the prior year. The region reported an operating profit of $26 million during the third quarter compared to an operating profit of $14 million in the previous year. The profitability improvement was driven continued cost reductions and productivity improvement which was partially offset by higher material costs and lower price mix.
Slide 14 shows a summary of our Latin American third quarter results. The region reported sales of $1.1 billion, a 13% increase from the prior year period as the appliance unit shipments increased 9%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 9%. Operating profit reached $143 million compared to $93 million reported in the prior year. The profitability improvement is primarily related to the increase in volume, cost reduction and productivity initiatives and increased monetization of certain tax spreads. These favorable items were partially offset by higher material cost and lower price mix.
Our third quarter results in the Asia region are shown on slide 15. Net sales increased 21% during the quarter to $195 million, up from $162 million in prior year period as unit shipments increased 18%. Excluding the impact of currency sales increased 16%.
On an adjusted basis operating profit reached $5 million for the quarter versus the $5 million generated in the prior year period. Favorables, volume growth and productivity was offset by higher material and oil related costs.
Turning to slide 16, you will see just a few of our international product launches during the quarter including the Bauknecht brand, Cosmos built in coffee machine in Europe. The machine makes coffee and froth’s milk at the press of a button and can make espresso, café latte or cappuccino.
The Brastemp a TV and washing machine in Latin America. It features an additional wash basket for delicate clothes and a special option on the machine can reduce soap stains by premixing soap and water before it comes into contact with fabrics. The new Whirlpool brand Ace semi-automatic washing machine in India, which offers a built in work surface and a handle and wheels for portability.
Turning to slide 17, I would like to summarize our international outlook for the remainder of 2010. We see demand levels improving slightly in Europe and expect to continue to see margin expansion as a result of our ongoing productivity efforts. As we discussed on the previous call, in Latin America, the slight negative growth rate in the second quarter recovered nicely in the third quarter despite more difficult comparisons, and we expect continued growth in the region for the remainder of the year. In Asia, we expect to continue to see positive growth through year-end.
In all the international regions, we will continue to focus on productivity to offset continued cost increases. In addition, the international organization is focused on continuing to bring consumer-relevant innovation that will improve our price mix. Our innovative new products continue to improve our price mix in the third quarter, despite the overall degradation we experienced. Going forward, we are focused on bringing more of these products to the market at a faster pace.
Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Roy Templin for his financial review.

For the quarter, our sales grew one half of a percentage point to $4.5 billion. Appliance unit volumes increased 5% from the prior year, while all of our regions reported unit volume increases during the quarter the overall increase was largely driven by higher unit volumes in our international operations. We continue to see a significant benefit from our productivity and cost reduction initiatives during the quarter.
In addition to this, we monetized $56 million of BEFIEX credits compared to $8 million in prior year. If you recall in the prior year we saw a significant reduction in our BEFIEX monetization due to the IPI tax reduction, legislated by the Brazilian government, which expired on February 1. Finally, these favorable effects were partially offset by lower price mix and higher material cost.
Before we take a look at the income statement in detail, there is one item I would like to highlight. During the quarter we recorded a $93 million accrual related to Embraco settlement agreements. This resulted in an unfavorable impact of $1.20 per diluted share on our third quarter results.
Turning to the income statement on slide 20, we reported net sales of just over $4.5 billion. Our gross margins rose 50 basis points to 14.3%. The most significant favorable impacts on our gross margin improvement related to our cost take out and productivity actions and the higher BEFIEX credits, which were partially offset by lower price mix and higher material cost.
SG&A expense totaled $391 million. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $5 million of the $9 million year-over-year decrease. Despite our relative flat sales results during the quarter, we continue to generate good SG&A leverage, as SG&A as a percentage of sales declined 20 basis points to 8.7% of net sales.
Restructuring expenses totaled $16 million during the quarter and were largely related to cost reduction actions in the North America. Given our year-to-date restructuring spend and our fourth quarter outlook, we now expect to record restructuring expenses in the $75 million to $100 million range during 2010. Finally, our operating margin expanded approximately one point from the prior year to 5.2%.
Turning to slide 21, I wanted to briefly discuss internet and sundry expense, the $93 million of Embraco settlement expenses, were recorded in this line during the third quarter. In the prior year, we recorded $43 million expense related to the settlement agreement with a Brazilian competition commission.
Turning to our tax rate, we recorded an income tax credit of $7 million during the quarter corresponding to an effective tax benefit of approximately 9%. For the full year, we continue to expect to record an effective tax benefit of approximately 5%. Finally, on an adjusted basis, we reported diluted EPS of $2.22 per share compared with $1.67 per share in the prior year.
Moving to our free cash flow results on slide 22, through the first nine months; we generated free cash flow use of $1 million compared with a $373 million free cash generation in the prior year. The main variance from the prior year’s record nine month results relates to higher working capital levels from the prior year end. The current year free cash flow results include a tax refund of approximately $105 million.
The most significant driver of our increased working capital balances relates to inventory. A higher inventory cash usage is due to a multitude of factors including product transition inventory, related to some of our high volume, new product launches, a general rebuild from the low level of inventory at year end and some excess stock at the end of Q3, due primarily to slowing industry demand levels in North America.
We have specific plans in place to reduce these balances during the fourth quarter, in addition to our typical seasonal drawdown. On a year-to-date basis, our capital spending has increased $39 million, largely as a result of new product launch spending in the North America region. We continue to expect full year capital spending will be between $575 million and $625 million.
Turning to slide 23, I would like to highlight our progress in debt reduction. On a year-to-date basis, we have repaid $380 million of borrowings. While our net debt levels increased slightly since December 31st, we expect to bring our net debt balance below the prior year end levels based on our full year free cash flow outlook.
On slide 24 we summarized our net liquidity position. As you can see from this table, our net liquidity position was over $2.7 billion as of September 30th. Based on the amended credit agreement that we entered into last year, our revolving credit facility is scheduled to downsize by $522 million in December. Even with the facility step down, our cash balances and remaining $1.35 billion credit line availability provide us with significant liquidity.
On slide 25 you can see a summary of our full year outlook. We are now expecting to report GAAP earnings per share in the range of $7.80 and $8.30 per share. On an adjusted basis our outlook is for diluted earnings per share in the range of $9.56 to $10.06 per share. As you might expect given the macroeconomic volatility we have been managing, there are several moving parts to our outlook.
The major unfavorable driver from our previous outlook is lower full year price mix. We now expect to see lower price mix for the full year given some of the recent trends, we experienced in the third quarter. We expect to offset lower price mix through continued productivity and cost reduction gains, slightly lower material cost and higher BEFIEX monetization.
Turning to our cash flow outlook, we continue to project free cash flow in the range of $550 million to $650 million. As noted earlier, we are executing several actions to reduce our overall inventory levels in a somewhat volatile demand environment. The level of volatility may impact our success in reducing overall inventory levels and therefore, influence whether we hit the high or low end of our cash guidance.
At this point, I’ll turn the call back over to Jeff.

Our successful cost reduction and productivity initiatives have enabled us to significantly expand our margins during 2010, despite some unfavorable trends in the macroeconomic environment and somewhat slow growth in demand in the developed markets in North America and Europe.
From a global unit demand standpoint, our expectation for moderating unit demand is largely unfolded as we’ve expected, although I’d say North America demand is a bit softer and Europe is a bit better than we previously expected. In some of our other markets and key emerging markets such as Brazil and India, we continue to see very strong growth and are creating significant value for our Company there. We remain bullish on the long-term prospects for these economies and believe that we are very well-positioned to capitalize on the economic growth potential in these markets going forward.
For the full year our key priorities are unchanged. Our entire organization is very focused and aligned to execute against these priorities as we believe there the keys to successfully navigating through a somewhat volatile global economic environment. In total as we said through our guidance in July and I’ll say in reaffirming it today, we expect to deliver a record year of operating results and value creation to our shareholders this year.
At this point in time, I will end and I’ll open this up for questions from our callers.

Let me talk about the price margin impact in the third quarter. First of all, as we expected and we to some extend talked in Q2 already about it, we did see some degradation of industry price mix during the quarter and we felt the impact as well. In particular with the some pretty aggressive competitive moves in two critical product categories already during Q2 and given our leadership positions, in these categories we decided to meet these new competitive price points.
As a result of that, we saw some immediate market share gains amidst the same category. Obviously, our job is to balance that price mix as we did in the past going forward. What gives us confidence is some of the products which we highlight in the presentation, we just launched towards the end of the third quarter and that should give us momentum. At the same time, we do expect from the promotion environment that’s around us to sustain and we’ll continue to match the cost side very aggressively to mitigate that.

The first is there is a normal seasonality of business that happened kind of from the second quarter when you go on to the third quarter. We didn’t see it last year because of the IPI tax holiday. That had an impact.
The second is we did experience higher material and oil-related cost in the third quarter of this year than we did in the second quarter. The third reason was that, we ended the second quarter with higher inventories, because if you remember, we saw a slight reduction in demand. We took actions to reduce production in the third quarter and that had an impact overall on the margins. I can tell you that I feel very confident that we will see margin expansion in Latin America in the fourth quarter.

If you look at year-over-year Sam, we’re up roughly 12 days in inventories. Now, the first thing that sort of first perspective is that we came into this year with inventories much lower than where we normally are in December, if you remember.
In December 2008 we were at $2.2 billion. If you look at sort of our normal traditional exit rate in December, we’re more like $2.5 billion, and we saw some impacts of that, Marc talked about that. He talked about Latin America in terms of availability because of low inventory levels we had coming out of the year.
First of all, 62 days a year ago, roughly $200 million Sam or five days of the increase from where it were at the end of the year ago is basically just what we call the normal build to get our inventories back to where we wanted inventories to be, so that takes you to 67 days. We got about a day for seasonality coming out of Asia, Deepavali this year is in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter and we got about a day here in North America, with respect to some other build for the fourth quarter.
There is two days there that we call seasonal build that gets you to 69 Sam. We have about four days of excess inventory that I referenced in my script that we’re going to work to get out by the end of the year and as I said in my script Sam, that’s mostly all in North America and then we’ve got one incremental day which is transitioned inventory in North America as we transition our products. Sam, that one day will still be there at the end of the year from a sequential perspective. The sequential piece is really taking out this excess inventory and the action that Marc Bitzer and his team have already taken in North America.

One is, yes, there is quite a bit of Q4 pre-build around some trade commitments and the other piece is we saw the market slowdown in particular during the second part of the third quarter. Obviously, it takes a little while to take that out of inventory.
We have taken measures towards the end of September, in particular, on October and November to run down production to what we would consider appropriate levels of inventory, which given the somewhat choppy demand environment, will be slightly high because we got to be able to respond to the changing demand trends. What I would like to point out is also the energy tax credits and the inventory are two independent issues. Actually, if you would just peel back the onion on our energy tax credit units, actually we run lower inventories than the rest of the average, quite a bit lower, in particular in some of the new products, which cause (inaudible) a bit when we run very low inventories. These two things are fairly unrelated to each other.

Again depend upon where discount rates go, David, particularly in this environment, I just can’t speculate on what that’s going to be next year. Probably the one point I can make to you though with respect to cash and funding of pensions as you know, we have roughly $1.3 billion unfunded status in our defined benefit plans. Of course, they’re frozen now, but we see the minimum funding requirements given current pension rules to be roughly $200 million in 2011 and that’s an important point from a cash perspective.

Welcome to the Whirlpool third quarter conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Roy Templin, our Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin, let me remind you that, as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corp.'s future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q.
Turning to Slide 2, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations, as they exclude items that may not be indicative of our core operating results.
We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for understanding trends in our underlying business. Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation on Slide 28 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investor section of our website, at whirlpoolcorp.com.

As you saw earlier this morning, we released our third quarter financial results and you can find these results summarized on Slide 4. During the quarter, as we expected, we faced a challenging environment in some markets, which resulted in a slow in sales growth compared to the first half of the year. We were able to quickly adapt to these economic changes due to our ongoing focus on our cost reductions, productivity and our innovative new product launches. Revenues for the quarter came in at $4.5 billion, and that's flat versus last year. On an adjusted basis, our EPS was $2.22 per share compared to $1.67 in the prior year. Our productivity results were positive during the quarter, enabled us to meet the challenges related to volume in some markets, price/mix and higher material costs. On a year-to-date aces, free cash flow was flat, which was an improvement from first half usage of $80 million. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to provide you with an update on the full year on our regional demand outlook. In the U.S., we now expect our full year demand in shipments to be up approximately 3% versus the 5% that we discussed earlier this year. And we did see some softness in demand during the third quarter. In spite of this weakening demand environment, overall, we performed very well from our branded share perspective.
In Europe, we continued to see industry growth improved during the quarter. We've increased our full year outlook to a demand growth of 1% to 3%, as we've now seen demand growth for 3 consecutive quarters across the region.
In Latin America, we saw appliance demand rebound after some moderation in demand late in the second quarter. As you may recall, we had some significant events in Brazil during the second quarter related to the expiration of the IPI tax holiday and the effects of the World Cup. We see the underlying economic fundamentals there remain very strong and we continue to see full year growth in demand in the range of 10%.
Finally, we saw healthy growth again in Asia. Our business is there, continuing to grow at a strong double-digit rate during the quarter. We've increased our full year industry outlook for Asia to 8% to 10% for the full year.
I'll now turn to Slide 6, we you can see the key drivers which are impacting our business for the year. We expect our cost reduction and productivity initiatives will continue to be the main driver behind our overall improvement as they have throughout the year. We managed our cost reduction efforts effectively and we expect to continue to benefit from these actions in the balance of this year.
As you know, we've seen foreign currency exchange become very volatile during the quarter but we've been able to continue to mitigate these risks and expect foreign currency impacts will be manageable at today's current levels. 
And finally, as we expected, we continue to see unfavorability in the material cost in the third quarter. For the full year, we now see material costs trending towards the lower end of the $200 million to $300 million estimate that we gave you throughout the year.
Finally, given the trends that we saw in the third quarter, we now expect price/mix to have an unfavorable impact on our full year results. And while we've had a very positive consumer receptions to our new product innovation launched in the third quarter, the overall price/mix environment was more challenging than our previous expectations particularly North America.
So looking at all these factors in total, we've been able to offset the negatives that we saw in the external environment with the internal actions that we're driving so we continue to expect to generate our adjusted earnings per share for the year in the range of $9.56 to $10.06 per share and our free cash flow guidance remains unchanged for the year which is $550 million to $650 million.
At this point in time, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer for his review of the North America operations."

Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance in the third quarter. As shown on Slide 8, we saw strong branded share growth during the quarter, driven by a consumer element innovation and an improvement in some of the product availability issues we experienced during the second quarter. Our key new product launches are well received by consumers. And at the same time, industry volumes and pricing environment were more challenging than expected and we took actions to met some aggressive competitive pricing pressure. 
On Slide 9, we detailed North America's performance in the third quarter. Net sales decreased 3% to $2.4 billion, driven by lower average sales values in the quarter. I will touch don this momentarily, obviously [indiscernible] largely related to reductions in 2 major product categories. Our North America unit shipments increased approximately 1%, while U.S. industry unit shipments of major key several appliances decreased 3% during the third quarter and we had, as mentioned before, a strong increase in branded share during the quarter. Our operating margin was 4.7% compared to 5.9% in the prior year. Overall, the results were unfavorably impacted by lower price/mix and higher material cost. Favorable cost reduction and productivity initiatives partially offset the unfavorable items. 
On Slide 10, you can see some of our new products that we expect will continue to support our branded share growth. The Maytag brand Ice2O easy access refrigerator, which is the industry's most efficient 4-door refrigerator. It features an external counter-height refrigerator drawer that holds up to 5 bags of groceries. We also launched from Whirlpool's brand most premium front-load [indiscernible] laundry. This is the industry's most resource-efficient washer and dryer. Finally, the KitchenAid brand dishwasher, featuring a modern vision of the reset handle found on models from past decades. I would like to point out that all these new launches happen towards the end of the third quarter.
On Slide 11, the target is the Average Sales Value industry trends by category. First thing you will note is that there was a biased distribution on a year-over-year basis as some categories up and others, down. You will also note that the overall reduction is mainly attributable to 2 categories. will [indiscernible] some of our price points in these categories given the competitive environment and we saw subsequently a strong increase in our branded share performance.
It is also important to note that our new product innovation starts to provide an overall ASV lift and we continue to focus on successfully launching our new products and continuing to generate a more new product in the future.
Overall, I would sum the third quarter challenging from a demand and pricing environment. We continue to address this [indiscernible] consumer-relevant new product to market and keeping a strong focus and cost control in productivity. 
Now, I'd like to turn over to Mike for his review of international operations."
314515,114465718,144873,"Whirlpool Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Let me start with an overview of our international business. Our international operating result continues to benefit from our ongoing cost reduction and productivity efforts and solid volume growth from our emerging markets. During the third",610,"Thanks, Marc. Let me start with an overview of our international business. Our international operating result continues to benefit from our ongoing cost reduction and productivity efforts and solid volume growth from our emerging markets. During the third quarter, we experienced improved market conditions in Brazil, slight improvement in Europe while Asia unit volumes remain very strong. 
Turning to Slide 13, our European sales declined 8% year-over-year to $827 million in the quarter, with unit shipments increasing 6%. Excluding the effects of currency, sales were essentially flat compared to the prior year. The reason reported on operating profit of $26 million during the third quarter compared to an operating profit of $14 million in the previous year. The profitability improvement was driven by continued cost reductions and productivity improvements, which were partially offset by higher material costs and lower price/mix.
Slide 14 shows a summary of our Latin American third quarter results. The region reported sales of $1.1 billion, a 13% increase from the prior year period as appliance unit shipments increased 9%. Excluding the impact from currency, sales increased approximately 9%. Operating profit reached $143 million compared to $93 million reported in the prior year. The profitability improvement is primarily related to the increase in volume, cost reduction and productivity initiatives and increased monetization of certain tax credits. These favorable items were partially offset by higher material costs and lower price/mix.
Our third quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 15. Net sales increased 21% during the quarter to $195 million, up from $162 million in the prior year period as unit shipments increased 18%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 16%. On an adjusted basis, operating profit reached $5 million for the quarter versus the $5 million generated in the prior year period. Favorable volume growth and productivity was offset by higher material and oil-related costs.
Turning to Slide 16, you'll see just a few of our international product launches during the quarter, including the Bauknecht brand, Cosmos' built-in coffee machine in Europe. The machine makes coffee and froths milk at a press of a button and can make espresso, café latte or cappuccino. The Brastemp [indiscernible] washing machine in Latin America. It features an additional wash basket for delicate clothes and a special option on the machine that can reduce soap stains by premixing soap and water before comes into contact with fabrics. And the new Whirlpool brand ACE semiautomatic washing machine in India, which offers a built-in work surface and a handle and wheels for portability.
Turning to Slide 17, I would like to summarize our international outlook for the remainder of 2010. We see demand levels improve slightly in Europe and expect to continue to see margin expansion as a result of our ongoing productivity efforts. As we've discussed on the previous quote, in Latin America, the slight negative growth rate in the second quarter recovered nicely in the third quarter despite difficult comparisons and we expect continued growth in the region for the remainder of the year. And in Asia, we expect to continue to see positive give growth through year end.
In all the international regions, we will continue to focus on productivity to offset continued cost increases. In addition, the international organization is focused on continuing to bring consumer-relevant innovation that will improve our price mix. Our innovative new products continue to improve our price/mix in the third quarter despite the overall degradation we experienced. Going forward, we are focused on bringing more of these products to the market at a faster pace. 
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Roy Templin for his financial review."
314515,114465718,144873,"Whirlpool Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Begin on Slide 19, I would like to summarize our third quarter results. For the quarter, our sales grew 1.5 of a percentage point to $4.5 billion. Appliance unit volumes increased 5% from the prior year. While all",1030,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Begin on Slide 19, I would like to summarize our third quarter results. For the quarter, our sales grew 1.5 of a percentage point to $4.5 billion. Appliance unit volumes increased 5% from the prior year. While all of our regions reported unit volume increases during the quarter, the overall increase was largely driven by higher unit volumes in Our International operations.
We continue to see a significant benefit from our productivity and cost-reduction initiatives during the quarter. In addition, to this, we monetized $56 million of our BEFIEX credits compared to $8 million in the prior year. If you recall, in the prior year, we saw a significant reduction in our BEFIEX monetization due to the IPI tax reduction legislated by the Brazilian government, which expired on February 1.
Finally, these favorable effects were partially offset by lower price/mix and higher material costs. before we take a look at the income statement in detail, there's one item I would like to highlight. During the quarter, we recorded a $93 million accrual related to Embraco settlement agreements. This resulted in an unfavorable impact of $1.20 per diluted share on our third quarter results.
Turning to the income statement on Slide 20, we reported net sales of just over $4.5 billion. Our gross margin rose 50 basis points to 14.3%, the most significant favorable impact on our gross margin improvement related to our cost takeout and productivity actions and the higher BEFIEX credits, which were partially offset by lower price/mix and higher material costs. SG&A expense totaled $391 million, foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $5 million of the $9 million year-over-year decrease. Despite our relatively flat sales results during the quarter, we continue to generate good SG&A leverage as SG&A as a percentage of sales declined 20 basis points to 8.7% of net sales.
Restructuring expenses totaled $16 million during the quarter and were largely related to cost-reduction actions in North America. Given our year-to-date restructuring spend and our fourth quarter outlook, we now expect to record restructuring expenses in the $75 million to $100 million range during 2010. Finally, our operating margin expanded approximately 1 point from the prior year to 5.2%.
Turning to Slide 21, I wanted to briefly discuss interest and sundry expense. The $93 million of Embraco settlement expenses were recorded in this line during the third quarter. In the prior year, we recorded a $43 million expense related to the settlement agreement with the Brazilian Competition Commisison.
Turning to our tax rate, we recorded an income tax credit of $7 million during the quarter, corresponding to an effective tax benefit of approximately 9%. For the full year, we continue to expect to record an effective tax benefit of approximately 5%. Finally, on an adjusted basis, we reported diluted EPS of $2.25 per share compared with $1.67 per share in the prior year.
Moving to our free cash flow results on Slide 22. Through the first 9 months, we generated free cash use of $1 million compared with a $373 million free cash generation in the prior year. The main variance from the prior year's record 9-month results relates to a higher working capital levels from the prior year end. The current year free cash flow results include a tax refund of approximately $105 million. 
The most significant driver of our increased working capital balances relates to inventory. The higher inventory cash usage is due to a multitude of factors including product transition inventory related to some of our high volume new product launches, a general rebuild from the low level of inventory at year end and some excess stock at the end of Q3 due primarily to slowing industry demand levels in North America.
We have specific plans in place to reduce these balances during the fourth quarter in addition to our typical seasonal drawdown. On a year-to-date basis, our capital spending has increased $39 million, largely as a result of new product launch spending in the North America region. We continue to expect full year capital spending will be between $575 million and $625 million.
Turning to Slide 23, I would like to highlight our progress in debt reduction. On a year-to-date basis, we have repaid $380 million of borrowings. One our net debt levels increased slightly since the December 31, we expect to bring our net-debt balance below the prior year end levels based on our full year free cash flow outlook.  
On slide 24, we summarize our net liquidity position. As you can see from this table, our net liquidity position was over $2.7 billion as of September 30. Based on the amended credit agreement that we entered into last year, our revolving credit facility is scheduled to downsize by $522 million in December. Even with the facility step down, our cash balances and remaining $1.35 million credit line availability provide us with significant liquidity.
On Slide 25, you can see a summary of our full year outlook. We are not expecting to report GAAP earnings per share in the range of $7.80 and $8.30 per share. On an adjusted basis, our outlook is for diluted earnings per share in the range of $9.56 to $10.06 per share. As you might expect, given the macroeconomic volatility we have been managing, there are several moving parts to our outlook. The major unfavorable driver from our previous outlook is lower full year price/mix. We now expect to see lower price/mix for the full year given some of the recent trends we experienced in the third quarter. We expect to offset lower price/mix through continued productivity and cost reduction gains, slightly lower material costs and higher BEFIEX monetization.
Turning to our cash flow outlook, we continue to protect free cash flow in the range of $550 million to $650 million. As noted earlier, we are executing several actions to reduce our overall inventory levels in a somewhat volatile demand environment. The level of volatility may impact our success in reducing overall inventory levels and therefore influence whether we hit the high or low end of our cash guidance.
At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

Let me summarize overall I feel that we've made strong progress this year executing against our key operational priorities. Our successful cost reduction and productivity initiatives have enabled us to significantly expand our margins during 2010, despite some unfavorable trends in the macroeconomic environment and somewhat slow growth in demand in the developed markets in North America and Europe. 
From a global unit demand standpoint, our expectation for moderating unit demand is largely unfolded as we've expected, although I'd say North America demand is a bit softer and Europe is a bit better than we previously expected.
In some of our other markets in key emerging markets such as Brazil and India, we continue to see very strong growth and are creating significant value for our company there. We remain bullish on the long-term prospects for these economies and believe that we're very well-positioned to capitalize on the economic growth potential in these markets going forward. So for the full year, our key priorities are unchanged. Our entire organization is very focused and aligned to execute against these as priorities as we believe they're the keys to successfully navigating through a somewhat volatile global economic environment.
And In total, as we said through our guidance in July and I'll say and reaffirming that today, we expect to deliver a record year of operating results and [indiscernible] operate to our shareholders this year.

Let me talk about the price margin impact in the third quarter. The first one, as we expected and to some extent talking to you already about it, and we did see some degradation of industry price mix during the quarter and we felt the impact as well. In particular, we observed some pretty aggressive competitive moves in 2 critical product categories already during Q2. And given our leadership position in these categories, we decided to meet these new competitive price points. As a result of that, we saw some immediate market share gains in these distinct categories. Obviously, our job is to balance that price/mix as we did in the past going forward. What gives us confidence is some of the products which we highlight in the presentation, we just launched towards the end of the third quarter, that should give us momentum.

Let me start and give you a little bit of perspective in terms of the inventory build and I'll talk specifically about what we're going to do and actually Marc may jump in here as well. If you look at year-over-year Sam, we're up roughly 12 days in inventories. Now, the first thing that sort of first perspective is that we came into this year with inventories much lower than where we normally are in December. If you remember, in December of 2008, we were at $2.2 billion. If you look at sort of our normal traditional exit rate in December, we're more like $2.5 billion. And we saw some impacts of that Marc talked about, talked about in Latin America in terms of availability because low inventory levels we had coming out the year. So first of all, 62 days a year ago, roughly $200 million Sam or 5 days of the increase from where we were at the end of the year ago is basically just what we call sort of a normal build to get our inventories back where we wanted inventories to be. So that takes you to 67 days. We've got about a day for seasonality coming out of Asia, the Bali this year is in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter and we've got about a day here in North America with respect to some of the build for the fourth quarter. So there's 2 days there that we would call seasonal build. That gets you to 69, Sam. Then we have about 4 days of excess inventory that I referenced in my script that we're going to work to get out by the end of the year and as I said, in my script Sam, that's mostly all in North America and then we've got one incremental day which is transition inventory in North America as we transition our products but Sam, I think that one day will still be there at the end of the year in a sequential perspective. So the sequential piece is really taking out this excess inventory in the action that Marc Bitzer and his team have already taken in North America."

North America has, right now, flattish to high inventory though, so it's about what we would consider optimal. And let's make it twofold. One is, yes, there's quite a bit of Q4 prebuild around some freight commitments and the other piece is we saw the market slowdown in particular during the second part of the third quarter and obviously it takes a little while to take that out of inventory. We have taken measures towards the end of December and particularly on October and November to run down production to what we would consider focused levels of inventory, which given the somewhat choppy demand environment, will be slightly higher because we've got to able to respond to it to the changing demand trends. What I would like to point out is also on the energy tax credits and the inventory are 2 independent issues, okay? Actually, if you would just peel back the onion on our energy tax credit units, actually, we run lower inventories than the rest of the average, quite a bit lower. In particular in some of the new products we've closed, 5 of these when we run very low inventories. So these 2 things are fairly unrelated to each other."

For the quarter, the second part, we estimate it was right about $80 million of impact Josh, and that was 1.8 points of hit on our gross margin.

But as long as we continue to offer good values in the marketplace, bring the latest innovation, continue to manage our cost structure, I feel very confident we can beat anybody in the world."

As you saw earlier this morning, we released our third quarter financial results and you can find these results summarized on Slide 4. During the quarter, as we expected, we faced a challenging environment in some markets, which resulted in a slowing in sales growth compared to the first half of the year. We were able to quickly adapt to these economic changes due to our ongoing focus on cost reductions, productivity and our innovative new product launches. Revenues for the quarter came in at $4.5 billion, and that's as flat versus last year. On an adjusted basis, our EPS was $2.22 per share compared to $1.67 in the prior year. Our productivity results were positive during the quarter, enabled us to manage challenges related to volume in some markets, price/mix and higher material costs. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was flat, which was an improvement from our first half usage of $80 million. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to provide you with an update for the full year on our regional demand outlook. In the U.S., we now expect our full year demand in shipments to be up approximately 3% versus the 5% that we've discussed earlier this year. And we did see some softness in demand during the third quarter. In spite of this weakening demand environment, overall, we performed very well from a branded share perspective.
In Europe, we continued to see industry growth improved during the quarter. We've increased our full year outlook to a demand growth of 1% to 3%, as we've now seen demand growth for 3 consecutive quarters across the region.
In Latin America, we saw appliance demand rebound after some moderation in demand late in the second quarter. As you may recall, we had some significant events in Brazil during the second quarter related to the expiration of the IPI tax holiday and the effects of the World Cup. We see the underlying economic fundamentals there remain very strong and we continue to see full year growth in demand in the range of 10%.
Finally, we saw healthy growth again in Asia. Our businesses there, continue to grow at a strong double-digit rate during the quarter. We've increased our full year industry outlook for Asia to 8% to 10% for the full year.
I'll now turn to Slide 6, we you see the key drivers which are impacting our business for the year. We expect our cost reduction and productivity initiatives will continue to be the main driver behind our overall improvement as they have throughout the year. We managed our cost reduction efforts effectively and we expect to continue to benefit from these actions for the balance of this year.
As you know, we've seen foreign currency exchange become very volatile during the quarter but we've been able to continue to mitigate these risks and expect foreign currency impacts will be manageable at today's current levels. 
And finally, as we expected, we continue to see unfavorability in the area of material cost during the third quarter. For the full year, we now see material costs trending towards the lower end of the $200 million to $300 million estimate that we gave you throughout the year.
Finally, given the trends that we saw in the third quarter, we now expect price/mix to have an unfavorable impact on our full year results. And while we've had a very positive consumer receptions to our new product innovation launched during the third quarter, the overall price/mix environment was more challenging than our previous expectations particularly North America.
So looking at all these factors in total, we've been able to offset the negatives that we saw in the external environment with the internal actions that we're driving so we continue to expect to generate our adjusted earnings per share for the year in the range of $9.56 to $10.06 per share and our free cash flow guidance remains unchanged for the year which is $550 million to $650 million.
At this point in time, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer for his review of the North America operations."

Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance in the third quarter. As shown on Slide 8, we saw strong branded share growth during the quarter, driven by a consumer element innovation and an improvement in some of the product availability issues we experienced during the second quarter. Our key new product launches are well received by consumers. And at the same time, industry volumes and the pricing environment grew more challenging than expected, and we took actions to met some aggressive competitive pricing pressure. 
On Slide 9, we detailed North America's performance in the third quarter. Net sales decreased 3% to $2.4 billion, driven by lower average sales values in the quarter. I will touch on this momentarily, but this decline is largely related to reductions in 2 major product categories. Our North America unit shipments increased approximately 1%, while U.S. industry unit shipments of major T7 appliances decreased 3% during the third quarter. And we had, as mentioned before, a strong increase in branded share during the quarter. 
Our operating margin was 4.7% compared to 5.9% in the prior year. Overall, the results were unfavorably impacted by lower price/mix and higher material cost. Favorable cost reductions and productivity initiatives partially offset the unfavorable items. 
On Slide 10, you can see some of our new products that we expect will continue to support our branded share growth. The Maytag brand Ice2O Easy Access refrigerator, which is the industry's most efficient 4-door refrigerator. It features an external counter-height refrigerator drawer that holds up to 5 bags groceries. We also launched from Whirlpool's brand most premium Front-Load Duet laundry pair. This is the industry's most resource-efficient washer and dryer. Finally, the KitchenAid brand dishwasher, featuring a modern version of the recessed handle, found on models from past decades. I would like to point out that all these new launches happen towards the end of the third quarter.
On Slide 11, the chart depicts ASV or average sales value industry trends by category. First thing you will note is that there was a generally a wide distribution on a year-over-year basis, with some categories up and others down. You will also note that the overall reduction is mainly attributable to 2 categories. We'd like to address some of our price points in these categories given the competitive environment and we saw subsequently a strong increase in our branded share performance.
It is also important to note that our new product innovation starts to provide an overall ASV lift and we continue to focus on successfully launching our new products and continuing to generate more new products in the future.
Overall, I would sum the third quarter challenging from a demand and pricing environment. We continue to address which will consumer-relevant new products to market and keeping a strong focus and cost control in productivity. 
Now, I'd like to turn over to Mike for his review of our international operations."

Let me start with an overview of our International business. Our international operating result continued to benefit from our ongoing cost reduction and productivity efforts and solid volume growth from our emerging markets. During the third",612,"Thanks, Marc. Let me start with an overview of our International business. Our international operating result continued to benefit from our ongoing cost reduction and productivity efforts and solid volume growth from our emerging markets. During the third quarter, we experienced improved market conditions in Brazil, slight improvement in Europe while Asia unit volumes remain very strong. 
Turning to Slide 13, our European sales declined 8% year-over-year to $827 million in the quarter, with unit shipments increasing 6%. Excluding the effects of currency, sales were essentially flat compared to the prior year. The reason reported on operating profit of $26 million during the third quarter compared to an operating profit of $14 million in the previous year. The profitability improvement was driven by continued cost reduction and productivity improvements, which were partially offset by higher material costs and lower price/mix.
Slide 14 shows a summary of our Latin American third quarter results. The region reported sales of $1.1 billion, a 13% increase from the prior year period as appliance unit shipments increased 9%. Excluding the impact from currency, sales increased approximately 9%. Operating profit reached $143 million compared to $93 million reported in the prior year. The profitability improvement is primarily related to the increase in volume, cost reduction and productivity initiatives and increased monetization of certain tax credits. These favorable items were partially offset by higher material costs and lower price/mix.
Our third quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 15. Net sales increased 21% during the quarter to $195 million, up from $162 million in the prior year period as unit shipments increased 18%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 16%. On an adjusted basis, operating profit reached $5 million for the quarter versus the $5 million generated in the prior year period. Favorable volume growth and productivity was offset by higher material and oil-related costs.
Turning to Slide 16, you'll see just a few of our international product launches during the quarter, including the Bauknecht brand, Kosmos built-in coffee machine in Europe. The machine makes coffee and froths milk at the press of a button and can make espresso, café latte or cappuccino. The Brastemp Ative! washing machine in Latin America. It features an additional wash basket for delicate clothes and a special option on the machine that can reduce soap stains by premixing soap and water before it comes into contact with fabrics. And the new Whirlpool brand ACE semiautomatic washing machine in India, which offers a built-in work surface and a handle and wheels for portability.
Turning to Slide 17, I would like to summarize our international outlook for the remainder of 2010. We see demand levels improve more than slightly in Europe and expect to continue to see margin expansion as a result of our ongoing productivity efforts. As we've discussed on the previous call, in Latin America, the slight negative growth rate in the second quarter recovered nicely in the third quarter despite more difficult comparisons and we expect continued growth in the region for the remainder of the year. And in Asia, we expect to continue to see positive growth through year end.
In all the international regions, we will continue to focus on productivity to offset continued cost increases. In addition, the international organization is focused on continuing to bring consumer-relevant innovation that will improve our price/mix. Our innovative new products continue to improve our price/mix in the third quarter despite the overall degradation we experienced. Going forward, we are focused on bringing more of these products to the market at a faster pace. 
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Roy Templin for his financial review."

Beginning on Slide 19, I would like to summarize our third quarter results. For the quarter, our sales grew [ph] 1/2 of a percentage point to $4.5 billion. Appliance unit volumes increased 5% from the prior year.",1030,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 19, I would like to summarize our third quarter results. For the quarter, our sales grew [ph] 1/2 of a percentage point to $4.5 billion. Appliance unit volumes increased 5% from the prior year. While all of our regions reported unit volume increases during the quarter, the overall increase was largely driven by higher unit volumes in our International operations.
We continue to see a significant benefit from our productivity and cost-reduction initiatives during the quarter. In addition, to this, we monetized $56 million of our BEFIEX credits compared to $8 million in the prior year. If you recall, in the prior year, we saw a significant reduction in our BEFIEX monetization due to the IPI tax reduction legislated by the Brazilian government, which expired on February 1.
Finally, these favorable effects were partially offset by lower price/mix and higher material costs. Before we take a look at the income statement in detail, there is one item I would like to highlight. During the quarter, we recorded a $93 million accrual related to Embraco settlement agreements. This resulted in an unfavorable impact of $1.20 per diluted share on our third quarter results.
Turning to the income statement on Slide 20, we reported net sales of just over $4.5 billion. Our gross margin rose 50 basis points to 14.3%, the most significant favorable impacts on our gross margin improvement related to our cost takeout and productivity actions and the higher BEFIEX credits, which were partially offset by lower price/mix and higher material cost. SG&A expense totaled $391 million, foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $5 million of the $9 million year-over-year decrease. Despite our relatively flat sales results during the quarter, we continued to generate good SG&A leverage as SG&A as a percentage of sales declined 20 basis points to 8.7% of net sales.
Restructuring expenses totaled $16 million during the quarter and were largely related to cost-reduction actions in North America. Given our year-to-date restructuring spend and our fourth quarter outlook, we now expect to record restructuring expenses in the $75 million to $100 million range during 2010. Finally, our operating margin expanded approximately 1 point from the prior year to 5.2%.
Turning to Slide 21, I wanted to briefly discuss interest and sundry expense. The $93 million of Embraco settlement expenses were recorded in this line during the third quarter. In the prior year, we recorded a $43 million expense related to the settlement agreement with the Brazilian Competition Commisison.
Turning to our tax rate, we recorded an income tax credit of $7 million during the quarter, corresponding to an effective tax benefit of approximately 9%. For the full year, we continue to expect to record an effective tax benefit of approximately 5%. Finally, on an adjusted basis, we reported diluted EPS of $2.22 per share compared with $1.67 per share in the prior year.
Moving to our free cash flow results on Slide 22. Through the first 9 months, we generated free cash use of $1 million compared with a $373 million free cash generation in the prior year. The main variance from the prior year's record 9-month results relates to higher working capital levels from the prior year end. The current year of free cash flow results include a tax refund of approximately $105 million. 
The most significant driver of our increased working capital balances relates to inventory. The higher inventory cash usage is due to a multitude of factors including product transition inventory related to some of our high-volume new product launches, a general rebuild from the low level of inventory at year end and some excess stock at the end of Q3 due primarily to slowing industry demand levels in North America.
We have specific plans in place to reduce these balances during the fourth quarter in addition to our typical seasonal drawdown. On a year-to-date basis, our capital spending has increased $39 million, largely as a result of new product launch spending in the North America region. We continue to expect full year capital spending will be between $575 million and $625 million.
Turning to Slide 23, I would like to highlight our progress in debt reduction. On a year-to-date basis, we have repaid $380 million of borrowings. While our net-debt levels increased slightly since the December 31, we expect to bring our net-debt balance below the prior year-end levels based on our full year free cash flow outlook.  
On slide 24, we summarized our net liquidity position. As you can see from this table, our net liquidity position was over $2.7 billion as of September 30. Based on the amended credit agreement that we entered in to last year, our revolving credit facility is scheduled to downsize by $522 million in December. Even with the facility step down, our cash balances and remaining $1.35 billion credit line availability provide us with significant liquidity.
On Slide 25, you can see a summary of our full year outlook. We are now expecting to report GAAP earnings per share in the range of $7.80 and $8.30 per share. On an adjusted basis, our outlook is for diluted earnings per share in the range of $9.56 to $10.06 per share. As you might expect, given the macroeconomic volatility we have been managing, there are several moving parts to our outlook. The major unfavorable driver from our previous outlook is lower full year price/mix. We now expect to see lower price/mix for the full year given some of the recent trends we experienced in the third quarter. We expect to offset lower price/mix through continued productivity and cost reduction gains, slightly lower material costs and higher BEFIEX monetization.
Turning to our cash flow outlook, we continue to protect free cash flow in the range of $550 million to $650 million. As noted earlier, we are executing several actions to reduce our overall inventory levels in a somewhat volatile demand environment. The level of volatility may impact our success in reducing overall inventory levels and therefore influence whether we hit the high or low end of our cash guidance.
At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

Let me summarize, overall, I feel that we made strong progress this year executing against our key operational priorities. Our successful cost reduction and productivity initiatives have enabled us to significantly expand our margins during 2010, despite some unfavorable trends in the macroeconomic environment and somewhat slow growth in demand in the developed markets in North America and Europe. 
From a global unit demand standpoint, our expectation for moderating unit demand is largely unfolded as we've expected, although I'd say North America demand is a bit softer and Europe is a bit better than we previously expected.
In some of our other markets, in key emerging markets such as Brazil and India, we continue to see very strong growth and are creating significant value for our company there. We remain bullish on the long-term prospects for these economies and believe that we're very well-positioned to capitalize on the economic growth potential in these markets going forward. So for the full year, our key priorities are unchanged. Our entire organization is very focused and aligned to execute against these priorities as we believe they're the keys to successfully navigating through a somewhat volatile global economic environment.
And In total, as we said through our guidance in July and I'll say and reaffirming it today, we expect to deliver a record year of operating results and value creation to our shareholders this year. 
So at this point in time, I will end and I'll open this up for questions from our callers."

The first one, as we expected, and with some extent talking you to already about it, and we did see some degradation of the industry price/mix during the quarter, and we felt the impact as well. In particular, we observed some pretty aggressive competitive moves in 2 critical product categories already during Q2. And given our leadership position, in these categories, we decided to meet these new competitive price points. As a result of that, we saw some immediate market share gains in these distinct categories. Obviously, our job is to balance that price/mix as we did in the past going forward. What gives us confidence is some of the products which we highlight in the presentation, we just launched towards the end of the third quarter, that should give us momentum. At the same time, we do expect the promotion environment around us to sustain and we'll continue to manage the cost side very aggressively to mitigate that."

So that had an impact. The second is we did experience higher material and oil-related cost in the third quarter of this year than we did in the second quarter. And the third reason was that we ended the second quarter with higher inventories because if you remember, we saw a slight reduction in demand. And so we took actions to reduce production in the third quarter and that had an impact overall in the margins.

Let me start and give you a little bit of perspective in terms of the inventory build and I'll talk specifically about what we're going to do and, actually, Marc may jump in here as well. If you look at year-over-year, Sam, we're up roughly 12 days in inventories. Now, the first thing that sort of put perspective is that we came into this year with inventories much lower than where we normally are in December. If you remember, in December of 2008, we were at $2.2 billion. If you look at sort of our normal traditional exit rate in December, we're more like $2.5 billion. And we saw some impacts of that, Marc talked about that. He talked about in Latin America in terms of availability because of low inventory levels we had coming out a year. So first of all, 62 days a year ago, roughly $200 million, Sam, or 5 days of the increase from where we were at the end of year ago is basically just what we call sort of a normal build to get our inventories back to where we wanted inventories to be. So that takes you to 67 days. We've got about a day for seasonality coming out of Asia to Bali this year is in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, and we've got about a day here in North America with respect to some of the build for the fourth quarter. So there's 2 days there that we would call seasonal build. That gets you to 69, Sam. Then we have about 4 days of excess inventory that I referenced in my script that we're going to work to get out by the end of the year and as I said, in my script Sam, that's mostly all in North America and then we've got one incremental day which is transition inventory in North America as we transition our products but Sam, I think that one day will still be there at the end of the year on a sequential perspective. So the sequential piece is really taking out this excess inventory in the action that Marc Bitzer and his team have already taken in North America."

One is, yes, there's quite a bit of Q4 prebuild around some freight commitments and the other piece is we saw the market slowdown in particular during the second part of the third quarter and obviously, it takes a little while to take that out of inventory. We have taken measures towards the end of December and particularly on October and November to run down production to what we would consider appropriate levels of inventory, which given the somewhat choppy demand environment will be slightly higher because we've got to able to respond to it to the changing demand trends. What I would like to point out is also on the energy tax credits and the inventory are 2 independent issues, okay? Actually, if you would just peel back the onion on our energy tax credit units, actually, we run lower inventories than the rest of the average, quite a bit lower. In particular in some of the new products we've closed, 5 of it when we run very low inventories. So these 2 things are fairly unrelated to each other."

So while we've said, and what we said in the second quarter call, and Josh, it still holds true today is, we only incurred about 15% of what we were projecting for material cost increases in the first half of the year and we have about 85% or for us, roughly $190 million of impact that will impact us in the second part of the year. For the quarter, the second part, we estimate it was right about $80 million of impact, Josh, and that was 1.8 points of hit on our gross margin. So you heard Mike and Marc and Jeff all comment on that in their scripts but it all came back to just under 2 points of negative impact on gross margins. But we're still in that.

It's an important question because we've had the energy tax credits, which have basically taken us to a negative rate. I think I said in the last call, and it's still true, that when you take the energy tax credits out and you're correct, they are currently set to expire at the end of this year. I don't know whether there'll be any action with respect to future energy tax credits or not. But you're right, they're set to expire. Once they expire, if you look at 2011 and you take that out of the picture, you go back to that rate that I've been referencing for some time, which is that high-20s percent tax rate for the global business. That rate does include the benefits of BEFIEX. I know there have been some questions whether BEFIEX was in or out of that number.

We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for understanding trends in our underlying business.

As you saw earlier this morning, we released our third quarter financial results and you can find these results summarized on Slide 4. During the quarter, as we expected, we faced a challenging environment in some markets, which resulted in a slowing in sales growth compared to the first half of the year. We were able to quickly adapt to these economic changes due to our ongoing focus on cost reductions, productivity and our innovative new product launches. Revenues for the quarter came in at $4.5 billion, and that's as flat versus last year. On an adjusted basis, our EPS was $2.22 per share compared to $1.67 in the prior year. Our productivity results were positive during the quarter, enabled us to manage challenges related to volume in some markets, price/mix and higher material costs. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was flat, which was an improvement from our first half usage of $80 million. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to provide you with an update for the full year on our regional demand outlook. In the U.S., we now expect our full year demand in shipments to be up approximately 3% versus the 5% that we've discussed earlier this year. And we did see some softness in demand during the third quarter. In spite of this weakening demand environment, overall, we performed very well from a branded share perspective.
In Europe, we continued to see industry growth improved during the quarter. We've increased our full year outlook to a demand growth of 1% to 3%, as we've now seen demand growth for 3 consecutive quarters across the region.
In Latin America, we saw appliance demand rebound after some moderation in demand late in the second quarter. As you may recall, we had some significant events in Brazil during the second quarter related to the expiration of the IPI tax holiday and the effects of the World Cup. We see the underlying economic fundamentals there remain very strong and we continue to see full year growth in demand in the range of 10%.
Finally, we saw healthy growth again in Asia. Our businesses there, continue to grow at a strong double-digit rate during the quarter. We've increased our full year industry outlook for Asia to 8% to 10% for the full year.
I'll now turn to Slide 6, we you see the key drivers which are impacting our business for the year. We expect our cost reduction and productivity initiatives will continue to be the main driver behind our overall improvement as they have throughout the year. We managed our cost reduction efforts effectively and we expect to continue to benefit from these actions for the balance of this year.
As you know, we've seen foreign currency exchange become very volatile during the quarter but we've been able to continue to mitigate these risks and expect foreign currency impacts will be manageable at today's current levels. 
And finally, as we expected, we continue to see unfavorability in the area of material cost during the third quarter. For the full year, we now see material costs trending towards the lower end of the $200 million to $300 million estimate that we gave you throughout the year.
Finally, given the trends that we saw in the third quarter, we now expect price/mix to have an unfavorable impact on our full year results. And while we've had a very positive consumer receptions to our new product innovation launched during the third quarter, the overall price/mix environment was more challenging than our previous expectations particularly North America.
So looking at all these factors in total, we've been able to offset the negatives that we saw in the external environment with the internal actions that we're driving so we continue to expect to generate our adjusted earnings per share for the year in the range of $9.56 to $10.06 per share and our free cash flow guidance remains unchanged for the year which is $550 million to $650 million.
At this point in time, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer for his review of the North America operations."
314515,114465718,145119,"Whirlpool Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.

Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance in the third quarter. As shown on Slide 8, we saw strong branded share growth during the quarter, driven by a consumer element innovation and an improvement in some of the product availability issues we experienced during the second quarter. Our key new product launches are well received by consumers. And at the same time, industry volumes and the pricing environment grew more challenging than expected, and we took actions to met some aggressive competitive pricing pressure. 
On Slide 9, we detailed North America's performance in the third quarter. Net sales decreased 3% to $2.4 billion, driven by lower average sales values in the quarter. I will touch on this momentarily, but this decline is largely related to reductions in 2 major product categories. Our North America unit shipments increased approximately 1%, while U.S. industry unit shipments of major T7 appliances decreased 3% during the third quarter. And we had, as mentioned before, a strong increase in branded share during the quarter. 
Our operating margin was 4.7% compared to 5.9% in the prior year. Overall, the results were unfavorably impacted by lower price/mix and higher material cost. Favorable cost reductions and productivity initiatives partially offset the unfavorable items. 
On Slide 10, you can see some of our new products that we expect will continue to support our branded share growth. The Maytag brand Ice2O Easy Access refrigerator, which is the industry's most efficient 4-door refrigerator. It features an external counter-height refrigerator drawer that holds up to 5 bags groceries. We also launched from Whirlpool's brand most premium Front-Load Duet laundry pair. This is the industry's most resource-efficient washer and dryer. Finally, the KitchenAid brand dishwasher, featuring a modern version of the recessed handle, found on models from past decades. I would like to point out that all these new launches happen towards the end of the third quarter.
On Slide 11, the chart depicts ASV or average sales value industry trends by category. First thing you will note is that there was a generally a wide distribution on a year-over-year basis, with some categories up and others down. You will also note that the overall reduction is mainly attributable to 2 categories. We'd like to address some of our price points in these categories given the competitive environment and we saw subsequently a strong increase in our branded share performance.
It is also important to note that our new product innovation starts to provide an overall ASV lift and we continue to focus on successfully launching our new products and continuing to generate more new products in the future.
Overall, I would sum the third quarter challenging from a demand and pricing environment. We continue to address which will consumer-relevant new products to market and keeping a strong focus and cost control in productivity. 
Now, I'd like to turn over to Mike for his review of our international operations."
314515,114465718,145119,"Whirlpool Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Let me start with an overview of our International business. Our international operating result continued to benefit from our ongoing cost reduction and productivity efforts and solid volume growth from our emerging markets. During the third",612,"Thanks, Marc. Let me start with an overview of our International business. Our international operating result continued to benefit from our ongoing cost reduction and productivity efforts and solid volume growth from our emerging markets. During the third quarter, we experienced improved market conditions in Brazil, slight improvement in Europe while Asia unit volumes remain very strong. 
Turning to Slide 13, our European sales declined 8% year-over-year to $827 million in the quarter, with unit shipments increasing 6%. Excluding the effects of currency, sales were essentially flat compared to the prior year. The reason reported on operating profit of $26 million during the third quarter compared to an operating profit of $14 million in the previous year. The profitability improvement was driven by continued cost reduction and productivity improvements, which were partially offset by higher material costs and lower price/mix.
Slide 14 shows a summary of our Latin American third quarter results. The region reported sales of $1.1 billion, a 13% increase from the prior year period as appliance unit shipments increased 9%. Excluding the impact from currency, sales increased approximately 9%. Operating profit reached $143 million compared to $93 million reported in the prior year. The profitability improvement is primarily related to the increase in volume, cost reduction and productivity initiatives and increased monetization of certain tax credits. These favorable items were partially offset by higher material costs and lower price/mix.
Our third quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 15. Net sales increased 21% during the quarter to $195 million, up from $162 million in the prior year period as unit shipments increased 18%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 16%. On an adjusted basis, operating profit reached $5 million for the quarter versus the $5 million generated in the prior year period. Favorable volume growth and productivity was offset by higher material and oil-related costs.
Turning to Slide 16, you'll see just a few of our international product launches during the quarter, including the Bauknecht brand, Kosmos built-in coffee machine in Europe. The machine makes coffee and froths milk at the press of a button and can make espresso, café latte or cappuccino. The Brastemp Ative! washing machine in Latin America. It features an additional wash basket for delicate clothes and a special option on the machine that can reduce soap stains by premixing soap and water before it comes into contact with fabrics. And the new Whirlpool brand ACE semiautomatic washing machine in India, which offers a built-in work surface and a handle and wheels for portability.
Turning to Slide 17, I would like to summarize our international outlook for the remainder of 2010. We see demand levels improve more than slightly in Europe and expect to continue to see margin expansion as a result of our ongoing productivity efforts. As we've discussed on the previous call, in Latin America, the slight negative growth rate in the second quarter recovered nicely in the third quarter despite more difficult comparisons and we expect continued growth in the region for the remainder of the year. And in Asia, we expect to continue to see positive growth through year end.
In all the international regions, we will continue to focus on productivity to offset continued cost increases. In addition, the international organization is focused on continuing to bring consumer-relevant innovation that will improve our price/mix. Our innovative new products continue to improve our price/mix in the third quarter despite the overall degradation we experienced. Going forward, we are focused on bringing more of these products to the market at a faster pace. 
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Roy Templin for his financial review."

Beginning on Slide 19, I would like to summarize our third quarter results. For the quarter, our sales grew 1/2 of a percentage point to $4.5 billion. Appliance unit volumes increased 5% from the prior year. While",1029,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 19, I would like to summarize our third quarter results. For the quarter, our sales grew 1/2 of a percentage point to $4.5 billion. Appliance unit volumes increased 5% from the prior year. While all of our regions reported unit volume increases during the quarter, the overall increase was largely driven by higher unit volumes in our International operations.
We continue to see a significant benefit from our productivity and cost-reduction initiatives during the quarter. In addition, to this, we monetized $56 million of our BEFIEX credits compared to $8 million in the prior year. If you recall, in the prior year, we saw a significant reduction in our BEFIEX monetization due to the IPI tax reduction legislated by the Brazilian government, which expired on February 1.
Finally, these favorable effects were partially offset by lower price/mix and higher material costs. Before we take a look at the income statement in detail, there is one item I would like to highlight. During the quarter, we recorded a $93 million accrual related to Embraco settlement agreements. This resulted in an unfavorable impact of $1.20 per diluted share on our third quarter results.
Turning to the income statement on Slide 20, we reported net sales of just over $4.5 billion. Our gross margin rose 50 basis points to 14.3%, the most significant favorable impacts on our gross margin improvement related to our cost takeout and productivity actions and the higher BEFIEX credits, which were partially offset by lower price/mix and higher material cost. SG&A expense totaled $391 million, foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $5 million of the $9 million year-over-year decrease. Despite our relatively flat sales results during the quarter, we continued to generate good SG&A leverage as SG&A as a percentage of sales declined 20 basis points to 8.7% of net sales.
Restructuring expenses totaled $16 million during the quarter and were largely related to cost-reduction actions in North America. Given our year-to-date restructuring spend and our fourth quarter outlook, we now expect to record restructuring expenses in the $75 million to $100 million range during 2010. Finally, our operating margin expanded approximately 1 point from the prior year to 5.2%.
Turning to Slide 21, I wanted to briefly discuss interest and sundry expense. The $93 million of Embraco settlement expenses were recorded in this line during the third quarter. In the prior year, we recorded a $43 million expense related to the settlement agreement with the Brazilian Competition Commisison.
Turning to our tax rate, we recorded an income tax credit of $7 million during the quarter, corresponding to an effective tax benefit of approximately 9%. For the full year, we continue to expect to record an effective tax benefit of approximately 5%. Finally, on an adjusted basis, we reported diluted EPS of $2.22 per share compared with $1.67 per share in the prior year.
Moving to our free cash flow results on Slide 22. Through the first 9 months, we generated free cash use of $1 million compared with a $373 million free cash generation in the prior year. The main variance from the prior year's record 9-month results relates to higher working capital levels from the prior year end. The current year of free cash flow results include a tax refund of approximately $105 million. 
The most significant driver of our increased working capital balances relates to inventory. The higher inventory cash usage is due to a multitude of factors including product transition inventory related to some of our high-volume new product launches, a general rebuild from the low level of inventory at year end and some excess stock at the end of Q3 due primarily to slowing industry demand levels in North America.
We have specific plans in place to reduce these balances during the fourth quarter in addition to our typical seasonal drawdown. On a year-to-date basis, our capital spending has increased $39 million, largely as a result of new product launch spending in the North America region. We continue to expect full year capital spending will be between $575 million and $625 million.
Turning to Slide 23, I would like to highlight our progress in debt reduction. On a year-to-date basis, we have repaid $380 million of borrowings. While our net-debt levels increased slightly since the December 31, we expect to bring our net-debt balance below the prior year-end levels based on our full year free cash flow outlook.  
On slide 24, we summarized our net liquidity position. As you can see from this table, our net liquidity position was over $2.7 billion as of September 30. Based on the amended credit agreement that we entered in to last year, our revolving credit facility is scheduled to downsize by $522 million in December. Even with the facility step down, our cash balances and remaining $1.35 billion credit line availability provide us with significant liquidity.
On Slide 25, you can see a summary of our full year outlook. We are now expecting to report GAAP earnings per share in the range of $7.80 and $8.30 per share. On an adjusted basis, our outlook is for diluted earnings per share in the range of $9.56 to $10.06 per share. As you might expect, given the macroeconomic volatility we have been managing, there are several moving parts to our outlook. The major unfavorable driver from our previous outlook is lower full year price/mix. We now expect to see lower price/mix for the full year given some of the recent trends we experienced in the third quarter. We expect to offset lower price/mix through continued productivity and cost reduction gains, slightly lower material costs and higher BEFIEX monetization.
Turning to our cash flow outlook, we continue to protect free cash flow in the range of $550 million to $650 million. As noted earlier, we are executing several actions to reduce our overall inventory levels in a somewhat volatile demand environment. The level of volatility may impact our success in reducing overall inventory levels and therefore influence whether we hit the high or low end of our cash guidance.
At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

Let me summarize, overall, I feel that we made strong progress this year executing against our key operational priorities. Our successful cost reduction and productivity initiatives have enabled us to significantly expand our margins during 2010, despite some unfavorable trends in the macroeconomic environment and somewhat slow growth in demand in the developed markets in North America and Europe. 
From a global unit demand standpoint, our expectation for moderating unit demand is largely unfolded as we've expected, although I'd say North America demand is a bit softer and Europe is a bit better than we previously expected.
In some of our other markets, in key emerging markets such as Brazil and India, we continue to see very strong growth and are creating significant value for our company there. We remain bullish on the long-term prospects for these economies and believe that we're very well-positioned to capitalize on the economic growth potential in these markets going forward. So for the full year, our key priorities are unchanged. Our entire organization is very focused and aligned to execute against these priorities as we believe they're the keys to successfully navigating through a somewhat volatile global economic environment.
And In total, as we said through our guidance in July and I'll say and reaffirming it today, we expect to deliver a record year of operating results and value creation to our shareholders this year. 
So at this point in time, I will end and I'll open this up for questions from our callers."

The first one, as we expected, and with some extent talking you to already about it, and we did see some degradation of the industry price/mix during the quarter, and we felt the impact as well. In particular, we observed some pretty aggressive competitive moves in 2 critical product categories already during Q2. And given our leadership position, in these categories, we decided to meet these new competitive price points. As a result of that, we saw some immediate market share gains in these distinct categories. Obviously, our job is to balance that price/mix as we did in the past going forward. What gives us confidence is some of the products which we highlight in the presentation, we just launched towards the end of the third quarter, that should give us momentum.

And the third reason was that we ended the second quarter with higher inventories because if you remember, we saw a slight reduction in demand. And so we took actions to reduce production in the third quarter and that had an impact overall in the margins.

Let me start and give you a little bit of perspective in terms of the inventory build and I'll talk specifically about what we're going to do and, actually, Marc may jump in here as well. If you look at year-over-year, Sam, we're up roughly 12 days in inventories. Now, the first thing that sort of put perspective is that we came into this year with inventories much lower than where we normally are in December. If you remember, in December of 2008, we were at $2.2 billion. If you look at sort of our normal traditional exit rate in December, we're more like $2.5 billion. And we saw some impacts of that, Marc talked about that. He talked about in Latin America in terms of availability because of low inventory levels we had coming out a year. So first of all, 62 days a year ago, roughly $200 million, Sam, or 5 days of the increase from where we were at the end of year ago is basically just what we call sort of a normal build to get our inventories back to where we wanted inventories to be. So that takes you to 67 days. We've got about a day for seasonality coming out of Asia to Bali this year is in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, and we've got about a day here in North America with respect to some of the build for the fourth quarter. So there's 2 days there that we would call seasonal build. That gets you to 69, Sam. Then we have about 4 days of excess inventory that I referenced in my script that we're going to work to get out by the end of the year and as I said, in my script Sam, that's mostly all in North America and then we've got one incremental day which is transition inventory in North America as we transition our products but Sam, I think that one day will still be there at the end of the year on a sequential perspective. So the sequential piece is really taking out this excess inventory in the action that Marc Bitzer and his team have already taken in North America."

One is, yes, there's quite a bit of Q4 prebuild around some freight commitments and the other piece is we saw the market slowdown in particular during the second part of the third quarter and obviously, it takes a little while to take that out of inventory. We have taken measures towards the end of December and particularly on October and November to run down production to what we would consider appropriate levels of inventory, which given the somewhat choppy demand environment will be slightly higher because we've got to able to respond to it to the changing demand trends. What I would like to point out is also on the energy tax credits and the inventory are 2 independent issues, okay? Actually, if you would just peel back the onion on our energy tax credit units, actually, we run lower inventories than the rest of the average, quite a bit lower. In particular in some of the new products we've closed, 5 of it when we run very low inventories. So these 2 things are fairly unrelated to each other."

But we see the minimum funding requirements given current pension rules to be roughly $200 million in 2011 and that's an important point from a cash perspective.

Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corp.'s future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q.
Turning to Slide 2, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations, as they exclude items that may not be indicative of our core operating results.
We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for understanding trends in our underlying business. Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation on Slide 28 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

As you saw earlier this morning, we released our third quarter financial results and you can find these results summarized on Slide 4. During the quarter, as we expected, we faced a challenging environment in some markets, which resulted in a slowing in sales growth compared to the first half of the year. We were able to quickly adapt to these economic changes due to our ongoing focus on cost reductions, productivity and our innovative new product launches. Revenues for the quarter came in at $4.5 billion, and that's as flat versus last year. On an adjusted basis, our EPS was $2.22 per share compared to $1.67 in the prior year. Our productivity results were positive during the quarter, enabled us to manage challenges related to volume in some markets, price/mix and higher material costs. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was flat, which was an improvement from our first half usage of $80 million. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to provide you with an update for the full year on our regional demand outlook. In the U.S., we now expect our full year demand in shipments to be up approximately 3% versus the 5% that we've discussed earlier this year. And we did see some softness in demand during the third quarter. In spite of this weakening demand environment, overall, we performed very well from a branded share perspective.
In Europe, we continued to see industry growth improvement during the quarter. We've increased our full year outlook to a demand growth of 1% to 3%, as we've now seen demand growth for 3 consecutive quarters across the region.
In Latin America, we saw appliance demand rebound after some moderation in demand late in the second quarter. As you may recall, we had some significant events in Brazil during the second quarter related to the expiration of the IPI tax holiday and the effects of the World Cup. We see the underlying economic fundamentals there remain very strong and we continue to see full year growth in demand in the range of 10%.
Finally, we saw healthy growth again in Asia. Our businesses there continue to grow at a strong double-digit rate during the quarter. We've increased our full year industry outlook for Asia to 8% to 10% for the full year.
I'll now turn to Slide 6, where you see the key drivers which are impacting our business for the year. We expect our cost reduction and productivity initiatives will continue to be the main driver behind our overall improvement as they have throughout the year. We managed our cost reduction efforts effectively and we expect to continue to benefit from these actions for the balance of this year.
As you know, we've seen foreign currency exchange become very volatile during the quarter but we've been able to continue to mitigate these risks and expect foreign currency impacts will be manageable at today's current levels. 
And finally, as we expected, we continue to see unfavorability in the area of material cost during the third quarter. For the full year, we now see material costs trending towards the lower end of the $200 million to $300 million estimate that we gave you throughout the year.
Finally, given the trends that we saw in the third quarter, we now expect price/mix to have an unfavorable impact on our full year results. And while we've had a very positive consumer receptions to our new product innovation launched during the third quarter, the overall price/mix environment was more challenging than our previous expectations particularly North America.
So looking at all these factors in total, we've been able to offset the negatives that we saw in the external environment with the internal actions that we're driving so we continue to expect to generate our adjusted earnings per share for the year in the range of $9.56 to $10.06 per share and our free cash flow guidance remains unchanged for the year which is $550 million to $650 million.
At this point in time, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer for his review of the North America operations."
314515,114465718,145181,"Whirlpool Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.

Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance in the third quarter. As shown on Slide 8, we saw strong branded share growth during the quarter, driven by a consumer element innovation and an improvement in some of the product availability issues we experienced during the second quarter. Our key new product launches are well received by consumers. And at the same time, industry volumes and the pricing environment grew more challenging than expected, and we took actions to met some aggressive competitive pricing pressure. 
On Slide 9, we detailed North America's performance in the third quarter. Net sales decreased 3% to $2.4 billion, driven by lower average sales values in the quarter. I will touch on this momentarily, but this decline is largely related to reductions in 2 major product categories. Our North America unit shipments increased approximately 1%, while U.S. industry unit shipments of major T7 appliances decreased 3% during the third quarter. And we had, as mentioned before, a strong increase in branded share during the quarter. 
Our operating margin was 4.7% compared to 5.9% in the prior year. Overall, the results were unfavorably impacted by lower price/mix and higher material cost. Favorable cost reductions and productivity initiatives partially offset the unfavorable items. 
On Slide 10, you can see some of our new products that we expect will continue to support our branded share growth. The Maytag brand Ice2O Easy Access refrigerator, which is the industry's most efficient 4-door refrigerator. It features an external counter-height refrigerator drawer that holds up to 5 bags groceries. We also launched from Whirlpool's brand most premium Front-Load Duet laundry pair. This is the industry's most resource-efficient washer and dryer. Finally, the KitchenAid brand dishwasher, featuring a modern version of the recessed handle, found on models from past decades. I would like to point out that all these new launches happen towards the end of the third quarter.
On Slide 11, the chart depicts ASV or average sales value industry trends by category. First thing you will note is that there was a generally a wide distribution on a year-over-year basis, with some categories up and others down. You will also note that the overall reduction is mainly attributable to 2 categories. We'd like to address some of our price points in these categories given the competitive environment and we saw subsequently a strong increase in our branded share performance.
It is also important to note that our new product innovation starts to provide an overall ASV lift and we continue to focus on successfully launching our new products and continuing to generate more new products in the future.
Overall, I would sum the third quarter challenging from a demand and pricing environment. We continue to address which will bring consumer-relevant new products to market and keeping a strong focus and cost control in productivity. 
Now, I'd like to turn over to Mike for his review of our international operations."
314515,114465718,145181,"Whirlpool Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Let me start with an overview of our International business. Our international operating results continued to benefit from our ongoing cost reduction and productivity efforts and solid volume growth from our emerging markets. During the thir",612,"Thanks, Marc. Let me start with an overview of our International business. Our international operating results continued to benefit from our ongoing cost reduction and productivity efforts and solid volume growth from our emerging markets. During the third quarter, we experienced improved market conditions in Brazil, slight improvement in Europe, while Asia unit volumes remain very strong. 
Turning to Slide 13, our European sales declined 8% year-over-year to $827 million in the quarter, with unit shipments increasing 6%. Excluding the effects of currency, sales were essentially flat compared to the prior year. The reason reported on operating profit of $26 million during the third quarter compared to an operating profit of $14 million in the previous year. The profitability improvement was driven by continued cost reduction and productivity improvements, which were partially offset by higher material costs and lower price/mix.
Slide 14 shows a summary of our Latin American third quarter results. The region reported sales of $1.1 billion, a 13% increase from the prior year period as appliance unit shipments increased 9%. Excluding the impact from currency, sales increased approximately 9%. Operating profit reached $143 million compared to $93 million reported in the prior year. The profitability improvement is primarily related to the increase in volume, cost reduction and productivity initiatives and increased monetization of certain tax credits. These favorable items were partially offset by higher material costs and lower price/mix.
Our third quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 15. Net sales increased 21% during the quarter to $195 million, up from $162 million in the prior year period as unit shipments increased 18%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 16%. On an adjusted basis, operating profit reached $5 million for the quarter versus the $5 million generated in the prior year period. Favorable volume growth and productivity was offset by higher material and oil-related costs.
Turning to Slide 16, you'll see just a few of our international product launches during the quarter, including the Bauknecht brand, Kosmos built-in coffee machine in Europe. The machine makes coffee and froths milk at the press of a button and can make espresso, café latte or cappuccino. The Brastemp Ative! washing machine in Latin America. It features an additional wash basket for delicate clothes and a special option on the machine that can reduce soap stains by premixing soap and water before it comes into contact with fabrics. And the new Whirlpool brand ACE semiautomatic washing machine in India, which offers a built-in work surface and a handle and wheels for portability.
Turning to Slide 17, I would like to summarize our international outlook for the remainder of 2010. We see demand levels improve more than slightly in Europe and expect to continue to see margin expansion as a result of our ongoing productivity efforts. As we've discussed on the previous call, in Latin America, the slight negative growth rate in the second quarter recovered nicely in the third quarter despite more difficult comparisons and we expect continued growth in the region for the remainder of the year. And in Asia, we expect to continue to see positive growth through year end.
In all the international regions, we will continue to focus on productivity to offset continued cost increases. In addition, the international organization is focused on continuing to bring consumer-relevant innovation that will improve our price/mix. Our innovative new products continue to improve our price/mix in the third quarter despite the overall degradation we experienced. Going forward, we are focused on bringing more of these products to the market at a faster pace. 
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Roy Templin for his financial review."
314515,114465718,145181,"Whirlpool Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 19, I would like to summarize our third quarter results. For the quarter, our sales grew 1/2 of a percentage point to $4.5 billion.

For the quarter, our sales grew 1/2 of a percentage point to $4.5 billion. Appliance unit volumes increased 5% from the prior year. While all of our regions reported unit volume increases during the quarter, the overall increase was largely driven by higher unit volumes in our International operations.
We continue to see a significant benefit from our productivity and cost-reduction initiatives during the quarter. In addition, to this, we monetized $56 million of our BEFIEX credits compared to $8 million in the prior year. If you recall, in the prior year, we saw a significant reduction in our BEFIEX monetization due to the IPI tax reduction legislated by the Brazilian government, which expired on February 1.
Finally, these favorable effects were partially offset by lower price/mix and higher material costs. Before we take a look at the income statement in detail, there is one item I would like to highlight. During the quarter, we recorded a $93 million accrual related to Embraco settlement agreements. This resulted in an unfavorable impact of $1.20 per diluted share on our third quarter results.
Turning to the income statement on Slide 20, we reported net sales of just over $4.5 billion. Our gross margin rose 50 basis points to 14.3%, the most significant favorable impacts on our gross margin improvement related to our cost takeout and productivity actions and the higher BEFIEX credits, which were partially offset by lower price/mix and higher material cost. SG&A expense totaled $391 million, foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $5 million of the $9 million year-over-year decrease. Despite our relatively flat sales results during the quarter, we continued to generate good SG&A leverage as SG&A as a percentage of sales declined 20 basis points to 8.7% of net sales.
Restructuring expenses totaled $16 million during the quarter and were largely related to cost-reduction actions in North America. Given our year-to-date restructuring spend and our fourth quarter outlook, we now expect to record restructuring expenses in the $75 million to $100 million range during 2010. Finally, our operating margin expanded approximately 1 point from the prior year to 5.2%.
Turning to Slide 21, I wanted to briefly discuss interest and sundry expense. The $93 million of Embraco settlement expenses were recorded in this line during the third quarter. In the prior year, we recorded a $43 million expense related to the settlement agreement with the Brazilian Competition Commission.
Turning to our tax rate, we recorded an income tax credit of $7 million during the quarter, corresponding to an effective tax benefit of approximately 9%. For the full year, we continue to expect to record an effective tax benefit of approximately 5%. Finally, on an adjusted basis, we reported diluted EPS of $2.22 per share compared with $1.67 per share in the prior year.
Moving to our free cash flow results on Slide 22. Through the first 9 months, we generated free cash use of $1 million compared with a $373 million free cash generation in the prior year. The main variance from the prior year's record 9-month results relates to higher working capital levels from the prior year end. The current year of free cash flow results include a tax refund of approximately $105 million. 
The most significant driver of our increased working capital balances relates to inventory. The higher inventory cash usage is due to a multitude of factors including product transition inventory related to some of our high-volume new product launches, a general rebuild from the low level of inventory at year end and some excess stock at the end of Q3 due primarily to slowing industry demand levels in North America.
We have specific plans in place to reduce these balances during the fourth quarter in addition to our typical seasonal drawdown. On a year-to-date basis, our capital spending has increased $39 million, largely as a result of new product launch spending in the North America region. We continue to expect full year capital spending will be between $575 million and $625 million.
Turning to Slide 23, I would like to highlight our progress in debt reduction. On a year-to-date basis, we have repaid $380 million of borrowings. While our net-debt levels increased slightly since the December 31, we expect to bring our net-debt balance below the prior year-end levels based on our full year free cash flow outlook.  
On slide 24, we summarized our net liquidity position. As you can see from this table, our net liquidity position was over $2.7 billion as of September 30. Based on the amended credit agreement that we entered in to last year, our revolving credit facility is scheduled to downsize by $522 million in December. Even with the facility step down, our cash balances and remaining $1.35 billion credit line availability provide us with significant liquidity.
On Slide 25, you can see a summary of our full year outlook. We are now expecting to report GAAP earnings per share in the range of $7.80 and $8.30 per share. On an adjusted basis, our outlook is for diluted earnings per share in the range of $9.56 to $10.06 per share. As you might expect, given the macroeconomic volatility we have been managing, there are several moving parts to our outlook. The major unfavorable driver from our previous outlook is lower full year price/mix. We now expect to see lower price/mix for the full year given some of the recent trends we experienced in the third quarter. We expect to offset lower price/mix through continued productivity and cost reduction gains, slightly lower material costs and higher BEFIEX monetization.
Turning to our cash flow outlook, we continue to protect free cash flow in the range of $550 million to $650 million. As noted earlier, we are executing several actions to reduce our overall inventory levels in a somewhat volatile demand environment. The level of volatility may impact our success in reducing overall inventory levels and therefore influence whether we hit the high or low end of our cash guidance.
At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

Let me summarize, overall, I feel that we made strong progress this year executing against our key operational priorities. Our successful cost reduction and productivity initiatives have enabled us to significantly expand our margins during 2010, despite some unfavorable trends in the macroeconomic environment and somewhat slow growth in demand in the developed markets in North America and Europe. 
From a global unit demand standpoint, our expectation for moderating unit demand is largely unfolded as we've expected, although I'd say North America demand is a bit softer and Europe is a bit better than we previously expected.
In some of our other markets, in key emerging markets such as Brazil and India, we continue to see very strong growth and are creating significant value for our company there. We remain bullish on the long-term prospects for these economies and believe that we're very well-positioned to capitalize on the economic growth potential in these markets going forward. So for the full year, our key priorities are unchanged. Our entire organization is very focused and aligned to execute against these priorities as we believe they're the keys to successfully navigating through a somewhat volatile global economic environment.
And In total, as we said through our guidance in July and I'll say and reaffirming it today, we expect to deliver a record year of operating results and value creation to our shareholders this year.

In particular, we observed some pretty aggressive competitive moves in 2 critical product categories already during Q2. And given our leadership position, in these categories, we decided to meet these new competitive price points. As a result of that, we saw some immediate market share gains in these distinct categories. Obviously, our job is to balance that price/mix as we did in the past going forward. What gives us confidence is some of the products which we highlight in the presentation, we just launched towards the end of the third quarter, that should give us momentum.

Just sequentially, there are kind of 3 things that impacted our margins in Latin America in the third quarter. The first is, there is a normal seasonality of business that happens kind of from the second quarter when you go into the third quarter. We didn't see it last year because of the IPI tax holiday. So that had an impact. The second is we did experience higher material and oil-related cost in the third quarter of this year than we did in the second quarter. And the third reason was that we ended the second quarter with higher inventories because if you remember, we saw a slight reduction in demand. And so we took actions to reduce production in the third quarter and that had an impact overall in the margins. I could tell you that I feel very confident that we will see margin expansion in Latin America in the fourth quarter."

Let me start and give you a little bit of perspective in terms of the inventory build and I'll talk specifically about what we're going to do and, actually, Marc may jump in here as well. If you look at year-over-year, Sam, we're up roughly 12 days in inventories. Now, the first thing that sort of put perspective is that we came into this year with inventories much lower than where we normally are in December. If you remember, in December of 2008, we were at $2.2 billion. If you look at sort of our normal traditional exit rate in December, we're more like $2.5 billion. And we saw some impacts of that, Marc talked about that. He talked about in Latin America in terms of availability because on the low inventory levels we had coming out a year. So first of all, 62 days a year ago, roughly $200 million, Sam, or 5 days of the increase from where we were at the end of year ago is basically just what we call sort of a normal build to get our inventories back to where we wanted inventories to be. So that takes you to 67 days. We've got about a day for seasonality coming out of Asia to Bali this year is in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, and we've got about a day here in North America with respect to some of the build for the fourth quarter. So there's 2 days there that we would call seasonal build. That gets you to 69, Sam. Then we have about 4 days of excess inventory that I referenced in my script that we are going to work to get out by the end of the year and as I said, in my script Sam, that's mostly all in North America and then we've got one incremental day which is transition inventory in North America as we transition our products but Sam, I think that one day will still be there at the end of the year on a sequential perspective. So the sequential piece is really taking out this excess inventory in the action that Marc Bitzer and his team have already taken in North America."

So it's about what we would consider optimal. And let's make it twofold. One is, yes, there's quite a bit of Q4 prebuild around some freight commitments and the other piece is we saw the market slowdown in particular during the second part of the third quarter and obviously, it takes a little while to take that out of inventory. We have taken measures towards the end of December and particularly on October and November to run down production to what we would consider appropriate levels of inventory, which given the somewhat choppy demand environment will be slightly higher because we've got to able to respond to it to the changing demand trends. What I would like to point out is also on the energy tax credits and the inventory are 2 independent issues, okay? Actually, if you would just peel back the onion on our energy tax credit units, actually, would run lower inventories than the rest of the average, quite a bit lower. In particular in some of the new products we've closed, 5 of it when we run very low inventories. So these 2 things are fairly unrelated to each other."

For the quarter, the second part, we estimate it was right about $80 million of impact, Josh, and that was 1.8 points of hit on our gross margin. So you heard Mike and Marc and Jeff all comment on that in their scripts but it all came back to just under 2 points of negative impact on gross margins. But we're still in that.

But again, depending upon where discount rates go, David, particularly in this environment, I just can't speculate on what that's going to be next year. Probably the one point I can make to you though with respect to cash and funding of pensions, as you know, we have roughly $1.3 billion unfunded status in our defined benefit plans, of course, they're frozen now. But we see the minimum funding requirements given current pension rules to be roughly $200 million in 2011 and that's an important point from a cash perspective. I just can't speculate yet David on the expense side."
