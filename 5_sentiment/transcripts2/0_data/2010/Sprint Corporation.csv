Good morning, and welcome to Sprint Nextel's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us this morning. For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO, Bob Brust, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter. Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website. Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review including our Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2009 and when filed, our Form 10-K for 2009. Turning to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the fourth quarter can be found on the attachments to our earnings release, and also at the end of today's presentation, which is stored on our website.Next, I would like to quickly cover our EPS results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the fourth quarter was $0.34, compared to $0.17 in the third quarter 2009 and $0.57 in the year-ago period. Approximately $0.11 of the fourth quarter loss per share was due to a non-cash charge to increase the valuation allowance on deferred taxes. 2009 basic and diluted loss per common share was $0.84 compared to $0.98 in 2008. I will now turn the call over to Sprint CEO, Dan Hesse."

I think some of you may be joining us from your homes, enjoying this winter. Going to Slide #5. We've been making progress each quarter, and the most recent quarter is no exception. I talk about the s",1405,"Thanks, Yijing. Thank you for joining us this morning. I think some of you may be joining us from your homes, enjoying this winter. Going to Slide #5. We've been making progress each quarter, and the most recent quarter is no exception. I talk about the same three priorities on each of our calls: The customer experience, the brand and cash, and I will keep this string going on this call. I'll try to shake it up today by going in reverse order. Starting with cash. With $666 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, Sprint generated $2.8 billion in free cash flow in 2009, the highest level ever for Sprint Nextel, allowing us to acquire Virgin Mobile, iPCS and invest approximately $1.1 billion in Clearwire in the fourth quarter. And still in the year, with almost $4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Bob will talk more about earnings and cash in his remarks.We go to Slide 6. Regarding the brand, we continue to make progress, perhaps best evidenced by our improving subscriber performance. We lost a total of 69,000 retail subscribers in the quarter, and fewer than 1 million for the entire year, an improvement of over 4 million year-over-year. Although postpaid subscribers declined by 504,000, the fourth quarter represents both the best sequential and the best year-over-year improvements in company history, sprint's 600,000 or 54% year-over-year improvement, postpaid results we would have achieved without any acquisitions lies in sharp contrast to the rest of the industry. Our Sprint branded services, which run on the CDMA network, were net add positive in the fourth quarter and showed the best sequential improvement in almost three years. We showed a lot of progress in the second half. The improvement in net adds in the second half both year-over-year and compared to the first half of the year were both best-ever results. The brand improvement is being demonstrated further through gross adds. Second half gross add performance year-over-year and versus the first half, were both the best in five years. Our estimate of fourth quarter share of gross adds or SOGA, shows an improvement year-over-year of 350 basis points. Our fourth quarter cost per gross add was also the lowest in over three years. We also maintained a high percentage of prime customers on postpaid, over 84%. Churn of 2.11% was a slight improvement both sequentially and year-over-year, but we still need to do better with churn.Going to Slide 7. Fourth quarter prepaid net adds were 435,000. For 2009, Boost generated over 2.5 million net adds, and we grew Boost revenue by 35%. Although we took actions to minimize churn during the fourth quarter, the success experienced by Boost Unlimited during the first three quarters of 2009 became increasingly difficult to replicate. Prepaid competition expanded and intensified as our competitors used more aggressive pricing tactics. We expect this highly competitive environment will continue.Our prepaid team is taking actions to overcome these recent challenges and expects to regain momentum during the second quarter. We expect to make meaningful progress in our prepaid net add results as we enter the second half of 2010. Prepaid should continue to be a source of subscriber and financial growth for the company. We are beginning to implement a robust, multi-brand strategy to appeal to multiple segments of the prepaid market with our Boost, Virgin Mobile and Assurance brands. Each of these brands, along with others, will target a specific segment of the market with a unique value proposition.We go to Slide 8. Large contributions to Sprint's momentum come from improvements in our top priority area, the customer experience. Customer satisfaction with care and first call resolution as measured both by a Sprint-sponsored external survey and by a very reputable independent survey, have now improved for eight consecutive quarters. Both metrics also hit all-time highs. Because of the improvements we made, J.D. Power asked to me to keynote their annual customer experience roundtable in New York three weeks ago. In J.D. Power's most recent survey, not only was Sprint's improvement by far the most significant, Sprint alone accounted for half of the improvement showed by the entire industry.As we look back on 2009, the University of Michigan Customer Satisfaction study showed Sprint made not only the most improvement among wireless carriers, but the most improvement of any company in the survey, from all industries. In a recently released well respected independent survey, Sprint was the only company that improved customer satisfaction in every category. From fourth place at the end of 2008, Sprint moved to number two in satisfaction with price value. Also, from fourth place in 2008, Sprint moved to number two in network satisfaction.In Consumer Reports, Sprint moved past AT&T. And based upon our analysis of the specific market data, Sprint improved or stayed the same in 80% of the markets. The next best competitor was at 24%. These improvements in care satisfaction have all been accomplished in an environment where we reduced care credits by 47% and reduced calls per sub 12% year-over-year, and by 39% from 2007 peak levels. We've closed three more call centers in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to 19 centers in 2009 and 30 centers closed in two years.Network performance, like care, is important to the customer experience. Our networks are performing at their best levels ever with PC World recognizing our reliability. Our customers enjoy more than twice the 3G coverage AT&T customers do. Our business customers in particular, have noticed the improvements. Sprint ranked number one among large business users. Those are users with 500 or more employees in both voice and data satisfaction in the recent Yankee Group and Mobile Enterprise Magazine survey.We hope that the quality improvements we've made to our networks will bring a new breed of wholesale device to the network, like the new Skiff Reader which generated so much excitement at the Consumer Electronics Show. We will also work to make sure our selection of retail devices is second to none. Sprint continue to grow the breadth of our device offerings in the fourth quarter, including the first CDMA Android devices in the United States, the HTC Hero and the Samsung Moment. We also launched the Palm Pixi, Samsung Intrepid, Motorola Debut and the new Blackberry Curve 8530. In 2010, we have already launched the LG Lotus Elite, Motorola Brute i680 and we announced the Rumor Touch, with many more devices to come. A robust portfolio of devices is important, as 49% of our fourth quarter CDMA postpaid handset sales and upgrades were either smartphones or handsets with touchscreens.We are encouraged by the January launch of the Sierra Wireless Overdrive(TM) 3G/4G Mobile Hotspot, the first device of its kind. The Overdrive can turn over 400 million Wi-Fi enabled devices today into Sprint 4G devices, including the iPod Touch, the iPhone and the iPad. The Overdrive won Best of CES recognition, that's Consumer Electronics Show, from both PC World and CrunchGear. The Overdrive, combined with our growing 4G coverage, provides our customers with mobile connectivity that is up to 10x faster than 3G. However, 4G is not just about speed, it's also about great value. You get a larger data bucket for the same price as with 3G.For customers that prefer a traditional AirCard, we offer the only dual-mode 3G/4G connection card, the U301, which won PC Magazine's Editors Choice award. We have also been working with several equipment manufacturers that will embed 4G capability into dozens of devices. Additional devices, especially phones, will be an important part of our 2010 4G plan. Expanding the coverage of 4G in 2010 will be an important catalyst for continued improvement in Sprint's postpaid subscriber results, so we chose to invest an additional $1.1 billion in Clearwire during the fourth quarter, bringing our total ownership to 56%.So with 4G as a catalyst, we expect that both postpaid and total subscriber losses will improve in 2010 as compared to last year. Even though we still have much improvement to make, if there was one word that would sum up the fourth quarter and 2009, it would be progress. Quarter by quarter, we will strive to continue to improve the customer experience, strengthen the brand and generate positive free cash flow. We feel we have momentum as we move into 2010. Now, I'll turn it over to Bob Brust, who will discuss the financial aspects of our results."

Moving on to Slide 11, we had another strong quarter, as Dan said, in terms of free cash flow, generating $666 million in the fourth quarter and $2.8 billion for the full year 2009. This compares to $664 million in the third quarter and $1.8 billion for the full year 2008.  During the third quarter of 2009, we made a $200 million cash contribution to Sprint's defined benefit pension plan, which we do not expect to be necessary in 2010. We are especially pleased with our consistent quarterly cash generation throughout 2009. We expect to generate a meaningful level of positive free cash flow in 2010.During the quarter, we repaid the remaining $1 billion of outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. We also provided a net $1.118 billion of funding to Clearwire and paid $560 million in net cash for the acquisitions of Virgin Mobile and iPCS during the fourth quarter, in addition to issuing approximately 96 million shares for our acquisition of Virgin Mobile. Even with our cash payments in the fourth quarter, we ended 2009 with a solid cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balance of $3.9 billion. Our goal continues to be to maintain a healthy cash balance for the foreseeable future. Taking into consideration the availability under our bank credit facility, we also had a strong liquidity position of $6.6 billion exiting 2009.Looking ahead, we have $750 million in debt maturing in the second quarter of 2010, $1.65 billion in January of 2011 and $2.750 billion in 2012. Our current view is to pay this debt as scheduled and not refinance. Enhancing our repayment ability, we expect rebanding cost to lower sharply in 2011 and beyond. Lastly, our revolving credit facility expires at the end of 2010, and we plan to take appropriate action before its maturity. We spent $554 million in capital during the fourth quarter compared to $431 million in the third quarter of 2009, and $548 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Fourth quarter 2008 CapEx included $90 million of 4G expenditures. We spent approximately $1.6 billion in capital in 2009 compared to $3 billion in 2008, which included approximately $560 million of 4G. We remain extremely focused on network quality for our customers and will spend where we need to, largely for capacity from the growth and data network development projects such as dual-mode, 3G/4G and network performance. We continually make improvements in network quality and coverage to additional macro sites backhaul capacity, the use of pico and femtocells repeaters and tuning. We also made strides during the quarter on our affiliate modernization program, which involves expanding our EVDO footprint and adding capacity in certain markets that we acquired through our affiliate purchases. We expect that full year 2010 capital spend will be as high as $2 billion.Moving on to the financial results for the fourth quarter. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $1.409 billion, down sequentially from $1.506 billion in the third quarter, and $1.7535 billion year-ago period. The chart on Slide 12 outlines a sequential change. Consolidated operating revenues declined approximately 2% sequentially due to fewer postpaid subscribers, the decline of postpaid ARPUs were approximately $55 and lower Wireline revenues offset by revenue growth in prepaid. The decline in postpaid ARPU resulted from two primary factors: Seasonably lower usage driven revenue streams and a loss in overage revenue associated with the addition of Any Mobile, Anytime feature to certain plans. With this new feature, we are excited about the opportunity to offer our customers a great value with a worry-free bill. Although we experienced some near-term dilution in ARPU with the launch of Any Mobile, Anytime, we do not expect further deterioration of this magnitude.Looking at Prepaid, we experienced close to a $4 sequential decrease in ARPU due to the inclusion of lower ARPU Virgin Mobile customers post acquisition. Offset by continued growth in Boost Monthly Unlimited offer. A further decline of $2 to $4 should be expected in the first quarter, since we will have a full quarter of prepaid results including Boost, Virgin Mobile and Assurance Wireless.Wireline revenues decreased sequentially, primarily due to IP rate declines and lack of IP growth. Labor actions taken in the fourth quarter will help OIBDA margins sequentially, but we will continue to see pressure on full year results. As we move into 2010, the expected continued growth in Prepaid and improving trends in Postpaid should significantly improve the downward trend in revenue we have experienced the past few years. On the cost side, we saw sequential improvement in the cost of service and an increase in G&A. Within the cost of service, we experienced seasonally lower roaming and favorable rates with our premium services providers, offset by an increase in vendor fees due to our increased mix of smartphones.  Additionally, our service and repair expenses were down due to seasonably lower volume and a focus on refurbishing devices. SG&A expenses increased sequentially, primarily due to higher variable cost. The prepaid contribution to OIBDA improved sequentially as we benefited from continued growth in the Boost Monthly Unlimited offer. The Boost contribution is partially offset by the post-acquisition Virgin Mobile impact on results which is driven by acquisition-related accounting adjustments and seasonably higher gross adds. We expect that our Prepaid group will continue to provide positive contribution to OIBDA through the course of 2010.In summary, the Postpaid subscriber losses we experienced in 2009 will continue to create OIBDA challenges. We took actions in the fourth quarter to reduce cost and we'll take additional actions in 2010 in other operational areas. We expect to improve our near-term historical revenue trend in 2010, and generate more than enough cash to meet our obligations. Now, I'll turn it over back to Yijing for Q&A."

Obviously last quarter, it seems like a long time ago but there's a lot of hoopla about the T-Mobile pricing, and it doesn't really seem to have had any impact on your business in the 4Q results. I guess looking at the 1Q, we had MetroPCS take pricing down, AT&T, Verizon, and I'd love to kind of hear your guys' kind of strategic commentary about pricing positioning and competition, and your expectations for 2010. And the second question would be specifically related to Simply Everything. This was the big initiative two years ago, it was how you differentiated yourself competitively. Those guys are coming off of two-year contracts starting I guess, next month and it seems like AT&T and Verizon especially, will be going after those guys. What kind of retention initiatives do you think are going to be necessary to lock down that base?"

Let me take them one at a time. First of all on pricing, you're right. There's been a lot of competitive activity.

First of all on pricing, you're right. There's been a lot of competitive activity. As you mentioned, kind of T-Mobile as well as AT&T and Verizon in recent months. So there's no question that the industry is getting more competitive. If there's a benefit for us, I think it's going to put more of a focus on what customers are paying each month. That's been actually a concern of ours that there's been so much focus on the handset pricing, that customers aren't doing enough to compare what they're paying each month. And I think, if you take a look at the value of, for example, Any Mobile, Anytime, that's a $70 plan. If you compare that to, let's say, the Verizon and AT&T plans at $70, you have to pay like an extra $30 for data, that's included in ours. You have to pay an extra $20 for tax, that's included ours. If you want navigation, that's maybe $10 a month, that's included in ours. So we think we're well positioned from a value point of view, although we still have some education to do. I'd say the same thing with simply everything, if you just take a look at all the things that it includes, and you compare it to a $70 plan and what you need to bolt on to those plans, we're pretty well, I think, positioned from a pricing point of view. So yes, it is getting more competitive, there is no question from a pricing perspective. But we kind of like where we are and our job will be to educate the consumer better in terms of what all is included in those offers. Your second question had to do with, was it Simply Everything? And I think it's similar to what we have to do kind of in churn, totally. First of all, we've seen improved churn characteristics for customers that have Simply Everything and also Any Mobile, Anytime. That's a big piece of the economic equation because there aren't any surprises, there aren't overages, satisfaction tends to be high. And what we do with our customers, what'll be important are a number of things. I think the number one is still focusing on the brand health and the perception of the company among our customers. And if you were to take a look at what we call MWI, most want to investigate, we've made a lot of progress in terms of brand health with our existing base. Unfortunately, we haven't made as much progress with non-customers. But we believe that will come. And particularly, perception of price value, which I mentioned is coming up. So customers on Simply Everything kind of know they're getting a good deal from Sprint as well as perception of the network. Strong handsets, they'll be looking to upgrade. We'll want to make sure that we have the handset lineup that they're going to want. That'll be very attractive. That's a very important element of retention. And customers that have Simply Everything are automatically on our Premier program, which means they get an upgrade every year. And that puts them in kind of special situation relative to the industry. And of course, handsets are becoming very important. So strong handset lineup with Simply Everything customers being able to upgrade more frequently than they could on competitors, I think puts us in a good position. We've also I think done a much better job on our Save Desk of late. We've really focused time and attention on that and we're seeing our save rates improve. So we know there's no question the environment, and it's a good question to ask, the environment on postpaid is getting much more competitive. T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T have all taken pricing actions since we launched Any Mobile, Anytime. But we think we're priced where we need to be and still provide very, very good value to customers. And on the prepaid side, I can throw it over to Dan Schulman, but there's no question that there's increasing competition in prepaid, where when we launched Boost Unlimited at the beginning of 2009, we really had kind of a very strong value proposition where $50 meant $50. Now Boost has moved from really aggressive price plan to, one could argue, at parity, possibly even premium to similar plans in Prepaid. So Dan has a, I think a very robust and comprehensive plan on prepaid that allows us to use different brands for different segments of the market. Dan, you on there, you want to make a couple of comments on Prepaid?"

I think as we think about the prepaid market, as Dan just mentioned, obviously Boost had a great first three quarters of the year. But it was kind of a single play being run and competition eventually caught up to that and impacted some of its growth in the fourth quarter. We've been looking quite hard at the overall Prepaid segment right now, and it's a pretty robust segment, it's somewhere between 55 and 60 million Americans now have prepaid. And so the market is no longer a one-size-fits-all. There are definitely very distinct segments of the market out there, they have very unique needs and wants. They shop in different channels, they want specific handsets or specific value propositions. And so what you're going to see from us on the Prepaid side, and we've just started to implement some of this, is actually create brands that have very unique value propositions that appeal to very specific segments of the market. And so some segments of the market are more price sensitive than other segments of the market, and we'll take actions where we need to there. Others have much different needs, and we don't need to take pricing action there. And so what we're looking at is on a segment-by-segment basis and a brand-by-brand perspective, exactly what type of value proposition do we need to have out there to clearly win in the marketplace. Because, by the way, different competitors target different segments of the market. And you don't really need to react from a pricing perspective, just because one competitor takes action across the market. And so we'll have not only unique value proposition but very unique CPGA and CCPU for each of the brands that we put out there, so that we think that we can drive not only very meaningful net add growth but provide a very compelling financial return as well. And so that's in a nutshell, kind of our strategy in the prepaid market and we'll have that fully rolled out by the end of the second quarter"

So we're not giving any specific guidance with respect to churn in 2010, but we're working on it very, very hard.

I was wondering if -- what you would say was the driver of the gross adds trend. And then one more follow-up on the Prepaid side. It sounds very much like you guys are going to use some of these new brands or maybe the Virgin brand to effectively cut price in some sort of market segments. When Metro PCS had their analyst day a month ago, I think they made it pretty clear that intended to remain the price sort of value leader in the space, given their cost structure. I mean is there a risk of that, by coming out with another sort of off brand that you risk, really squeezing whatever economics are left out of the unlimited prepaid segment?

That's been what's moved the needle the most. From a credit point of view, we'd make minor tweaks basically to try to keep our credit policies similar to Verizon and AT&T. So as they move theirs, we move ours. We try to more or less mirror them. There will be slight differences market-to-market. But as our strong prime percentage results indicate, we're not going back to some things Sprint did many years ago, which was to loosen credit policies to go after adds. That is -- we are not doing that. We're only going after profitable revenue, period, on Postpaid. The second part of the question, maybe Dan Schulman, I'll let you answer that."

With respect to 4G, there are really two things that are important to making a lot of hay with 4G. One is kind of coverage and the number of markets. It makes it much more efficient to sell, to advertise, et cetera. And you'll begin to see that as we hit, if you will, a critical mass in 2010 that we didn't do in 2009. And we finished 2009 with about 30 million POPs covered. And our expectation is we have roughly 4x that amount of coverage at the end of 2010. The other element that's very, very important is just having some devices available in dual-mode 4G/3G (sic) [3G/4G]. And we launched really two devices in January. One was the U301 dual-mode aircard, and the other was the Overdrive. So we're just beginning, if you will, to have combination network coverage and devices that are attractive. And as I mentioned in my remarks, what will really make a difference is having some what we call phones as well that you can make phone calls on also being launched during the year. That will make a big difference. So internally, we call 2010 the year of 4G. It's going to be the year that we're the only game in town. And it's a combination of we need to get more markets turned up, and we need to get a better device lined up, and then we think we can really start to show some sizable progress in that regard. We also thought it was important not to provide a disincentive to customers to try out, if you will, dual-mode 4G/3G (sic) [3G/4G]. As you know, with having and owning over 50% of Clearwire, we look at the pricing of 4G/3G (sic) [3G/4G] with really two hats on. One is, if you will, the transfer price that were charged as an MVNO, if you will, on 4G, as well as just the overall economics of that network. And if you could take a look at the second half of that, which is the economics of that network, it's a lot cheaper to produce a gigabyte on the 4G network than on the 3G network. So actually, one of the questions would be why don't you provide 4G at a lower price than 3G because you could? But we have no intention of doing that because there's a, if you will, not only speed advantage. But what we are doing is offering a larger bucket because as customers get 4G devices. They're going to want to use their devices a lot more in the mobile environment. And so raising the cap, if you will, in terms of gigabytes, we believe reflects the superior economics of 4G over 3G in terms of data production. The last question you had was with respect Wireline, and I'll let Paget talk about that."

So on balance, at least 50%, maybe a tad more of the change, was a result of those kinds of items. So we not expect to see that recurring in 2010. From a standpoint of the economy, the economy has affected the business marketplace, I think Dan mentioned earlier that you do see between iDEN and CDMA there's some difference, which is to some extent a by-product of the economic sensitivity that iDEN has to the business marketplace. But generally, we're optimistic about what the economy will do going forward. We're starting to see some planning, certainly in the business. The larger businesses are beginning to make decisions and anticipate making purchases. So we've seen a very different environment as we move into 2010 as compared to, say, the second half of 2009."

But you raised a good point or point something out that it's also a fixed solution and a mobile solution. So there are opportunities for us and for companies like Clear [Clearwire] to get customers to cut the cord at home by using 4G really as a stationary or a premise-based, high-capacity connection. But our primary emphasis at Sprint is on dual-mode 4G/3G (sic) [3G/4G] and customers that would be mobile. And that is where we see by far the largest opportunity for us because of we're a mobility company primarily. But again, there are some fixed applications, but mobility is absolutely crucial. Of course, we want to get the coverage to even greater than 120 million POPs. Of course, there are some realities in terms of just how quickly you can effectively bring up markets, do cell-siting and what have you. It just takes a while to build out a 4G network. So we would expect that you would see more POPs being expanded in 2011 and in 2012. So this would be a continuous process like so many generations are. As a matter of fact, in Sprint's case, we put a lot of 3G coverage in place back in 2007, and a number of competitors are really just beginning to roll out 3G. So that will be a process that continues. With respect to Clearwire funding, as you know, we just put a lot of equity and others put a lot of equity and they also raised some additional debt. So the board of Clearwire will always, they'll determine how much additional funding, if any, is needed going forward. And we'll look at the alternatives to do that when the time comes."

The cable companies can bundle it, if you will, broadband at home and on the go. They can bundle it with video services and other things that are really in their wheel house. So we see each of the partners really going to their strength. Clearwire, as I mentioned earlier, has traditionally been a fixed-line replacement company. They're good at that. That'll be their greatest strength. Generally, single-mode 4G has a landline replacement, not that they won't also do other things. In Sprint's case, very much mobility, a mobile offering. And in the case of Time Warner, Comcast, Bright House, a different bundle that they'll be very strong in when a customer wants to have video service or high-speed Internet at home in a fixed environment. So I see the different partners that are investors in Clearwire expanding the total size of the addressable market and pie that 4G has because we each bring customer bases to the table. Our subscribers don't have a total overlap, so all of us are bringing customer base and unique kind of capabilities or skills to the table. And that's the plan or vision of Clearwire is that we have all these different companies with different strengths and customer bases going after the market that I think gives the company special potential."

So I'd like to get your thoughts on how we should think about the backhaul migration to Clearwire's network, moving off special access over time. And then thirdly, the multiple network challenges, moving Boost on CDMA. You alluded to it before, and I appreciate it, that we're going to be rolling forward two networks here.

One on costs and roaming, right now, we don't have plans to roam, let's say, on Verizon at 800 megahertz because you have to put that capability in the phone, the dual-mode capability, which adds cost and price to the devices. And our coverage is so darn good, we don't really need to. I mean, coverage is a Sprint strength, both the size of our voice footprint and data footprint. And of course, the economics of roaming are not that favorable. So roaming is still fairly expensive. So we are not looking to expand to roam on 800 megahertz because it just doesn't make economic sense to us. Secondly, with respect to backhaul migration, our number one regulatory issue, and we're pleased that the FCC is taking this issue up quite seriously, is special access and just the very, very high costs that we pay. Roughly a third of the operating cost of a cell site are special-access charges that go back to the lion of the cases directly to our competitors, with extremely high margin. So we think there's some opportunity for special access cost to come down. In addition, as we build up the network with Clearwire, we're working together to maximize the use of existing cell sites that Sprint has and to share the backhaul expense, whether that backhaul be -- because there are scale economies, if you will, be provided by the local exchange carrier. And we can get better economics if we're sharing, if you will, the capacity of whatever we might buy or potentially using Clearwire technology could be reel as a backhaul alternative to the local exchange carriers. So we're looking at every possible way to decrease costs and working very closely with Clearwire to really come up with win-win for both Clearwire Company (sic) [Clearwire Corp.]  And Sprint, just to look at ways we can share cell sites and backhaul any place possible. But the real key for Sprint in terms of our regulatory initiatives in 2010 will be to make a lot of progress on special access, which is the one industry structure issue that really hasn't been addressed and needs to be addressed. And the data has been out there for a long time. So I have some cautious optimism that we'll see some progress made in special access. And your last question was something about Boost on CDMA? I just want to make sure I understand that question."

We still do have the iDEN network. And we want to make sure that we are utilizing that network and have revenue covering our fixed costs on that network. But as we look to additional investments, with those investments be in new handsets, or those investments being in capital that we would put into the networks, we're going to get a better return and a longer-lived return on incremental investments on the CDMA network than on the iDEN network. So that is what's behind it. Over time, CDMA will give us a better return on our investment."

Let me begin by saying that as I reflect on my ninth quarter at Sprint, I am encouraged by the improvements we've made especially in light of the declining performance trend lines we entered 200",1621,"Thank you, Yijing and thank you for joining us this morning. Let me begin by saying that as I reflect on my ninth quarter at Sprint, I am encouraged by the improvements we've made especially in light of the declining performance trend lines we entered 2008 with.
Our turnaround has been made more difficult by a weak economy in late 2008 and in 2009 plus the strong competitive challenges we faced. But what were negative sequential and year-over-year trends have changed from negative to flat and some are now turning positive.
If you go to slide four, the first quarter represents our first sequential increase in total net operating revenues and wireless service revenues in nearly three year. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA and adjusted OIBDA margin both grew sequentially. And perhaps most important of all, our post-paid net adds shows the best year-over-year improvement in five years driven by the largest share of gross adds or SoGA improvement in five years estimated now at 500 basis points, an increase in gross add market share of 45%.
We continue to execute well around our three priorities, which are improving the customer experience, strengthening our brand and generating cash.
Starting with the first, with respect to customer experience, I am pleased to report our 9th consecutive quarter of improvement in customer care satisfaction and in first call resolution. As Cliff Moore, the Chairman and Co-Founder of the Customer Operations Performance Center or COPC, the world's leading authority on customer contact centers recently said and I quote, 'Sprint's nine consecutive quarters of improvement in first call resolution and customer satisfaction is a true rarity and it is at the highest end of best-in-class levels, demonstrating continuous improvement in the contact center industry.
Our customer satisfaction top-box score has improved 15% year-over-year and is at an all-time high. Our bottom-box score has improved 35% year-over-year, also reaching an all-time best. And we're not buying satisfaction with billed credits. We've reduced customer care credits by 47% versus last year.
In the recent JD Power Wireless Customer Care survey, Sprint improved the most of any carrier, 17 points versus the industry's four points. Sprint alone accounted for half of the improvement shown by the entire industry.
Our networks are also performing at their best levels ever as measured by drops and blocked calls. Based on a survey of large businesses by the Yankee Group and Mobile Enterprise Magazine, business customers with more than 500 employees, ranked Sprint number one in voice service satisfaction and number one in data service satisfaction.
If you adjust post-paid churn for the discontinued Helio platform we acquired as part of the Virgin Mobile transaction, our churn of 2.12% ties Sprint's best first quarter churn performance since the merger. We expect to complete the Helio decommissioning in the second quarter and this will have a negative impact on second quarter post-paid churn by 6 to 8 basis points. But, we still expect that post-paid churn will be lower in the second quarter.
The second is brand, second priority. In part of our confidence in churn comes from the continuing improvement in Sprint's brand metrics. We're making significant strides in strengthening the Sprint brand among the customers of each of the major wireless carriers our MWI or most want to investigate score has improved more for Sprint than for any competitor.
Likelihood to recommend Sprint among our customer base has shown steady and significant gains, more improvement than for any carrier among their base. Our confidence in the quality of the customer experience we have built for Sprint customers led us to offer the industry's first true 30-day performance guarantee which we introduced on March 31.
Sprint's value network and 4G messages are continuing to gain traction as we see statistically significant improvement in customers associating these messages with the Sprint brand. Awareness in correct brand linkage for the Now Network is now ahead of all competitor taglines.
If you go to slide five, in Reputation Institute's 2010 study recently published by Forbes, Sprint's corporate reputation score with consumers grew 11% in the past year, the 18th largest gain among the companies in the survey, the 150 largest companies in US, almost tripled the gain of either AT&T or Verizon. Even though external brand held in corporate reputation studies are helpful in determining the direction your brand is taking, a more tangible measure is the change in subscriber trajectory.
If you go to slide six, our estimate of Sprint's annual improvement in share gross add of 500 basis points based upon the actual reported results of AT&T, Verizon and Sprint, and the consensus estimate of T-Mobile represents our largest improvement in five years.
If you go to slide seven, our year-over-year improvement in post-paid net adds of 672,000 represents our largest improvement for any quarter in five years. And this has been accomplished in an increasingly challenging competitive environment, against a much larger Verizon and against the iPhone. And we're maintaining a strong credit quality with the percentage of our base with a prime credit rating, up slightly sequentially still rounding to a healthy 84% prime that is.
AT&T and Verizon have many wireless performance numbers that I wish I could report. They are still outperforming us. Sprint lost a total of 75,000 subscribers in the first quarter, but AT&T's post-paid net add this quarter were down 385,000 versus the same quarter last year to their lowest reported net add number since 2004. Verizon's post-paid net adds were down 546,000 year-over-year to their lowest net add number since 2003. So in this context, our post-paid subscriber improvements are noteworthy.
A contribute to our brand and to subscriber trends is maintaining a strong device lineup. Smartphones or touch screen handsets made up 57% of our CDMA gross adds or upgrades in the first quarter. Sprint launched to announce several new devices including the Motorola i1, the world's first push-to-talk Android-powered smartphone, the Motorola Brute TM i680 which combines ultra-rugged durability with the best-in-class push-to-talk services of Nextel Direct Connect and the Motorola i890 iDEN device.
We also launched the exclusive LG Lotus Elite and fashionable LG Rumor Touch. In addition, we announced the LG Remarq and the Samsung Restore, which brings our industry-leading lineup of full-featured green devices to three and the new high-powered Blackberry Bold 9650 world phone.
But the most industry attention has been directed toward 4G. The Overdrive 3G/4G Mobile Hotspot which we announced in January was recognized by PCWorld, CrunchGear and Ubergizmo as the best of CES 2010. It's becoming a very popular accessory for the Apple iPad as well.
More recently, the HTC EVO 4G using Android 2.1 and Americas first 3G/4G phone was awarded best phone and best smartphone of CTIA by CNET and by LAPTOP Magazine.
Let's talk about prepaid. We're glad we've expanded our prepaid business and it's estimated that prepaid decisions reached 54% of industry decisions in the first quarter an all time high.
First quarter prepaid net adds were 348,000. After losing some prepaid momentum during the fourth quarter, we were quite pleased with the early success of our efforts in the first quarter.
During the first quarter, the Boost Mobile brand launched two new CDMA handsets and the first Blackberry with the unique All-In plan for $60. We saw immediate demand exceeding our expectations. We also launched the new Assurance Wireless brand in five states, aimed at lower income families and individuals, which received accolades from both consumers and community services organizations.
And finally we enhanced our Virgin Mobile broadband offer and significantly expanded its distribution leading to a tripling of sales. All these actions contributed to the highest prepaid gross adds in company history and the lowest level of first quarter prepaid churn in four years.
We have also made significant progress on our prepaid team integration and synergy efforts. The prepaid reorganization is now essentially complete and the prepaid team is on their way to exceeding our synergy targets. We've been working hard not only to update the Virgin Mobile brand and its value proposition in handsets, but also to identify new segments and brands to address the expanding prepaid market.
In the next few weeks, we will not only announce, but implement our multi-brand prepaid strategy into retail channels. You can expect unique value proposition, great handsets and a variety of distribution channels to effectively target multiple segments of the prepaid market.
We expect that the combination of repositioning our existing brands and adding a new brand will enable us to make meaningful progress to our prepaid net ad results during the second half of 2010 after all brands are fully rolled out in the national retail.
Our third priority is cash and with respect to this objective cash generation as I mentioned earlier, consolidated adjusted OIBDA and margin both improved sequentially as revenues also grew sequentially. 2009 was the strongest free cash flow year in Sprint Nextel history and we're continuing to generate free cash flow with over $500 million added in the first quarter.
So in conclusion, I never said Sprints turnaround would be quick or be easy. Two years ago our performance trend lines were declining and they were deteriorating at an accelerating rate. I hope you'll agree that the trajectories of a number of important performance metrics are starting to improve in spite of industry trend headwinds. We are looking forward to the upcoming launch of the groundbreaking HTC EVO 4G device which we hope will provide a tailwind to our momentum.
It's now my pleasure to introduce the person recently recognized by Institutional Investor as the best Chief Financial Officer in the Telecom industry, Bob Brust, who will provide more detail with respect to our financial performance.

That was down $160 million from the fourth quarter due to sea",1095,"Thanks Dan for that very nice intro and good morning everyone.
Moving on to slide eight, we had a satisfactory quarter in terms of free cash flow, generating $506 million in the first quarter. That was down $160 million from the fourth quarter due to seasonably higher interest payments and payroll-related costs that were partially offset by some other working capital benefits. We expect to continue to generate a meaningful level of positive free cash flow during the remainder of 2010.
Looking ahead at debt maturities, we have $750 million maturing in June, $1.65 billion in January of 2011 and $2.75 billion in 2012. We expect to pay the $750 million due this year in June and plan to pay the 2011 and 2012 maturities as scheduled and not refinance.
Our current revolving credit facility expires at the end of 2010 and we are currently in discussions with banks to negotiate revised terms for the revolver. We expect a facility to be completed in the second quarter and we will share additional details at that time.
We spent $419 million in capital during the first quarter compared to $554 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $291 million in the first quarter of last year. We continue to spend an appropriate amount on CapEx, mostly in the areas of development, capacity and coverage. We still expect the full year 2010 capital spending to be up to $2 billion.
During the first quarter, we also paid the remaining $50 million to Clearwire as part of the funding commitment we made back in November 2009. We ended the first quarter with cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balance of $4.4 billion. We continue to expect to maintain an average cash balance of approximately $4 billion for the foreseeable future.
Moving on to slide nine. Importantly, our total revenues and wireless service revenues which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues grew this quarter sequentially for the first time in nearly three years. This represents a 3% and 2% increase, respectively. 
The sequential growth was primarily achieved through the increase in prepaid revenues, resulting from the acquisition of Virgin Mobile and the continued growth of Boost Mobile subscribers, increased equipment revenues and the successful launch of Assurance Wireless, and the slowing revenue declines from post-paid subscriber losses and the iPCS acquisition. These benefits were partially offset by lower wholesale and affiliate revenues, mostly due to the transfer of Virgin Mobile and iPCS subscribers out of this category and lower wireline revenues.
Post-paid ARPU remained essentially flat at approximately $55. Compared to the fourth quarter, total post-paid data ARPU grew approximately 3% and CDMA post-paid data ARPU grew approximately 2%. Beginning this quarter, we are no longer disclosing ARPU data as it is depended on allocations of fixed-rate bundle service plans, which continue to increase in popularity.
To summarize, total revenues were up 3% over the last quarter driven primarily by the two acquisitions. Compared to last year, when revenues declined by 3%, due mostly to lower post-paid subscribers. Organically, revenues were stable sequentially.
Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $1.478 billion, up $69 million sequentially and down $245 million from the year ago. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved 60 basis points sequentially. Additionally, we saw year-over-year and sequential reductions in operating losses after interest.
Improvements in adjusted OIBDA margin and operating loss after interest were due mostly to revenue growth. As Yijing mentioned, we increased the valuation allowance for deferred taxes related to federal and state net operating loss carry forwards in the first quarter.
As we indicated in our 2009 10-K, our recent history of consecutive annual losses, we no longer recognize a net tax benefit from operating losses generated during the current period. As a result, we've recorded an increase valuation allowance of $365 million or $0.12 per share in the first quarter.
Moving on to slide 10. The prepaid contribution to the wireless segment improved sequentially, as we benefited from acquisition-related revenues as well as organic revenue growth from the continued success of the Boost Monthly Unlimited offer and Assurance Wireless.
We experienced approximately a $4 sequential decrease in prepaid ARPU due to a combination of the inclusion of lower ARPU Virgin Mobile customers for the full quarter and new customers from the launch of Assurance Wireless.
The Assurance Wireless business is gaining momentum with five states launched through the first quarter and many more to come throughout the year. While these customers have a lower ARPU, they are profitable and an important growth engine for our business.
With the upcoming relaunch of Virgin Mobile and other exciting announcements in the works, we expect prepaid ARPU to be flat to slightly up compared to the first quarter of 2010 for the remainder of 2010.
We also saw increased prepaid costs due to the inclusion of a full quarter of Virgin Mobile, the increased market in association with the launch of Boost Mobile on CDMA, as well as increased handset shipments. We expect that our prepaid group will continue to provide positive contribution to our wireless segment throughout 2010, while continuing to grow their prepaid subscriber base.
On the post-paid cost side, we saw improvements in the cost of service and net subsidy. Cost of service declined from the fourth quarter as a result of reductions in inter-company voice rates to reflect market pricing and lower affiliate roaming with the acquisition of iPCS.
Additionally, we continue to see favorable rates with our premium services providers offset by an increase in vendor fees due to our increased mix of smartphones. Post-paid net subsidy declines were mostly due to lower volume compared to the fourth quarter. We expect some rate pressure going forward from the continued growth in smartphones.
Wireline revenues decreased sequentially due to the inter-company voice rate declines reflecting market price declines and continued pressure in voice, data and IP. Cost of service improved mostly due to the mix of IP in the wireline base and rate changes helping OIBDA margin sequentially. We continue to expect moderate pressure on wireline results through the remainder of this year.
In summary, we are pleased with our revenue of OIBDA and free cash flow in the first quarter. Our general goal is to stabilize operations in 2010, which would be a significant improvement from reported trends we have experienced during the last few years. Remember that our revenue declined approximately $4 billion per year in 2008 and 2009. Stabilization of revenue in 2010 is very significant in Sprint's turnaround.
I will now turn it back to Yijing for Q&A.

So, our turnaround is really focused on both prepaid becoming a more and more important part of the company and doing better in that market. But also as you point out we are making improvements in the post-paid side. So prepaid has been growing nicely and that growth in prepaid has been quite frankly offsetting some of the decline in post-paid. What we hope to do is get post-paid growing again and prepaid growing robustly. So, I wouldn't say it's an either or. We expect both prepaid and post-paid performance to improve over time.

We now have to focus on maintaining, stabilizing the company, stabilizing the margins, stabilizing the cash, and being able to fund the upfront activities of things like 4G and all of that stuff in the new phone.

So there is no question that we are losing post-paid customers at a more rapid rate on iDEN than on CDMA. But we've also, of course, starting last year, we began to load that iDEN network up very effectively with cash producing, kind of profit producing prepaid customers and that's been an effective strategy. But also over time, what we're looking at and this has been reported. Again, the other thing I want to say is we continue to really focus on providing great service to our post-paid customers on iDEN, the network is performing at its best levels ever. And as I mentioned in my remarks, there is three new iDEN devices that we've introduced. But as a combination of post-paid and prepaid traffic or volumes come down, we will look at them with new technology. We can potentially use some of very small pieces of the freed up iDEN spectrum for CDMA and CDMA capacity and CDMA coverage. So we're beginning to look at that as well. Sprint Nextel has very, very strong spectrum assets if you look at what we have at 800, 900, 1900, 2.5 with Clearwire, and so there are a lot of alternatives that we can look at to get the best return on those investments.

So it's a variety of activities that we're involved in. So, for example, bundle plans, customers that are on bundle plans that get both voice and data, for example churn at a lower level; customers that that buy, we call smarter devices churn at a lower level.

Maybe a couple of questions, first on, just following up on the churn question, I guess one of the ways we've looked at it is, if you look at gross adds from two years ago, there is a high correlation and what happens with churn this quarter. And as we look at that over the course of 2010, go back to 2008, your gross add activity dropped off pretty down meaningfully. So I'm wondering is that the right way to think about the way churn can fall off over the course of this year. And the second question is just on margins. I think Bob in your prepared remarks, you talked about rate pressure going forward giving increasing gross adds and smartphones in the mix. Was this a comment on expectations for margin pressure and how should we think about that? Thanks.

There is basically a correlation with gross adds because, in fact, there was two buckets of customers that you have when you look at it from a churn point of view. You have on-contract customers that churn at a low rate and customers who are off-contract that churn at significantly higher rate on average. So we are focusing on improving on both, number one, getting more gross adds, which puts more or a higher percentage of our customer base on-contract that helps with churn. But we are also seeing improvements in off-contract churn, which kind of comes the hard way by just providing better customer service. And thinking of churn going forward, it's a combination of two things. It's the percentage of on-contract customers and that, of course, has been helping our competitors reduce their churn over the last few years as they've been driving a lot of gross adds, but then also improving off-contract churn, and we are making a lot of progress there as well.

On the network side and the outsourcing, we have transferred over a sizeable number of people into the outsourcing deal. Most of that has been those savings; the initial savings have been recognized, and it will continue to be a better deal for us as we don't have to do the additional heavy lifting on IP and stuff like that, which [I assume brings] to the party.

And we are still looking at all of our alternatives what I have mentioned earlier and we haven't reached decisions yet because there are a number of very promising technologies coming onboard that will make it more cost effective, if you will, to reaffirm spectrum and use it more efficiently across our various networks. But David, you are exactly right. One of the big benefits of doing that is to potentially reduce in-market roaming costs. With respect to the D Block, we support an auction of the D Block to promote competition in wireless broadband. So that's we have been kind of very, very clear and vocal in terms of our position on the D Block, and we would expect that to be auctioned at some point in the future.

In fact, you'll see our strategy is well beyond pricing. So I would also point out that there is some rationality in pricing piece of this market. I think you are seeing some formulary quite aggressive players like Page Plus actually beginning to take up their pricing in some of the unlimited space. On May 18, they'll take the pricing up from $35 to $40 for an unlimited package. So I think people are beginning to understand that if you look at different segments, there are obviously price points that are out there, but you can compete very effectively by providing the right value to meet the right needs of those segments.

So I think the integration, frankly, is going much better than any of us expected. I think a lot of that is because there is a great cultural fit between the Boost organization and the Virgin Mobile organization. Frankly, that cultural fit can be much better. So we formed the team. The team is now up operating, running quite efficiently. We did aggressively go after synergies. We cut almost one-third of the combined organization that was painful to go do, but we got through it quite quickly. We now have synergies that are not only well ahead of plan, but they are well ahead of plan, both in the amount that we've realized and in the timing as well. And as I mentioned, we've done that without losing any of the efficiency or productivity of the organization. In Q1, we hit all of our targets. Frankly, we exceeded most of them. And importantly, reversed a lot of the Q4 trends. We were losing share as we exited Q4, and if you normalize our share of gross adds, we actually gained slight share in the first quarter. So I think the other real important thing is we've been together now for four and a half months or so. We've got our strategy completely formulated. That strategy has been enthusiastically received by retailers, by handset manufacturers. And frankly, in the middle of this coming month in May, we will roll out a fully revamped Virgin Mobile proposition. We'll roll out another brand to address the pay-as-you-go segment, and by the end of the second quarter, we will be fully rolled out with our multi-brand strategy.

From what I can see on the economy that consumers are responding and coming back faster than business in terms of their attitudes and their buying behavior. Business customers are still taking a little longer than they once did, let's say, two years ago to make decisions. They are more thoughtful about adding cost back and they taking cost out. So I think over time when the recovery comes, you'll see business come back robustly. But we are seeing some signs that business is beginning to come back.

First of all, it's, obviously, quite nice to have owner's economics as opposed to MVNO economics. You can create, I think, very compelling value propositions, sort of backwards engineer your cost structure to make sure that you deliver exactly the financial return that you want to back into the corporation and yet still provide value propositions or a clearer design to win in the marketplace. And so I do think having owner's economics. But coming from a MVNO background, that looks at every single piece of the cost structure and knows that in pre-paid, it's really, Jacks or better in the poker game is to have a leaner cost structure possible. And so we've been able to utilize both having network owner's economics and that philosophy of really minimizing every single possible cost that you can have to create propositions that, one, you see out in the market, but, two, as I have mentioned, we'll introduce several new propositions within the next two to four weeks into the marketplace that I think will have very compelling value propositions. 
We are going to utilize both the iDEN and the CDMA network. I think the CDMA network, you are going to see us utilizing that more and more. Frankly, it provides depending on the segment that you are addressing, superior kind of data type of connectivity, especially for the revamped Virgin Mobile proposition. That's going to be a very important element of the proposition as we go after young, savvy consumers who are all about staying connected through advanced devices via social networking. And also, even on the Boost side, we just announced another couple of handsets on CDMA. I think actually on the Boost side, quite frankly, as we tend to utilize iDEN for push-to-talk functionality, this is a large segment that want that, but going on to CDMA getting a broader array of handsets, probably a better data experience has enabled us to compete very effectively in that Talk and Text segment without actually having to lower prices. I mean the demand is definitely there for Boost. It's just a matter of making sure we can supply all the handsets that we need to on that. So I'd say in general, Ric, we are going to be utilizing both of those networks depending on the segment that we are targeting. And I think we can provide very compelling value propositions and very attractive financial returns back to the company.

For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter. Then our CFO, Bob Brust, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter.
Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide two is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements.
We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.
Turning to slide #3; throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the second quarter can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today’s presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Next, I would like to cover our EPS results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the second quarter was $0.25 compared to $0.29 in the first quarter 2010 and $0.13 in the year-ago period.
Approximately, $0.10 of the second quarter 2010 loss per share was due to an increase in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, resulting from net operating loss carry forwards generated during the second quarter. The impact was about $0.12 in the first quarter. Bob will discuss this further in his remarks.
I will now turn the call over to Sprint CEO, Dan Hesse.

We grew total wireless subscribers by 111,000 in the",2375,"Thank you, Yijing and good morning and thanks for joining us so early on a summer day, especially those of you who might be on vacation.
As you can see from Slide #4, Sprint had a solid second quarter. We grew total wireless subscribers by 111,000 in the quarter, driven by Sprint’s best postpaid churn performance ever, and we’ve been in the wireless business for almost 14 years now.
Our efforts to improve the customer experience by being simple to do business with are paying off and like last quarter we can again report sequential stability in revenues, adjusted OIBDA and OIBDA margin and strong free cash flow.
As I do on each call, I will organize my comments along the lines of Sprint’s three consistent overarching objectives, improving the customer experience, strengthening the brand, and generating cash flow.
Please go to Slide #5. With respect to the customer experience, I am very pleased to report that we achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of improvement in customer care satisfaction and in first call resolution last quarter.
As a result of this 2.5 year company-wide obsession with improving the customer experience, the 2010 American Customer Satisfaction Index, which some of you may know as the comprehensive University of Michigan customer satisfaction study reported that over the past two years, Sprint has not only improved far more than any U.S. wireless carrier, but Sprint’s customer satisfaction has improved more in the past two years than any U.S. company in the survey from any industry.
The ACSI is not alone. Recently, I was invited to New York to keynote the Forrester’s Customer Experience Forum 2010 Conference in recognition of Sprint’s significant customer service improvements over the past year. In the Forrester Customer Experience Index, Sprint improved 15 points, while no other U.S. wireless carrier improved more than one point and Sprint’s improvement tied for the greatest improvement achievement of any U.S. company in any industry.
Also in the quarter, Sprint received the Gartner 1to1 Media CRM Excellence Award as one of five Gold medal winners. Gartner’s CRM Excellence Award honors outstanding organizations that use customer-focus strategies to improve their business performance.
In addition, the J.D. Power Wireless Business Satisfaction survey recognized Sprint recently as the only carrier to see its scores improve in the small/mid-size business category in each of the 2008, 2009 and 2010 surveys. Earlier this year, the Yankee Group recognized Sprint as the number one in voice satisfaction and number one in data satisfaction among large business customers.
Please go to Slide #6. Our internal metrics mirror these results. In the quarter, blocked calls on our network achieved an all-time best. In a well-known third-party survey, customers gave Sprint, our highest rating ever in network satisfaction.
For customer care, our overall top box customer satisfaction percentage hit yet another all-time high in the second quarter and our bottom box performance was also another all-time best.
We achieved yet another all-time best in the quarter with the fewest number of calls per customer to customer care ever. This is a win-win for us and for our customers as they prefer not to call us and if they don’t call, we can reduce our care costs.
Calls to care per customer were down 41% this June versus June 2007, and we have not been buying satisfaction by crediting a customer’s bill. Customer billed credits are down 46% year-over-year. The improvements in Sprint’s customer service levels over the past 10 quarters are truly remarkable and most importantly, this is borne out by our churn performance.
As I said, our postpaid churn achieved a best ever result this quarter of 1.85% and had it not been for the decommissioning of the Helio platform, which we acquired recently as part of the Virgin Mobile acquisition, any associated deactivations on that platform which we told you were coming in the second quarter and last quarter’s call, postpaid churn would have been only 1.78% this quarter.
We are making improvements in both voluntary and involuntary churn. Involuntary churn benefits because our percentage of postpaid customers that carry a prime credit rating remains at a robust 84%. Prepaid churn is also better post sequentially and year-over-year.
Turning to Slide #7, our customer experience improvements are helping to strength our brand, which is crucial to improving subscriber performance. According to a third-party brand data, Sprint was the only carrier to see a statistically significant improvement in its ‘Purchase Consideration’ and ‘Most Want to Investigate’ metrics sequentially in the second quarter.
Because the Sprint brand is strengthening, the number of Sprint-branded postpaid customers increased by a net positive 285,000 in the quarter, the number of contract customers choosing the Sprint brand is growing nicely.
When I say Sprint-branded, I am referring to customers who choose Sprint-branded services, which utilize our CDMA network. These are all retail postpaid customers on our CDMA network with the exception of Helio subscribers and customers using the Nextel-branded PowerSource dual-mode iDEN/CDMA devices.
Even though our Sprint-branded postpaid gross add year-over-year growth of 46% was the highest since 2001, you have perhaps also noticed that our marketing expenses have declined sequentially and year-over-year. The multi-year consistency and clarity of our messages allows our advertising spend to be more productive.
Please go to Slide #8. Our year-over-year postpaid for contract customer, net add improvement of 763,000 is yet another all-time best for Sprint. For the first half of the year, this represents an improvement of better than $1.4 million as compared to the first six months of last year. By contrast, AT&T and Verizon reported their fewest new contract customer additions in the second quarter in six years.
Going to slide #9, the sequential improvement in postpaid net adds is our best since 2002. Even though the EVO 4G launch helped, the strength of our broad handset portfolio and our across the board improvements were so significant that we would have achieved both positive total wireless net subscriber growth and Sprint brand postpaid subscriber growth without any help from EVO in the second quarter. Our improvements are foundational.
Sprint’s market share of new postpaid or contract customers also known as share of gross adds, or SoGA, based upon our best industry estimates, were up for the fourth consecutive quarter and up 560 basis points year-over-year, our largest year-over-year improvement on record. Sequentially and year-over-year, we are the only major wireless carrier improving SoGA or market share of new postpaid customers.
One way to measure the relative strength of your brand is to look at the trend in port-outs two-year competitors and port-ins from your competitors. How are you doing amongst switchers, if you will? Port-outs continue to get better as a percentage of our base and on an absolute basis, but even more noteworthy is the dramatic increase in customers porting in from our competitors.
Postpaid port-ins are up 84% year-over-year, but churn improvement was the most valuable contributor to our subscriber performance. The impact we’re getting from our brand anchor, simplicity embodied in our Any Mobile, Anytime and our 30-day guarantee offers is providing significant voluntary and involuntary churn benefits.
An excellent indicator of the impact of improved service level is off-contract churn, where there is not a financial penalty to leave. Off-contract churn last quarter was at the lowest level since the merger five years ago.
Because of our confidence in the improvements we’ve made to the customer experience, earlier this year we introduced the industry’s first full 30-day money back guarantee. Since we launched this guarantee, our churn or de-activation percentage in that first 30 days is actually lower or better than it was in 2008 or in 2009 before the money back guarantee. This is more hard evidence that the Sprint customer experience has improved.
The second quarter was a productive quarter for our prepaid brands. If you would go to Slide #10, we launched Common Cents into 700 Wal-Mart stores, re-launched Virgin Mobile, and we expanded Assurance Wireless into additional states.
Although we saw and expected decline in net adds sequentially due to seasonality, prepaid net add performance of 173,000 was in line with our internal plan. We did this in spite of a few short-term headwinds, including Boost inventory issues and delays in rolling out Assurance Wireless.
Churn continues to perform well and we anticipate further improvement as we look towards year end.
Assurance Wireless was available in seven states at the end of the quarter. We had hoped to launch Florida in the middle of the second quarter, but state approval was delayed until July due to opposition from various interested parties.
I am pleased to say that we are now officially launched in Florida and Louisiana and we expect to be in approximately 20 states by the end of the year.
We relaunched the Virgin Mobile brand with an innovative Beyond Talk proposition during the second quarter. Although announced in May, we were not fully rolled out to nearly 20,000 retail locations until the end of June. In retailers they previously sold Virgin Mobile and now sell our Beyond Talk offers, sales are up 20% plus post launch.
According to first quarter data from Nielsen pay-as-you-go customers are what we call basic communicators, make up 62% of the no-contract market. We launched Common Cents in 700 Wal-Mart stores in June and will expand to a total of 1,500 stores in August. Two weeks ago, we added payLo by Virgin Mobile as our pay-as-you-go offerings, which is targeted at basic communicators in retail channels other than Wal-Mart.
Boost Mobile was recently honored by the American Business Awards also known as the Stevies. Boost Mobile’s Unwronged campaign was recognized as the best technology ad in campaign and Boost Mobile won the Business Turnaround of the Year for organizations of up to 2,500 employees.
We continue to see good demand for Boost Unlimited, especially for CDMA devices. We have resolved inventory issues with Boost and we were fully stocked by the third week of June.
The results of all these actions and the launch of our multi-brand strategy position us for the remainder of the year. We continued to expect to make meaningful progress in our prepaid net add results in the second half of 2010 and we expect to see sequential improvement in the third quarter.
Sprint continues to focus on improving our environment. Sprint now has 21% of our wireless invoices being electronic versus paper and we were awarded the sustainability leadership award at the 2010 International Electronics Recycling Conference & Expo. We also launched two more green phones in the second quarter, the LG Remarq and the Samsung Restore.
Finally, with respect to cash in the bottom line, we can report once again sequential stability in revenue and in consolidated adjusted OIBDA and OIBDA margin. Our $709 million of free cash flow this quarter puts us at $1.2 billion in free cash flow for the first half of the year.
Regarding the second half of 2010, 4G will be an increasingly important element of our performance. So far, the HTC EVO 4G, pictured on slide #11, has exceeded our expectations, whether it’d be press or analyst reviews, sales demand or for its historic low return level. We wish we could get more devices and it’s an issue of HTC is working on.
We launched eight 4G markets in the second quarter, bringing us up to 51 million POPs. I get a lot of questions about Clearwire and about Sprint’s network RFP. On the topic of Clearwire, we have an advantage in the aligned ownership interests we share with the cable partners, Intel and Google and we benefit from the many contributions they have brought to the table and we benefit from the resale of 4G services.
We are supportive of Clearwire’s 2010 network build plan of up to a 120 million POPs and we will continue to explore with Clearwire and each of its partners, various network deployment strategies and financing options beyond 2010.
As in the past, any strategic or funding decisions about Clearwire must be a collective decision among the strategic investors and the Clearwire Board. Beyond that, we are not going to comment on the ongoing media speculation.
Regarding Sprint’s network, we are currently in the early stages of exploring network options with a multimodal technology for RFP. The primary objective of this RFP is to reduce operating costs, such as roaming, access, lease costs, power and maintenance. We expect the next evolution of our network will allow us to optimize our spectrum assets and will provide the opportunity for further network asset sharing with Clearwire.
This also provides investment protection by allowing us flexibility in the deployment of network technology standards. Our analysis to-date looks promising and we will share additional information when appropriate.
So in conclusion, the strong cash flow, stable revenue and OIBDA and widespread third-party recognition for the improvements we’re making in the customer experience, which in turn builds stronger brands and better subscriber performance. We are feeling that the intense work on these unwavering, overarching objectives for the past ten quarters is beginning to pay off.
Because of the improving trends Sprint is seeing, we are enhancing our forecast to say that we now expect to have positive total net wireless subscriber additions during the remainder of 2010 and fewer net postpaid subscriber losses in the second half of 2010 as compared to the first half. It is our goal that the number of Sprint brand postpaid customers continues to grow, and as I’ve said previously, we expect to see sequential improvement in prepaid net adds in the third quarter.
I was interviewed about our turnaround recently on National Public Radio. When asked how far along we are, I like into our turnaround to a baseball game, and I said we’re in the third inning. The first part of the game is to achieve stability. The middle third of the game is to achieve growth and the final innings of the game will be to achieve best-in-class performance in all aspects of our operations. We still have a lot of hard work ahead of us.
It’s now time to turn it over to Institutional Investor’s top telecom CFO, Bob Brust to take you through the numbers.

Moving on to slide #12, as Dan mentioned, we had another good quarter in terms of free cash flow, generating $709 million during the second quarter. This was up from $506 million in the first quarter, primarily due to seasonally lower interest payments and working capital benefits.
We expect to generate a meaningful level of positive free cash flow during the remainder of 2010.
We ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, down only slightly from the previous quarter after repaying $750 million note that came due in June of 2010. This was our only note maturity in 2010.
Looking ahead at debt maturities, we have $1.65 billion maturing in January of 2011 and $2.75 billion in 2012. We expect to pay the 2011 and 2012 maturities as scheduled without refinancing.
During the second quarter, we also entered into a new $2.1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will provide liquidity through 2013. The facility supports our re-banding letter of credit, which is now at $1.4 billion after the $160 million reduction we received earlier in July.
We expect to end 2010 with a strong cash balance in preparation for our January 2011 maturity payment. Our goal continues to be to maintain an average cash balance of approximately $4 billion.
Capital expenditures were $437 million in the second quarter compared to $419 million in the second quarter and $321 million in the second quarter of last year. We continue to spend an appropriate amount on CapEx, primarily in the areas of direct capability development and coverage. Over the previous three quarters, we added approximately 250 new CDMA cell sites. We still expect the full year 2010 capital spending will be up to $2 billion.
Moving on to Slide #13, we were pleased with the continued relative stabilization of revenue in the quarter. Total revenues and wireless service revenues, which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues, both declined by less than 1% sequentially.
The slight decline in revenue was primarily the result of lower postpaid revenues due to fewer postpaid subscribers and lower wireline revenues. This impact was partially offset by the increase in prepaid revenues due to the increased base of prepaid subscribers.
Importantly wireless service revenue was also relatively stable year-over-year, a strong improvement compared to the 9% year-over-year decline we reported for the second quarter of 2009. This improvement was due primarily to our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions and better subscriber results over the last four quarters as compared to the four-quarter period ended second quarter of 2009.
For the first half of 2010, total net operating revenues declined approximately 1.5% as compared to the first half of 2009, whereas last year we saw a year-over-year decline of about 11%.
Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $1.501 billion up $23 million sequentially and down $268 million from a year-ago. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved 40% basis points sequentially. Additionally, we saw year-over-year and sequential reduction in operating losses after interest.
As Yijing mentioned, we increased the valuation allowance for deferred taxes related to federal and state operating loss carry forwards in the second quarter.
As we indicated during our first quarter call with our recent history of consecutive annual losses, we no longer recognize a net tax benefit from operating losses generated during the current period.
As a result, we recorded an increased valuation allowance of $302 million or $0.10 per share for the quarter. We expect that for the full year 2010, we will record a net tax expense of approximately 7% to 9% on pre-tax loss due primarily to taxable temporary differences associated with our spectrum.
Moving on to Slide #14, adjusted OIBDA was stable sequentially, primarily due to SG&A cost improvements and stabilizing net operating revenue results. On the postpaid cost side, we saw sequential improvements in SG&A expenses, driven by lower marketing program and sponsorship spend, as well as lower customer care expenses.
Cost of service was up slightly as compared to the first quarter, due primarily to the higher roaming costs driven by seasonality. Postpaid subsidy expense was higher sequentially, driven by higher average subsidy per handset sold. We continue to expect some rate pressure going forward from the ongoing growth in smartphone sales.
The prepaid contribution to the Wireless segment improved sequentially, due to the increased pace of Boost Monthly Unlimited and Assurance Wireless subscribers. Prepaid also benefited from lower subsidy expense in the quarter.
Prepaid ARPU improved by approximately $1 sequentially as a result of the continued popularity of Boost Unlimited. We expect prepaid ARPU to be relatively flat for the remainder of 2010 as compared to the second quarter of 2010.
Wireline contribution to adjusted OIBDA was relatively stable sequentially as the revenue decline was mostly offset by a decline in SG&A. Revenue was lower primarily due to lower voice volume. We continue to expect moderate pressure on our wireline results for the remainder of the year.
Overall, we are pleased to report a second consecutive quarter of improved adjusted OIBDA and adjusted OIBDA margins. However, seasonality typically drives higher third quarter cost of service expenses, including roaming and service and repair. In addition, a continued strengthening of gross adds will pressure third quarter costs.
I will remind you that over the past two years, we have seen an average sequential decline in adjusted OIBDA of approximately 14% from the second quarter to the third quarter. While we have stabilized our revenue trends, the improvement we have seen in gross adds along with items that I just talked about will likely result in a sequential decline in adjusted OIBDA.
In summary, the stabilization and eventual growth of revenue continues to be the primary focus of the company. And we are pleased that our results through the first half of the year have demonstrated progress towards that goal. Our stable second quarter adjusted OIBDA results and strong liquidity position also offer us confidence as we look ahead to the remainder of 2010.
Now, I’ll turn it back over to Yijing for Q&A.

A couple of questions, maybe first on churn. Really good progress this quarter, and seems like if we step back here, industry switching activity in the quarter is on the decline which happened despite several device refreshes across the competitive landscape. So how should we think about the ability to further improve the churn metrics? It seems like you still have really an opportunity.
And then second on the margins, as we step back, stronger quarter on gross adds. I think that many people expected this quarter along with relatively high upgrade percentages, it’s still upgrade to 9% at the base. So again, two metrics that we usually pressure margin that you still delivered on decent margin improvement.
Bob, I heard your comments on seasonally higher expenses in 3Q, but it seems like the magnitude of sequential decline shouldn’t be anywhere near what we’ve seen historically and this might actually be a decent run rate going forward, if you can just comment on that.

I’ll take the first item in terms of continued churn improvement. Even though we’ve made, and I keep telling the team as well, we’ve made these dramatic improvements in terms of customer satisfaction, care, retail, pretty much at every touch point. We still are not the best-in-class from an absolute point of view at every single touch point. So we still have improvements to make.
As you know, our two major competitors; if you take the big four, we’re now three from a churn point of view. Two are better. So we have a lot of aggressive internal targets to continue to improve our churn performance. There is also a lag, if you will, at brand with respect to the improvements in customer service. What we’re hoping is over time as more people know and understand and see third-party verification after-third party verification after-third party verification, these are non-customers or potentially ex-customers because that’s where we really still have a lot of work to do.
If you will take a look at strength of our brand, Sprint customers, the improvement in what we call MWI scores, purchase consideration scores are just up dramatically because of course they have experience with Sprint over the last two years. We still need a lot of good work to get that message across the people who have never been our customers or quite frankly may have been passed Sprint customers a long time ago.
And so I think there is an opportunity to as they begin to understand that the Sprint of today is very different than the Sprint of a few years ago, I think that gives us even more opportunity to improve churn. So I think there is a lot of momentum as you know that goes with brands and we feel as though we have a lot of it right now and we hope it continues.

On your question on margins, the last few years the seasonality in the third quarter has to do with higher roaming with the summer travel with cost to service and things like that and in the past two years ‘08 and ‘09 that was coupled with a difficult reduction in volume of 8% or 9% a quarter from the preceding year. This year we’re in a little different game. Revenue was more stable. So that won’t have the same effect, but we do expect to have the same seasonality in roaming, cost of service, and a continuation of pressure from gross adds. So it should go down a little bit. We’re not going to give any guidance as any percentage or anything, but there will be increased pressure in the third quarter.

If you look at the postpaid CDMA and you normalize for the one-time disconnects of Helio. Does that mean that the net adds in CDMA were over 200,000?
And then secondly, just taking a step back, how would you rate your ability to manage ARPU? I realize that you stopped disclosing some of the data ARPUs because of your bundles, but how do you think your bundles are doing at upselling customers versus the risk of people pricing down over time or just simply the competitive environment putting some pressure on it?

The first is, when you really think of Sprint brand net adds that was a positive 285,000 postpaid for the quarter, and if you take a look at the CDMA number, you have two things that are the difference. One is Helio and t",414,"Mike, let me take both questions. The first is, when you really think of Sprint brand net adds that was a positive 285,000 postpaid for the quarter, and if you take a look at the CDMA number, you have two things that are the difference. One is Helio and the other is, its Nextel-branded service called PowerSource, which is really a dual-mode iDEN/CDMA, and we count those and you have to choose whether the content is iDEN subs or CDMA subs, we throw them in there with the CDMA sub.
So the way we look at it when we talk about how Sprint is doing, how Sprint’ offers are doing, how the Sprint’s brand is doing, we look at Sprint brand and that would be a positive net postpaid adds in the quarter of 285,000. The second issue is really around bundles. Net-net if you take a look at the overall business case, the overall top line and bottom line performance, our bundles have been quite successful, particularly Any Mobile, Anytime, which is what you are seeing advertised now. You have a few puts and takes, and I think you put your finger on a few of them.
On the one hand, it’s doing better than we expected and doing very well at acquiring new customers on the gross add side. It’s really overperforming very well on the churn side and so we see the churn very, very strong, both voluntary and involuntary churn, while the customers who have bundle plans also it’s reducing calls to care very significant, which is another cost advantage to us. But with it there is some ARPU pressure as customers do, if you will, they might have been buying à la carte or have a larger bundle plan they move down to a, what we call, it a lower ARPU bundle plan. So there is some ARPU dilution.
So if you look at customer lifetime value where the most improvement driver of profit or value is churn, give that a checkmark, a big plus. We have a ARPU is a negative; cost reduction on calls to care is a positive and of course, it helps on the revenue side and that we’re acquiring, and that’s a piece of our growth and performance improvement in gross adds that we’ve been talking about. So net-net overall, it’s exceeding our business case, it’s doing very well, but you’re right, it does pressure ARPU even though it does improve our overall profitability.

Now, a combination of the economy improving and all of a sudden some real increased customer demand for these high-end devices is putting some strain on the supply chain.

Trends in the second quarter, as you can imagine, we announced the rollout in the middle of the quarter, we were done really rolling out the majority of the multi-brand strategy by the end of the second quarter. So from a gross add perspective, we had a very nice trend line coming out of the quarter, with June being by far and away, the highest gross add month for prepaid in the quarter.

I mean it’s probably easiest to remember the last one and move back. With respect to credit, no, as I mentioned that we continue to maintain a very strong, solid, high credit rating 84% prime in our postpaid base. Obviously, there it’s more than credit score, when you look at customers in CLV and what have you, there is what we call pre-prime and prime. So there is more science to it than being that simple, but that’s really the best litmus test. So no, we still are maintaining a very rigid focus on profitability. This company, as you know, got into some financial trouble years ago by being too generous. So we watch it very closely.
But as I mentioned earlier on voluntary and involuntary, what we’re finding is that our bundle plans provide both prime and subprime customers with so much more predictability that we actually can improve our involuntary churn of subprime customers by putting them on kind of value-oriented bundle plans that then they become profitable customers for us. So, this is around profitability, not just a magic credit score. So I think over time we can gradually, if you will, be very selective and scientific about loosening credit if we get them on the right plan with that kind of predictability, and as also of course, we’ve got prepaid.
So, we have a number in a very strong business that looks at a lot of different segment. So, I think we have right portfolio of brands, both postpaid and prepaid, to address really any kind of economic situation the customer might be in. So it’s a long way of saying no, as gross adds growth coming from relaxed credit scores, the answer is no. With the AT&T and Verizon, you’ll have to ask them, and by the way, if they tell you, will you call me? I’ll appreciate that.
Last question was with respect to the iPhone 4, let’s face it that I would not be perfectly honest with you if I didn’t say, every time Apple announces a new phone that there is not an impact in the market that we don’t all feel it. But I think what we’ve done in the last few years is we’ve mitigated the size of that impact versus previous years by having our own plan and handsets, the Instinct helped us in ‘08, the Pre helped us in ‘09, the EVO will help us this year to mitigate that, but we like all. I think the major competitors of AT&T do feel it when there is a new iPhone out there.

In Clearwire, we get some valuable partners; Intel, Google, the cable companies and stuff like that. So the valuation issue, we do not consolidate that in our operations other than equity accounting, which is around 54% now and as that thing is in its build out mode, it’s a tough valuation issue, because they were losing a fair amount of money. So that will become an easier discussion as time goes on and the various partners determine how to handle this thing in the coming years. So that valuation should approve over time as their operations improve and we’ll see how that plays out.

Typically second quarter for all prepaid carriers is slowest. Usually churn is higher, sort of the mirror reflection of what is a strong fourth quarter, typically six months later you see the churn impact of that and always gross adds are seasonally lower in Q2. Q4 is the highest, Q1 the next highest, then Q3, than Q2. I think we’ll tend to see improved churn. I was very pleased with churn in the second quarter. It is actually lower than the first quarter and that should continue as we look forward. Part of that is mix, part of that is just improved real performance as a result of the value that we have out in the marketplace.
In terms of gross adds as Dan mentioned and Bob did, we come out of the second quarter very well positioned. All of our brands are out there as Dan mentioned, we are seeing a very strong lift as a result of the new Virgin Mobile versus what we had out in retail, anywhere between 20% to 30% lift. Some retailers are even higher than that. Assurance is doing extremely well and the more states we get into, the better that will continue to perform for us.
As Dan mentioned, Common Cents will be doubling in size from its initial roll-out into Wal-Mart and as you may have seen we are putting in payLo by Virgin Mobile into about 40,000 retail locations that will be primarily Drug/Convenience, Family Dollar, or Kmart that kind of thing to go after the basic communicators outside of Wal-Mart. So in general, we should expect to see and we believe we’ll see strong sequential improvement in net adds in the back half of the year and we should start to see that in the third quarter specifically as well.

As I mentioned earlier, kind of the real key for us has been not only the kind of the brand and service improvements, but we see differences in churn or we’re actually looking at it very scientifically on rate plan and on handsets, and in devices. As we get more granular, you understand what rate plans I mentioned Any Mobile, Anytime is having very low churn. The same with devices; certain devices have very high customer satisfaction, very low churn.
As we get better and better, we’re going to continue to focus on those, and as I mentioned as well, the brand is something that there is a lag and there is momentum to and it builds over time, and that’s why things like most one we investigate and we look at other things in terms of net promoter scores and what have you, are very important. Those trend lines are moving in the right direction sequentially year-over-year, et cetera. You mentioned port-ins, that is where we look at every Monday, we have a meeting and we look at port-ins versus port-outs between us and every competitor, and I feel very good about the way those trend lines have been moving. As you can imagine, a year-ago, two years ago, there were pretty ugly discussions on Monday, and they’ve been improving.
So that is, and as you know, there are fewer adds to go out there, new gross adds coming into the postpaid world than there has been traditionally. So you have to very much look at the porting trends between carriers, so that’s a real good litmus test with respect to the strength of your brand. So where we want to go of course is, I’ve told the team, I hope never to see a two spot again, that’s our goal. I can’t commit to that and I am not providing guidance clearly in that regard, but I’d hope never to see that again in the postpaid world.
Our improvement in gross adds is, well, will help our churn long term, because as I mentioned earlier, even though we’ve made a lot of improvements in off-contract churn, very significant improvements in off-contract churn. On-contract churn is a lot lower than off-contract churn. So we need to get more customers on contract and have better gross add performance than we’ve had traditionally. So this 560 basis point improvement in share gross adds will also help over time on the churn side.
So in conclusion, there is a whole lot of stuff we’re working on. As a matter of fact, John Carney, who is our Senior Vice President of Marketing, every week he heads up what we call a churn task force which is comprehensive across the company. We review it as a senior team. Every week we go through it. There is lot’s to it. The low-hanging fruit is gone. Now it’s really hard work getting the next basis point or 2 basis points or 5 basis point improvement. We’re just going to keep working to get it lower.

We will continue to monitor the situation, but so much of our brand, what we’re showing is, customers will pay a premium of simplicity. Our bundle plans and our simple plans are helping us in churn, are helping our brand, so we won’t take the decision lightly to move away from our current structure to something as you’re discussing around tiering. So I’m not excluding it as a future possibility, but we currently have no plans to do that and see no need currently to move in that direction.

As you can see from Slide 4, Sprint had a solid second quarter. We grew total wireless subscribers by 111,000 in the quarter, driven by Sprint's best postpaid churn performance ever. And we've been in the Wireless business for almost 14 years now. Our efforts to improve the customer experience by being simple to do business with are paying off. And like last quarter, we can, again, report sequential stability in revenues, adjusted OIBDA and OIBDA margin and strong free cash flow. 
As I do on each call, I will organize my comments along the lines of Sprint's three consistent overarching objectives: Improving the customer experience, strengthening the brand and generating cash flow.
Please go to Slide 5. With respect to the customer experience, I'm very pleased to report that we achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of improvement in customer care satisfaction and in first call resolution last quarter. As a result of this two and a half year, company-wide obsession with improving the customer experience, the 2010 American Customer Satisfaction Index, which some of you may know as the comprehensive University of Michigan customer satisfaction study, reported that over the past two years, Sprint has not only improved far more than any U.S. wireless carrier, but Sprint's customer satisfaction has improved more in the past two years than any U.S. company in the survey from any industry, period. 
And the ACSI is not alone. Recently, I was invited to New York to keynote the Forrester Customer Experience Forum 2010 Conference in recognition of Sprint's significant customer service improvements over the past year. In the Forrester Customer Experience Index, Sprint improved 15 points while no other U.S. wireless carrier improved more than one point. And Sprint's improvement tied for the greatest improvement achievement of any U.S. company in any industry.
Also in the quarter, Sprint received the Gartner 1 to 1 Media CRM Excellence Award as one of the five gold medal winners. Gartner's CRM excellence award honors outstanding organizations that use customer-focused strategies to improve their business performance. 
In addition, the J.D. Power Wireless business satisfaction survey recognized Sprint recently as the only carrier to see its scores improve in the small, mid-sized business category in each of the 2008, 2009 and 2010 surveys. And earlier this year, the Yankee Group recognized Sprint as the number one invoice satisfaction and number one in data satisfaction among large business customers.
Please go to Slide 6. Our internal metrics mirror these results. In the quarter, blocked calls on our network achieved an all-time best. In a well-known third-party survey, customers gave Sprint our highest rating ever in network satisfaction. Per customer care, our overall top box customer satisfaction percentage hit, yet, another all-time high in the second quarter. And our bottom box performance was also another all-time best. 
We achieved yet another all-time best in the quarter, with the fewest number of calls per customer to customer care ever. This is a win-win for us and for our customers, as they prefer not to call us, and if they don't call, we can reduce our care costs. Calls to care per customer were down 41% this June versus June 2007. And we have not been buying satisfaction by crediting the customer's bill. Customer bill credits are down 46% year-over-year. 
The improvements in Sprint's customer service levels over the past 10 quarters are truly remarkable.  And most importantly, this is borne out by our churn performance. As I said, our postpaid churn achieved a best ever result this quarter of 1.85%. And had it not been for the decommissioning of the Helio platform, which we acquired recently as part of the Virgin Mobile acquisition, any associated deactivations on that platform, which we told you were coming in the second quarter on last quarter's call, postpaid churn would have been only 1.78% this quarter. 
We're making improvements in both voluntary and involuntary churn. Involuntary churn benefits because our percentage of postpaid customers that carry a prime credit rating remains at a robust 84%. Prepaid churn is also better, both sequentially and year-over-year.
Turning to Slide 7. Our customer experience improvements are helping to strengthen our brand, which is crucial to improving subscriber performance. According to third-party brand data, Sprint was the only carrier to see a statistically significant improvement in its purchase consideration and most want to investigate metrics sequentially in the second quarter. Because the Sprint brand is strengthening, the number of Sprint-branded postpaid customers increased by a net positive 285,000 in the quarter. The number of contract customers choosing the Sprint brand is growing nicely. When I say Sprint-branded, I'm referring to customers who choose Sprint-branded services, which utilize our CDMA network. These are all retail postpaid customers on our CDMA network, with the exception of Helio subscribers and customers using the Nextel-branded power source dual mode iDEN CDMA devices. 
Even though our Sprint-branded postpaid gross adds year-over-year growth of 46% was the highest since 2001, yet perhaps also noticed that our marketing expenses have declined sequentially and year-over-year. The multi-year consistency and clarity of our messages allows our advertising spend to be more productive.
Please go to Slide 8. Our year-over-year postpaid for contract customer net add improvement of 763,000 is yet another all-time best for Sprint. For the first half of the year, this represents an improvement of better than 1.4 million as compared to the first six months of last year. By contrast, AT&T and Verizon reported their fewest new contract customer additions in the second quarter in six years. 
Going to Slide 9, the sequential improvement in postpaid net adds is our best since 2002. Even though the EVO 4G launch helped, the strength of our broad handset portfolio and our across-the-board improvements were so significant, that we would have achieved both positive total wireless net subscriber growth and Sprint brand postpaid subscriber growth without any help from EVO in the second quarter. Our improvements are foundational. 
Sprint's market share of new postpaid or contract customers, also known as share of gross adds or SOGA, based upon our best industry estimates were up for the fourth consecutive quarter and up 560 basis points year-over-year, our largest year-over-year improvement on record. Sequentially, and year-over-year, we are the only major wireless carrier improving SOGA for market share of new postpaid customers.
One way to measure the relative strength of your brand is to look at the trend in port outs to your competitors and port ins from your competitors, how you're doing among switchers, if you will. Port outs continue to get better as a percentage of our base and on an absolute basis, but even more noteworthy is the dramatic increase in customers porting in from our competitors. Postpaid port ins are up 84% year-over-year. 
The churn improvement was the most valuable contributor to our subscriber performance. The impact we're getting from our brand anchor, simplicity embodied in our Any Mobile, Anytime and our 30-day guarantee offers is providing significant voluntary and involuntary churn benefits, an excellent indicator of the impact of approved service levels is off-contract churn, where there is not a financial penalty to leave. Off-contract churn last quarter was at the lowest level since the merger five years ago. Because of our confidence in the improvements we've made to the customer experience, earlier this year, we introduced the industry's first full 30-day money-back guarantee. Since we launched this guarantee, our churn or deactivation percentage in that first 30 days is actually lower or better than it was in 2008 or in 2009 before the money-back guarantee. This is more hard evidence that the Sprint customer experience has improved.
The second quarter was a productive quarter for our prepaid brands. If you would go to Slide 10, we launched Common Cents into 700 Wal-Mart stores, relaunched Virgin Mobile and we expanded Assurance Wireless into additional states. Although we saw an expected decline in net adds sequentially due to seasonality, prepaid net add performance of 173,000 was in line with our internal plan. We did this in spite of a few short-term headwinds, including Boost inventory issues and delays in rolling out Assurance Wireless. Churn continues to perform well, and we anticipate further improvement as we look towards year end. 
Assurance Wireless was available in seven states at the end of the quarter. We had hoped to launch Florida in the middle of the second quarter, but state approval was delayed until July, due to opposition from various interested parties. I am pleased to say that we are now officially launched in Florida and Louisiana, and we expect to be in approximately 20 states by the end of the year.
We relaunched the Virgin Mobile brand with innovative Beyond Talk proposition during the second quarter. Although announced in May, we were not fully rolled out to nearly 20,000 retail locations  until the end of June. In retailers that previously sold Virgin Mobile and now sell our Beyond Talk offers, sales are up 20-plus percent post launch. 
According to first quarter data from Nielsen, pay-as-you-go customers, or what we call basic communicators, make up 62% of the no-contract market. We launched Common Cents in 700 Wal-Mart stores in June and will expand to a total of 1500 stores in August. Two weeks ago, added payLo by Virgin Mobile as our pay-as-you-go offerings, which is targeted at basic communicators and retail channels other than Wal-Mart. 
Boost Mobile was recently honored by the American Business Awards, also known as the Stevie's [Stevie Awards]. Boost Mobile's Unwronged campaign was recognized as the best technology ad and campaign and Boost Mobile won the business turnaround of the year for organizations above the 2500 employees. We continue to see good demand for Boost Unlimited, especially for CDMA devices. We have resolved inventory issues with Boost, and we were fully stocked by the third week of June. 
The results of all these actions and the launch of our multi-brand strategy position us for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect to make meaningful progress in our prepaid net add results in the second half of 2010. And we expect to see sequential improvement in the third quarter.
Sprint continues to focus on improving our environment. Sprint now has 21% of our wireless invoices being electronic versus paper. And we were awarded the Sustainability Leadership Award at the 2010 International Electronics Recycling Conference & Expo. We also launched two more green phones in the second quarter, the LG Remarq and the Samsung Restore. 
And finally, with respect to cash in the bottom line, we can report once again sequential stability and revenue and in consolidated adjusted OIBDA and OIBDA margin. Our $709 million of free cash flow this quarter puts us at $1.2 billion free cash flow for the first half of the year.
Regarding the second half of 2010, 4G will be an increasingly important element of our performance. So far, the HTC EVO 4G pictured on Slide 11 has exceeded our expectations, whether it be press or analysts reviews, sales demand or for its historic lower churn [ph] level. We wish we could get more devices and it's an issue HTC is working on. We launched eight 4G markets in the second quarter bringing us up to 51 million pops.
I get a lot of questions about Clearwire and about Sprint's network, RFP. On the topic of Clearwire, we have an advantage in the aligned ownership interests we share with the cable partners, Intel and Google. And we benefit from the many contributions they have brought to the table and we benefit from the resale of 4G services. We are supportive of Clearwire's 2010 network build plan of up to 120 million pops. And we will continue to explore with Clearwire and each of its partners' various network deployment strategies and financing options beyond 2010. As in the past, any strategic or funding decisions about Clearwire must be a collective decision among the strategic investors and the Clearwire board. Beyond that, we are not going to comment on the ongoing media speculation. 
Regarding Sprint's network, we are currently in the early stages of exploring network options with a  multimodal technology RFP. The primary objective of this RFP is to reduce operating costs, such as roaming, access, lease costs, power and maintenance. We expect the next evolution of our network will allow us to optimize our spectrum assets and will provide the opportunity for further network asset sharing with Clearwire. This also provides investment protection, by allowing us flexibility in the deployment of network technology standards. Our analysis to date looks promising. And we will share additional information when appropriate. 
So in conclusion, the strong cash flow, stable revenue and OIBDA and widespread third-party recognition for the improvements we're making in customer experience, which in turn builds stronger brands and better subscriber performance. We are feeling that the intense work on these unwavering overarching objectives for the past quarters is beginning to pay off. Because of the improving trends Sprint is seeing, we are enhancing our forecast to say that we now expect to have positive total net wireless subscriber additions during the remainder of 2010 and fewer net postpaid subscriber losses in the second half of 2010 as compared to the first half. It is our goal that the number of Sprint brand postpaid customers continues to grow, and as I said previously, we expect to see sequential improvement in prepaid net adds in the third quarter. 
I was interviewed about our turnaround recently on National Public Radio. When asked how far along we are, I likened our turnaround to a baseball game. And I said we're in the third inning. The first third of the game is to achieve stability. The middle third of the game is to achieve growth. And the final innings of the game will be to achieve best-in-class performance in all aspects of our operations. We still have a lot of hard work ahead of us. 
It is now time to turn it over to institutional investors' top telecom CFO, Bob Brust, to take you through the numbers."

This was up from $506 million in the first quarter, primarily due",1009,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to Slide 12. As Dan mentioned, we had another good quarter in terms of free cash flow, generating $709 million during the second quarter. This was up from $506 million in the first quarter, primarily due to seasonally lower interest payments and working capital benefits. We expect to generate a meaningful level of positive free cash flow during the remainder of 2010. We ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, down only slightly from the previous quarter after repaying the $715 million note that came due in June of 2010. This was our only note maturity in 2010.
Looking ahead at debt maturities, we have $1.65 billion maturing in January of 2011 and $2.75 billion in 2012. We expect to pay the 2011 and 2012 maturities as scheduled without refinancing.  During the second quarter, we also entered into a new $2.1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will provide liquidity through 2013. The facility supports our rebanding letter of credit, which is now at $1.4 billion after the $160 million reduction we received earlier in July. We expect to end 2010 with a strong cash balance in preparation for our January 2011 maturity payment. Our goal continues to be, to maintain an average cash balance of approximately $4 billion.
Capital expenditures were $437 million in the second quarter, compared to $419 million in the first quarter and $321 million in the second quarter of last year. We continue to spend an appropriate amount on CapEx primarily in the areas of data capability, development and coverage. Over the previous three quarters, we added approximately 250 new CDMA cell sites. We still expect the full year 2010 capital spending will be up to $2 billion.
Moving on to Slide 13. We were pleased with the continued relative stabilization of revenue in the quarter. Total revenues in wireless service revenues which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues, both declined by less than 1% sequentially. The slight decline in revenue was primarily the result of lower postpaid revenues due to fewer postpaid subscribers and lower wireline revenues. This impact was partially offset by the increase in prepaid revenues, due to the increased space of prepaid subscribers. 
Importantly, wireless service revenue was also relatively stable year-over-year, a strong improvement compared to the 9% year-over-year decline we reported for the second quarter of 2009. This improvement was due primarily to our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions and better subscriber results over the last four quarters, as compared to the four-quarter period ended second quarter of 2009. 
For the first half of 2010, total net operating revenues declined approximately 1.5% as compared to the first half of 2009. Whereas last year, we saw a year-over-year decline of about 11%. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $1.501 billion, up $23 million sequentially and down $268 million  from a year ago. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved 40 basis points sequentially. Additionally, we saw year-over-year and sequential reductions in operating losses after interest. 
As Yijing mentioned, we increased the valuation allowance for deferred taxes related to federal and state operating loss carryforwards in the second quarter. As we indicated during our first quarter call, with our recent history of consecutive annual losses, we no longer recognize a net-tax benefit from operating losses generated during the current period. As a result, we recorded an increased valuation allowance of $302 million or $0.10 per share for the quarter. We expect that for the full year 2010, we will record a net tax expense of approximately 7% to 9% on pretax loss due primarily to taxable temporary differences associated with our spectrum.
Moving on to Slide 14. Adjusted OIBDA was stable sequentially, primarily due to SG&A cost improvements and stabilizing net operating revenue results. On the postpaid cost side, we saw sequential improvements in SG&A expenses, driven by lower marketing program and sponsorship spend, as well as lower customer care expenses. Cost of service was up slightly as compared to the first quarter, due primarily to the higher roaming costs driven by seasonality. Postpaid subsidy expense was higher sequentially, driven by higher average subsidy per handset sold. 
We continue to expect some rate pressure going forward from the ongoing growth in smartphone sales. The prepaid contribution to the Wireless segment improved sequentially, due to the increased space of Boost Monthly Unlimited and Assurance Wireless subscribers. Prepaid also benefited from lower subsidy expense in the quarter. Prepaid ARPU improved by approximately $1 sequentially, as a result of the continued popularity of Boost Unlimited. We expect prepaid ARPU to be relatively flat for the remainder of 2010 as compared to the second quarter of 2010. 
Wireline contribution to adjusted OIBDA was relatively stable sequentially, as the revenue decline was mostly offset by a decline in SG&A. Revenue was lower primarily due to lower voice volume. We continue to expect moderate pressure on wireline results for the remainder of the year. 
Overall, we are pleased to report a second consecutive quarter of improved adjusted OIBDA and adjusted OIBDA margins. However, seasonality typically drives higher third quarter costs of service expenses, including roaming, service and repair. In addition, a continued strengthening of gross adds will pressure third quarter cost.  
I will remind you that over the past two years, we have seen an average sequential decline in adjusted OIBDA of approximately 14% from the second quarter to the third quarter. While we have stabilized our revenue trends, the improvement we have seen in gross adds, along with items that I just talked about, will likely result in a sequential decline in adjusted OIBDA. 
In summary, the stabilization and eventual growth of revenue continues to be the primary focus of the company. And we are pleased that our results through the first half of the year have demonstrated progress toward that goal. Our stable second quarter adjusted OIBDA results and strong liquidity position also offer us confidence as we look ahead to the remainder of 2010. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Yijing for Q&A."

Even though we've made -- and I keep telling the team as well, we've made these dramatic improvements in terms of customer satisfaction: Care, retail, pretty much in every touch point. We still are not the best in class from an absolute point of view at every single touch point. So we still have improvements to make, and as you know, our two major competitors, if you take the big four, we're now three. From a churn point of view, two or better. So we have a lot of aggressive internal targets to continue to improve our churn performance. And there's also a lag, if you will with brand with respect to the improvements in customer service. So what we're hoping is over time, as more people know and understand and see third party verification after third party verification after third party verification, these are non-customers or potentially ex-customers, because that's where we really still have a lot of work to do. If you were to take a look at the strength of our brand, Sprint customers, the improvement in what we call, MWI scores, purchase consideration scores, are just up dramatically because, of course, they have experience with Sprint over the last two years. We still need a lot of good work to get that message across to people who have never been our customers or quite frankly, may have been past Sprint customers a long time ago. And so I think there's an opportunity to as they begin to understand that the Sprint of today is very different from the Sprint of a few years ago. I think that gives us even more opportunity to improve churn. So I think there's a lot of momentum, as you know, that goes with brands.

The first is when you really think of Sprint brand net adds, that was a positive 285,000 postpaid for the quarter. And what we take out there is what -- if you take a look at the CDMA number, you have two things that are the difference. One is Helio, and the other is, it's Nextel-branded service called PowerSource, which is really a dual-mode iDEN CDMA. And we count those -- and you have to choose whether you'd count them as iDEN subs or CDMA subs, which roam in there with the CDMA subs. So the way we look at it, when we talk about how Sprint is doing, how Sprint's offers are doing, how the Sprint's brand is doing. We look at Sprint brand and that would be a positive net postpaid adds in the quarter of 285,000. The second issue is really around bundles. And net-net, if you take a look at the overall business case, the over all top line and bottom line performance, our bundles have been quite successful, particularly Any Mobile Anytime, which is what you're seeing advertised now. And you have a few puts and takes. And I think you put your finger on a few of them. On the one had, it's doing better than we expected and doing very well at acquiring new customers on the gross add side. It's really over performing very well on the churn side. And so we see the churn very, very strong, both voluntary and involuntary churn. We'll have customers who bundled plans, also which reducing calls to care very significant, which is another cost advantage to us. But with it, there is some ARPU pressure as customers do, if you will, they might have been buying a la carte, or have a larger bundle plan. They moved down to a -- we call a lower-ARPU bundled plan. So there is some ARPU dilution. So if you look -- we'd look at customer lifetime value, where the most important driver of profit or value is churn, give that a checkmark, a big plus. We have a -- ARPU is a negative. Cost reduction on calls to care is a positive. And of course, it helps on the revenue side and that we're acquiring. And it's a piece of our growth and performance improvement gross adds that we've been talking about. So net-net overall, it's exceeding our business case. It's doing very well. But you're right, it does pressure ARPU even though it does improve our overall profitability."

With respect to credit, no. As I mentioned, that we continue to maintain a very strong solid high credit rating, 84% prime in our postpaid base. We do, obviously, you know it's more than credit score. When you look at customers and CLV and what have you, there is what we call pretty prime and prime. So there's more science to it than being that simple. But that's really the best litmus test. So no, we have, we still are maintaining a very rigid focus on profitability. This company, as you know, got into some financial trouble years ago by being too generous. So we watch it very, very closely. But as I mentioned earlier on voluntary and involuntary, what we're finding is that our bundled plans provide both prime and sub-prime customers with so much more predictability, that we actually can improve our involuntary churn of sub-prime customers by putting them on kind of value-oriented bundled plans that then, they become profitable customers for us. So this is around profitability, not just to magic credit scores. So I think over time, we can gradually, if you will, be very selective and scientific about loosening credit, if we get them on the right plan with that kind of predictability. And it's also, of course, we've got prepaid. So we have a number in a very strong business that looks at a lot of different segments. So I think we have the right portfolio of brands, both postpaid and prepaid, to address really any kind of economic situation the customer might be in. So it's a long way of saying no to -- as gross adds, as gross add growth coming from, relaxed credit scores, the answer is no. With AT&T and Verizon, you'll have to ask them. And by the way, if they tell you, will you call me? I'd appreciate that. And last, with respect to the questions with respect to the iPhone 4, let's face it. I would not be perfectly honest with you if I didn't say everytime Apple announces a new phone, that there is not an impact in the market, that we don't all feel it. But I think what we've done the last few years is that we've mitigated the size of that impact versus previous years by having our own plan and handsets. The instinct helped us in '08, they pretty helped us in '09. The EVO will help us this year to mitigate that. But we, like all, I think the major competitors of AT&T do feel it when there's a new iPhone out there."

So the valuation issue, we do not consolidate that in our operations other than equity accounting, which is around 54% now.

Gross adds are seasonally lower in Q2. Q4 is the highest. Q1, the next highest, then Q3, then Q2. I think we tend to see improved churn. I was very pleased with churn in the second quarter. It as actually lower than the first quarter and that should continue as we look forward. Part of that is mix, part of that is just  the improved real performance as a result of the value that we have out in the marketplace. In terms of gross adds, as Dan mentioned and Bob did, we come out of the second quarter very well positioned. All of our brands are out there. As Dan mentioned, we're seeing a very strong lift as a result of the new Virgin Mobile versus what we had out in retail, anywhere between 20% to 30% lifts some retailers even higher than that. Assurance is doing extremely well and the more states we get into, the better that will continue to perform for us. As Dan mentioned, Common Cents will be doubling in size from its from its initial roll-out into Wal-Mart. And as you may have seen, we are putting in payLo by Virgin Mobile into about 40,000 retail locations that will be primarily drug convenience, Family Dollar, Kmart, that kind of thing, to go after the basic communicators outside of Wal-Mart. So in general, we should expect to see, and we believe we we'll see strong sequential improvement in net adds in the back half of the year and we should start to see that in the third quarter specifically as well."

And kind of the real key for us has been not only kind of the brand and service improvements. But we see differences in churn. We're actually looking at it very scientifically on our rate plan and on handsets and in devices. And we're  -- as you get more granular, you understand what rate plans -- I mentioned Any Mobile Anytime as having very low churn. The same with devices. Certain devices have very high customers satisfaction, very low churn. And as we get better and better, we're going to continue to focus on those. And as I mentioned as well, and brand is something that there is a lag in its momentum to and it builds over time and that's why things like most want to investigate and we look at other things in terms of net promoter scores and what have you are very important. And those trend lines are moving in the right direction sequentially, year-over-year, etc. You mentioned port-ins, that is where we have -- when we look at every Monday, we have a meeting and you look at port-ins versus point out, between us and every competitor and I feel very good about the way those trend lines have been moving. As you can imagine, year ago, two years ago, there were pretty ugly discussions on Monday. And they've been improving. So that is, as you know, there are fewer adds to go to go out there. New gross adds coming into the postpaid world than there has been traditionally. So you have to very much look at the porting trends between carriers. So that's a real good litmus test with respect to the strength of your brand. So where we want to go, of course is, I've told the team, I hope never see a two spot again. That's our goal. I can't commit to that and not providing guidance clearly in that regard. But I'd hope never to see that again in the postpaid world. And will -- our improvement in gross adds as well will help our churn long-term because as I mentioned earlier, even though we've made a lot of improvements in off-contract churn, very significant improvement in off-contract churn. On-contract chain is a lot lower than off-contractor and so we need to get more customers on contract and have better gross add performance than we had traditionally. So this 550 basis point improvement in share gross adds will also help over time on the churn site. So in conclusion, there's a whole lot of step we're working on. As a matter of fact, John Carney, who's the Senior Vice President of Marketing, every week, he heads up what we call a churn task force, which s comprehensive across the company. We review it as a senior team. Every week, we'd go through it. There's lots to it. We've kind of gotten -- the low hanging fruit is gone. Now it's really hard work going to them, getting the next basis point or two basis points or five basis point improvement. And we're just going to keep working to get it lower."

So it clearly I think justifies from our point of view that the premium, although, of course, it's less expensive from a technical point of view with our spectrum position at Clearwire and with 4G to produce gigabytes on 4G networks than with networks but we clearly can do that. With respect to tiering, right now, we have no plans to go to tiered data pricing. That doesn't mean we won't. We will continue to monitor the situation but so much of our brand -- what we're showing is customers will pay a premium for simplicity and where our bundled plans and our simple plans are helping us in churn, are helping our brand, so we won't take the decision lightly to move away from our current structure to something as you're discussing around tiering.

Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.
Turning to Slide 3, throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the second quarter can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Next, I would like to cover our EPS results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the second quarter was $0.25 compared to $0.29 in the first quarter 2010 and $0.13 in the year-ago period. Approximately $0.10 of the second quarter 2010 loss per share was due to an increase in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, resulting from net operating loss carryforwards generated during the second quarter. The impact was about $0.12 in the first quarter. Bob will discuss this further in his remarks. 
I will now turn the call over to Sprint CEO, Dan Hesse."

As you can see from Slide 4, Sprint had a solid second quarter. We grew total wireless subscribers by 111,000 in t",2379,"Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, and thanks for joining us so early on a summer day, especially those of you who might be on vacation. 
As you can see from Slide 4, Sprint had a solid second quarter. We grew total wireless subscribers by 111,000 in the quarter, driven by Sprint's best postpaid churn performance ever. And we've been in the Wireless business for almost 14 years now. Our efforts to improve the customer experience by being simple to do business with are paying off. And like last quarter, we can again report sequential stability in revenues, adjusted OIBDA and OIBDA margin and strong free cash flow. 
As I do on each call, I will organize my comments along the lines of Sprint's three consistent overarching objectives: Improving the customer experience, strengthening the brand and generating cash flow.
Please go to Slide 5. With respect to the customer experience, I'm very pleased to report that we achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of improvement in customer care satisfaction and in first call resolution last quarter. As a result of this two and a half year, company-wide obsession with improving the customer experience, the 2010 American Customer Satisfaction Index, which some of you may know as the comprehensive University of Michigan customer satisfaction study, reported that over the past two years, Sprint has not only improved far more than any U.S. wireless carrier, but Sprint's customer satisfaction has improved more in the past two years than any U.S. company in the survey from any industry, period. 
And the ACSI is not alone. Recently, I was invited to New York to keynote the Forrester Customer Experience Forum 2010 Conference in recognition of Sprint's significant customer service improvements over the past year. In the Forrester Customer Experience Index, Sprint improved 15 points while no other U.S. wireless carrier improved more than one point. And Sprint's improvement tied for the greatest improvement achievement of any U.S. company in any industry.
Also in the quarter, Sprint received the Gartner 1 to 1 Media CRM Excellence Award as one of the five gold medal winners. Gartner's CRM Excellence Award honors outstanding organizations that use customer-focused strategies to improve their business performance. 
In addition, the J.D. Power Wireless business satisfaction survey recognized Sprint recently as the only carrier to see its scores improve in the small, mid-sized business category in each of the 2008, 2009 and 2010 surveys. And earlier this year, the Yankee Group recognized Sprint as the number one in voice satisfaction and number one in data satisfaction among large business customers.
Please go to Slide 6. Our internal metrics mirror these results. In the quarter, blocked calls on our network achieved an all-time best. In a well-known third-party survey, customers gave Sprint our highest rating ever in network satisfaction. For customer care, our overall top box customer satisfaction percentage hit yet another all-time high in the second quarter. And our bottom box performance was also another all-time best. 
We achieved yet another all-time best in the quarter, with the fewest number of calls per customer to customer care ever. This is a win-win for us and for our customers, as they prefer not to call us, and if they don't call, we can reduce our care costs. Calls to care per customer were down 41% this June versus June 2007. And we have not been buying satisfaction by crediting the customer's bill. Customer bill credits are down 46% year-over-year. 
The improvements in Sprint's customer service levels over the past 10 quarters are truly remarkable.  And most importantly, this is borne out by our churn performance. As I said, our postpaid churn achieved a best ever result this quarter of 1.85%. And had it not been for the decommissioning of the Helio platform, which we acquired recently as part of the Virgin Mobile acquisition, and the associated deactivations on that platform, which we told you were coming in the second quarter on last quarter's call, postpaid churn would have been only 1.78% this quarter. 
We're making improvements in both voluntary and involuntary churn. Involuntary churn benefits because our percentage of postpaid customers that carry a prime credit rating remains at a robust 84%. Prepaid churn is also better, both sequentially and year-over-year.
Turning to Slide 7, our customer experience improvements are helping to strengthen our brand, which is crucial to improving subscriber performance. According to third-party brand data, Sprint was the only carrier to see a statistically significant improvement in its purchase consideration and most want to investigate metrics sequentially in the second quarter. Because the Sprint brand is strengthening, the number of Sprint-branded postpaid customers increased by a net positive 285,000 in the quarter. The number of contract customers choosing the Sprint brand is growing nicely. When I say Sprint-branded, I'm referring to customers who choose Sprint-branded services, which utilize our CDMA network. These are all retail postpaid customers on our CDMA network, with the exception of Helio subscribers and customers using the Nextel-branded power source dual mode iDEN CDMA devices. 
Even though our Sprint-branded postpaid gross adds year-over-year growth of 46% was the highest since 2001, yet perhaps also noticed that our marketing expenses have declined sequentially and year-over-year. The multi-year consistency and clarity of our messages allows our advertising spend to be more productive.
Please go to Slide 8. Our year-over-year postpaid for contract customer net add improvement of 763,000 is yet another all-time best for Sprint. For the first half of the year, this represents an improvement of better than 1.4 million as compared to the first six months of last year. By contrast, AT&T and Verizon reported their fewest new contract customer additions in the second quarter in six years. 
Going to Slide 9, the sequential improvement in postpaid net adds is our best since 2002. Even though the EVO 4G launch helped, the strength of our broad handset portfolio and our across-the-board improvements were so significant, that we would have achieved both positive total wireless net subscriber growth and Sprint brand postpaid subscriber growth without any help from EVO in the second quarter. Our improvements are foundational. 
Sprint's market share of new postpaid or contract customers, also known as share of gross adds or SOGA, based upon our best industry estimates were up for the fourth consecutive quarter and up 560 basis points year-over-year, our largest year-over-year improvement on record. Sequentially, and year-over-year, we are the only major wireless carrier improving SOGA for market share of new postpaid customers.
One way to measure the relative strength of your brand is to look at the trend in port outs to your competitors and port ins from your competitors, how you're doing among switchers, if you will. Port outs continue to get better as a percentage of our base and on an absolute basis, but even more noteworthy is the dramatic increase in customers porting in from our competitors. Postpaid port ins are up 84% year-over-year. 
The churn improvement was the most valuable contributor to our subscriber performance. The impact we're getting from our brand anchor, simplicity embodied in our Any Mobile, Anytime and our 30-day guarantee offers is providing significant voluntary and involuntary churn benefits, an excellent indicator of the impact of approved service levels is off-contract churn, where there is not a financial penalty to leave. Off-contract churn last quarter was at the lowest level since the merger five years ago. Because of our confidence in the improvements we've made to the customer experience, earlier this year, we introduced the industry's first full 30-day money-back guarantee. Since we launched this guarantee, our churn or deactivation percentage in that first 30 days is actually lower or better than it was in 2008 or in 2009 before the money-back guarantee. This is more hard evidence that the Sprint customer experience has improved.
The second quarter was a productive quarter for our prepaid brands. If you would go to Slide 10, we launched Common Cents into 700 Wal-Mart stores, relaunched Virgin Mobile and we expanded Assurance Wireless into additional states. Although we saw an expected decline in net adds sequentially due to seasonality, prepaid net add performance of 173,000 was in line with our internal plan. We did this in spite of a few short-term headwinds, including Boost inventory issues and delays in rolling out Assurance Wireless. Churn continues to perform well, and we anticipate further improvement as we look towards year end. 
Assurance Wireless was available in seven states at the end of the quarter. We had hoped to launch Florida in the middle of the second quarter, but state approval was delayed until July, due to opposition from various interested parties. I am pleased to say that we are now officially launched in Florida and Louisiana, and we expect to be in approximately 20 states by the end of the year.
We relaunched the Virgin Mobile brand with innovative Beyond Talk proposition during the second quarter. Although announced in May, we were not fully rolled out to nearly 20,000 retail locations  until the end of June. In retailers that previously sold Virgin Mobile and now sell our Beyond Talk offers, sales are up 20-plus percent post launch. 
According to first quarter data from Nielsen, pay-as-you-go customers, or what we call basic communicators, make up 62% of the no-contract market. We launched Common Cents in 700 Wal-Mart stores in June and will expand to a total of 1500 stores in August. Two weeks ago, added payLo by Virgin Mobile as our pay-as-you-go offerings, which is targeted at basic communicators and retail channels other than Wal-Mart. 
Boost Mobile was recently honored by the American Business Awards, also known as the Stevie's [Stevie Awards]. Boost Mobile's Unwronged campaign was recognized as the best technology ad and campaign and Boost Mobile won the business turnaround of the year for organizations above the 2500 employees. We continue to see good demand for Boost Unlimited, especially for CDMA devices. We have resolved inventory issues with Boost, and we were fully stocked by the third week of June. 
The results of all these actions and the launch of our multi-brand strategy position us for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect to make meaningful progress in our prepaid net add results in the second half of 2010. And we expect to see sequential improvement in the third quarter.
Sprint continues to focus on improving our environment. Sprint now has 21% of our wireless invoices being electronic versus paper. And we were awarded the Sustainability Leadership Award at the 2010 International Electronics Recycling Conference & Expo. We also launched two more green phones in the second quarter, the LG Remarq and the Samsung Restore. 
And finally, with respect to cash in the bottom line, we can report once again sequential stability and revenue and in consolidated adjusted OIBDA and OIBDA margin. Our $709 million of free cash flow this quarter puts us at $1.2 billion free cash flow for the first half of the year.
Regarding the second half of 2010, 4G will be an increasingly important element of our performance. So far, the HTC EVO 4G pictured on Slide 11 has exceeded our expectations, whether it be press or analysts reviews, sales demand or for its historic low return level. We wish we could get more devices and it's an issue HTC is working on. We launched eight 4G markets in the second quarter bringing us up to 51 million pops.
I get a lot of questions about Clearwire and about Sprint's network, RFP. On the topic of Clearwire, we have an advantage in the aligned ownership interests we share with the cable partners, Intel and Google. And we benefit from the many contributions they have brought to the table and we benefit from the resale of 4G services. We are supportive of Clearwire's 2010 network build plan of up to 120 million pops. And we will continue to explore with Clearwire and each of its partners' various network deployment strategies and financing options beyond 2010. As in the past, any strategic or funding decisions about Clearwire must be a collective decision among the strategic investors and the Clearwire board. Beyond that, we are not going to comment on the ongoing media speculation. 
Regarding Sprint's network, we are currently in the early stages of exploring network options with a  multimodal technology RFP. The primary objective of this RFP is to reduce operating costs, such as roaming, access, lease costs, power and maintenance. We expect the next evolution of our network will allow us to optimize our spectrum assets and will provide the opportunity for further network asset sharing with Clearwire. This also provides investment protection, by allowing us flexibility in the deployment of network technology standards. Our analysis to date looks promising. And we will share additional information when appropriate. 
So in conclusion, the strong cash flow, stable revenue and OIBDA and widespread third-party recognition for the improvements we're making in customer experience, which in turn builds stronger brands and better subscriber performance. We are feeling that the intense work on these unwavering overarching objectives for the past quarters is beginning to pay off. Because of the improving trends Sprint is seeing, we are enhancing our forecast to say that we now expect to have positive total net wireless subscriber additions during the remainder of 2010 and fewer net postpaid subscriber losses in the second half of 2010 as compared to the first half. It is our goal that the number of Sprint brand postpaid customers continues to grow, and as I said previously, we expect to see sequential improvement in prepaid net adds in the third quarter. 
I was interviewed about our turnaround recently on National Public Radio. When asked how far along we are, I likened our turnaround to a baseball game. And I said we're in the third inning. The first third of the game is to achieve stability. The middle third of the game is to achieve growth. And the final innings of the game will be to achieve best-in-class performance in all aspects of our operations. We still have a lot of hard work ahead of us. 
It is now time to turn it over to institutional investors' top telecom CFO, Bob Brust, to take you through the numbers."

Moving on to Slide 12, as Dan mentioned, we had another good quarter in terms of free cash flow, generating $709 million during the second quarter. This was up from $506 million in the first quarter, primarily due to seasonally lower interest payments and working capital benefits. We expect to generate a meaningful level of positive free cash flow during the remainder of 2010. We ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, down only slightly from the previous quarter after repaying the $715 million note that came due in June of 2010. This was our only note maturity in 2010.
Looking ahead at debt maturities, we have $1.65 billion maturing in January of 2011 and $2.75 billion in 2012. We expect to pay the 2011 and 2012 maturities as scheduled without refinancing.  During the second quarter, we also entered into a new $2.1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will provide liquidity through 2013. The facility supports our rebanding letter of credit, which is now at $1.4 billion after the $160 million reduction we received earlier in July. We expect to end 2010 with a strong cash balance in preparation for our January 2011 maturity payment. Our goal continues to be to maintain an average cash balance of approximately $4 billion.
Capital expenditures were $437 million in the second quarter compared to $419 million in the first quarter and $321 million in the second quarter of last year. We continue to spend an appropriate amount on CapEx primarily in the areas of data capability, development and coverage. Over the previous three quarters, we added approximately 250 new CDMA cell sites. We still expect the full year 2010 capital spending will be up to $2 billion.
Moving on to Slide 13, we were pleased with the continued relative stabilization of revenue in the quarter. Total revenues and wireless service revenues, which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues, both declined by less than 1% sequentially. The slight decline in revenue was primarily the result of lower postpaid revenues due to fewer postpaid subscribers and lower wireline revenues. This impact was partially offset by the increase in prepaid revenues due to the increased base of prepaid subscribers. 
Importantly, wireless service revenue was also relatively stable year-over-year, a strong improvement compared to the 9% year-over-year decline we reported for the second quarter of 2009. This improvement was due primarily to our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions and better subscriber results over the last four quarters, as compared to the four-quarter period ended second quarter of 2009. 
For the first half of 2010, total net operating revenues declined approximately 1.5% as compared to the first half of 2009. Whereas last year, we saw a year-over-year decline of about 11%. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $1.501 billion, up $23 million sequentially and down $268 million  from a year ago. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved 40 basis points sequentially. Additionally, we saw year-over-year and sequential reductions in operating losses after interest. 
As Yijing mentioned, we increased the valuation allowance for deferred taxes related to federal and state operating loss carryforwards in the second quarter. As we indicated during our first quarter call, with our recent history of consecutive annual losses, we no longer recognize a net-tax benefit from operating losses generated during the current period. As a result, we recorded an increased valuation allowance of $302 million or $0.10 per share for the quarter. We expect that for the full year 2010, we will record a net tax expense of approximately 7% to 9% on pretax loss due primarily to taxable temporary differences associated with our spectrum.
Moving on to Slide 14. Adjusted OIBDA was stable sequentially, primarily due to SG&A cost improvements and stabilizing net operating revenue results. On the postpaid cost side, we saw sequential improvements in SG&A expenses, driven by lower marketing program and sponsorship spend, as well as lower customer care expenses. Cost of service was up slightly as compared to the first quarter, due primarily to the higher roaming costs driven by seasonality. Postpaid subsidy expense was higher sequentially, driven by higher average subsidy per handset sold. 
We continue to expect some rate pressure going forward from the ongoing growth in smartphone sales. The prepaid contribution to the Wireless segment improved sequentially, due to the increased space of Boost Monthly Unlimited and Assurance Wireless subscribers. Prepaid also benefited from lower subsidy expense in the quarter. Prepaid ARPU improved by approximately $1 sequentially, as a result of the continued popularity of Boost Unlimited. We expect prepaid ARPU to be relatively flat for the remainder of 2010 as compared to the second quarter of 2010. 
Wireline contribution to adjusted OIBDA was relatively stable sequentially, as the revenue decline was mostly offset by a decline in SG&A. Revenue was lower primarily due to lower voice volume. We continue to expect moderate pressure on wireline results for the remainder of the year. 
Overall, we are pleased to report a second consecutive quarter of improved adjusted OIBDA and adjusted OIBDA margins. However, seasonality typically drives higher third quarter costs of service expenses, including roaming, service and repair. In addition, a continued strengthening of gross adds will pressure third quarter cost.  
I will remind you that over the past two years, we have seen an average sequential decline in adjusted OIBDA of approximately 14% from the second quarter to the third quarter. While we have stabilized our revenue trends, the improvement we have seen in gross adds, along with items that I just talked about, will likely result in a sequential decline in adjusted OIBDA. 
In summary, the stabilization and eventual growth of revenue continues to be the primary focus of the company. And we are pleased that our results through the first half of the year have demonstrated progress toward that goal. Our stable second quarter adjusted OIBDA results and strong liquidity position also offer us confidence as we look ahead to the remainder of 2010. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Yijing for Q&A."

It seems like, if we step back here, industry-switching activity in the quarter is on the decline, which happened despite several device refreshes across the competitive landscape.

And then second on the margins, as we step back, stronger quarter on gross adds, I think that many people expected this quarter along with relatively high upgrade percentages still upgrade 9% of the base, so two metrics that would usually pressure margins, yet you still delivered on decent margin improvement. Bob, I heard your comments on seasonally higher expenses in 3Q, but it seems like the magnitude of sequential decline shouldn't be anywhere near what we've seen historically.

I'll take the first item in terms of continued churn improvement. Even though we've made -- and I keep telling the team as well, we've made these dramatic improvements in terms of customer satisfaction: Care, retail, pretty much in every touch point. We still are not the best in class from an absolute point of view at every single touch point. So we still have improvements to make, and as you know, our two major competitors, if you take the big four, we're now three. From a churn point of view, two or better. So we have a lot of aggressive internal targets to continue to improve our churn performance. And there's also a lag, if you will with brand with respect to the improvements in customer service. So what we're hoping is over time, as more people know and understand and see third party verification after third party verification after third party verification, these are non-customers or potentially ex-customers, because that's where we really still have a lot of work to do. If you were to take a look at the strength of our brand, Sprint customers, the improvement in what we call, MWI scores, purchase consideration scores, are just up dramatically because, of course, they have experience with Sprint over the last two years. We still need a lot of good work to get that message across to people who have never been our customers or quite frankly, may have been past Sprint customers a long time ago. And so I think there's an opportunity to as they begin to understand that the Sprint of today is very different from the Sprint of a few years ago. I think that gives us even more opportunity to improve churn. So I think there's a lot of momentum, as you know, that goes with brands.

The first is, when you really think of Sprint brand net adds, that was a positive 285,000 postpaid for the quarter. And what we take out there is what -- if you take a look at the CDMA number, you have two things that are the difference. One is Helio, and the other is, it's a Nextel-branded service called PowerSource, which is really a dual-mode iDEN CDMA. And we count those -- and you have to choose whether to count them as iDEN subs or CDMA subs, we throw them in there with the CDMA subs. So the way we look at it, when we talk about how Sprint is doing, how Sprint's offers are doing, how the Sprint's brand is doing, we look at Sprint brand and that would be a positive net postpaid adds in the quarter of 285,000. The second issue is really around bundles. And net-net, if you take a look at the overall business case, the overall top line and bottom line performance, our bundles have been quite successful, particularly Any Mobile, Anytime, which is what you're seeing advertised now. And you have a few puts and takes. And I think you've put your finger on a few of them. On the one hand, it's doing better than we expected and doing very well at acquiring new customers on the gross add side. It's really over performing very well on the churn side. And so we see the churn very, very strong, both voluntary and involuntary churn. We'll have customers who bundled plans, also which reducing calls to care very significant, which is another cost advantage to us. But with it, there is some ARPU pressure as customers do, if you will, they might have been buying a la carte, or have a larger bundle plan. They moved down to a -- we call a lower-ARPU bundled plan. So there is some ARPU dilution. So if you look -- we'd look at customer lifetime value, where the most important driver of profit or value is churn, give that a checkmark, a big plus. We have a -- ARPU is a negative. Cost reduction on calls to care is a positive. And of course, it helps on the revenue side and that we're acquiring. And it's a piece of our growth and performance improvement gross adds that we've been talking about. So net-net overall, it's exceeding our business case. It's doing very well. But you're right, it does pressure ARPU even though it does improve our overall profitability."

That will affect, I think, a number of vendors over the next few months, whether it be for chips or displays. Because what happened back in the 2008, early 2009 time frame, is a lot of capacity came off-line as the economy began to go down. And now a combination of the -- economy improving, and all of a sudden, some really increased customer demand for these high-end devices is putting some strain on the supply chain. So we're working with our suppliers very closely, HTC in particular, and try to get as much inventory as we can. We are supply constraint. So the answer to your question is yes.

We were done rolling out the majority of the multi-brand strategy by the end of the second quarter and so from a gross add perspective, we had a very nice trend line coming out of the quarter with June, being by far and away, the highest gross add month for prepaid in the quarter.

With respect to credit, no. As I mentioned, that we continue to maintain a very strong solid high credit rating, 84% prime in our postpaid base. We do, obviously, you know it's more than credit score. When you look at customers and CLV and what have you, there is what we call pretty prime and prime. So there's more science to it than being that simple. But that's really the best litmus test. So no, we have, we still are maintaining a very rigid focus on profitability. This company, as you know, got into some financial trouble years ago by being too generous. So we watch it very, very closely. But as I mentioned earlier on voluntary and involuntary, what we're finding is that our bundled plans provide both prime and sub-prime customers with so much more predictability, that we actually can improve our involuntary churn of sub-prime customers by putting them on kind of value-oriented bundled plans that then, they become profitable customers for us. So this is around profitability, not just to magic credit scores. So I think over time, we can gradually, if you will, be very selective and scientific about loosening credit, if we get them on the right plan with that kind of predictability. And it's also, of course, we've got prepaid. So we have a number in a very strong business that looks at a lot of different segments. So I think we have the right portfolio of brands, both postpaid and prepaid, to address really any kind of economic situation the customer might be in. So it's a long way of saying no to -- as gross adds, as gross add growth coming from, relaxed credit scores, the answer is no. With AT&T and Verizon, you'll have to ask them. And by the way, if they tell you, will you call me? I'd appreciate that. And last, with respect to the questions with respect to the iPhone 4, let's face it. I would not be perfectly honest with you if I didn't say everytime Apple announces a new phone, that there is not an impact in the market, that we don't all feel it. But I think what we've done the last few years is that we've mitigated the size of that impact versus previous years by having our own plan and handsets. The instinct helped us in '08, they pretty helped us in '09. The EVO will help us this year to mitigate that. But we, like all, I think the major competitors of AT&T do feel it when there's a new iPhone out there."

Part of that is mix, part of that is just  the improved real performance as a result of the value that we have out in the marketplace. In terms of gross adds, as Dan mentioned and Bob did, we come out of the second quarter very well positioned. All of our brands are out there. As Dan mentioned, we're seeing a very strong lift as a result of the new Virgin Mobile versus what we had out in retail, anywhere between 20% to 30% lifts some retailers even higher than that. Assurance is doing extremely well and the more states we get into, the better that will continue to perform for us. As Dan mentioned, Common Cents will be doubling in size from its from its initial roll-out into Wal-Mart. And as you may have seen, we are putting in payLo by Virgin Mobile into about 40,000 retail locations that will be primarily drug convenience, Family Dollar, Kmart, that kind of thing, to go after the basic communicators outside of Wal-Mart.

And kind of the real key for us has been not only kind of the brand and service improvements. But we see differences in churn. We're actually looking at it very scientifically on our rate plan and on handsets and in devices. And we're  -- as you get more granular, you understand what rate plans -- I mentioned Any Mobile Anytime as having very low churn. The same with devices. Certain devices have very high customers satisfaction, very low churn. And as we get better and better, we're going to continue to focus on those. And as I mentioned as well, and brand is something that there is a lag in its momentum to and it builds over time and that's why things like most want to investigate and we look at other things in terms of net promoter scores and what have you are very important. And those trend lines are moving in the right direction sequentially, year-over-year, etc. You mentioned port-ins, that is where we have -- when we look at every Monday, we have a meeting and you look at port-ins versus point out, between us and every competitor and I feel very good about the way those trend lines have been moving. As you can imagine, year ago, two years ago, there were pretty ugly discussions on Monday. And they've been improving. So that is, as you know, there are fewer adds to go to go out there. New gross adds coming into the postpaid world than there has been traditionally. So you have to very much look at the porting trends between carriers. So that's a real good litmus test with respect to the strength of your brand. So where we want to go, of course is, I've told the team, I hope never see a two spot again. That's our goal. I can't commit to that and not providing guidance clearly in that regard. But I'd hope never to see that again in the postpaid world. And will -- our improvement in gross adds as well will help our churn long-term because as I mentioned earlier, even though we've made a lot of improvements in off-contract churn, very significant improvement in off-contract churn. On-contract chain is a lot lower than off-contractor and so we need to get more customers on contract and have better gross add performance than we had traditionally. So this 550 basis point improvement in share gross adds will also help over time on the churn site. So in conclusion, there's a whole lot of step we're working on. As a matter of fact, John Carney, who's the Senior Vice President of Marketing, every week, he heads up what we call a churn task force, which s comprehensive across the company. We review it as a senior team. Every week, we'd go through it. There's lots to it. We've kind of gotten -- the low hanging fruit is gone. Now it's really hard work going to them, getting the next basis point or two basis points or five basis point improvement. And we're just going to keep working to get it lower."

In terms of EVO, yes, EVO usage is higher than our, what we call our smartphone, which by the way, is almost half of our customer base now. But the EVO customers are using about 3 1/2 times more data than our other smartphone customers are. So it clearly I think justifies from our point of view that the premium, although, of course, it's less expensive from a technical point of view with our spectrum position at Clearwire and with 4G to produce gigabytes on 4G networks than with networks but we clearly can do that. With respect to tiering, right now, we have no plans to go to tiered data pricing. That doesn't mean we won't. We will continue to monitor the situation but so much of our brand -- what we're showing is customers will pay a premium for simplicity and where our bundled plans and our simple plans are helping us in churn, are helping our brand, so we won't take the decision lightly to move away from our current structure to something as you're discussing around tiering. So I'm not excluding it as a future possibility  but we currently have no plans to do that and we see no need currently to move in that direction."

For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO will discuss operational performance in the quarter, and then our CFO, Bob Brust will cover the financial aspects of the quarter.
Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint Web site.
Slide two is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements.
We provide a comprehensive list of the risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and in Part II Item 1A risk factors of our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
Turning to slide three, throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the third quarter can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today’s presentation, which are available on our Web site at www.sprint.com/investors.
Next, I would like to cover our EPS results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the third quarter was $0.30 compared to $0.25 in the second quarter 2010 and $0.17 in the year ago period. The sequential change in EPS was due primarily to drivers that also impacted the sequential change in OIBDA, which Bob Brust will discuss in more detail later on the call.
I will now turn the call over to Sprint’s CEO, Dan Hesse.

417206,114228229,82166,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Yijing, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining us this morning.If you’d turn to slide four, I was asked at an investor conference recently to describe Sprint’s performance in one word, and I chose the word ‘Momentum.’ Our l",2033,"Thank you, Yijing, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining us this morning.
If you’d turn to slide four, I was asked at an investor conference recently to describe Sprint’s performance in one word, and I chose the word ‘Momentum.’ Our last two quarters, the second and third quarters of 2010 represent the best quarters ever for Sprint, both in postpaid churn and in year-over-year improvement in postpaid net adds, driven by our best retail net add performance in over four years.
We grew total wireless subscribers by 644,000 in the third quarter, our highest quarterly net add total since 2006.
As is my habit, I’ll discuss our results in the context of Sprint’s three overarching priorities
The customer experience, the brand, and cash. But with a change of pace, let me start with the third, cash, primarily driven by more postpaid and prepaid gross adds and upgrades plus some anticipated seasonal factors, quarterly OIBDA was driven down sequentially to $1.34 billion.
Year-to-date free cash flow now stands at $1.6 billion, allowing us to maintain strong liquidity with cash and cash equivalents balance of $4.7 billion. Total net operating revenues increased sequentially and year-over-year.
Please go to slide #five, with respect to the customer experience, I am pleased to report that we’ve achieved our 11th consecutive quarter of improvement in customer care satisfaction and in first call resolution. Top-box satisfaction and bottom-box satisfaction both achieved all time bests, as did first call resolution.
Our networks achieved yet another all-time best result for fewest blocked calls. In a recent third-party survey, our customers gave Sprint our highest rating ever on network satisfaction.
According to the recent J.D. Power and Associates Wireless Call Quality Performance Study, Sprint came in first or second place in five of six regions, and we have shown the most improvement of any carrier over a three-year period.
In the J.D. Power Retail Sales Satisfaction Study, Sprint moved from last place in recent years to a virtual tie for first place. In the Vocalabs National Customer Service Survey, Sprint’s call satisfaction tied for first place.
On the business side, we won seven ATLANTIC-ACM Awards for Business Connectivity and Wireless Business Excellence, and Sprint again walked away with the top honors in the Nemertes 2010 PilotHouse Awards for MPLS Services, receiving the top overall score.
The customer experience improvements are reflected in our churn results. As mentioned, the last two quarters have been the best two churn quarters in our history. The percentage of postpaid customers that carry a prime credit rating remains at a strong 84%, an important determinant of involuntary churn.
On the voluntary side, customers who are on contract churn at a lower rate than those who are off contract. We are getting more customers on contract, but our off contract churn the past two quarters has been our lowest on record, and our return rate in the first 30 days is actually lower since we launched Sprint’s unique full 30-day money back guarantee this year than it has been for any previous year on record.
Moving to slide #six, in the brand, the Sprint brand continues to gain strength. One measure of brand health is subscribers. In the third quarter, we had positive postpaid net adds for the Sprint brand for the fourth consecutive quarter.
In the second quarter, the Sprint brand was the fastest growing postpaid brand of all major postpaid brands in terms of net new customers. 354,000 net adds in the third quarter represents over a 5% annualized growth rate in the size of the total Sprint postpaid customer base. So, it is likely the brand will achieve this fastest growing distinction yet again this quarter.
Virtually all of Sprint’s brand metrics have improved year-over-year. As I have mentioned on previous calls, Sprint brand metrics like most want to investigate and purchase consideration have improved much more quickly amongst Sprint customers, who have experience our improved customer service than they have with non-customers.
It is in this context that I am pleased to announce that we are net port positive for both the Sprint brand and on the CDMA platform for the first time on record, that is based on our porting data, more customers are switching to Sprint than are switching from Sprint. An indication of how the brand is strengthened with non-customers is that port-ins from our competitors have practically doubled year-over-year. Based upon Sprint’s data, they are up 95%.
Our share of postpaid gross adds improved for the fifth consecutive quarter, and we estimate it’s up over 400 basis points year-over-year. Year-over-year total postpaid net add performance improved by almost 700,000, our best third quarter year-over-year improvement ever. As I mentioned earlier, our 644,000 total company net adds in the quarter is our best since 2006.
Please turn to slide seven; devices are becoming increasingly important in attracting and retaining customers. PCWorld ranks Samsung Epic 4G launched in the third quarter and HTC EVO 4Gs launched in the second as the two best smartphones on the market, ahead of the iPhone 4 and ahead of every other Android device.
ZDNet ranks the EVO as the best smartphone on the market. Each device has a long list of accolades and smartphones are helping to fuel our momentum with 60% of our Sprint handset sales and upgrades being smartphones in the quarter.
Also in the third quarter, Sprint launched the Samsung Intercept, Sanyo’s Innuendo and Vero, the Blackberry 9330 Curve, the Motorola i1 which is the world’s first Nextel direct connect smartphone powered by Android, and the Franklin Wireless U600, which is 3G/4G USB modem.
In prepaid, we launched Motorola’s RAMBLER and BALI, Samsung Seek and Intercept, and the Blackberry 8530.
If you turn to slide #eight, in prepaid our multi-brand strategy allows us to address multiple segments with specific offers, distinct brand identities, and unique business models. Despite the extremely competitive environment and the recent integration of prepaid into Sprint’s consumer organization, we feel we have momentum.
Prepaid net adds of 471,000 are an improvement of almost 300,000 from last quarter with churn improving 29 basis points from Q2 to our lowest prepaid churn level in almost five years.
We continued to enhance the Boost CDMA device lineup with the Blackberry Curve and our first touch screen QWERTY, the Samsung Seek. Two weeks ago we launched the next evolution of Boost, Monthly Unlimited with Shrinkage.
This revolutionary approach rewards customers for on time payments by shrinking their monthly bills after six, 12 and 18 on time payments. This is a win-win for Boost and its customers.
Lastly, two important brand metrics for Boost, brand awareness and purchase consideration, both reached all time highs in our most recent study.
Assurance Wireless was available in 11 states at the end of the quarter, and as we said last quarter, we plan on being in 20 states by the end of the year.
We are re-launching the Virgin Mobile brand. Virgin Mobile launched its Crazy Life national marketing campaign in July. Virgin Mobile’s Beyond Talk launched its first Android device, the Samsung Intercept in October giving it compelling Blackberry and Android offers. We expect to see a growth in prepaid net adds in the fourth quarter.
Spring continues to innovate and lead in the areas of open and simplicity, and we’ve added another proof point of this recently with our announcement of Sprint ID which is on slide nine. Sprint ID is about accessing content. There are so many apps out there. Google, I think just yesterday reported that Android has over 100,000, that mobile users need a trusted app search and aggregation partner to simplify navigating through this ocean of apps and finding the best and most relevant apps for their needs.
To launch this revolutionary concept, we’ve lined up some of the world’s best brands like Yahoo!, HSN, Disney, ESPN, LatCel and eBay. Sprint ID opens a two-way street between content providers and users, and Sprint’s open philosophy enables this rather than restricts it.
ID lets customers download packs of apps, widgets, ring tones and wallpapers aggregated and optimized by a trusted brand. A customer can have up to five IDs at once be they personal or business.
We announced three new Sprint ID-enabled Android devices, the Samsung Transform, the Sanyo Zio and the LG Optimus S priced at under $150, $100, and under $50 respectively. Many content providers will also be new distribution partners for us. Improving our environment continues to be a top Sprint priority.
If you go to slide #10, you’ll see that Newsweek ranks Sprint number 6 nationally among the 100 greenest companies, the only telecom company in the top 50, as a matter of fact, the only one in the top 95.
Sprint also placed first among all technology companies for actual environmental impact, which measures 750 performance metrics. Out of the 500 companies researched only one scored higher in this measure.
We recently launched a certified pre-owned device program to give wireless phones a second life. This program not only allows customers to get one of today’s devices at a great value, but it allows helps Sprint to achieve our aggressive reuse and recycling goals.
All Sprint certified pre-owned devices are thoroughly inspected, tested, and if necessary remanufactured according to original equipment manufacturer new unit specifications and they come with a 30 day return policy. Devices available include BlackBerry Tour, Samsung Reclaim in green, and the Sanyo 2700 in pink and blue.
PC Magazine awarded the Samsung Restore and the LG Remarq its GreenTech seal, joining the Samsung Reclaim, which was also named world’s greenest cell phone by CallFinder.
Many on this call are investors, so you may be interested to know that in August, Sprint was chosen one of the 20 most responsible companies in the U.S. by Governance Metrics International out of 4,100 companies evaluated.
The overall ratings are based on six broad categories, Board accountability, financial disclosure and internal controls, shareholder rights, remuneration, market for control and corporate behavior.
Leading in 4G has been an important element of our strategy this year. In the third quarter, we launched in 19 4G markets including Jacksonville, Boston, Providence, Orlando, Minneapolis, Saint Paul and Pittsburg, and fourth quarter markets planned includes, New York, L.A. and San Francisco.
For sometime, Sprint has been in discussions with Clearwire regarding the financial status of its ongoing operations as well as Sprint potentially providing new financing. We expect those discussions to continue as we review alternatives with Clearwire. There is no assurance that the discussions will result in any transaction with Clearwire, and we will provide no additional comments on this matter.
Also, as I mentioned on last quarter’s earnings call, we intend, through the network modernization plan to enhance service quality and coverage, create network flexibility, reduce operating costs and improve environmental sustainability.
The plan focuses on upgrading the existing EVDO network and providing technology flexibility for 4G. Results of trial activities have shown positive gains in coverage and performance, in line with expectations.
We expect that improved coverage and next-generation backhaul solutions will enable Sprint to reduce roaming and access costs.
The deployment of multimode equipment allows Sprint to more feasibly consider new technologies using available spectrum bands and reduce future deployment costs.
Under the network plan, if we chose, we can reallocate a portion of available iDEN 800 MHz 800 spectrum to provision CDMA services, giving customers the benefit of enhanced in-building coverage associated with the 800 MHz band.
The implementation of the network modernization plan should further Sprint’s reputation as a leader in environmental responsibility through improvements in physical footprint, power consumption and cooling requirements. We will provide more details on the overall plan when vendor selection is complete later this year.
So in conclusion, although our momentum continues as we have achieved a number of all-time bests for two quarters in a row, we realize we have much progress still to make. We are in a hyper competitive industry with strong, capable competitors, so making continued progress is hard work, but we intend to persevere.
I will now turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Brust who will discuss our financial performance.

417206,114228229,82166,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. Moving on to slide #11, we are pleased with the continued stabilization of revenue on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Total quarterly revenues grew year-over-year for the first time in more than three",844,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. Moving on to slide #11, we are pleased with the continued stabilization of revenue on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Total quarterly revenues grew year-over-year for the first time in more than three years. This improvement was the result of acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2009, and higher equipment and prepaid service revenues, partially offset by lower wireline and postpaid service revenues.
Total quarterly revenues improved sequentially primarily due to higher equipment revenue. Wireless service revenues which include retail, wholesale, and affiliate revenues were also relatively stable sequentially and year-over-year. The reduction in postpaid subscriber losses and the continued growth in prepaid subscribers have been the key drivers in stabilizing revenue.
In the third quarter of 2009, Sprint lost 545,000 wireless subscribers, and this year in the third quarter, we gained 644,000 total wireless subscribers. This year-over-year improvement of almost $1.2 million net subscriber additions has had a meaningful impact on our revenue results. Revenue improvement continues to be a primary focus for the company.
Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $1.339 billion, down $162 million sequentially and down $167 million from a year ago. Adjusted OIBDA margins declined 200 basis points sequentially.
Adjusted OIBDA declined sequentially primarily due to higher retail gross adds and upgrades which drove higher subsidy and selling expenses. Both postpaid and prepaid gross adds increased by more than 10% as compared to the second quarter. Although we incurred cost to bring new customers on to our network, it is money well spent.
As we have said, an important factor in turning around the company’s financial performance is growing our customer base, and as a result, improving revenue.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect that postpaid gross adds will improve sequentially, driving higher associated subsidy and selling expense. Cost of service was higher sequentially due largely to the effects of seasonality, including higher roaming, service and repair and cell site utility expenses.
Postpaid ARPU remains stable sequentially at $55. The mix of subscribers in our postpaid customer base who own a smartphone continues to grow, which along with Any Mobile, Anytime helped drive adoption of data base bundled plans.
However, the positive impact of higher monthly recurring charges was offset by lower usage based charges including overage. Prepaid ARPU was essentially flat. Looking forward, overall prepaid ARPU will be impacted in the short term by shifts in mix of our prepaid subscriber base along with our brands.
Wireline contribution to adjusted OIBDA was relatively stable sequentially as the revenue decline was mostly offset by a decline in cost of service. Revenue was lower primarily due to lower voice volume and adjustments associated with carrier disputes impacting IP.
The improvement in cost of service was primarily driven by lower voice volume and a slight improvement in switched access rates. We expect pressure on wireline revenue and OIBDA on the fourth quarter driven primarily by continued lower voice volume.
Moving to slide 13, we generated $384 million of free cash flow in the third quarter. This was down from $709 million in the second quarter primarily due to a reduction in cash flow from operations, which includes higher interest payments which is typical for the third quarter. Through the first three quarters of 2010, we have generated a net total of $1.6 billion free cash flow.
We expect to continue to generate a meaningful level of positive cash flow in the fourth quarter. We ended the quarter with $4.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. As we discussed during our second quarter earnings call, we have repaid the $750 million note that came due on June of 2010. This was our only note maturity due in 2010.
Looking ahead at debt maturities, we have $1.65 billion maturing in January of 2011 and $2.75 billion in 2012. We expect to pay the 2011 and 2012 maturities as scheduled.
We expect to end 2010 with a strong cash balance in preparation for our first quarter 2011 maturity payment. Our goal continues to be to maintain an average cash balance of approximately $4 billion.
Capital expenditures were $462 million in the third quarter compared to $437 million in the second quarter and $431 million in the third quarter of 2009. Capital investment in 2010 has focused on wireless quality, coverage and capacity to maintain competitive positions in data services and network quality.
Our total cell sites including CDMA and iDEN is approximately 68,000 reflecting the additions from the iPCS acquisition. We still expect that full year 2010 capital spending will be up to $2 billion.
In summary, our priorities have remained constant. In 2010, our focus is on stabilizing revenue. Next year if our subscriber results continue to improve, we expect to start seeing revenue growth.
We have made progress on our key objectives through the first three quarters of 2010. We still have a lot more work to do on the turnaround, but we are encouraged by how far we have come.
Now, I will turn it back to Yijing for questions.

Subs are declining on the iDEN network, and as I mentioned earlier on the call, we are doing, I think a lot for our customers on iDEN. They are being provided with the best call quality, lowest blocking rates that they’ve ever had. We continue to launch new devices. I’m talking on the postpaid side. On the prepaid side, what you’re seeing is with the launch of Boost unlimited on CDMA with some attractive and more attractively priced CDMA devices an increasing number of prepaid customers, they’re looking at Boost are choosing CDMA over iDEN.
So we’re really focusing on iDEN on keeping churn down and actually churn is beginning to approach CDMA levels of churn on postpaid, so we’re doing a better job on churn on iDEN. What we’re not doing though is we have limited advertising and marketing dollars, we’re spending very little on iDEN going after new customers, because if you think if your marketing spend is a zero sum gain, we’re going to get a better return on that investment putting that on the Sprint brand than on the Nextel brand.
So you are seeing if you will a decline in both postpaid and prepaid customers on the iDEN network, but we’re focusing on providing them with great service and what it’s allowing us to do is, if you will, going to form or use some of that 800 MHz spectrum, which we are trialing and testing now, potentially on CDMA to provide better in-building and service quality on our CDMA service, so this is very valuable spectrum that we can get good utilization out of.
And as I mentioned also from a device point of view, we launched the first Android handset on iDEN in the third quarter. Secondly, with respect to the iPhone, it’s hard to speculate on that. We’ll just have to see what happens, but quite frankly of course, all the carriers are thinking about 2011 and the implications, but I just don’t want to speculate on it.

Let me take them kind of backwards. I think your second question was with respect to smartphones in the base, so 60% of our new sales, if you will, of phones both gross adds and upgrades, 60% was smartphones this quarter which brings us to about 45% of our base being smartphones, if that answers your question.
The second question had to do with, I think what is driving our improvements in SoGA and port ratios and what have you between rate plans and devices. I’d say it’s really both of them. We’ve improved our device line up very significantly, and one of the very key trends in our industry has been, each year, that devices are becoming a more and more important part of the marketing plan and what customers base their decisions on.
As a matter of fact, it’s probably becoming the most important overall factor, and it was not that case just a couple of years ago. But clearly the rate plans are important, and very importantly, from a port out point of view because if customers are on a good rate plan and they like the nature of the rate plan, the simplicity of the rate plan, the value of it, they are much less likely to leave.
So, our focus is on devices, the network, the quality of the network, both 3G and 4G, first 4G is important, an improved customer experience because as you also heard on the call was that our brand metrics continue to improve, but they’re up sharply among our existing customers, so that’s helping with churn. So net-net, for us, we believe they are both important devices and rate plans, but as time goes on, devices are becoming even more important than rate plans.

Could you dig in a little bit further into this loss of overage that seems to be impacting ARPU? I guess as I look at it, year-over-year you’ve lost say, 1 million lower ARPU iDEN customers. You’ve added higher ARPU CDMA customers, the vast majority of upgrades in gross ads are smartphones which are higher ARPU relative to the base. So it seems strange that we haven’t been able to see more of that come through. And I’m wondering if it’s because older customers are repricing at lower plans. If you could dig into that a little bit more it’d be great.
And then second, maybe Dan, not necessarily on the Clearwire question directly, but Clearwire has been throwing out a lot of options to show people that there are many strategies that they have. I think the sense is that Sprint has only one strategy right now which is, Clearwire, which may or may not be true. What is Sprint’s backup plan if Clearwire’s build just stops in the first part of 2011 and you don’t have a broad 4G strategy for 2011 and 2012?

Over time, with momentum we have in smartphones and the $10 premium that were charging for certain heavy use smartphones, I think over time, you could expect that ARPU will begin to tick-up. But so far, if you will, typically people that price down do it more quickly.
So, so far you’ve had more or less of a cancellation. If you will, the two cancel each other out. You have higher MRCs, multi-recurring charges on average, fewer fees and overages. Of course, that’s reflected on the positive side in churn, in churn improvements because customers don’t like overages. If you just extrapolate those trends over time, you should expect to begin to see ARPU move up. I am not going to tell you when yet, but you should expect to see those begin to tick up going forward.

I guess, the first is with normal seasonality which would suggest a downtick in churn, it should mean positive net adds or within reach in 4Q. Wondering how you would think through how likely that is.
And then second, as it relates to your gross adds continuing to move up and then a continued large device upgrade percentage in your base. It seems like no real relief on the horizon at least in the near term for wireless margins. So how should we think through your balancing efforts on postpaid and sort of improving the trajectory there relative to what’s happening on the margin line.

With respect to upgrades, and I think you’re getting at subsidies and what have you, that is kind of a challenge in our industry, where smartphones and this is related to the question give us benefits in ARPU and churn, but of course also have increased subsidy, so increased CPGA and then kind of increased cost of service that go with them.
And so far the benefits have outstripped the downside. We are working very closely and hard with our suppliers to continue to give us better priced phones and we work very hard on the mix, and that’s why actually our cost for the devices was better this quarter than it was in previous quarters mainly because we’ve been able to work very effectively on not only device pricing, but device mix.
That being said, in terms of margins, if you look at the margins in our business, the biggest issue for us from a margin point of view is the cost of service associated with running two networks and it will take us, near the end of my comments on the earnings call, we have a network modernization plan out there that we’re currently evaluating.
We’re going to decide and we haven’t yet who we’re choosing, what the economics are, how quickly we deploy that or what have you, but it takes a while to implement that so you wouldn’t start to see the significant benefits of that probably occurring till 2012 or so. So that’s the biggest opportunity we have, if you will, on the margin side is our activity on the network.

So, in terms of overall priorities in terms of us doing this, the primary driver is cost reduction, and is economic improvement, but it has added benefits, if you will, the icing on the cake in terms of also giving us superior network performance, it makes it easier for us to more effectively use multimode technology. For example, and I mentioned, using the 800 MHz band for CDMA as well, and do that cost effectively. So the biggest driver is to improve our cost position.

There clearly is an advantage to having, if you will, unlimited or kind of headache-free simple pricing. Customers like it and they will pay a premium for it. But we don’t want to lose segments of the market because we don’t have price points in other parts of the, if you will, the continuum of data use.
So, it’s something that we just continue to monitor. It helped us to not only improve churn, but lower our costs and improve the overall care and retail experience two years ago we eliminated 85% of our rate plan combinations, and that simplicity really helps the business. So, there are a lot of advantages to having a simple rate plan structure. But again, there is a lot of increased data usage and we want to make sure that we’re competitive and effective out there in the marketplace, so I will not rule out tiered data pricing.

I’m wondering if you could remind us of the details of your 800 MHz spectrum position and where you are in the rebanding process. I can’t remember if that affects the 800 MHz or not, and then getting into the detail of repurposing that spectrum. How much do you need to reserve for the number of subscribers that you have left on the iDEN network, and how much does that free up for use on CDMA, and is the repurposing of that spectrum something you can do relatively soon before you go to the whole network transformation process, or does it have to wait for the network transformation process before you can start reusing it?

So our letter of credit is now at $1.33 billion, which is down from the original $2.5 billion, and we’ve incurred about $2.7 billion of costs so far. So, there is an outstanding letter of credit out there at $1.33 billion, but that’s down $255 million this quarter and the rebanding process is likely to continue even beyond 2012, so the process will take some time.
With respect to your second question, yes, the network monetization project is a very, very important part of utilizing the 800 frequency for CDMA. It make sense to do that as part of the project and the other thing that goes along with it is new CDMA handsets that are also capable of operating at those lower 800 MHz frequencies that our existing base of handsets or not, it’s not a big change, it’s a fairly minor one, but it’s still something that we need to seed new devices into the marketplace. So, if you will, it’s not something that we will do immediately, so there are two elements in essence that we’re really waiting for before we do it in a, what we call, a meaningful fashion. I think you had one last question, I’m not sure. There was one more question?

So, over time, you will begin to see those coverage holes fill in, and if you will, 3G provides a very good safety net. In the early days of rolling this out, you’re going to see fairly robust 3G usage. You also had a question about, is three to four years the fastest. Well, no, not necessarily, you mean the fastest that it could be done technically, but we look at a lot of factors, operating risk, financial, cash, and all those things that I just think four is probably a good midpoint if you will to think about in terms of how long we would take to roll this out.

Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the third quarter can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Next, I would like to cover our EPS result. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the third quarter was $0.30 compared to $0.25 in the second quarter 2010 and $0.17 in the year-ago period. The sequential change in EPS was due primarily to the drivers that also impacted the sequential change in OIBDA, which Bob Brust will discuss in more detail later on the call. 
I will now turn the call over to Sprint CEO, Dan Hesse."
417206,114228229,82251,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Yijing, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining us this morning. If you'd turn to Slide 4, I was asked at an investor conference recently to describe Sprint's performance in one word, and I chose the word momentum. Our last two quarte",2025,"Thank you, Yijing, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining us this morning. If you'd turn to Slide 4, I was asked at an investor conference recently to describe Sprint's performance in one word, and I chose the word momentum. Our last two quarters, the second and third quarters of 2010, represent the best quarters ever for Sprint, both in postpaid churn and in year-over-year improvement in postpaid net adds. Driven by our best retail net add performance in over four years, we grew total wireless subscribers by 644,000 in the third quarter, our highest quarterly net add total since 2006.
As is my habit, I'll discuss our results in the context of Sprint's three overarching priorities: the customer experience, the brand and cash. As a change of pace, let me start with the third, cash. Primarily driven by more postpaid and prepaid gross adds and upgrades, plus some anticipated seasonal factors, quarterly OIBDA was driven down sequentially to $1.34 billion. Year-to-date, free cash flow now stands at $1.6 billion allowing us to maintain strong liquidity with a cash and cash equivalents balance of $4.7 billion. Total net operating revenues increased sequentially and year-over-year.
Please go to Slide 5. With respect to the customer experience, I'm pleased to report that we've achieved our 11th consecutive quarter of improvement in Customer Care Satisfaction and in First Call Resolution. Top box satisfaction and bottom box satisfaction both achieved all-time bests as did First Call Resolution. Our networks achieved yet another all-time best result for fewest blocked calls. In a recent third-party survey, our customers gave Sprint our highest rating ever on network satisfaction. According to the recent J.D. Power and Associates Wireless Call Quality Performance Study, Sprint came in first or second place in five of six regions, and we have shown the most improvement of any carrier over a three-year period.
In the J.D. Power Retail Sales Satisfaction Study, Sprint moved from last place in recent years to a virtual tie for first place. In the Vocal Labs National Customer Service Survey, Sprint's call satisfaction tied for first place. 
On the business side, we won seven ATLANTIC-ACM Awards for Business Connectivity and Wireless Business Excellence. And Sprint, again, walked away with the top honors in the Nemertes 2010 PilotHouse Awards for MPLS Services receiving the top overall score.
The customer experience improvements are reflected in our churn results. As mentioned, the last two quarters have been the best two churn quarters in our history. The percentage of postpaid customers that carry a prime credit rating remains at a strong 84%, an important determinant of involuntary churn.
On the voluntary side, customers who are on contract churn at a lower rate than those who are off contract. We are getting more customers on contract, but our off contract churn the past two quarters has been our lowest on record, and our return rate in the first 30 days is actually lower since we launched Sprint's unique full 30-day Money Back Guarantee this year than it has been for any previous year on record.
Moving to Slide 6 and the brand. The Sprint brand continues to gain strength. One measure of brand health is subscribers. In the third quarter, we had positive postpaid net adds for the Sprint brand for the fourth consecutive quarter. In the second quarter, the Sprint brand was the fastest-growing postpaid brand of all major postpaid brands in terms of net new customers. 354,000 net adds in the third quarter represents over a 5% annualized growth rate in the size of the total Sprint postpaid customer base. So it is likely the brand will achieve this fastest-growing distinction yet again this quarter.
Virtually all of Sprint's brand metrics have improved year-over-year. As I have mentioned on previous calls, Sprint brand metrics, like most want to investigate and purchase consideration, have improved much more quickly among Sprint customers who have experienced our improved customer service than they have with non-customers. It is in this context that I'm pleased to announced that we are net port positive for both the Sprint brand and on the CDMA platform for the first time on record. That is based on our porting data, more customers are switching to Sprint than are switching from Sprint. An indication of how the brand is strengthened with noncustomers is that port ends from our competitors have practically doubled year-over-year. Based upon Sprint's data, they're up 95%.
Our share of postpaid gross adds improved for the fifth consecutive quarter, and we estimate it's up over 400 basis points year-over-year. Year-over-year, total postpaid net add performance improved by almost 700,000, our best third quarter year-over-year improvement ever. As I mentioned earlier, our 644,000 total company net adds in the quarter is our best since 2006.
Please turn to Slide 7. Devices are becoming increasingly important in attracting and retaining customers. PC World ranks the Samsung Epic 4G, launched in the third quarter, and the HTC Evo 4G, launched in the second, as the two best smartphones on the market, ahead of the iPhone 4 and ahead of every other Android device. ZDNet ranks the Evo as the best smartphone on the market. Each device has a long list of accolades, and smartphones are helping to fuel our momentum, with 60% of our Sprint handset sales and upgrades being smartphones in the quarter.
Also in the third quarter, Sprint launched the Samsung Intercept, Sanyo's Innuendo and Vero, the BlackBerry 9330 Curve, the Motorola i1, which is the world's first Nextel Direct Connect Smartphone powered by Android and the Franklin Wireless U600 which is a 3G/4G USB modem. In prepaid, we launched Motorola's Rambler and Bali, Samsung's Seek and Intercept and the BlackBerry 8530.
If you turn to Slide 8, in prepaid, our multi-brand strategy allows us to address multiple segments with specific offers, distinct brand identities and unique business models. Despite the extremely competitive environment and the recent integration of prepaid in the Sprint's consumer organization, we feel we have momentum. Prepaid net adds of 471,000 are an improvement of almost 300,000 from last quarter, with churn improving 29 basis points from Q2 to our lowest prepaid churn level in almost five years. 
We continue to enhance the Boost CDMA device lineup with the BlackBerry Curve and our first touch screen QWERTY, the Samsung Seek. Two weeks ago, we launched the next evolution of Boost, monthly unlimited with shrinkage. This revolutionary approach rewards customers for on-time payments by shrinking their monthly bills after six, 12 and 18 on-time payments. This is a win-win for Boost and its customers. Lastly, two important brand metrics for Boost, brand awareness and purchase consideration, both reached all-time highs in our most recent study.
Assurance Wireless was available in 11 states at the end of the quarter, and as we said last quarter, we plan on being in 20 states by the end of the year. We are relaunching the Virgin Mobile brand. Virgin Mobile launched its ""Crazy Life"" national marketing campaign in July. Virgin Mobile's Beyond Talk launched its first Android device, the Samsung Intercept, in October giving it compelling BlackBerry and Android offers. We expect to see a growth in prepaid net adds in the fourth quarter.
Sprint continues to innovate and lead in the areas of open and simplicity, and we've added another proof point of this recently with our announcement of Sprint ID, which is on Slide 9. Sprint ID is about accessing content. There are so many apps out there, Google, just yesterday, reported the Android has over 100,000, that mobile users need a trusted app search and aggregation partner to simplify navigating through this ocean of apps and finding the best and most relevant apps for their needs. To launch this revolutionary concept, we lined up some of the world's best brands like Yahoo!, HSN, Disney, ESPN, LatCel and eBay. 
Sprint ID opens a two-way street between content providers and users, and Sprint's open philosophy enables this rather than restricts it. ID-less customers download packs of apps, widgets, ringtones and wallpapers, aggregated and optimize by a trusted brand. A customer can have up to five IDs at once, be they personal or business.
We announced three new Sprint ID-enabled Android devices, the Samsung Transform, the Sanyo ZIO and the LG Optimus S, priced at under $150, $100 and under $50, respectively. Many content providers will also be new distribution partners for us.
Improving our environment continues to be a top Sprint priority. If you go to Slide 10, you'll see that Newsweek ranked Sprint number six nationally among the 100 Greenest Companies. The only telecom company in the top 50. As a matter fact, the only one in the top 95. Sprint also placed first among all technology companies for actual environmental impact, which measures 750 performance metrics. Out of the 500 companies researched, only one scored higher in this measure.
We recently launched a certified pre-owned device program to give wireless phones a second life. This program not only allows customers to get one of today's devices at a great value, but it also helps Sprint to achieve our aggressive reuse and recycling goals. All Sprint certified pre-owned devices are thoroughly inspected, tested and if necessary, remanufactured according to original equipment manufacturer new unit specifications, and they come with a 30-day return policy. Devices available include the BlackBerry Tour, the Samsung Reclaim in green and the Sanyo 2700 in pink and blue.
PC Magazine awarded the Samsung Restore and the LG Remarq its GreenTech seal, joining the Samsung Reclaim, which was also named the World's Greenest Cellphone by CalFinder.
Many on this call are investors. So you maybe interested to know that in August, Sprint was chosen one of The 20 Most Responsible Companies in the U.S. by GovernanceMetrics International out of 4,100 companies evaluated. The overall ratings are based on six broad categories, board accountability, financial disclosure and internal controls, shareholder rights, renumeration, market for control and corporate behavior.
Leading in 4G has been an important element of our strategy this year. In the third quarter, we launched 19 4G markets including Jacksonville, Boston, Providence, Orlando, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Pittsburgh, and fourth quarter markets planned include New York, L.A. and San Francisco. 
For some time, Sprint has been in discussions with Clearwire regarding the financial status of its ongoing operations, as well as Sprint potentially providing new financing. We expect those discussions to continue as we review alternatives with Clearwire. There is no assurance that the discussions will result in any transaction with Clearwire, and we will provide no additional comments on this matter.
Also, as I mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, we intend, through the network modernization plan, to enhance service quality and coverage, create network flexibility, reduce operating costs and improve environmental sustainability. The plan focuses on upgrading the existing EVDO network in providing technology flexibility for 4G. Results of trial activities have shown positive gains in coverage and performance in line with expectations. We expect that improved coverage and next-generation backhaul solutions will enable Sprint to reduce roaming and access costs.
The deployment of multimode equipment allows Sprint to more feasibly consider new technologies using available spectrum brands and reduce future deployment costs. Under the network plan, if we choose, we can reallocate a portion of available iDEN 800 megahertz spectrum to provision CDMA services, giving customers the benefit of enhanced in-building coverage associated with the 800 megahertz band. The implementation of the network modernization plan should further Sprint's reputation as a leader in environmental responsibility through improvements in physical footprint, power consumption and cooling requirements. We will provide more details on the overall plan when vendor selection is complete later this year.  
So in conclusion, although our momentum continues as we have achieved a number of all-time bests for two quarters in a row, we realized we have much progress still to make. We are in a hyper-competitive industry with strong capable competitors, so making continued progress is hard work here but we intend to persevere. 
I will now turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Brust, who will discuss our financial performance."
417206,114228229,82251,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. Moving onto Slide 11. We are pleased with the continued stabilization of revenue on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Total quarterly revenues grew year-over-year for the first time in more than three y",841,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. Moving onto Slide 11. We are pleased with the continued stabilization of revenue on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Total quarterly revenues grew year-over-year for the first time in more than three years. This improvement was a result of acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2009 and higher equipment and prepaid service revenues, partially offset by lower wireline and postpaid service revenues. Total quarterly revenues improved sequentially, primarily due to higher equipment revenue.
Wireless service revenues, which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues, were also relatively stable sequentially and year-over-year. The reduction in postpaid subscriber losses and the continued growth in prepaid subscribers have been the key drivers in stabilizing revenue. In the third quarter of 2009, Sprint lost 545,000 wireless subscribers. And this year, in the third quarter, we gained 644,000 total wireless subscribers. This year-over-year improvement of almost $1.2 million net subscriber additions has had a meaningful impact on our revenue results. Revenue improvement continues to be a primary focus for the company.
Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $1.339 billion, down $162 million sequentially and down $167 million from a year ago. Adjusted OIBDA margins declined 200 basis points sequentially. Adjusted OIBDA declined sequentially, primarily due to higher retail gross adds and upgrades, which drove higher subsidy and selling expenses. Both postpaid and prepaid gross adds increased by more than 10% as compared to the second quarter. Although we incur costs to bring new customers onto our network, it is money well spent. As we have said, an important factor in turning around the company's financial performance is growing our customer base and as a result, improving revenue.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect that postpaid gross adds will improve sequentially, driving higher associated subsidy and selling expense. Cost of service was higher sequentially, due largely to the effects of seasonality, including higher roaming, service and repair and cell site utility expenses.
Postpaid ARPU remains stable sequentially at $55. The mix of subscribers in our postpaid customer base who own a smartphone continues to grow, which along with Any Mobile Anytime help drive adoption of database bundled plans. However, the positive impact of higher monthly recurring charges was offset by lower usage base charges, including overage. Prepaid ARPU was essentially flat. Looking forward, overall prepaid ARPU will be impacted by, in the short-term, by shifts and mix of our prepaid subscriber base along with our brands.
Wireline contribution to adjusted OIBDA was relatively stable sequentially, as the revenue decline was mostly offset by a decline in cost of service. Revenue was lower primarily due to lower voice volume and adjustments associated with carrier disputes impacting IP. The improvement in cost of service was primarily driven by lower voice volume and a slight improvement in switch access rates. We expect pressure on wireline revenue and OIBDA in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by continued lower voice volume.
Moving to Slide 13. We generated $384 million of free cash flow in the third quarter. This was down from $709 million in the second quarter, primarily due to a reduction in cash flow from operations, which includes higher interest payments, which is typical for the third quarter. Through the first three quarters of 2010, we have generated a net total of $1.6 billion free cash flow. We expect to continue to generate a meaningful level of positive cash flow in the fourth quarter.
We ended the quarter with $4.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. As we discussed during our second quarter earnings call, we have repaid the $750 million note that came due in June of 2010. This was our only note maturity due in 2010. Looking ahead at debt maturities, we have $1.65 billion maturing in January of 2011 and $2.75 billion in 2012. We expect to pay the 2011 and 2012 maturities as scheduled.
We expect to end 2010 with a strong cash balance in preparation for our first quarter 2011 maturity payment. Our goal continues to be to maintain an average cash balance of approximately $4 billion. Capital expenditures were $462 million in the third quarter compared to $437 million in the second quarter and $431 million in the third quarter of 2009. Capital investment in 2010 has focused on wireless quality, coverage and capacity to maintain competitive positions and data services and network quality.
Our total cell sites including CDMA and iDEN is approximately 68,000, reflecting the additions from the iPCS acquisition. We still expect that full year 2010 capital spending will be up to $2 billion.
In summary, our priorities have remained constant. In 2010, our focus is on stabilizing revenue. Next year, if our subscriber results continue to improve, we expect to start seeing revenue growth. We have made progress on our key objectives through the first three quarters of 2010. We still have a lot more work to do on the turnaround, but we are encouraged by how far we have come. 
Now I will turn it back to Yijing for questions."

Subs are declining on the iDEN network and as I mentioned earlier on the call, we're doing I think a lot for our customers on iDEN. They're being provided with the best call quality, lowest blocking rates that they've ever had. We continued to launch new devices, I'm talking on the postpaid side. And on the prepaid side, what you're seeing is with the launch of the Boost Unlimited on CDMA with some attractive and more attractively priced CDMA devices, an increasing number of prepaid customers, they're looking at Boost or choosing CDMA over iDEN. So we are really focusing on iDEN on keeping churn down and actually, churn is beginning to approach CDMA levels of churn on postpaid. So we're doing a better job on churn on iDEN. What we're not doing though is we have limited advertising and marketing dollars. We're spending very little on iDEN going after new customers because if you think of your marketing spend as a zero-sum gain, we're going to get a better return on that investment putting that on the Sprint brand and on the Nextel brand. So you are seeing, if you will, a decline in both postpaid and prepaid customers on the iDEN network, but we're focusing on providing them with great service. And what it's allowing us to do is, if you will, in a far more use some of that 800 megahertz spectrum, which we are trialing and testing now, potentially on CDMA to provide better in-building and service quality on our CDMA service. So there's a very valuable spectrum that we can get good utilization out of. And as I mentioned, also, from a device point of view, we launched the first Android handset on iDEN in the third quarter. Secondly, with respect to the iPhone, it's hard to speculate on that. We'll just have to see what happens. But quite frankly, of course, all the carriers are thinking about 2011 and the implications. But I just don't want to speculate on it."

The second question had to do with, I think, what is driving our improvements in SOGA and port ratios and what have you between rate plans and devices. I'd say it's really both of them. We've improved our device lineup very significantly and one of the very key trends in our industry has been each year that devices are becoming a more and more important part of the marketing plan and what customers base their decisions on. As a matter fact, it's probably becoming the most important overall factor, and it was not that case just a couple of years ago. But clearly, the rate plans are important and very importantly, from a port out point of view, because if customers are on a good rate plan and they like the nature of the rate plan, the simplicity of the rate plan, the value of it, they're much less likely to leave. So our focus is on devices, the network, the quality of the network, both 3G and 4G, first 4G is important and improve customer experience. Because as you also heard on the call, was that our brand metrics continue to improve. But they're up sharply among our existing customers. So that's helping with churn. So net-net, for us, we believe they're both important, devices and rate plans. But as time goes on, devices are becoming even more important than rate plans."

The vast majority of upgrades and gross adds are smartphones, which are higher ARPU relative to the base. So it seems strange that we haven't been able to see more of that come through, and I'm wondering if it's because older customers are repricing at lower plans or if you could dig into that a little bit more, it'd be great. And then second, maybe Dan, not necessarily on the Clearwire question directly, but Clearwire has been throwing out a lot of options to show people that there are many strategies that they have. I think the sense is that Sprint has only one strategy right now, which is Clearwire, which may or may not be true.

You have higher MRC's, monthly recurring charges, on average, fewer fees on overages and of course, that's reflected on the positive side in churn improvements because customers don't like overages.

I guess the first is with normal seasonality, which would suggest the downtick in churn, it should mean positive net adds or within reach in 4Q. I'm wondering, how you would think through how likely that is. And then second, as it relates to your gross adds continuing to move up and then a continued large device upgrade percentage in your base, it seems like no real relief on the horizon, at least in the near term for wireless margin. So how should we think through your balancing efforts on postpaid and sort of improving the trajectory there relative to what's happening on the margin line?"

And you'll see, if you will, in our new kind of guidance language or forecast language for Q4, that you could expect an improvement in both postpaid, prepaid and total kind of net add performance sequentially in Q4 versus Q3. But I won't elaborate more than that. But clearly, we're working to improve those numbers. With respect to upgrades and I think you're getting at subsidies and what have you, that is kind of the challenge in our industry of where smartphones, and this is related to the last question, give us benefits in ARPU and churn but of course also have increased subsidy so increased CPGA and then kind of increased cost of service that go with them. And so far, the benefits have outstripped the downside. We are working very closely and hard with our suppliers to continue to give us better price phones and we work very hard on the mix. And that's why, actually, our cost for the devices was better this quarter than it was in previous quarters, mainly because we've been able to work very effectively on, not only device pricing, but device mix. That being said, in terms of margins, if you look at the margins in our business, the biggest issue for us from a margin point of view is the cost of service associated with running two networks. And it will take us, I mentioned it near the end of my comments on the earnings call, we have a network modernization plan out there that we're currently evaluating. We're going to decide, and we haven't yet, who we're choosing, what the economics are, how quickly we deploy that or what have you. But it takes a while to implement that, so you wouldn't start to see the significant benefits of that probably occurring until 2012 or so. So that's the biggest opportunity we have, if you will, on the margin side, is our activity on the network."

So in terms of overall priorities, in terms of us doing this, the primary driver is cost reduction and is economic improvement. But it has added benefits, if you will, the icing on the cake in terms of also giving us superior network performance, it makes it easier for us to more effectively use multimode technology, for example, and I mentioned, using the 800 megahertz band for CDMA as well and do that cost effectively. So the biggest driver is to improve our cost position. And it has added performance benefits that come along with it because of the way technology's improved over the past few years."

And you have to pick the time when you launch a market. And then as you well know, over time, our customers should expect that local coverage will improve, very much like the earlier days of PCS when service roamed on analog in addition to digital. It's no different. So over time, you will begin to see those coverage holes fill in and, if you will, 3G provides a very good safety net. And in the early days of rolling this out, you're going to see fairly robust 3G usage. You also had a question about is three to four years the fastest. Well, no, not necessarily. You mean the fastest that it could be done technically, but we look at a lot of factors, operating risks, financial, cash, all those things that I just think four is probably a good midpoint, if you will, to think about in terms of how long we would take to roll this out."

For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO, Bob Brust, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter. Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations Page of the Sprint website. 
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of the risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and in Part II Item 1A Risk Factors of our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
Turning to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the third quarter can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Next, I would like to cover our EPS results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the third quarter was $0.30 compared to $0.25 in the second quarter 2010 and $0.17 in the year-ago period. The sequential change in EPS was due primarily to the drivers that also impacted the sequential change in OIBDA, which Bob Brust will discuss in more detail later on the call.

If you'd turn to Slide 4. I was asked at an investor conference recently to describe Sprint's performance in one word, and I chose the word momentum. Our last two quarte",2023,"Thank you, Yijing, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining us this morning. If you'd turn to Slide 4. I was asked at an investor conference recently to describe Sprint's performance in one word, and I chose the word momentum. Our last two quarters, the second and third quarters of 2010, represent the best quarters ever for Sprint, both in postpaid churn and in year-over-year improvement in postpaid net adds. Driven by our best retail net add performance in over four years, we grew total wireless subscribers by 644,000 in the third quarter, our highest quarterly net add total since 2006.
As is my habit, I'll discuss our results in the context of Sprint's three overarching priorities: the customer experience, the brand and cash. As a change of pace, let me start with the third, cash. Primarily driven by more postpaid and prepaid gross adds and upgrades, plus some anticipated seasonal factors, quarterly OIBDA was driven down sequentially to $1.34 billion. Year-to-date, free cash flow now stands at $1.6 billion, allowing us to maintain strong liquidity with a cash and cash equivalents balance of $4.7 billion. Total net operating revenues increased sequentially and year-over-year.
Please go to Slide 5. With respect to the customer experience, I'm pleased to report that we've achieved our 11th consecutive quarter of improvement in Customer Care Satisfaction and in First Call Resolution. Top box satisfaction and bottom box satisfaction both achieved all-time bests as did First Call Resolution. Our networks achieved yet another all-time best result for fewest blocked calls. In a recent third-party survey, our customers gave Sprint our highest rating ever on network satisfaction. According to the recent J.D. Power and Associates Wireless Call Quality Performance Study, Sprint came in first or second place in five of six regions, and we have shown the most improvement of any carrier over a three-year period.
In the J.D. Power Retail Sales Satisfaction Study, Sprint moved from last place in recent years to a virtual tie for first place. In the Vocalabs National Customer Service Survey, Sprint's call satisfaction tied for first place. 
On the business side, we won seven ATLANTIC-ACM Awards for Business Connectivity and Wireless Business Excellence, and Sprint, again, walked away with the top honors in the Nemertes 2010 PilotHouse Awards for MPLS Services receiving the top overall score.
The customer experience improvements are reflected in our churn results. As mentioned, the last two quarters have been the best two churn quarters in our history. The percentage of postpaid customers that carry a prime credit rating remains at a strong 84%, an important determinant of involuntary churn.
On the voluntary side, customers who are on contract churn at a lower rate than those who are off contract. We are getting more customers on contract, but our off contract churn the past two quarters has been our lowest on record, and our return rate in the first 30 days is actually lower since we launched Sprint's unique full 30-day Money Back Guarantee this year than it has been for any previous year on record.
Moving to Slide 6, into brand. The Sprint brand continues to gain strength. One measure of brand health is subscribers. In the third quarter, we had positive postpaid net adds for the Sprint brand for the fourth consecutive quarter. 
In the second quarter, the Sprint brand was the fastest-growing postpaid brand of all major postpaid brands in terms of net new customers. 354,000 net adds in the third quarter represents over a 5% annualized growth rate in the size of the total Sprint postpaid customer base. So it is likely the brand will achieve this fastest-growing distinction yet again this quarter.
Virtually all of Sprint's brand metrics have improved year-over-year. As I have mentioned on previous calls, Sprint brand metrics, like most want to investigate and purchase consideration, have improved much more quickly among Sprint customers who have experienced our improved customer service than they have with non-customers. It is in this context that I'm pleased to announce that we are net port positive for both the Sprint brand and on the CDMA platform for the first time on record. That is based on our porting data, more customers are switching to Sprint than are switching from Sprint. An indication of how the brand has strengthened with noncustomers is that port ends from our competitors have practically doubled year-over-year. Based upon Sprint's data, they're up 95%.
Our share of postpaid gross adds improved for the fifth consecutive quarter, and we estimate it's up over 400 basis points year-over-year. Year-over-year, total postpaid net add performance improved by almost 700,000, our best third quarter year-over-year improvement ever. As I mentioned earlier, our 644,000 total company net adds in the quarter is our best since 2006.
Please turn to Slide 7. Devices are becoming increasingly important in attracting and retaining customers. PC World ranks the Samsung Epic 4G, launched in the third quarter, and the HTC EVO 4G, launched in the second, as the two best smartphones on the market, ahead of the iPhone 4 and ahead of every other Android device. ZDNet ranks the EVO as the best smartphone on the market. Each device has a long list of accolades, and smartphones are helping to fuel our momentum, with 60% of our Sprint handset sales and upgrades being smartphones in the quarter.
Also in the third quarter, Sprint launched the Samsung Intercept, Sanyo's Innuendo and Vero, the BlackBerry 9330 Curve, the Motorola i1, which is the world's first Nextel Direct Connect Smartphone powered by Android and the Franklin Wireless U600 which is a 3G/4G USB modem. In prepaid, we launched Motorola's Rambler and Bali, Samsung's Seek and Intercept and the BlackBerry 8530.
If you turn to Slide 8. In prepaid, our multi-brand strategy allows us to address multiple segments with specific offers, distinct brand identities and unique business models. Despite the extremely competitive environment and the recent integration of prepaid in the Sprint's consumer organization, we feel we have momentum. Prepaid net adds of 471,000 are an improvement of almost 300,000 from last quarter, with churn improving 29 basis points from Q2 to our lowest prepaid churn level in almost five years. 
We continue to enhance the Boost CDMA device lineup with the BlackBerry Curve and our first touch screen QWERTY, the Samsung Seek. Two weeks ago, we launched the next evolution of Boost, monthly unlimited with shrinkage. This revolutionary approach rewards customers for on-time payments by shrinking their monthly bills after six, 12 and 18 on-time payments. This is a win-win for Boost and its customers. Lastly, two important brand metrics for Boost, brand awareness and purchase consideration, both reached all-time highs in our most recent study.
Assurance Wireless was available in 11 states at the end of the quarter, and as we said last quarter, we plan on being in 20 states by the end of the year. We are relaunching the Virgin Mobile brand. Virgin Mobile launched its ""Crazy Life"" national marketing campaign in July. Virgin Mobile's Beyond Talk launched its first Android device, the Samsung Intercept, in October, giving it compelling BlackBerry and Android offers. We expect to see a growth in prepaid net adds in the fourth quarter.
Sprint continues to innovate and lead in the areas of open and simplicity, and we've added another proof point of this recently with our announcement of Sprint ID, which is on Slide 9. 
Sprint ID is about accessing content. There are so many apps out there, Google, just yesterday, reported the Android has over 100,000, that mobile users need a trusted app search and aggregation partner to simplify navigating through this ocean of apps and finding the best and most relevant apps for their needs. To launch this revolutionary concept, we lined up some of the world's best brands like Yahoo!, HSN, Disney, ESPN, LatCel and eBay. 
Sprint ID opens a two-way street between content providers and users, and Sprint's open philosophy enables this rather than restricts it. ID-less customers download packs of apps, widgets, ringtones and wallpapers, aggregated and optimized by a trusted brand. A customer can have up to five IDs at once, be they personal or business.
We announced three new Sprint ID-enabled Android devices, the Samsung Transform, the Sanyo ZIO and the LG Optimus S, priced at under $150, $100 and under $50, respectively. Many content providers will also be new distribution partners for us.
Improving our environment continues to be a top Sprint priority. If you go to Slide 10, you'll see that Newsweek ranked Sprint number six nationally among the 100 Greenest Companies, the only telecom company in the top 50. As a matter fact, the only one in the top 95. Sprint also placed first among all technology companies for actual environmental impact, which measures 750 performance metrics. Out of the 500 companies researched, only one scored higher in this measure.
We recently launched a certified pre-owned device program to give wireless phones a second life. This program not only allows customers to get one of today's devices at a great value, but it also helps Sprint to achieve our aggressive reuse and recycling goals. All Sprint certified pre-owned devices are thoroughly inspected, tested and if necessary, remanufactured according to original equipment manufacturer new unit specifications, and they come with a 30-day return policy. Devices available include the BlackBerry Tour, the Samsung Reclaim in green and the Sanyo 2700 in pink and blue.
PC Magazine awarded the Samsung Restore and the LG Remarq its GreenTech seal, joining the Samsung Reclaim, which was also named the World's Greenest Cellphone by CalFinder.
Many on this call are investors. So you may be interested to know that in August, Sprint was chosen one of The 20 Most Responsible Companies in the U.S. by GovernanceMetrics International out of 4,100 companies evaluated. The overall ratings are based on six broad categories, board accountability, financial disclosure and internal controls, shareholder rights, remuneration, market for control and corporate behavior.
Leading in 4G has been an important element of our strategy this year. In the third quarter, we've launched 19 4G markets including Jacksonville, Boston, Providence, Orlando, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Pittsburgh, and fourth quarter markets planned include New York, L.A. and San Francisco. 
For some time, Sprint has been in discussions with Clearwire regarding the financial status of its ongoing operations, as well as Sprint potentially providing new financing. We expect those discussions to continue as we review alternatives with Clearwire. There is no assurance that the discussions will result in any transaction with Clearwire, and we will provide no additional comments on this matter.
Also, as I mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, we intend, through the network modernization plan, to enhance service quality and coverage, create network flexibility, reduce operating costs and improve environmental sustainability. The plan focuses on upgrading the existing EVDO network in providing technology flexibility for 4G. Results of trial activities have shown positive gains in coverage and performance in line with expectations. We expect that improved coverage and next-generation backhaul solutions will enable Sprint to reduce roaming and access costs.
The deployment of multimode equipment allows Sprint to more feasibly consider new technologies using available spectrum bands and reduce future deployment costs. Under the network plan, if we choose, we can reallocate a portion of available iDEN 800 megahertz spectrum to provision CDMA services, giving customers the benefit of enhanced in-building coverage associated with the 800 megahertz band. The implementation of the network modernization plan should further Sprint's reputation as a leader in environmental responsibility through improvements in physical footprint, power consumption and cooling requirements. We will provide more details on the overall plan when vendor selection is complete later this year.  
So in conclusion, although our momentum continues as we have achieved a number of all-time bests for two quarters in a row, we realize we have much progress still to make. We are in a hyper-competitive industry with strong capable competitors, so making continued progress is hard work but we intend to persevere. 
I will now turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Brust, who will discuss our financial performance."
417206,114228229,82283,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. Moving on to Slide 11. We are pleased with the continued stabilization of revenue on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Total quarterly revenues grew year-over-year for the first time in more than three",843,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. Moving on to Slide 11. We are pleased with the continued stabilization of revenue on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Total quarterly revenues grew year-over-year for the first time in more than three years. This improvement was a result of acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2009 and higher equipment and prepaid service revenues, partially offset by lower wireline and postpaid service revenues. Total quarterly revenues improved sequentially primarily due to higher equipment revenue.
Wireless Service revenues, which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues, were also relatively stable sequentially and year-over-year. The reduction in postpaid subscriber losses and the continued growth in prepaid subscribers have been the key drivers in stabilizing revenue. In the third quarter of 2009, Sprint lost 545,000 wireless subscribers. And this year, in the third quarter, we gained 644,000 total wireless subscribers. This year-over-year improvement of almost 1.2 million net subscriber additions has had a meaningful impact on our revenue results. Revenue improvement continues to be a primary focus for the company.
Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $1.339 billion, down $162 million sequentially and down $167 million from a year ago. Adjusted OIBDA margins declined 200 basis points sequentially. Adjusted OIBDA declined sequentially, primarily due to higher retail gross adds and upgrades, which drove higher subsidy and selling expenses. Both postpaid and prepaid gross adds increased by more than 10% as compared to the second quarter. Although we incur cost to bring new customers onto our network, it is money well spent. As we have said, an important factor in turning around the company's financial performance is growing our customer base and as a result, improving revenue.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect that postpaid gross adds will improve sequentially, driving higher associated subsidy and selling expense. Cost of service was higher sequentially due largely to the effects of seasonality, including higher roaming, service and repair and cell site utility expenses.
Postpaid ARPU remains stable sequentially at $55. The mix of subscribers in our postpaid customer base who own a smartphone continues to grow, which along with Any Mobile, Anytime help drive adoption of database bundled plans. However, the positive impact of higher monthly recurring charges was offset by lower usage base charges, including overage. Prepaid ARPU was essentially flat. Looking forward, overall prepaid ARPU will be impacted by, in the short term, by shifts and mix of our prepaid subscriber base along with our brands.
Wireline contribution to adjusted OIBDA was relatively stable sequentially as the revenue decline was mostly offset by a decline in cost of service. Revenue was lower primarily due to lower voice volume and adjustments associated with carrier disputes impacting IP. The improvement in cost of service was primarily driven by lower voice volume and a slight improvement in switch access rates. We expect pressure on wireline revenue and OIBDA in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by continued lower voice volume.
Moving to Slide 13. We generated $384 million of free cash flow in the third quarter. This was down from $709 million in the second quarter, primarily due to a reduction in cash flow from operations, which includes higher interest payments, which is typical for the third quarter. Through the first three quarters of 2010, we have generated a net total of $1.6 billion free cash flow. We expect to continue to generate a meaningful level of positive cash flow in the fourth quarter.
We ended the quarter with $4.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. As we discussed during our second quarter earnings call, we have repaid the $750 million note that came due in June of 2010. This was our only note maturity due in 2010. Looking ahead at debt maturities, we have $1.65 billion maturing in January of 2011 and $2.75 billion in 2012. We expect to pay the 2011 and 2012 maturities as scheduled.
We expect to end 2010 with a strong cash balance in preparation for our first quarter 2011 maturity payment. Our goal continues to be to maintain an average cash balance of approximately $4 billion. 
Capital expenditures were $462 million in the third quarter compared to $437 million in the second quarter and $431 million in the third quarter of 2009. Capital investment in 2010 has focused on wireless quality, coverage and capacity to maintain competitive positions and data services and network quality.
Our total cell sites including CDMA and iDEN is approximately 68,000, reflecting the additions from the iPCS acquisition. We still expect that full year 2010 capital spending will be up to $2 billion.
In summary, our priorities have remained constant. In 2010, our focus is on stabilizing revenue. Next year, if our subscriber results continue to improve, we expect to start seeing revenue growth. We have made progress on our key objectives through the first three quarters of 2010. We still have a lot more work to do on the turnaround, but we are encouraged by how far we have come. 
Now I will turn it back to Yijing for questions."

Subs are declining on the iDEN network and as I mentioned earlier on the call, we're doing I think a lot for our customers on iDEN. They're being provided with the best call quality, lowest blocking rates that they've ever had. We continued to launch new devices, I'm talking on the postpaid side. And on the prepaid side, what you're seeing is with the launch of the Boost Unlimited on CDMA with some attractive and more attractively priced CDMA devices, an increasing number of prepaid customers, they're looking at Boost or choosing CDMA over iDEN. So we're really focusing on iDEN on keeping churn down, and actually churn is beginning to approach CDMA levels of churn on postpaid. So we're doing a better job on churn on iDEN. What we're not doing though is we have limited advertising and marketing dollars. We're spending very little on iDEN going after new customers because if you think of your marketing spend as a zero-sum gain, we're going to get a better return on that investment putting that on the Sprint brand and on the Nextel brand. So you are seeing, if you will, a decline in both postpaid and prepaid customers on the iDEN network, but we're focusing on providing them with great service. And what it's allowing us to do is, if you will kind of farm or use some of that 800 megahertz spectrum, which we are trialing and testing now, potentially on CDMA to provide better in-building and service quality on our CDMA service. So there's a very valuable spectrum that we can get good utilization out of. And as I mentioned also from a device point of view, we launched the first Android handset on iDEN in the third quarter. Secondly, with respect to the iPhone, it's hard to speculate on that. We'll just have to see what happens. But quite frankly, of course, all the carriers are thinking about 2011 and the implications. But I just don't want to speculate on it."

So 60% of our new sales, if you will, of phones, both gross adds and upgrades, 60% were smartphones this quarter, which brings us to about 45% of our base being smartphones, if that answers your question. The second question had to do with, I think, what is driving our improvements in SOGA and port ratios and what have you between rate plans and devices. I'd say it's really both of them. We've improved our device lineup very significantly and one of the very key trends in our industry has been each year that devices are becoming a more and more important part of the marketing plan and what customers base their decisions on. As a matter fact, it's probably becoming the most important overall factor, and it was not that case just a couple of years ago. But clearly, the rate plans are important and very importantly, from a port out point of view, because if customers are on a good rate plan and they like the nature of the rate plan, the simplicity of the rate plan, the value of it, they're much less likely to leave. So our focus is on devices, the network, the quality of the network, both 3G and 4G, first 4G is important and improve customer experience. Because as you also heard on the call, was that our brand metrics continue to improve. But they're up sharply among our existing customers. So that's helping with churn. So net-net, for us, we believe they're both important, devices and rate plans. But as time goes on, devices are becoming even more important than rate plans."

And I'm wondering if it's because older customers are repricing at lower plans or if you could dig into that a little bit more, it'd be great. And then second, maybe Dan, not necessarily on the Clearwire question directly, but Clearwire has been throwing out a lot of options to show people that there are many strategies that they have.

You have higher MRC's, monthly recurring charges on average, fewer fees on overages and of course, that's reflected on the positive side in churn improvements because customers don't like overages.

But I won't elaborate more than that. But clearly, we're working to improve those numbers. With respect to upgrades and I think you're getting at subsidies and what have you, that is kind of the challenge in our industry of where smartphones, and this is related to the last question, give us benefits in ARPU and churn but of course also have increased subsidy so increased CPGA and then kind of increased cost of service that go with them. And so far, the benefits have outstripped the downside. We are working very closely and hard with our suppliers to continue to give us better price phones and we work very hard on the mix. And that's why, actually, our cost for the devices was better this quarter than it was in previous quarters, mainly because we've been able to work very effectively on, not only device pricing, but device mix. That being said, in terms of margins, if you look at the margins in our business, the biggest issue for us from a margin point of view is the cost of service associated with running two networks. And it will take us, I mentioned it near the end of my comments on the earnings call, we have a network modernization plan out there that we're currently evaluating. We're going to decide, and we haven't yet, who we're choosing, what the economics are, how quickly we deploy that or what have you.

But we don't want to lose segments of the market because we don't have price points in other parts of the, if you will, the continuum of data use. So it's something that we just continue to monitor. It helped us not only improve churn but lower our costs and improve the overall, if you will, care and retail experience by two years ago, we eliminated 85% of our A plan combinations, and that simplicity really helps the business.

So there's an outstanding letter of credit out there at $1.33 billion, but that's down $255 million this quarter. And the rebanding process is likely to continue even beyond 2012. So the process will take some time. With respect to your second question, yes, the network modernization project is a very, very important part of utilizing the 800 frequency for CDMA. It makes sense to do that as part of the project. And the other thing that goes along with it is new CDMA handsets that are also capable of operating at those lower 800 megahertz frequencies that our existing base of handsets are not. It's not a big change. It's a fairly minor one, but it's still something that we need to seed new devices into the marketplace. So it's not, if you will, it's not something that we will do immediately. So there are two elements in essence that we're really waiting for before we do it in a what we'll call a meaningful fashion.
