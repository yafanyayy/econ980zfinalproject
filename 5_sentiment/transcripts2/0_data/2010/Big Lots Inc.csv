As discussed in this morning's press release, our Q4 results contain one item and fiscal 2009 results contain two items in continuing operations that we believe are not directly related to the company's ongoing operations. Accordingly, we have provided a non-GAAP reconciliation for both the fourth quarter and the full year fiscal 2009. And those schedules are attached to today's press release. We prefer to focus on the ongoing operations of the business, so the balance of our prepared comments will be based on non-GAAP results from continuing operations.

From the merchants to the stores, to the marketing programs, to the distribution centers that deliver the goods, Q4 was a wonderful example of solid execution of a plan that was months in the making. From a sales per",690,"Thanks, TJ and good morning, everyone. From the merchants to the stores, to the marketing programs, to the distribution centers that deliver the goods, Q4 was a wonderful example of solid execution of a plan that was months in the making. From a sales perspective, two observations were very clear to us. First, the customer returned, and was in the mood to shop this Christmas season. And second, if you provide great value and newness in your merchandise offering, the customer will absolutely respond and reward you with a register. This was very clear in Q4, as our comps increased 5% with all major merchandise divisions in all regions of the country, performing well and exceeding their plans. In terms of merchandising, the strength was broad-based with the furniture, home and hard lines leading the way with comps up in the high single digits, followed by seasonal toys and consumables, comping up in the low to mid-singles. We were very encouraged by the accelerating trends in furniture during Q4, as new items and new styles in upholstery and case goods were well received by the customer. Additionally, our mattress business got healthy in Q4 and comped up in line with the rest of the division. For the second consecutive quarter, Home was a leading category in the store. Newness and better quality goods were again a successful formula. Real good closeout deals from new vendors and better brands resonated with the consumer. In hard lines, it was all about our Electronics business, which comped up in the 20s in Q4. The chain-wide rollout of our video game software program exceeded our expectations and the availability of DVDs, digital cameras, MP3 players and accessories helped drive results. Electronics vendors, in particular, are getting more and more comfortable selling to us, and are repeatedly surprised by how much volume we bring to them as a new customer.Seasonal and toys each performed well and were important to our Q4 success. Combined, these areas can be upwards of 25% to 30% of our business in any given week in November and December. In seasonal, the customer responded to the extreme value we offered in lighting and trees. Interesting to note here, that items with higher average item retail and higher perceived value did very well, which is an encouraging sign when we look forward to spring and our opportunities in lawn and garden. The shift towards a more branded assortment in toys also helped drive positive Q4 comps. More branded goods, new vendors and deeper relationships with existing vendors, are all trends we anticipate continuing into 2010. Our Consumables business comped up in the low single digits. Our vendor relationships are stronger and deeper, and the availability of excess merchandise continues to be more than enough for us to successfully manage this business. So broad-based performance across most of the areas of the store, and our buying teams manage their businesses really well in Q4, as inventories finished the quarter, down 2% per store the last year. From a store's perspective, it was the best executed holiday season I've seen from this business. The talent we've added to the team, along with our ready-for-business initiatives, have improved the shopability of our stores and hopefully left a more favorable impression of Big Lots to encourage more frequent future visits from our customers. In terms of marketing, the Buzz Club Rewards program exceeded our expectations. And as of last week, we have over 1.4 million members. There were trends at the store level that suggests rewards can be a basket driver, as reward customers spent nearly double what the average customer spends. But also we're learning that rewards can be a transaction driver, which I'll touch on later.In summary, Q4 surpassed even our highest expectations. As operating profit dollars increased 30% compared to last year, we generated record EPS that were up 31% to last year's record performance. And we managed our business very prudently, and ended the year with over $280 million of cash and no debt.  Now Joe is going to give you some details on the quarter and our expectations for 2010. Joe?"

The increase was driven by a comparable store sales increase of 5.1%, strong sales",2512,"Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $1.463 billion, a 7.0% increase, compared to $1.367 billion for the fourth quarter of last year. The increase was driven by a comparable store sales increase of 5.1%, strong sales from our non-comp or newer stores, along with a slight increase in our average store count in Q4.  We estimate that our comps for Q4 benefited by approximately 1% from one additional shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Our Q4 comps are 5.1%, exceeded our most recent guidance, which called for comps of 3.5% to 4.5%, thanks to a better-than-expected performance in January. For the fourth quarter, our operating profit dollars increased $40.3 million or 30% to last year. This increase was driven by the 7% increase in total sales, along with an expansion of our operating profit rate by 220 basis points to 11.9% of sales. Our Q4 gross margin rate was 41.3% or 90 basis points above last year. The increase in last year was due to favorable initial mark-up on goods sold, lower import freight costs and a lower shrink accrual rate partially offset by an increase in domestic freight costs, resulting from the higher price of diesel fuel compared to last year. Total SG&A dollars including depreciation were $431.3 million. The fourth quarter SG&A rate of 29.5% was 120 basis points below last year. We generated leverage in store payroll for better hours allocation. And our initiatives in transportation to have dollar reductions that were only partially offset by higher fuel costs. Advertising expenses were below last year, benefiting from lower costs in the marketplace. And we were able to lower our ad circular costs by reducing some of our print distribution.Utilities and depreciation were again below last year levels, and we benefited from the leveraging impact that a 5.1% comp has on occupancy costs and insurance. All of this leverage was partially offset by the accelerated vesting of restricted stock grants, based on our above planned performance for fiscal 2009.Net interest expense was $0.4 million for the quarter compared to $1.1 million last year, with the improvement of result to the cash generated by the business over the last 12 months, partially offset by higher amortization expense related to our new bank facility issuance costs. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was 37.3% compared to last year's rate of 38.1%. The tax rate difference is principally attributable to a valuation adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 related to assets held for our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. In total, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we reported income from continuing operations of $108.6 million or $1.31 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $81.8 million or $1 per diluted share a year ago.  Our earnings of $1.31 per diluted share were better than our previously-communicated guidance, which called for earnings of $1.19 to $1.24 per diluted share. Comparing to the high-end of our guidance, approximately $0.02 of the beat [ph] came from better-than-expected January sales, $0.02 came from a better-than-expected gross margin rate, $0.02 came from lower SG&A, because we did not incur pension settlement charge that was contemplated in our guidance and also, there was only minimal flex on the upside sales to our comp guidance. And finally, approximately $0.01 came from lower than anticipated tax rate.Turning to the balance sheet, inventory ended the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 at $731 million compared to $737 million last year. This represents a 2% decrease per store. For the year, we achieved record inventory turnover of 3.7x compared to 3.6x last year. Cash flow, which we defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities, increased by $32 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to last year. Cash flow for the full year was $314 million, which was above our guidance of $215 million, due to higher net income, lower inventory levels and better AP leverage, with the largest portion of the increase coming from AP leverage. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $284 million and no borrowings under our credit facility, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $35 million and borrowings under our credit facility of $62 million last year.During the fourth quarter, there was no opportunistic share repurchase activity conducted under the $150 million share repurchase program, which was approved by our Board of Directors in December. For the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $16.8 million, compared to $13.2 million last year. The increase to the prior year is primarily attributable to more new store construction activity than last year and higher SAP spending year-over-year. Our fourth quarter investment in SAP related to the finance wholesale systems that went live last month and the continued development work on the merchandising module. Depreciation expense for the quarter was $18.6 million or $1.2 million lower than last year.Moving on to 2010, in guidance, overall, we're planning 2010 EPS to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.75 per diluted share, compared to 2009's income from continuing operations of $2.37 per diluted share. Our 2010 plan calls for a comparable store sales increase of 3% to 4%, and a total sales dollar increase in the range of 5% to 6% compared to fiscal 2009. At this level of sales, we're estimating a 10% to 14% increase in operating profit dollars. We anticipate our operating profit rate to be in the range of 7.0% to 7.2% or 30 to 50 basis points higher than fiscal 2009, with the expansion coming from a lower expense rate.Our gross margin rate for 2010 is expected to be similar to 2009, as solid initial mark-up, favorable shrink experience and disciplined inventory management, resulting in a slightly lower markdown rate are expected to be offset by higher freight costs, both domestic and imports.As many of you know, there has been a tremendous amount of progress on the cost structure of the last several years. The important takeaway from today's call should be that we are not finished. Our improved business processes, combined with 2010 initiatives, give us the confidence in this year's plan, which begins to leverage expenses at approximately a flat comp.  Additionally, for many of these same reasons, we believe SG&A leverage is possible for the next couple of years, as Steve will touch on shortly. Our forecasted 2010 expense leverage of 30 to 50 basis points is expected to come from several different sources. We have initiatives to lower costs in advertising, utilities and insurance. In terms of advertising, you recall, we have tested and executed reductions in the distribution of print advertising. And these changes began back in the fall of 2009. We believe more opportunities exist to reduce the amount of print distribution per circular and will continue to test in 2010. Additionally, we anticipate that the print advertising costs will be very competitive and rate decreases are possible. Next, in terms of utilities, we've decided to make a sizable investment in energy management systems or EMS in 2010. This is another example of an initiative that we've tested over time and have determined as a good use of capital. Stores with EMS have been averaging in the neighborhood of a 15% reduction in utility costs. Today, we have approximately 450 stores with EMS. And throughout 2010, we'll be investing a little over $10 million to reach an additional 700 stores. Another area where we anticipate better cost control is the area of insurance. You recall that in fiscal 2007, we changed healthcare administrators, while improving our plan for associates and lowering our overall costs. Towards the end of 2009, with the help of outside expertise, we completed the dependent eligibility audit and a review of our healthcare plan design, with the goal of making sure we're delivering competitive benefits while also controlling costs. All indications are that our new program is very competitive in the marketplace and remains a good recruiting tool to attract new talent to the organization.When we look at stores, along with distribution and transportation costs, we also expect to generate leverage as dollar growth in these areas is forecasted to be at a slower rate than our anticipated sales growth. In terms of stores, we'll continue to pay per performance and merit increases will occur this year, like they have every other year. We continue to see opportunities to improve productivity as inventory per store is expected to remain relatively flat or down slightly year-over-year. And our labor scheduling efficiencies is getting better, and our investment and talent should begin to pay dividends in 2010.Distribution and transportation costs are forecasted to leverage in 2010 as well. You recall that in Q3 of 2009, we closed our West Coast Furniture facility. And mid-year 2009, we entered into a new dedicated fleet contracts, which lowered our costs and will benefit the first half of 2010.  Additionally, higher DC productivity and better inventory flow continues to help partially offset the normal wage and merit pressures we incur each year. So clearly, there are a number different sources of expense leverage being executed in 2010. However, there will be areas of the business where costs will increase and deleverage. Areas like occupancy and new store preopening costs, depreciation and equity-related expenses. In terms of occupancy, we expect only slight deleverage as we open more new stores and stores in better demographic locations which require a higher rent. New stores are the best investment we can make with the our cash and over the initial lease term, which is typically between five and seven years, were satisfied with expected return that believe it exceeds our cost of capital. However, our new stores tend open at below-market productivity, which can initially cause deleverage. This is included in the model we're providing. Depreciation expense is forecasted to grow in 2010, primarily as a result of the increasing amount of net store growth and the successful go live last month of our SAP implementation of the new finance and wholesale systems. Finally, equity-related expenses will deleverage given our current share price, which is up significantly to last year, and the completion of the accelerated vesting of restricted stock grants based on our 2009 profit performance.Filling out the rest of the P&L for 2010, net interest income is estimated to be essentially flat. And the effective income tax rate is planned to be in the neighborhood of 38.0% to 39.0%. For the year, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $115 million. Maintenance capital is estimated about $35 million to $40 million, which covers our stores, DCs and the general office. From a Real Estate perspective, new store capital is estimated at approximately $35 million to $40 million to cover opening 80 new stores.Investments and certain other strategic initiatives will represent approximately $40 million of CapEx in 2010. These dollars will be focused on our SAP implementation, retrofitting and refreshing a portion of our store base and our move forward to increase on investment and energy management systems to save on utility costs.The CapEx increase of approximately $36 million compared to 2009 is focused in three key areas. First, new store growth and a large number of stores in our refresh program. Next is SAP, specifically the capital needed for the development of the merchandising module. And third, the notable increase in the incremental investment in EMS, which I mentioned earlier. Each of these increases demonstrates an investment focused on the long-term view of our business. Based on these capital assumptions, 2010 depreciation expense is estimated to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million. This level of performance in 2010 is estimated to result in approximately $200 million of cash flow. As mentioned in our press these this morning, based on the better-than-expected cash flow for 2009 and our estimated cash flow for fiscal 2010, our Board of Directors has increased our share repurchase authorization by $250 million, bringing the total authorization to $400 million. We intend to utilize $150 million of the authorization to execute an accelerated share repurchase or ASR, which is expected to commence during the first quarter of fiscal 2010. An estimated number of shares will be reduced from our outstanding common stock near the start of the program. The exact total number of shares repurchased under the ASR will be based on the volume weighted average price of our stock over a predetermined period and will not be known until the period ends. This level of ASR insures a base level of cash is returned to shareholders at a discount to a straight dollar-cost-average approach. This level will also offset estimated dilution since our last repurchase program. We're estimating our diluted share count to be approximately 81 million shares for fiscal 2010, which includes the ASR activity I just mentioned. The remaining 250 million will be available to opportunistically repurchase shares in the open market and/or in privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. The program will be funded with current cash and cash equivalents, cash flow generated during fiscal 2010 or if needed, by drawing on our $500 million unsecured credit facility.Turning to the first quarter, we're estimating earnings to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.65 per diluted share, a 36% to 48% increase compared to $0.44 per diluted share last year. This level of EPS is based on total sales in the range of $1.215 billion to $1.235 billion, and a comp sales increase in the range of 4% to 6%.  In the month of February, comps were above the high end of this guidance due to two key factors. First, a highly productive president's stay at circular [ph]. And second, the significant outperformance of our one day semi-annual Friends and Family event in the last week of February. These two events and the strength of certain deals and our core business, were only partially offset by the weather issues experienced during the month.We expect our Q1 gross margin rate to be essentially flat to last year. Lower import costs, lower shrink and a slightly lower markdown rate are expected to offset higher overall fuel costs for domestic freight this year. And also remember, that we did benefit last year from a favorable shrink adjustment related to the completion of physical inventories. We also expect significant SG&A leverage, driven by lower advertising expense, lower insurance-related costs, lower distribution and transportation expense and lower bonus expense compared to last year. Additionally, we expect store expense will leverage at this level of comp, partially offset by higher equity expense and the increased expected in depreciation.Additional assumptions for our Q1 guidance include: Minimal interest income, a tax rate similar to last year's rate of 39.5% and diluted share count in the range of 81.5 million to 82 million, which includes an estimate for the ASR I mentioned earlier. Now for an update on our progress in Real Estate, I'd like to turn it over to Chuck."
26949,98792397,52309,"Big Lots Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2010",2010-03-03,"Earnings Calls","Big Lots, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe. During the fourth quarter, we opened nine new stores and closed 16 stores, leaving us with 1,361 stores, and total selling square footage of 29.2 million at the end of the year. For the year, we opened 52 stores and closed 30 stores. Of the 5",941,"Thanks, Joe. During the fourth quarter, we opened nine new stores and closed 16 stores, leaving us with 1,361 stores, and total selling square footage of 29.2 million at the end of the year. For the year, we opened 52 stores and closed 30 stores. Of the 52 new stores that were opened in 2009, 41 stores are what we referred to as traditional Big Lots stores, meaning in secondary or tertiary locations and primarily in strip centers. Eight of the new stores opened to what we've been referring to as A locations, which are locations with either better co-tenant mix, better demographics or both. And three stores opened in 2009 are part of our small store test. Generally speaking, new stores openings perform very well in 2009, with A locations exceeding our expectations, traditional stores, overall, meeting our overall expectations and our small store tests is producing mixed results. Looking towards 2010, we expect to open 80 new stores and closed approximately 40 locations for net store growth of 40 stores or approximately 3%. Looking at the break out of what types of stores we planned to open, the availability of space for our traditional locations remains good. Rents are reasonable. And we're certainly an attractive potential tenant as our overall business model gets stronger. We're an investment grade retailer with a rock solid balance sheet, who to my knowledge has never missed a rent payment. As you would expect, all these characteristics are very appealing to landlords today. Right now, I would estimate that we would open approximately 50 traditional locations in 2010. However, we have the capacity and the cash to ramp up this number, if opportunities and rents are right for us and model out. In terms of A locations, we see a meaningful opportunity for growth in 2009, and are estimating that we will open approximately 30 new A locations this year. This is a major step forward for our company, and has been made possible by the softening in the commercial real estate market and the strength of our improving performance over the last several years. Additionally, a higher quality and more branded merchandise assortment, along with improvements in store standards and customer service, have given us the confidence that we can be successful in these better locations with a new customer base that has a somewhat higher level of expectations in terms of the in-store shopping experience.As we mentioned on our last call, results from the eight A locations that were in test mode in 2009 have been very encouraging. These locations, on average, have exceeded our initial sales goals by 10% to 15%, and are trending the sales of a little over $4 million per store or approximately $190 per foot for their first full year. Clearly, occupancy costs are higher in these locations. However, this is a potentially very profitable endeavor when modeling out a store at $190 a foot in its first year and nowhere near maturity despite low double-digit rents. Putting this in perspective, when we sign a new deal, we look at the initial lease term and what level of sales and annual growth are needed to generate a financial return that exceeds our cost of capital. Based on results today, we're well ahead of the space needed to hit our return targets, which has given us confidence to increase our CapEx budget for A locations in 2010. In terms of the smaller store tests, we've learned a great deal about the operational aspects relating to renting a smaller store, and the merchandising changes or edits that are critical in this size of box. We will continue to make modifications to these three stores and monitor their progress. And along the way in 2010, we may also add a couple of stores to that test.Hopefully, this is a helpful summary of our 2010 store growth targets. Also in 2010, we're moving forward with a more aggressive approach to our store Refresh program. We identified 120 stores with some of the biggest upside sales opportunities, and we'll be investing approximately $5 million of capital in 2010. In approximately 105 of these stores, we will be making certain layout modifications while also investing in the overall fiscal plan. For the other 15 stores, the layouts are fine as is, but some level of capital investment is needed, and is justified given the sales opportunity. You'll recall that we tested this idea in approximately 20 or so stores in 2009, primarily here in Columbus. Again, we learned a great deal, and now have the processes and people in place to move forward with this initiative in a more meaningful way in 2010.We feel very good about our real estate plans for 2010, and continue to believe new store growth is the best investment available to us at this time. We believe the level of new store openings should grow in 2011 and 2012, and could reach 90 or 100 new stores in those years, making us a potentially 1,500-plus store chain by 2012. We see availability of space. The buyers have more than enough inventory sources to merchandise the stores. And our level of talent in the stores, organization continues to grow, it'll be ready to run a larger chain. We're confident in the progress in growth we can achieve in this three-year view, but we believe that we're only beginning to scratch the surface. Population density study suggest that we could grow to 2,100 to 2,200 store someday, assuming locations become available at the level of rents we can afford. Now I'll turn it back to Steve for some closing remarks."
26949,98792397,52309,"Big Lots Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2010",2010-03-03,"Earnings Calls","Big Lots, Inc.","Executives","Over the last four-plus years, we've reinvented this company. We've taken it from a buying organization to a selling organization. We've significantly improved the merchandise content and quality, increased inventory turnover and expanded our vendor base,",1619,"Over the last four-plus years, we've reinvented this company. We've taken it from a buying organization to a selling organization. We've significantly improved the merchandise content and quality, increased inventory turnover and expanded our vendor base, both in numbers and in quality. In fact, in the last two years alone, we've added over 1,000 new merchandise vendors. Our cost structure has never been leaner. We've made good intelligent decisions in real estate, and now have a very productive portfolio. More than 98% of our stores are profitable on a four-wall basis, and over 99% of our stores generate positive cash flow.  We've generated nearly $1.2 billion of cash, much of which we've returned to shareholders through repurchase programs. And EPS has grown to $2.37 per share compared to only $0.14 back in 2005, when we first started repositioning the business. I've been with Big Lots coming up on five years this summer. And I firmly believe heading into 2010, we're better positioned than at any other time in my tenure with the company. Our merchandise content and the value message continues to grow stronger and stronger. Our stores have never looked better. Inventories are flowing and well under control. And we continue to find smart ways to leverage our cost structure without impacting the customer. But today, I want to talk about the future and what my vision is for the company. We're entering into a growth mode, which is the next phase of our evolution. With the potential of over 2,000 stores, I see this as a $9 billion or $10 billion business.  We tend to focus our strategies and goals into three-year increments, which is what we're providing to you today. Over the next three years, we see sales growth potential in the range of 5% to 7% annually, through square footage growth of 3% to 4% per year, supplemented by comp growth of 2% to 3% per year, which is a similar model to what Joe just walked you through for 2010. In terms of comp growth, we're looking at target sales productivity of $175 per foot by 2012. So the next question is how do we get there? Our strategies today have been focused on getting a greater wallet share from our existing loyal customer base. Based on my over 30 years of retail, it's been my experience this is the quickest way to increase sales and profits, to go after the customer who shops you and knows you best. We see continued opportunity with our core customer to improve the basket in terms of AUR and units sold and frequency of visits. Looking forward, we have several strategies to build transactions, both from our core customer, as well as our infrequent customer. First, the most important piece is merchandising content. I don't anticipate any major category adds or edits. The customers consistently told us that they like the business we trade in, and they want more excitement, new and different closeouts but most of all, they want extreme value. Our marketing efforts will be more focused on driving transactions. First is the Rewards program. As of last week, we have over 1.4 million members, and the list is growing pretty rapidly each week. To date, stores with the highest amount of reward sign-up or penetration are seeing transaction lifts in the low single digits. Later this year, we will be implementing the technology to offer our members targeted messages or promotions based on their specific buying patterns. Next, using our ad circulars and promotional pricing to create more buzz builders, could help us increase transactions. I believe we're seeing some validation of this strategy in the last couple of ads that we've run, both President's Day and the mid-January ad. Additionally, as many of you may be aware of, we've begun accepting the American Express card, which was effective in all stores in the last several days. It's another vehicle to market to our customers and small businesses in a program that is consistent with our real estate strategy to move forward into more A locations.Maybe one of the largest opportunities to improve transactions is our stores and store operations. Specifically, when you survey the infrequent customer, convenience and store appearance are the two biggest barriers to more frequent visits. Convenience speaks more to location of store and number of stores in the market, which by the way, we think we're addressing with the store growth and potentially, the A store strategy. But in terms of store appearance, its shopability, cleanliness and I'd add to it, customer service as well. Last week, we held our semiannual leaders meeting and the theme of the meeting was 2010: The Year of The Store. This is a multi-year initiative and focuses on three key aspects: Ready for business standards, where we're making progress each day, with store cleanliness, recovery standards and good merchandise presentation to make the store easy to shop; it's also customer service, meet, greet and smile, which I'd be the first to admit, we've not always been the best at. Talent will also play a big role. As we raise the level of accountability on standard in our stores, we've recruited new talent in a number of situations at the store district and regional levels. Finally, we have some capital needs in our stores as well. Chris, Chuck and Joe's team have a detailed understanding and a plan of where and when we will need to invest capital over the next several years. Now don't misinterpret this statement. We invest in capital in our stores every year to maintain our buildings. I'm talking about improvement capital, or dollars that we believe will make a difference and grow sales profitability. It's not a shocking number and clearly, based on our guidance, will not slow us down when talking about operating profit growth.So there are many different levers in terms of merchandising basket and transaction to potentially drive comps for the foreseeable future. At this level of comp and sales growth, we believe that the continued SG&A leverage for the next three years could occur at a very similar rate to what we have guided for 2010. Many of the same key drivers of SG&A leverage in fiscal 2010 are expected to continue into 2011 and 2012. The overall dollar reductions in advertising are expected to continue. We believe there are opportunities to test and further reduce our print circulation. Additionally, we anticipate leverage related to the investments we're making in our Rewards programs. In terms of utilities, the investments being made in EMS should provide leverage opportunities well into the future, as a result of an increasing level of electricity savings and potentially, lower overall repair and maintenance costs. The changes in our insurance program promote wellness that could have longer-term benefit as do the improved controls that we've established as a result of the eligibility audits. We expect insurance costs to grow at a slower rate than our expected sales growth. Similarly, we expect future distribution and transportation costs and store expenses to grow, but at a slower rate than our forecasted sales growth for many of the same reasons that Joe articulated in our 2010 guidance.At a high level, we see the potential for an operating profit of 8% by fiscal 2012, driven by accelerating operating profit dollar growth in the range of 8% to 12% annually over the next three-year period. Operating profit growth, coupled with the successful execution of our currently authorized $400 million share repurchase program could translate to a compounded EPS growth rate of 12% to 16%, or the potential of $3.50 in EPS by fiscal 2012.As you can see, it's a pretty powerful model now that comps are moving in the right direction. Along the way, we'll continue to invest in this business for the long term and anticipate spending in the neighborhood of $300 million to $325 million of capital over the next three years, concentrated in maintenance, new store capital, store refresh capital and continued evaluations of all of our systems and the next steps in terms of SAP. However, as I think we have demonstrated in the past, should there be an additional opportunity, or should there be additional opportunities to enhance the efficiency in our supply chain or other initiatives to drive leverage or incremental profits, we will do what is right for the business and the shareholder in the long term. Clearly, our model and our excess liquidity affords us the opportunity to be flexible wherever needed. At this level of performance and with continued investment into the business, we would estimate cash flow in the range of $650 million to $700 million over the next three years, assuming the successful execution of our currently authorized $400 million share repurchase program, combined with the $284 million of cash we currently have on our balance sheet, we would have approximately $550 million of cash on hand and available at the end of fiscal 2012. This cash could be used for further investments in the business or to return to shareholders or look into other investment opportunities whatever they may be.We're very proud of what we've accomplished as an organization over the last four plus years, not only for our shareholders but our loyal associates and their families as well. Over the next three years, alone, we expect to add a net of approximately 140 stores or so, which creates hundreds of opportunities for promotions for our best performers and potentially creates in the neighborhood of 4,000 to 5,000 jobs, to do our part to help the economy grow and improve the overall employment picture. With that, I'll turn it back over to TJ."

But the loyalty card member is the one that we're really concentrated on. We have 1.4 million members today, that we understand their spending about double, a little over $40 the average customer. So we're very excited about that because that's almost double what our average transaction is. And the other issue is that they're coming back frequently. And when they come back after their 10 visits and get their one-time coupon, they're spending almost $100 on an average transaction at that particular point. So those things bode well. And I think what we indicated, where we have been able to track, in some cases where we have a higher concentration of Buzz Club loyalty card members in some of the stores, the early performance is that number of transactions and comp sales in those stores are up about 1% higher than the overall trend of the company right now. So that's very, very encouraging. Now how big loyalty can be? I mean we're going to work on it as hard as we can come, as fast as we can. We have about 6.5 million Buzz Club members. And a think I had mentioned before, about 20% or 25% of the loyalty card members are Buzz Club members, and about three quarters of them are not. So we think we have a lot of runway in front of us there. And we think that's just a huge opportunity, coupled along with the fact of going into the third quarter and adding the technology, that all along was planned into about the end of the second into the early the third quarter. We're now going to be capable in the back half of the year, to start communicating directly with these customers and offering them opportunities where they shop us, specifically, in classifications of businesses in the stores. So the question is, is how smart are we and how smart is our customer and what can we offer them and encourage them to shop more frequently. So it's a pretty compelling opportunity."

It's interesting, actually, the acceleration in February is the businesses that we came out of January and the fourth quarter that we've talked about. So there's no real change other than, quite honestly, Furniture business continues to be really good. So that's very exciting and is good or better in February than it was in January. And I think I alluded to that from the Friends & Family event, which is a one-day event, which clearly impacted the month of February. But it was strong throughout the entire month. As things went on, and again, it's across the board like I talked about. Case goods is decent, upholstery is really good, mattresses is really good. So those are all really very exciting issues to us. And then of course, I won't get into the details, dining is good and chairs and things like that. But people are spending money where there's great value. Seasonal is decent and where there is great value, it's the same thing there. The bigger items are doing quite well, particularly patio sets, gazebos. It's like I'm just repeating myself, season-to-season, but those are the things that are really resonating. We had weather in February 2 in a number of markets, and I'm not using this as an excuse, please, no one say that Big Lots used weather as an excuse. We didn't talk about it, it is what it is. But clearly, in the warmer weather climate areas where we said earlier about 400, 450 stores, you take California, Florida, Arizona, Las Vegas, those kind of things, business was good in Seasonal. So we feel particularly strong there. Home continued good. It was really a repeat of what I said in the fourth quarter, only at even higher comp levels. The AUR I alluded to, really, boy, I feel kind of bad that you took that as something that was special. We've been talking about higher average unit retails and better values consistently. It's all about the raise the ring program. I've just kind of not said that term in about a year or year and a half. We've constantly been selling better quality merchandise at higher active average unit retails, and our business is not about price, it's about value. I'll continue to say it, as long as the Board let's me continue to be here, and I can scream it. The average unit retails on our floor today are better values than they've ever been before. But they are probably slightly higher than they were before, or at least, what we're selling is slightly higher than it was before, in Furniture, in Seasonal, in Home, in Hard Goods, it's across the board."

There's challenges for everybody in the United States on import container freights. The Orient and the shipping companies have decided that they haven't made the kind of money they've wanted to make over the last year, whether they have contracts with you or they don't have contracts with you. The simple answer is yes, we have contracts and we have rates that are higher than they were last year as probably everybody does, and it's an important part of our business. But there's a cost associated with it and that's baked into the margin and that will put pressure on margin because of the elevated costs. There's no one who's not going to be importing at higher costs this year. Cost associated with the shipping from the Orient, from Asia, is just going up and that's all there is to it. And they've put a tremendous amount of pressure on the retailers here, but I think we have some pretty good partners over there, that understand how we do business here. And Chuck has been specifically involved with it, with our global sourcing people. And in fact, was probably over in Asia two weeks ago, because of it, and we're back on track with everybody. But that's going to put pressure on initial markup. The overall maintenance of margins and the mix of business, hopefully, will be somewhat favorable but it will be offset by distribution freight fuel costs, whether they're domestic or import, to be quite honest with you. So probably a pretty good answer."

The national-branded closeout deal that you're seeing in the stores is at the highest retails we've ever had before. And it has a higher unit retail than the last year program was.

From the merchants to the stores, to the marketing programs, to the distribution centers that deliver the goods, Q4 was a wonderful example of solid execution of a plan that was months in the making. From a sales perspective, two observations were very clear to us. First, the customer returned, and was in the mood to shop this Christmas season. And second, if you provide great value and newness in your merchandise offering, the customer will absolutely respond and reward you with a register. This was very clear in Q4, as our comps increased 5% with all major merchandise divisions in all regions of the country, performing well and exceeding their plans. In terms of merchandising, the strength was broad-based with the furniture, home and hard lines leading the way with comps up in the high single digits, followed by seasonal toys and consumables, comping up in the low to mid-singles. We were very encouraged by the accelerating trends in furniture during Q4, as new items and new styles in upholstery and case goods were well received by the customer. Additionally, our mattress business got healthy in Q4 and comped up in line with the rest of the division. For the second consecutive quarter, Home was a leading category in the store. Newness and better quality goods were again a successful formula. Real good closeout deals from new vendors and better brands resonated with the consumer. In hard lines, it was all about our Electronics business, which comped up in the 20s in Q4. The chain-wide rollout of our video game software program exceeded our expectations and the availability of DVDs, digital cameras, MP3 players and accessories helped drive results. Electronics vendors, in particular, are getting more and more comfortable selling to us, and are repeatedly surprised by how much volume we bring to them as a new customer.Seasonal and toys each performed well and were important to our Q4 success. Combined, these areas can be upwards of 25% to 30% of our business in any given week in November and December. In seasonal, the customer responded to the extreme value we offered in lighting and trees. Interesting to note here, that items with higher average item retail and higher perceived value did very well, which is an encouraging sign when we look forward to spring and our opportunities in lawn and garden. The shift towards a more branded assortment in toys also helped drive positive Q4 comps. More branded goods, new vendors and deeper relationships with existing vendors, are all trends we anticipate continuing into 2010. Our Consumables business comped up in the low single digits. Our vendor relationships are stronger and deeper, and the availability of excess merchandise continues to be more than enough for us to successfully manage this business. So broad-based performance across most of the areas of the store, and our buying teams manage their businesses really well in Q4, as inventories finished the quarter, down 2% per store the last year. From a store's perspective, it was the best executed holiday season I've seen from this business. The talent we've added to the team, along with our ready-for-business initiatives, have improved the shopability of our stores and hopefully left a more favorable impression of Big Lots to encourage more frequent future visits from our customers. In terms of marketing, the Buzz Club Rewards program exceeded our expectations. And as of last week, we have over 1.4 million members. There were trends at the store level that suggests rewards can be a basket driver, as reward customers spent nearly double what the average customer spends. But also we're learning that rewards can be a transaction driver, which I'll touch on later.In summary, Q4 surpassed even our highest expectations. As operating profit dollars increased 30% compared to last year, we generated record EPS that were up 31% to last year's record performance. And we managed our business very prudently, and ended the year with over $280 million of cash and no debt.  Now Joe is going to give you some details on the quarter and our expectations for 2010.

Sales for the fourth quarter were $1.463 billion, a 7.0% increase, compared to $1.367 billion for the fourth quarter of last year. The increase was driven by a comparable store sales increase of 5.1%, strong sales from our non-comp or newer stores, along with a slight increase in our average store count in Q4.  We estimate that our comps for Q4 benefited by approximately 1% from one additional shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Our Q4 comps are 5.1%, exceeded our most recent guidance, which called for comps of 3.5% to 4.5%, thanks to a better-than-expected performance in January. For the fourth quarter, our operating profit dollars increased $40.3 million or 30% to last year. This increase was driven by the 7% increase in total sales, along with an expansion of our operating profit rate by 220 basis points to 11.9% of sales. Our Q4 gross margin rate was 41.3% or 90 basis points above last year. The increase in last year was due to favorable initial mark-up on goods sold, lower import freight costs and a lower shrink accrual rate partially offset by an increase in domestic freight costs, resulting from the higher price of diesel fuel compared to last year. Total SG&A dollars including depreciation were $431.3 million. The fourth quarter SG&A rate of 29.5% was 120 basis points below last year. We generated leverage in store payroll for better hours allocation. And our initiatives in transportation to have dollar reductions that were only partially offset by higher fuel costs. Advertising expenses were below last year, benefiting from lower costs in the marketplace. And we were able to lower our ad circular costs by reducing some of our print distribution.Utilities and depreciation were again below last year levels, and we benefited from the leveraging impact that a 5.1% comp has on occupancy costs and insurance. All of this leverage was partially offset by the accelerated vesting of restricted stock grants, based on our above planned performance for fiscal 2009.Net interest expense was $0.4 million for the quarter compared to $1.1 million last year, with the improvement of result to the cash generated by the business over the last 12 months, partially offset by higher amortization expense related to our new bank facility issuance costs. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was 37.3% compared to last year's rate of 38.1%. The tax rate difference is principally attributable to a valuation adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 related to assets held for our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. In total, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we reported income from continuing operations of $108.6 million or $1.31 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $81.8 million or $1 per diluted share a year ago.  Our earnings of $1.31 per diluted share were better than our previously-communicated guidance, which called for earnings of $1.19 to $1.24 per diluted share. Comparing to the high-end of our guidance, approximately $0.02 of the beat [ph] came from better-than-expected January sales, $0.02 came from a better-than-expected gross margin rate, $0.02 came from lower SG&A, because we did not incur pension settlement charge that was contemplated in our guidance and also, there was only minimal flex on the upside sales to our comp guidance. And finally, approximately $0.01 came from lower than anticipated tax rate.Turning to the balance sheet, inventory ended the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 at $731 million compared to $737 million last year. This represents a 2% decrease per store. For the year, we achieved record inventory turnover of 3.7x compared to 3.6x last year. Cash flow, which we defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities, increased by $32 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to last year. Cash flow for the full year was $314 million, which was above our guidance of $215 million, due to higher net income, lower inventory levels and better AP leverage, with the largest portion of the increase coming from AP leverage. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $284 million and no borrowings under our credit facility, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $35 million and borrowings under our credit facility of $62 million last year.During the fourth quarter, there was no opportunistic share repurchase activity conducted under the $150 million share repurchase program, which was approved by our Board of Directors in December. For the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $16.8 million, compared to $13.2 million last year. The increase to the prior year is primarily attributable to more new store construction activity than last year and higher SAP spending year-over-year. Our fourth quarter investment in SAP related to the finance wholesale systems that went live last month and the continued development work on the merchandising module. Depreciation expense for the quarter was $18.6 million or $1.2 million lower than last year.Moving on to 2010 in guidance, overall, we're planning 2010 EPS to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.75 per diluted share compared to 2009's income from continuing operations of $2.37 per diluted share. Our 2010 plan calls for a comparable store sales increase of 3% to 4%, and a total sales dollar increase in the range of 5% to 6% compared to fiscal 2009. At this level of sales, we're estimating a 10% to 14% increase in operating profit dollars. We anticipate our operating profit rate to be in the range of 7.0% to 7.2% or 30 to 50 basis points higher than fiscal 2009, with the expansion coming from a lower expense rate.Our gross margin rate for 2010 is expected to be similar to 2009, as solid initial mark-up, favorable shrink experience and disciplined inventory management resulting in a slightly lower markdown rate are expected to be offset by higher freight costs, both domestic and imports.As many of you know, there has been a tremendous amount of progress on the cost structure over the last several years. The important takeaway from today's call should be that we are not finished. Our improved business processes, combined with 2010 initiatives, give us the confidence in this year's plan, which begins to leverage expenses at approximately a flat comp. Additionally, for many of these same reasons, we believe SG&A leverage is possible for the next couple of years, as Steve will touch on shortly. Our forecasted 2010 expense leverage of 30 to 50 basis points is expected to come from several different sources. We have initiatives to lower costs in advertising, utilities and insurance. In terms of advertising, you'll recall we have tested and executed reductions in the distribution of print advertising, and these changes began back in the fall of 2009. We believe more opportunities exist to reduce the amount of print distribution per circular and will continue to test in 2010. Additionally, we anticipate that the print advertising costs will be very competitive and rate decreases are possible. Next, in terms of utilities, we've decided to make a sizable investment in energy management systems or EMS in 2010. This is another example of an initiative that we've tested over time and have determined as a good use of capital. Stores with EMS have been averaging in the neighborhood of a 15% reduction in utility costs. Today, we have approximately 450 stores with EMS. And throughout 2010, we'll be investing a little over $10 million to reach an additional 700 stores. Another area where we anticipate better cost control is the area of insurance. You'll recall that in fiscal 2007, we changed healthcare administrators while improving our plan for associates and lowering our overall costs. Towards the end of 2009, with the help of outside expertise, we completed a dependent eligibility audit and a review of our healthcare plan design with the goal of making sure we're delivering competitive benefits while also controlling costs. All indications are that our new program is very competitive in the marketplace and remains a good recruiting tool to attract new talent to the organization.When we look at stores, along with distribution and transportation costs, we also expect to generate leverage as dollar growth in these areas is forecasted to be at a slower rate than our anticipated sales growth. In terms of stores, we'll continue to pay for performance and merit increases will occur this year like they have every other year. We continue to see opportunities to improve productivity as inventory per store is expected to remain relatively flat or down slightly year-over-year, and our labor scheduling efficiencies is getting better, and our investment and talent should begin to pay dividends in 2010.Distribution and transportation costs are forecasted to leverage in 2010 as well. You'll recall that in Q3 of 2009, we closed our West Coast Furniture facility. And mid-year 2009, we entered into a new dedicated fleet contracts, which lowered our costs and will benefit the first half of 2010.  Additionally, higher DC productivity and better inventory flow continues to help partially offset the normal wage and merit pressures we incur each year. So clearly, there are a number different sources of expense leverage being executed in 2010. However, there will be areas of the business where costs will increase and deleverage, areas like occupancy and new store preopening costs, depreciation and equity-related expenses. In terms of occupancy, we expect only slight deleverage as we open more new stores and stores in better demographic locations which require a higher rent. New stores are the best investment we can make with the our cash and over the initial lease term, which is typically between five and seven years, were satisfied with expected return and believe it exceeds our cost of capital. However, our new stores tend open at below-market productivity, which can initially cause deleverage. This is included in the model we're providing. Depreciation expense is forecasted to grow in 2010, primarily as a result of the increasing amount of net store growth and the successful go live last month of our SAP implementation of the new finance and wholesale systems. Finally, equity-related expenses will deleverage given our current share price, which is up significantly to last year, and the completion of the accelerated vesting of restricted stock grants based on our 2009 profit performance.Filling out the rest of the P&L for 2010, net interest income is estimated to be essentially flat. And the effective income tax rate is planned to be in the neighborhood of 38.0% to 39.0%. For the year, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $115 million. Maintenance capital is estimated about $35 million to $40 million, which covers our stores, DCs and the general office. From a Real Estate perspective, new store capital is estimated at approximately $35 million to $40 million to cover opening 80 new stores.Investments and certain other strategic initiatives will represent approximately $40 million of CapEx in 2010. These dollars will be focused on our SAP implementation, retrofitting and refreshing a portion of our store base and our move forward to increase our investment and energy management systems to save on utility costs.The CapEx increase of approximately $36 million compared to 2009 is focused in three key areas: First, new store growth and a larger number of stores in our refresh program; next is SAP, specifically the capital needed for the development of the merchandising module; and third, the notable increase in the incremental investment in EMS, which I mentioned earlier. Each of these increases demonstrates an investment focused on the long-term view of our business. Based on these capital assumptions, 2010 depreciation expense is estimated to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million. This level of performance in 2010 is estimated to result in approximately $200 million of cash flow. As mentioned in our press these this morning, based on the better-than-expected cash flow for 2009 and our estimated cash flow for fiscal 2010, our Board of Directors has increased our share repurchase authorization by $250 million, bringing the total authorization to $400 million. We intend to utilize $150 million of the authorization to execute an accelerated share repurchase or ASR, which is expected to commence during the first quarter of fiscal 2010. An estimated number of shares will be reduced from our outstanding common stock near the start of the program. The exact total number of shares repurchased under the ASR will be based on the volume weighted average price of our stock over a predetermined period and will not be known until the period ends. This level of ASR insures a base level of cash is returned to shareholders at a discount to a straight dollar-cost-average approach. This level will also offset estimated dilution since our last repurchase program. We're estimating our diluted share count to be approximately 81 million shares for fiscal 2010, which includes the ASR activity I just mentioned. The remaining 250 million will be available to opportunistically repurchase shares in the open market and/or in privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. The program will be funded with current cash and cash equivalents, cash flow generated during fiscal 2010, or if needed, by drawing on our $500 million unsecured credit facility.Turning to the first quarter, we're estimating earnings to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.65 per diluted share, a 36% to 48% increase compared to $0.44 per diluted share last year. This level of EPS is based on total sales in the range of $1.215 billion to $1.235 billion, and a comp sales increase in the range of 4% to 6%.  In the month of February, comps were above the high end of this guidance due to two key factors. First, a highly productive President's Day ad circular. And second, the significant outperformance of our one day semi-annual Friends and Family event in the last week of February. These two events and the strength of certain deals and our core business, were only partially offset by the weather issues experienced during the month.We expect our Q1 gross margin rate to be essentially flat to last year. Lower import costs, lower shrink and a slightly lower markdown rate are expected to offset higher overall fuel costs for domestic freight this year. And also remember, that we did benefit last year from a favorable shrink adjustment related to the completion of physical inventories. We also expect significant SG&A leverage, driven by lower advertising expense, lower insurance-related costs, lower distribution and transportation expense and lower bonus expense compared to last year. Additionally, we expect store expense will leverage at this level of comp, partially offset by higher equity expense and the increased expected in depreciation.Additional assumptions for our Q1 guidance include: Minimal interest income, a tax rate similar to last year's rate of 39.5% and diluted share count in the range of 81.5 million to 82 million, which includes an estimate for the ASR I mentioned earlier. Now for an update on our progress in Real Estate, I'd like to turn it over to Chuck."

During the fourth quarter, we opened nine new stores and closed 16 stores, leaving us with 1,361 stores, and total selling square footage of 29.2 million at the end of the year. For the year, we opened 52 stores and closed 30 stores. Of the 5",941,"Thanks, Joe. During the fourth quarter, we opened nine new stores and closed 16 stores, leaving us with 1,361 stores, and total selling square footage of 29.2 million at the end of the year. For the year, we opened 52 stores and closed 30 stores. Of the 52 new stores that were opened in 2009, 41 stores are what we referred to as traditional Big Lots stores, meaning in secondary or tertiary locations and primarily in strip centers. Eight of the new stores opened to what we've been referring to as A locations, which are locations with either better co-tenant mix, better demographics or both. And three stores opened in 2009 are part of our small store test. Generally speaking, new stores openings perform very well in 2009, with A locations exceeding our expectations, traditional stores, overall, meeting our overall expectations and our small store tests is producing mixed results. Looking towards 2010, we expect to open 80 new stores and closed approximately 40 locations for net store growth of 40 stores or approximately 3%. Looking at the break out of what types of stores we planned to open, the availability of space for our traditional locations remains good. Rents are reasonable. And we're certainly an attractive potential tenant as our overall business model gets stronger. We're an investment grade retailer with a rock solid balance sheet, who to my knowledge has never missed a rent payment. As you would expect, all these characteristics are very appealing to landlords today. Right now, I would estimate that we would open approximately 50 traditional locations in 2010. However, we have the capacity and the cash to ramp up this number, if opportunities and rents are right for us and model out. In terms of A locations, we see a meaningful opportunity for growth in 2009, and are estimating that we will open approximately 30 new A locations this year. This is a major step forward for our company, and has been made possible by the softening in the commercial real estate market and the strength of our improving performance over the last several years. Additionally, a higher quality and more branded merchandise assortment, along with improvements in store standards and customer service, have given us the confidence that we can be successful in these better locations with a new customer base that has a somewhat higher level of expectations in terms of the in-store shopping experience.As we mentioned on our last call, results from the eight A locations that were in test mode in 2009 have been very encouraging. These locations, on average, have exceeded our initial sales goals by 10% to 15%, and are trending the sales of a little over $4 million per store or approximately $190 per foot for their first full year. Clearly, occupancy costs are higher in these locations. However, this is a potentially very profitable endeavor when modeling out a store at $190 a foot in its first year and nowhere near maturity despite low double-digit rents. Putting this in perspective, when we sign a new deal, we look at the initial lease term and what level of sales and annual growth are needed to generate a financial return that exceeds our cost of capital. Based on results today, we're well ahead of the space needed to hit our return targets, which has given us confidence to increase our CapEx budget for A locations in 2010. In terms of the smaller store tests, we've learned a great deal about the operational aspects relating to renting a smaller store, and the merchandising changes or edits that are critical in this size of box. We will continue to make modifications to these three stores and monitor their progress. And along the way in 2010, we may also add a couple of stores to that test.Hopefully, this is a helpful summary of our 2010 store growth targets. Also in 2010, we're moving forward with a more aggressive approach to our store Refresh program. We identified 120 stores with some of the biggest upside sales opportunities, and we'll be investing approximately $5 million of capital in 2010. In approximately 105 of these stores, we will be making certain layout modifications while also investing in the overall fiscal plan. For the other 15 stores, the layouts are fine as is, but some level of capital investment is needed, and is justified given the sales opportunity. You'll recall that we tested this idea in approximately 20 or so stores in 2009, primarily here in Columbus. Again, we learned a great deal, and now have the processes and people in place to move forward with this initiative in a more meaningful way in 2010.We feel very good about our real estate plans for 2010, and continue to believe new store growth is the best investment available to us at this time. We believe the level of new store openings should grow in 2011 and 2012, and could reach 90 or 100 new stores in those years, making us a potentially 1,500-plus store chain by 2012. We see availability of space. The buyers have more than enough inventory sources to merchandise the stores. And our level of talent in the stores, organization continues to grow, it'll be ready to run a larger chain. We're confident in the progress in growth we can achieve in this three-year view, but we believe that we're only beginning to scratch the surface. Population density study suggest that we could grow to 2,100 to 2,200 store someday, assuming locations become available at the level of rents we can afford. Now I'll turn it back to Steve for some closing remarks."

We've taken it from a buying organization to a selling organization. We've significantly improved the merchandise content and quality, increased inventory turnover and expanded our vendor base,",1619,"Over the last four-plus years, we've reinvented this company. We've taken it from a buying organization to a selling organization. We've significantly improved the merchandise content and quality, increased inventory turnover and expanded our vendor base, both in numbers and in quality. In fact, in the last two years alone, we've added over 1,000 new merchandise vendors. Our cost structure has never been leaner. We've made good intelligent decisions in real estate, and now have a very productive portfolio. More than 98% of our stores are profitable on a four-wall basis, and over 99% of our stores generate positive cash flow.  We've generated nearly $1.2 billion of cash, much of which we've returned to shareholders through repurchase programs. And EPS has grown to $2.37 per share compared to only $0.14 back in 2005, when we first started repositioning the business. I've been with Big Lots coming up on five years this summer. And I firmly believe heading into 2010, we're better positioned than at any other time in my tenure with the company. Our merchandise content and the value message continues to grow stronger and stronger. Our stores have never looked better. Inventories are flowing and well under control. And we continue to find smart ways to leverage our cost structure without impacting the customer. But today, I want to talk about the future and what my vision is for the company. We're entering into a growth mode, which is the next phase of our evolution. With the potential of over 2,000 stores, I see this as a $9 billion or $10 billion business.  We tend to focus our strategies and goals into three-year increments, which is what we're providing to you today. Over the next three years, we see sales growth potential in the range of 5% to 7% annually, through square footage growth of 3% to 4% per year, supplemented by comp growth of 2% to 3% per year, which is a similar model to what Joe just walked you through for 2010. In terms of comp growth, we're looking at target sales productivity of $175 per foot by 2012. So the next question is how do we get there? Our strategies today have been focused on getting a greater wallet share from our existing loyal customer base. Based on my over 30 years of retail, it's been my experience this is the quickest way to increase sales and profits, to go after the customer who shops you and knows you best. We see continued opportunity with our core customer to improve the basket in terms of AUR and units sold and frequency of visits. Looking forward, we have several strategies to build transactions, both from our core customer, as well as our infrequent customer. First, the most important piece is merchandising content. I don't anticipate any major category adds or edits. The customers consistently told us that they like the business we trade in, and they want more excitement, new and different closeouts but most of all, they want extreme value. Our marketing efforts will be more focused on driving transactions. First is the Rewards program. As of last week, we have over 1.4 million members, and the list is growing pretty rapidly each week. To date, stores with the highest amount of reward sign-up or penetration are seeing transaction lifts in the low single digits. Later this year, we will be implementing the technology to offer our members targeted messages or promotions based on their specific buying patterns. Next, using our ad circulars and promotional pricing to create more buzz builders, could help us increase transactions. I believe we're seeing some validation of this strategy in the last couple of ads that we've run, both President's Day and the mid-January ad. Additionally, as many of you may be aware of, we've begun accepting the American Express card, which was effective in all stores in the last several days. It's another vehicle to market to our customers and small businesses in a program that is consistent with our real estate strategy to move forward into more A locations.Maybe one of the largest opportunities to improve transactions is our stores and store operations. Specifically, when you survey the infrequent customer, convenience and store appearance are the two biggest barriers to more frequent visits. Convenience speaks more to location of store and number of stores in the market, which by the way, we think we're addressing with the store growth and potentially, the A store strategy. But in terms of store appearance, its shopability, cleanliness and I'd add to it, customer service as well. Last week, we held our semiannual leaders meeting and the theme of the meeting was 2010: The Year of The Store. This is a multi-year initiative and focuses on three key aspects: Ready for business standards, where we're making progress each day, with store cleanliness, recovery standards and good merchandise presentation to make the store easy to shop; it's also customer service, meet, greet and smile, which I'd be the first to admit, we've not always been the best at. Talent will also play a big role. As we raise the level of accountability on standard in our stores, we've recruited new talent in a number of situations at the store district and regional levels. Finally, we have some capital needs in our stores as well. Chris, Chuck and Joe's team have a detailed understanding and a plan of where and when we will need to invest capital over the next several years. Now don't misinterpret this statement. We invest in capital in our stores every year to maintain our buildings. I'm talking about improvement capital, or dollars that we believe will make a difference and grow sales profitability. It's not a shocking number and clearly, based on our guidance, will not slow us down when talking about operating profit growth.So there are many different levers in terms of merchandising basket and transaction to potentially drive comps for the foreseeable future. At this level of comp and sales growth, we believe that the continued SG&A leverage for the next three years could occur at a very similar rate to what we have guided for 2010. Many of the same key drivers of SG&A leverage in fiscal 2010 are expected to continue into 2011 and 2012. The overall dollar reductions in advertising are expected to continue. We believe there are opportunities to test and further reduce our print circulation. Additionally, we anticipate leverage related to the investments we're making in our Rewards programs. In terms of utilities, the investments being made in EMS should provide leverage opportunities well into the future, as a result of an increasing level of electricity savings and potentially, lower overall repair and maintenance costs. The changes in our insurance program promote wellness that could have longer-term benefit as do the improved controls that we've established as a result of the eligibility audits. We expect insurance costs to grow at a slower rate than our expected sales growth. Similarly, we expect future distribution and transportation costs and store expenses to grow, but at a slower rate than our forecasted sales growth for many of the same reasons that Joe articulated in our 2010 guidance.At a high level, we see the potential for an operating profit of 8% by fiscal 2012, driven by accelerating operating profit dollar growth in the range of 8% to 12% annually over the next three-year period. Operating profit growth, coupled with the successful execution of our currently authorized $400 million share repurchase program could translate to a compounded EPS growth rate of 12% to 16%, or the potential of $3.50 in EPS by fiscal 2012.As you can see, it's a pretty powerful model now that comps are moving in the right direction. Along the way, we'll continue to invest in this business for the long term and anticipate spending in the neighborhood of $300 million to $325 million of capital over the next three years, concentrated in maintenance, new store capital, store refresh capital and continued evaluations of all of our systems and the next steps in terms of SAP. However, as I think we have demonstrated in the past, should there be an additional opportunity, or should there be additional opportunities to enhance the efficiency in our supply chain or other initiatives to drive leverage or incremental profits, we will do what is right for the business and the shareholder in the long term. Clearly, our model and our excess liquidity affords us the opportunity to be flexible wherever needed. At this level of performance and with continued investment into the business, we would estimate cash flow in the range of $650 million to $700 million over the next three years, assuming the successful execution of our currently authorized $400 million share repurchase program, combined with the $284 million of cash we currently have on our balance sheet, we would have approximately $550 million of cash on hand and available at the end of fiscal 2012. This cash could be used for further investments in the business or to return to shareholders or look into other investment opportunities whatever they may be.We're very proud of what we've accomplished as an organization over the last four plus years, not only for our shareholders but our loyal associates and their families as well. Over the next three years, alone, we expect to add a net of approximately 140 stores or so, which creates hundreds of opportunities for promotions for our best performers and potentially creates in the neighborhood of 4,000 to 5,000 jobs, to do our part to help the economy grow and improve the overall employment picture. With that, I'll turn it back over to TJ."

But the loyalty card member is the one that we're really concentrated on. We have 1.4 million members today, that we understand they're spending about double, a little over $40 the average customer. So we're very excited about that because that's almost double what our average transaction is. And the other issue is that they're coming back frequently. And when they come back after their 10 visits and get their one-time coupon, they're spending almost $100 on an average transaction at that particular point. So those things bode well. And I think what we indicated, where we have been able to track, in some cases where we have a higher concentration of loyalty card members in some of the stores, the early performance is that number of transactions and comp sales in those stores are up about 1% higher than the overall trend of the company right now. So that's very, very encouraging. Now how big loyalty can be? I mean we're going to work on it as hard as we can come, as fast as we can. We have about 6.5 million Buzz Club members. And a think I had mentioned before, about 20% or 25% of the loyalty card members are Buzz Club members, and about three quarters of them are not. So we think we have a lot of runway in front of us there. And we think that's just a huge opportunity, coupled along with the fact of going into the third quarter and adding the technology, that all along was planned into about the end of the second into the early the third quarter. We're now going to be capable in the back half of the year to start communicating directly with these customers and offering them opportunities where they shop us, specifically in classifications of businesses in the stores. So the question is, is how smart are we and how smart is our customer and what can we offer them and encourage them to shop more frequently. So it's a pretty compelling opportunity."

It's interesting, actually, the acceleration in February is the businesses that we came out of January in the fourth quarter that we've talked about. So there's no real change other than, quite honestly, Furniture business continues to be really good. So that's very exciting and is good or better in February than it was in January. And I think I alluded to that from the Friends & Family event, which is a one-day event which clearly impacted the month of February. But it was strong throughout the entire month. As things went on, and again, it's across the board like I talked about. Case goods is decent, upholstery is really good, mattresses is really good. So those are all very exciting issues to us. And then of course, I won't get into the details, dining is good and chairs and things like that. But people are spending money where there's great value. Seasonal is decent and where there is great value, it's the same thing there. The bigger items are doing quite well, particularly patio sets, gazebos. It's like I'm just repeating myself, season-to-season, but those are the things that are really resonating. We had weather in February 2 in a number of markets, and I'm not using this as an excuse, please, no one say that Big Lots used weather as an excuse. We didn't talk about it, it is what it is. But clearly, in the warmer weather climate areas where we said earlier about 400, 450 stores, you take California, Florida, Arizona, Las Vegas, those kind of things, business was good in Seasonal. So we feel particularly strong there. Home continued good. It was really a repeat of what I said in the fourth quarter, only at even higher comp levels. The AUR I alluded to, really, boy, I feel kind of bad that you took that as something that was special. We've been talking about higher average unit retails and better values consistently. It's all about the raise the ring program. I've just kind of not said that term in about a year or year and a half. We've constantly been selling better quality merchandise at higher active average unit retails, and our business is not about price, it's about value. I'll continue to say it as long as the Board let's me continue to be here, and I can scream it. The average unit retails on our floor today are better values than they've ever been before, but they are probably slightly higher than they were before, or at least what we're selling is slightly higher than it was before, in Furniture, in Seasonal, in Home, in Hard Goods, it's across the board."

On the trend comment, I would just add on to what Steve said, and you and I have talked about this on a number of occasions in the past, that discretionary item or discretionary purchase is really starting to resonate with the customer, where they took roughly a year off and didn't really look at discretionary purchase, particularly in Home and some of the Furniture businesses. Now they're looking at it. And clearly, we have been highly leveraged to benefit from that and that's probably some of the benefit we're seeing today."

There's challenges for everybody in the United States on import container freights. The Orient and the shipping companies have decided that they haven't made the kind of money they've wanted to make over the last year, whether they have contracts with you or they don't have contracts with you. The simple answer is yes, we have contracts and we have rates that are higher than they were last year as probably everybody does, and it's an important part of our business. But there's a cost associated with it and that's baked into the margin and that will put pressure on margin because of the elevated costs. There's no one who's not going to be importing at higher costs this year. Cost associated with the shipping from the Orient, from Asia, is just going up and that's all there is to it. And they've put a tremendous amount of pressure on the retailers here, but I think we have some pretty good partners over there, that understand how we do business here. And Chuck has been specifically involved with it, with our global sourcing people. And in fact, was probably over in Asia two weeks ago, because of it, and we're back on track with everybody. But that's going to put pressure on initial markup. The overall maintenance of margins and the mix of business, hopefully, will be somewhat favorable but it will be offset by distribution freight fuel costs, whether they're domestic or import, to be quite honest with you. So probably a pretty good answer."

I can only say to you and reiterate what I've said before. The deal environment is good and it's vibrant. You noticed that we had, again, a national-branded closeout deal that's in our stores right now. It's way too early since it's the latest piece that's come in and set. Since we were under the guise and we pre-plan our business that we may or may not get it, and we don't know it from year to year. We put together what we're calling personally inside our company, a road show, a great value of upholstery, case goods, a mattress, one particular mattress, and it's absolutely resonating with the consumer of great value and doing quite well. The national-branded closeout deal that you're seeing in the stores is at the highest retails we've ever had before. And it has a higher unit retail than the last year program was. And as we sell down some of the other inventory, we'll probably be capable of understanding how well it's doing in the next quarter conference call. There are big deals coming. There are big deals that you don't see in the stores, but with our big deals that are underway right now and there are big deals that are planned for the second and into the early third quarter, quite honestly. But I won't share them with you or anybody else. We'll let our competition see them in the store when they hit. But they're big and they're good, and they will resonate with the consumer. And we've got, actually, slightly more visibility further out than I think we've had for a while. So it's one of the reasons why we feel good. And I will answer that before that question's asked, with the same way I responded all along. As things get better and business gets better, the deals tend to get better. As people spend more money on capital, they feel more comfortable at making change. So although it's not anywhere near where we'd like it to be, it never will be, it's good."

Also from a customer perspective, our comps were fairly consistent across income demographics, whether high income or more economically challenged. Comps were right around the 6% mark, which suggests to us that it's all about the extreme value that they were looking for and finding in our stores.
In terms of merchandising, Furniture and Home led the way with double-digit comps for the quarter, followed by Hardlines and Seasonal, each of which were up mid-single digits. As many of you know, Q1 is historically the largest quarter of the year in the furniture industry and in our Furniture business as well. We experienced accelerating trends as our customer responded to new styles and upholstery and our first ever Furniture Roadshow event.  Additionally, our Mattress business remained very strong and the large gallery of bankruptcy liquidation deal did extremely well.
For the third consecutive quarter, Home was a key driver as comps were up in the low double digits. We continue to deliver newness and better quality goods into our stores, and the customer has responded. Our Echo Point Home Collection generated some very good results, whether it's Echo Point or our new Port 7 collection, or the Furniture Roadshow that I mentioned earlier, we believe we're getting better and better at creating and executing these types of engineered events. 
Our Seasonal business, primarily Lawn & Garden, performed well in the quarter, despite some unfriendly weather in most of the country in the last two weeks of April. I was particularly pleased with the business in larger ticket items, such as patio, furniture and grills. As I've said before, with our customers, it's not about price. It's about value. And right now, the customer's telling us that they see great value in our higher tickets seasonal assortment. 
In Hardlines, it was all about our Electronics business, which comped up in the high teens against a very strong business last year. The chainwide rollout of our videogame software program, that occurred last year, provide an incremental sales in Q1 and the availability of DVDs, digital cameras, printers and accessories continue to positively impact this category. We also drove record inventory turnover results during Q1, which not only helps from a markdown and cash flow perspective, but also helps our cost structure continue to become more efficient.
In summary, Q1 surpassed even our highest expectations as sales increased 8%, gross margin dollars increased 9%, with expenses up only 2%, a very strong performance for the quarter. Operating profit dollars increased 49% to last year and our operating profit rate was up 200 basis points to 7.3%. 
We managed our business very prudently and generated significant cash flow. And we invested $150 million in our share repurchase program, while still ending Q1 with over $260 million of cash and no borrowings under the credit facility. 
Now Joe's going to give you some detail around the quarter and how we're looking at our forward guidance. Joe?"

Sales for the first quarter were $1.235 billion, compared to $1.142 billion for the first quarter of last year. Comparable store sales increased 6.0%.

Sales for the first quarter were $1.235 billion, compared to $1.142 billion for the first quarter of last year. Comparable store sales increased 6.0%. The key financial metric we watch to evaluate our performance is operating profit. And for Q1, both the operating profit rate and dollars were above LY. Our Q1 operating profit rate increased 200 basis points to 7.3% of sales, and operating profit dollars increased $29.8 million, or 49%. 
Looking at gross margin, our dollars grew faster than sales, as our rate of 40.6%, was 10 basis points above last year. The increase to last year was due to a lower markdown rate and a slightly favorable mix of business as our sales of our higher margin home product became a larger percent of the total sales. These improvements were partially offset by higher domestic freight costs due to higher fuel prices. 
Total SG&A dollars were $411.9 million, or up 2% compared to last year. The first quarter SG&A rate of 33.3% was down 190 basis points to last year. We experienced significant leverage in store payroll, distribution and transportation and occupancy as a result of our 6% comp. Additionally, as expected, our advertising dollars were down year-over-year due to certain cost savings initiatives, as we detailed earlier this year. 
Partially offsetting these areas of leverage is higher bonus expense incurred during the quarter given our record performance. And we also experienced higher equity-related compensation expense due to the acceleration of certain performance awards based on 2009's record year. And additionally, the equity awards for 2010 were valued at a significantly higher stock price compared to last year.
Net interest expense was $0.2 million for the quarter compared to $0.3 million last year. Our tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was 37.7% compared to 39.5% last year. The decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to the settlement of an uncertain tax position. When you add it all up for the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we reported income from continuing operations of $56.0 million or $0.68 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $36.3 million or $0.44 per diluted share a year ago.
Our results of $0.68 per share was better than our guidance, which called for earnings of $0.60 to $0.65 per share. Compared to the high end of guidance, $0.01 of the favorability came from a slightly higher gross margin rate, $0.01 came from lower SG&A expenses and the last $0.01 was the result of the favorability in the tax rate.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory ended the first quarter of fiscal 2010 at $745 million, compared to $718 million last year. The increase of 4% resulted from a 2% increase in store count compared to last year and a 2% increase in average store inventory to support our sales trends exiting Q1 and continuing into Q2. 
Cash flow, which we defined as cash provided by operating activities, less cash used in investing activities, was $96 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2010, which represents an $11 million increase compared to last year. This is directly attributable to higher earnings and better AP leverage partially offset by higher inventory levels. 
We ended the quarter with $261 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to $51 million last year. This change of $210 million is directly attributable to our cash generated over the last year, partially offset by share repurchase activity during Q1. We were active in the market repurchasing our stock during Q1 as we executed our $150 million Accelerated Share Repurchase program, or ASR. 
Our goal in executing the ASR was to ensure a base level of cash was returned to shareholders that discount to a straight dollar cost average approach and to offset estimated dilution since our last repurchase program. The ASR reduced our common shares outstanding by $3.6 million immediately. However, the total number of shares repurchased under the ASR will be based upon the volume weighted average price of our stock less the discount, over a predetermined period, and will not be known until that period ends, which by contract can be no later than January 26, 2011.
The final settlement could increase or decrease the 3.6 million shares initially reduced from our outstanding common shares. We have 250 million remaining under our current authorization to repurchase shares, opportunistically, in the open market. For the first quarter, capital expenditures totaled $11.5 million. And depreciation expense for the quarter was $19.1 million. 
Moving on to guidance. We're forecasting a comp sales increase in the range of 4% to 5% for the second quarter. This forecast is consistent with our comps, and the combined period of March and April, as well as being consistent with the first two weeks of May, or prior to the impact of the Memorial Day shift. We expect the strong comp trends in Furniture, Home and Hardlines to continue and anticipate seasonal sales will accelerate in Q2, as weather reverts to more normal conditions throughout the country. We expect our Q2 gross margin rate will be up slightly to LY due to lower markdown rate and lower shrink costs. Partially offsetting this favorability is a higher forecast for both domestic and import trade costs.
From an expense standpoint, we anticipate leverage in most major expense area's based on the forecasted comp and we expect dollar reductions in advertising and also utilities. This favorability is assumed to be partially offset by higher bonus expense, equity-related compensation expense and higher debit card fees, resulting from rate hikes being passed on by network providers.
Based on these assumptions, Q2 EPS from continuing operations is estimated to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.49 per diluted share, compared to $0.35 per diluted share last year. For the full year, we've increased our guidance and now expect income from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85 per diluted share, compared to our original guidance of $2.65 to $2.75 per share. This range of EPS assumes a share count of approximately 82 million shares and does not contemplate any opportunistic share repurchase activity or use of the remaining 250 million currently authorized. For the full year of fiscal 2010, we now expect a comparable store sales increase in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. Based on higher forecasted earnings for the year and tax  payment favorability, related to the deductibility of option exercises and restricted stock activity, we're raising our cash flow forecast for the year to $220 million from $200 million. 
Now I'll turn it over to Chuck for an update on Real Estate."
26949,106377933,63327,"Big Lots Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 27, 2010",2010-05-27,"Earnings Calls","Big Lots, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe.

During the first quarter, we opened seven new stores and closed one store, leaving us with 1,367 stores and total selling square footage of 29.3 million at the end of the quarter. Three of the new stores were traditional Big Lots, meaning secondary or tertiary locations and primarily in strip centers. Four of the new stores were A locations. And we're on track to our goal to open 80 new stores in 2010, 50 in traditional locations and 30 in A locations. 
In terms of A locations, as we discussed on our last call, we see this as a major step forward for our company and has been made possible by the softening in the commercial real estate market and the strength of our improving performance over the last several years. Early indications suggest that we are attracting a new customer base in these locations, a customer who typically did not shop us or did not have a traditional store that was convenient for them to visit on a regular basis. We're finding that she is a more discretionary customer, meaning Furniture, Home and Seasonal are more important and Consumables, as a percentage of mix, is a little smaller. 
But again, these results are very early. From a financial standpoint, the eight A locations, that were in test mode beginning in 2009, continue to be very encouraging. These locations, on average, have exceeded our initial financial goals and are trained to sales of a little over $4 million per store, with the majority of the stores between $180 and $200 per selling square foot. Being a higher rent in these locations, however, at these sales locations and with our disciplines around inventory and expenses, we're well ahead of the pace needed to hit our profitability in cash return targets.
In terms of our existing store base, we began our store refresh program during the month of May. And we'll complete approximately 45 stores during the second quarter. As a reminder, the majority of these stores will receive a new store layout. And we'll make capital improvements in all locations. In total, for 2010, we're now estimating that we'll refresh approximately 105 stores. 
Now I'll turn it back to Steve for some closing remarks."

I believe the results from the first quarter demonstrates our plans were on target with the customer. And I'm firmly convinced we're prepared to deliver the balance of this year. From merchandising to stores to marketing, to the real estate opportunities that lie ahead, I feel very good about our future. 
Our merchandise content and the value message continues to improve. The flow of inventory and the availability of merchandise does not let up, and we're working hard to make sure that it doesn't. We recently held our third Vendor Summit year here, where we invited potentially new contacts to the office here in Columbus to share with them our strategies and financial strength and to encourage them to think of us as a new customer or a larger customer. 
We continue to make progress on our Ready for Business initiative and have probably three quarters of our stores to a standard that we believe is acceptable at this point. In the last 60 days, I've been in five or six different markets on unannounced visits and there's is a noticeable difference in store execution, customer service and merchandise presentation, compared to this time a year ago. Again, progress. But this is a multi-year initiative and we've taken it on in our stores.
From our store associates to our marketing team, we're very focused on building the Buzz Club Rewards program for the future. In the last few weeks, our rewards program have exceeded the $3 million member plateau, over double where it was at the beginning of the year. Again, the program is only a few months old and we're in the stage of building memberships. So it's very difficult to say what level of impact this had on our Q1 results. The more tangible evidence, our opportunity, we believe, comes later in the year and on into 2011, when we begin to market directly to customers based on their buying behavior or history. We're busy implementing the tools to be in a position to do this in the back half of 2010. 
And finally, in terms of Real Estate, I believe we're very well positioned for the balance of 2010 and the foreseeable future. Similar to merchandising, the deal flow has been good and there's no charge of locations for us to look at and evaluate. In fact, Chuck and I were just at the ICSC Real Estate Conference earlier this week, and met with several landlords, who we do a small amount of business with or we have no locations with them at all. We tried to help them understand our financial model and the cash-rich nature of our company. 
We shared our approach to real estate and the types of locations we were most interested in negotiating. We updated them on our A store strategy, which is new and different and opens up more possible sites for them to consider for us. We reinforced with them that we're interested in all types of locations, low rent, higher rents, suburban, urban. We have an open to receive new ideas. We left the conference feeling encouraged about the opportunities to expand our landlord base in the future. 
To summarize, and then go to a brief Q&A, up against some very challenging comparisons from last year, we generated our 14th consecutive record quarter of EPS from continuing operations. Our in-store standards and the shopability of our stores have improved and we look better today than we ever have before. Our merchandise mix is highly discretionary, which positions us to be the beneficiary as consumer confidence continues to recover. 
We're continuing to make investments necessary to be successful, whether it's investing in systems, putting capital to work in our stores and distribution facilities or hiring talent where needed. We're growing our store base and have many years of growth ahead. And we generate lots of cash and invest it wisely. We happen to believe that great value will never go out of style, and discounts and saving money are likely here to stay. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to TJ."

When you get to the stock compensation, clearly, the value -- the price of our stock was significantly higher when our restricted stock and stock options were valued in 2010.

And I spent the morning as I always do going through what our strategy is and share with them the financial strength of the company and the concepts of how they can contribute and be a part of our business. Then we spent the afternoon with one on ones of anybody who wants to spend time directly with our merchants. There is just a lot of positive relationships that people are looking to build, as actually the retail environment has contracted over the last four or five years. And people are looking for financially strong and healthy people to want to do business with. And if we hadn't been on the radar screens before, they're certainly figuring out how to develop relationships with us through end-of-life product or product that they can engineer for us. We're extremely excited about the response that we got from the conference. And in fact, had a number of those vendors back in our office within four weeks after the conference, with all kinds of great ideas for the third and the fourth quarter of our  year, that I want to share with you but you clearly will see in our stores if you're in our stores at Back to School and then at Christmastime. So that's number one. The deal flow, as far as what you call closeouts or what we have traditionally known as one-time deals, continues to be very consistent. And it's across-the-board in just about all segments of our business. This is traditionally a time when certain areas of business get near ends of quarters and end of years. So we see a nice flow of product coming into the second and third quarter of the year. So we're real excited about that. And then there's been no real change whatsoever from what's been going on, I would say, in the last 12 to 18 months. So we feel pretty good about it.

But the rate side of it, clearly, the lower number of newspapers today versus a year ago, and probably lower than that going forward, it's still pretty competitive out there right now. So rates have swung a little bit more in our favor, probably like every other retailer. So that's really what's driving the majority of the change. And we did see a reduction in advertising dollars in the first quarter and are forecasting it for the year. Please understand quarter-to-quarter, the numbers could be a little bit different, based on how we want to go to market. But we're comfortable for the year. Dollars will be down in 3.5% to 4.5% comp; with dollars down clearly, there's been a fair amount of leverage opportunity there."

The engineered part of the business is just trying to be intelligent in protecting businesses based upon what had happened the year before and not knowing if it's going to happen again. The road show's probably as good of an example as anything. We put the road show together because we've had a significant furniture closeout the last two years, it turns out the last three now from one of the major furniture players in the business. But not knowing 12 months in advanced what you have to work on, programs like that to be prepared for the fact that we may not be capable of finding that kind of inventory.

And I'm very pleased with the results as we recorded our 14th consecutive quarter of record earnings per share from continuing operation",628,"Thanks, TJ, and good morning, everyone. We continue to stay focused on and execute against our win strategy during Q1. And I'm very pleased with the results as we recorded our 14th consecutive quarter of record earnings per share from continuing operations, $0.68 per share versus last year's record at that time of $0.44. 
Operating profit dollars grew 49% behind the strength of our 6% sales comp, improvement in gross margin and significant SG&A leverage compared to a year ago. From a sales perspective, trends coming out of Q4 and the holiday were every bit as strong, if not stronger in Q1. And our 6% comp was the highest quarterly comp for this business in over seven years. We were very encouraged by the customers' continued focus on a discretionary purchase, whether it was furniture, home or seasonal-type merchandise. 
Also from a customer perspective, our comps were fairly consistent across income demographics, whether high-income or more economically-challenged. Comps were right around the 6% mark, which suggests to us that it's all about the extreme value that they were looking for and finding in our stores.
In terms of merchandising, Furniture and Home led the way with double-digit comps for the quarter, followed by Hardlines and Seasonal, each of which were up mid-single digits. 
As many of you know, Q1 is historically the largest quarter of the year in the furniture industry and in our Furniture business as well. We experienced accelerating trends as our customer responded to new styles and upholstery and our first ever Furniture Roadshow event.  Additionally, our Mattress business remained very strong and the large gallery of bankruptcy liquidation deal did extremely well.
For the third consecutive quarter, Home was a key driver as comps were up in the low double digits. We continue to deliver newness and better quality goods into our stores, and the customer has responded. Our Echo Point Home Collection generated some very good results, whether it's Echo Point or our new Port 7 collection, or the Furniture Roadshow that I mentioned earlier, we believe we're getting better and better at creating and executing these types of engineered events. 
Our Seasonal business, primarily Lawn & Garden, performed well in the quarter, despite some unfriendly weather in most of the country in the last two weeks of April. I was particularly pleased with the business in larger ticket items, such as patio, furniture and grills. As I've said before, with our customers, it's not about price. It's about value. And right now, the customer's telling us that they see great value in our higher tickets seasonal assortment. 
In Hardlines, it was all about our Electronics business, which comped up in the high teens against a very strong business last year. The chain-wide rollout of our videogame software program that occurred last year, provide an incremental sales in Q1 and the availability of DVDs, digital cameras, printers and accessories continue to positively impact this category. We also drove record inventory turnover results during Q1, which not only helps from a markdown in cash flow perspective, but also helps our cost structure continue to become more efficient.
In summary, Q1 surpassed even our highest expectations as sales increased 8%, gross margin dollars increased 9%, with expenses up only 2%, a very strong performance for the quarter. Operating profit dollars increased 49% to last year and our operating profit rate was up 200 basis points to 7.3%.  We managed our business very prudently and generated significant cash flow. And we invested $150 million in our share repurchase program, while still ending Q1 with over $260 million of cash and no borrowings under the credit facility. 
Now Joe's going to give you some detail around the quarter and how we're looking at our forward guidance. Joe?"

Sales for the first quarter were $1.235 billion, compared to $1.142 billion for the first quarter of last year. Comparable store sales increased 6.0%. The key financial metric we watch to evaluate our performance",1115,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $1.235 billion, compared to $1.142 billion for the first quarter of last year. Comparable store sales increased 6.0%. The key financial metric we watch to evaluate our performance is operating profit. And for Q1, both the operating profit rate and dollars were above LY. Our Q1 operating profit rate increased 200 basis points to 7.3% of sales, and operating profit dollars increased $29.8 million, or 49%. 
Looking at gross margin, our dollars grew faster than sales, as our rate of 40.6%, was 10 basis points above last year. The increase to last year was due to a lower markdown rate and a slightly favorable mix of business as our sales of our higher margin home product became a larger percent of the total sales. These improvements were partially offset by higher domestic freight costs due to higher fuel prices. 
Total SG&A dollars were $411.9 million, or up 2% compared to last year. The first quarter SG&A rate of 33.3% was down 190 basis points to last year. We experienced significant leverage in store payroll, distribution and transportation and occupancy as a result of our 6% comp. Additionally, as expected, our advertising dollars were down year-over-year due to certain cost savings initiatives, as we detailed earlier this year. 
Partially offsetting these areas of leverage is higher bonus expense incurred during the quarter given our record performance. And we also experienced higher equity-related compensation expense due to the acceleration of certain performance awards based on 2009's record year. And additionally, the equity awards for 2010 were valued at a significantly higher stock price compared to last year.
Net interest expense was $0.2 million for the quarter compared to $0.3 million last year. Our tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was 37.7% compared to 39.5% last year. The decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to the settlement of an uncertain tax position. When you add it all up for the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we reported income from continuing operations of $56.0 million or $0.68 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $36.3 million or $0.44 per diluted share a year ago.
Our results of $0.68 per share was better than our guidance, which called for earnings of $0.60 to $0.65 per share. Compared to the high end of guidance, $0.01 of the favorability came from a slightly higher gross margin rate, $0.01 came from lower SG&A expenses and the last $0.01 was the result of the favorability in the tax rate.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory ended the first quarter of fiscal 2010 at $745 million, compared to $718 million last year. The increase of 4% resulted from a 2% increase in store count compared to last year and a 2% increase in average store inventory to support our sales trends exiting Q1 and continuing into Q2. 
Cash flow, which we defined as cash provided by operating activities, less cash used in investing activities, was $96 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2010, which represents an $11 million increase compared to last year. This is directly attributable to higher earnings and better AP leverage partially offset by higher inventory levels. 
We ended the quarter with $261 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to $51 million last year. This change of $210 million is directly attributable to our cash generated over the last year, partially offset by share repurchase activity during Q1. We were active in the market repurchasing our stock during Q1 as we executed our $150 million Accelerated Share Repurchase program, or ASR. 
Our goal in executing the ASR was to ensure a base level of cash was returned to shareholders that discount to a straight dollar cost average approach and to offset estimated dilution since our last repurchase program. The ASR reduced our common shares outstanding by $3.6 million immediately. However, the total number of shares repurchased under the ASR will be based upon the volume weighted average price of our stock less the discount, over a predetermined period, and will not be known until that period ends, which by contract can be no later than January 26, 2011.
The final settlement could increase or decrease the 3.6 million shares initially reduced from our outstanding common shares. We have 250 million remaining under our current authorization to repurchase shares, opportunistically, in the open market. For the first quarter, capital expenditures totaled $11.5 million. And depreciation expense for the quarter was $19.1 million. 
Moving on to guidance. We're forecasting a comp sales increase in the range of 4% to 5% for the second quarter. This forecast is consistent with our comps, and the combined period of March and April, as well as being consistent with the first two weeks of May, or prior to the impact of the Memorial Day shift. We expect the strong comp trends in Furniture, Home and Hardlines to continue and anticipate seasonal sales will accelerate in Q2, as weather reverts to more normal conditions throughout the country. We expect our Q2 gross margin rate will be up slightly to LY due to lower markdown rate and lower shrink costs. Partially offsetting this favorability is a higher forecast for both domestic and import trade costs.
From an expense standpoint, we anticipate leverage in most major expense area's based on the forecasted comp and we expect dollar reductions in advertising and also utilities. This favorability is assumed to be partially offset by higher bonus expense, equity-related compensation expense and higher debit card fees, resulting from rate hikes being passed on by network providers.
Based on these assumptions, Q2 EPS from continuing operations is estimated to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.49 per diluted share, compared to $0.35 per diluted share last year. For the full year, we've increased our guidance and now expect income from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85 per diluted share, compared to our original guidance of $2.65 to $2.75 per share. This range of EPS assumes a share count of approximately 82 million shares and does not contemplate any opportunistic share repurchase activity or use of the remaining 250 million currently authorized. For the full year of fiscal 2010, we now expect a comparable store sales increase in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. Based on higher forecasted earnings for the year and tax  payment favorability, related to the deductibility of option exercises and restricted stock activity, we're raising our cash flow forecast for the year to $220 million from $200 million. 
Now I'll turn it over to Chuck for an update on Real Estate."

During the first quarter, we opened seven new stores and closed one store, leaving us with 1,367 stores and total selling square footage of 29.3 million at the end of the quarter. Three of the new stores were traditional Big Lots, meaning secondary or tertiary locations and primarily in strip centers. Four of the new stores were A locations. And we're on track to our goal to open 80 new stores in 2010, 50 in traditional locations and 30 in A locations. 
In terms of A locations, as we discussed on our last call, we see this as a major step forward for our company and has been made possible by the softening in the commercial real estate market and the strength of our improving performance over the last several years. Early indications suggest that we are attracting a new customer base in these locations, a customer who typically did not shop us or did not have a traditional store that was convenient for them to visit on a regular basis. We're finding that she is a more discretionary customer, meaning Furniture, Home and Seasonal are more important and Consumables, as a percentage of mix, is a little smaller. 
But again, these results are very early. From a financial standpoint, the eight A locations, that were in test mode beginning in 2009, continue to be very encouraging. These locations, on average, have exceeded our initial financial goals and are trained to sales of a little over $4 million per store, with the majority of the stores between $180 and $200 per selling square foot. Being a higher rent in these locations, however, at these sales locations and with our disciplines around inventory and expenses, we're well ahead of the pace needed to hit our profitability in cash return targets.
In terms of our existing store base, we began our store refresh program during the month of May. And we'll complete approximately 45 stores during the second quarter. As a reminder, the majority of these stores will receive a new store layout. And we'll make capital improvements in all locations. In total, for 2010, we're now estimating that we'll refresh approximately 105 stores. 
Now I'll turn it back to Steve for some closing remarks.

I believe the results from the first quarter demonstrates our plans were on target with the customer. And I'm firmly convinced we're prepared to deliver the balance of this year. From merchandising to stores to marketing, to the real estate opportunities that lie ahead, I feel very good about our future. 
Our merchandise content and the value message continues to improve. The flow of inventory and the availability of merchandise does not let up, and we're working hard to make sure that it doesn't. We recently held our third Vendor Summit year here, where we invited potentially new contacts to the office here in Columbus to share with them our strategies and financial strength and to encourage them to think of us as a new customer or a larger customer. 
We continue to make progress on our Ready for Business initiative and have probably three quarters of our stores to a standard that we believe is acceptable at this point. In the last 60 days, I've been in five or six different markets on unannounced visits and there's is a noticeable difference in store execution, customer service and merchandise presentation, compared to this time a year ago. Again, progress. But this is a multi-year initiative and we've taken it on in our stores.
From our store associates to our marketing team, we're very focused on building the Buzz Club Rewards program for the future. In the last few weeks, our rewards program have exceeded the $3 million member plateau, over double where it was at the beginning of the year. Again, the program is only a few months old and we're in the stage of building memberships. So it's very difficult to say what level of impact this had on our Q1 results. The more tangible evidence, our opportunity, we believe, comes later in the year and on into 2011, when we begin to market directly to customers based on their buying behavior or history. We're busy implementing the tools to be in a position to do this in the back half of 2010. 
And finally, in terms of Real Estate, I believe we're very well positioned for the balance of 2010 and the foreseeable future. Similar to merchandising, the deal flow has been good and there's no charge of locations for us to look at and evaluate. In fact, Chuck and I were just at the ICSC Real Estate Conference earlier this week, and met with several landlords, who we do a small amount of business with or we have no locations with them at all. We tried to help them understand our financial model and the cash-rich nature of our company. 
We shared our approach to real estate and the types of locations we were most interested in negotiating. We updated them on our A store strategy, which is new and different and opens up more possible sites for them to consider for us. We reinforced with them that we're interested in all types of locations, low rent, higher rents, suburban, urban. We have an open to receive new ideas. We left the conference feeling encouraged about the opportunities to expand our landlord base in the future. 
To summarize, and then go to a brief Q&A, up against some very challenging comparisons from last year, we generated our 14th consecutive record quarter of EPS from continuing operations. Our in-store standards and the shopability of our stores have improved and we look better today than we ever have before. Our merchandise mix is highly discretionary, which positions us to be the beneficiary as consumer confidence continues to recover. 
We're continuing to make investments necessary to be successful, whether it's investing in systems, putting capital to work in our stores and distribution facilities or hiring talent where needed. We're growing our store base and have many years of growth ahead. And we generate lots of cash and invest it wisely. We happen to believe that great value will never go out of style, and discounts and saving money are likely here to stay. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to TJ."

And I spent the morning as I always do going through what our strategy is and share with them the financial strength of the company and the concepts of how they can contribute and be a part of our business. Then we spent the afternoon with one on ones of anybody who wants to spend time directly with our merchants. There is just a lot of positive relationships that people are looking to build, as actually the retail environment has contracted over the last four or five years. And people are looking for financially strong and healthy people to want to do business with. And if we hadn't been on the radar screens before, they're certainly figuring out how to develop relationships with us through end-of-life product or product that they can engineer for us. We're extremely excited about the response that we got from the conference. And in fact, had a number of those vendors back in our office within four weeks after the conference, with all kinds of great ideas for the third and the fourth quarter of our  year that I want to share with you, but you clearly will see in our stores if you're in our stores at Back to School and then at Christmastime. So that's number one. The deal flow, as far as what you call closeouts or what we have traditionally known as one-time deals, continues to be very consistent. And it's across the board in just about all segments of our business. This is traditionally a time when certain areas of business get near ends of quarters and ends of years. So we see a nice flow of product coming into the second and third quarter of the year. So we're real excited about that. And then there's been no real change whatsoever from what's been going on, I would say, in the last 12 to 18 months. So we feel pretty good about it.

As you know, we have done a significant amount of testing in the last 12 to 18 months, primarily focused on print distribution. As the Buzz Club grows, as the rewards program grows and as stores mature, what level of print distribution is appropriate by store? And that's what we've been testing to. We first tested through advo [ph]  And the first test [ph] component of our distribution. We're now starting to look at newspapers. So it's a several quarters worth of testing you had to do. And it's something that we think we're partway through but not complete. So that's, kind of, I'll call it volume-based. But the rate side of it, clearly, the lower number of newspapers today versus a year ago, and probably lower than that going forward, it's still pretty competitive out there right now. So rates have swung a little bit more in our favor, probably like every other retailer. So that's really what's driving the majority of the change. And we did see a reduction in advertising dollars in the first quarter and are forecasting it for the year. Please understand quarter-to-quarter, the numbers could be a little bit different, based on how we want to go to market. But we're comfortable for the year. Dollars will be down in 3.5% to 4.5% comp; with dollars down clearly, there's been a fair amount of leverage opportunity there."

We continued to stay focused and execute across the organization during the second quarter, and I'm very proud of what we were able to accomplish as a team.
We recorded our 15th consecutive quarter of record EPS from continuing operations, $0.48 per share, versus last year's record at that time of $0.35. We grew the topline by over 5% with the comps of 3.8% supplemented by net store growth of 24 stores.
Operating profit dollars grew 33% behind the strength of our comp, improvement in gross margin and significant SG&A leverage compared to a year ago. And we were able to repurchase significant amounts of stock in the last 60 days, which we believe is a very good use of shareholder cash and demonstrates the confidence we have in this business and the longer-term potential.
From the sales perspective, our comp of 3.8% for the quarter puts us near the top end of our competitive set and represents very good performance in an environment with the somewhat hesitant consumer.
Across retail, it appeared that consumers were more cautious during the June-July timeframe. However, it was very interesting to see that the discretionary categories and the higher ticket goods seemed to be the most appealing areas of our store during Q2.
In terms of merchandizing, furniture, home and seasonal led the way, and electronics continued to perform up against some very lofty numbers from a year ago. For the third consecutive quarter, furniture comped up double digits with broad-based strength across all classifications: upholstery, RTA, case goods and also the mattresses, which interestingly enough was the strongest business.
On average, furniture represents the highest ticket prices in the store, which suggests our customers are willing to spend where they see extreme value and good-quality product.
Home comped up in the low double digits again in Q2 with improved quality, better price points and a very successful Port 7 home event. I'm very pleased with our merchants in this area have responded to the challenge, and I have every reason to believe that this category has even more upside going forward.
Our seasonal business, primarily lawn and garden and summer, comped up high single digits against multiple years of comp store increases in this all important category. Seasonal is one of the two top reasons customers come to Big Lots, and we delivered on our promise. Again, the highest price points performed the best, further reinforcing for us that with our customers it's not about price, it's about value and they're telling us by ringing the register that they see great value in our seasonal assortments.
And finally, our electronics business continues to be good, comping us mid single digits on top of a comp in the high 30s last year. The chain-wide rollout of our video game software program that occurred last year provided incremental sales in Q2. And the availability of closeout deals like DVDs, digital cameras, printers and even a couple of opportunities with computers and GPS units were part of delivering a good comp in Q2.
Also during the quarter, we made meaningful progress on several other of our key strategic initiatives, ready-for-business and our store refresh program and our rewards loyalty card.
Our ready-for-business initiatives continued to get traction, and we estimate that over 80% of our stores serve a standard that we believe is acceptable at this point. We've created a process where executives and their teams are coordinating unannounced visits to stores across the country to hold ourselves accountable to these new standards. I'm pleased to say that we're seeing noticeable differences in store execution, customer service and merchandize presentation compared to this time a year ago. Again, progress, but this is a multiyear initiative we've taken on in our stores.
In terms of our existing store base, our store refresh program is moving along the schedule. Chuck will update you on the details in a moment. But at a really high level, we're pleased with the execution and early results.
Our store associates and our marketing team are focused on building the rewards program for the future. The number of active rewards members now exceeds 5 million customers and continues to build, and the program is still relatively new. Early on, we're seeing some level of positive comp sales impact in the top 100 or so stores in terms of penetration. However, the overall impact to the company comp in Q2 or on year-to-date is an immaterial number.
The more tangible opportunity we believe comes later in the year and on into 2011 when we begin to market directly to customers based on their buying behavior. We're busy testing different ideas and promotions with the goal of improving both transactions and ticket with some of our most loyal customers.
Now, Joe is going to give you some details on the quarter, and how we're looking at our forward guidance.

26949,111997073,75910,"Big Lots Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 24, 2010",2010-08-24,"Earnings Calls","Big Lots, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $1.142 billion, an increase of 5.1% over the $1.087 billion we reported for the second quarter last year.Comparable store sales increased 3.8%. For Q2, operating profit dollars",1844,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $1.142 billion, an increase of 5.1% over the $1.087 billion we reported for the second quarter last year.
Comparable store sales increased 3.8%. For Q2, operating profit dollars and rate improved over last year. Q2 operating profit dollars were $63.2 million, an increase of approximately $16 million or 33% compared to last year. As expected, our operating rate increased by 100 basis points as both gross margin and expenses improved as a percent of sales.
Looking at gross margin, our dollars grew 6.5% which is a combination of a 5.1% sales increase plus expansion in the gross margin rate. Our rate for Q2 of 40.5% was 50 basis points above last year. The increase in rate was due to lower markdowns, particularly in seasonal and home, given the strength of those businesses.
Also helping the margin rate in the quarter was lower shrink costs and a slightly favorable mix impact as sales of our higher margin seasonal and home categories became a larger percent of the total sales. These improvements were partially offset by higher freight costs, both import and domestic.
In terms of imports, the increases in container rates have been well documented, and we along with most every other retailer will be fighting this battle for the next several quarters. Domestic freight costs are also up to last year, with fuel and rising carrier rates driving the increase.
Total SG&A dollars were $399.2 million, or up 3% compared to last year. The second quarter SG&A rate of 34.9% was down 60 basis points to last year. We experienced leverage in most major expense areas, and as expected we saw real dollar reductions in advertising, utilities and health benefits.
You recall that each of these three areas have been specific initiatives designed to lower costs. Additionally, in advertising we did have a planned reduction of one ad which also helped to curtail cost.
Partially offsetting these areas of leverage was higher bonus expense incurred during the quarter given our record performance, higher equity-related compensation expense, and higher debit card fees from a spike in network rates.
Net interest expense was $0.3 million for the quarter compared to $0.5 million last year. Our tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 was 38.3% compared to 39.3% last year. The lower tax rate was primarily due to a state income tax settlement.
In total for the second quarter of 2010 we reported income from continuing operations of $38.8 million or $0.48 per diluted share compared to income from continuing operations of $28.6 million or $0.35 per diluted share a year ago. This result was in line with our previously communicated guidance of $0.44 to $0.49.
Comparing our results to the low end of EPS guidance, $0.01 of the favorability came from a slightly higher gross margin rate; $0.02 came from lower SG&A expenses, and the last penny was due to opportunistic share repurchase activity in Q2.
Turning to the balance sheet, inventory ended the second quarter of fiscal 2010 at $734 million compared to $668 million last year. Now it's real important to understand our inventory position heading into the third quarter, because the $66 million increase to last year, 10%, is not our usual position. However, approximately $55 million of the $66 million or over 80% can be summarized as timing of import receipts and timing of deals.
In terms of imports, we made an intentional decision to move up delivery dates and bring in goods early to avoid potential disruption or risk of sales that could have resulted from the container shortages coming out of Asia. On the deals front, for those of you who have been in our stores recently, you should have noticed three large deals that we believe will be important sales drivers for Q3; the furniture road show event, a Stratolounger closeout and also a large branded underwear deal in time for back-to-school.
Each of these deals is an important part of our comp expectations for Q3. The balance of the inventory increase of about $10 million relates to higher store count as we have 24 more stores than last year at the end of Q2. So as you can see, the inventory build was intentional and designed to position us for sales and earnings growth in Q3.
Cash flow, which we define as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities decreased by $56 million compared to last year. This was largely attributable to a $66 million increase in year-over-year inventory levels, partially offset by our increase in Q2 earnings.
We ended the quarter with $171 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to $98 million last year. This change of $73 million is attributable to our cash generated over the last year, partially offset by our year-to-date share repurchase activity.
We were active in the market, repurchasing our stock during Q2, as we invested $83.8 million to purchase 2.5 million shares at a weighted average price of $33.58 per share. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we continued to invest in our repurchase plan and through yesterday, August 23, we've invested $67.9 million in the third quarter of 2010 to repurchase 2.2 million shares at an average price of $31.19 bringing the total number of shares repurchased, excluding our ASR, to 4.7 million shares at an average price of $32.46.
Year-to-date, we've repurchased $301.8 million of company stock, $150 million under the ASR program and $151.8 million through opportunistic repurchases. Although the final settlement of the total number of shares repurchased under our ASR will not be known until the contract ends, had the ASR settled yesterday, August 23, the total amount of shares repurchased under the ASR would have been 4.3 million shares.
Combining ASR at 4.3 million shares and our recent opportunistic repurchase efforts of 4.7 million shares, our total number of shares repurchased year-to-date would be 8.9 million or approximately 11% of our outstanding shares. We have $98.2 million remaining under our current authorization to repurchase shares opportunistically in the open market as of today. For the second quarter, capital expenditures totaled $31.1 million, and depreciation expense for the quarter was $18.8 million.
Moving on to guidance, we're forecasting a comp sales increase in the range of 2% to 4% for the third quarter. This is based on recent sales trends, incremental deals and one additional ad circular this year in August, and to generating more back-to-school business. We expect our Q3 gross margin rate will be slightly down to last year.
You would recall that last year's rate benefited by approximately 20 basis points from a onetime import duty contingency settlement. Additionally, we're anticipating that a lower markdown rate, favorable merchandize mix impact from higher anticipated sales in our better margin categories and lower shrink expense will be offset by higher domestic and import freight cost.
Our Q3 guidance anticipates expenses will be essentially flat as a percentage of sales. Flattish SG&A as a percent of sales is different from where we've been recently, but we know there are some challenges in Q3 that make this a unique quarter. From a trend standpoint what makes Q3 unique? Well, we see differences in three key areas; store openings, distribution and transportation, and advertising.
First, on new store openings, we have 55 stores to open from August through the first couple of weeks in November compared to the 33 stores we opened during the same timeframe last year. This will result in approximately $2 million or 20 basis points of incremental pre-opening expense in the third quarter. Next, from a distribution and transportation standpoint, we begin to anniversary our dedicated, outbound fleet contract savings from last year and the closing of our California furniture D.C. in Q3 a year ago.
For these two reasons, and given the highly volatile market for trucking costs and peak season surcharges, we believe it's prudent to not expect leverage here in Q3. And lastly as I mentioned earlier, we moved an ad circular out of Q2 into Q3. On average, we spent about $2 million for each ad, so $2 million out of Q2 and into Q3 will minimize any leverage opportunity in advertising during Q3. This is a timing difference only; we still expect total advertising dollars to be down for the year with leverage for the year of 20 basis points or so.
Clearly, there are some unique factors to Q3 SG&A that we believe are isolated to the quarter, because in a moment you'll hear that we expect expense leverage to return in Q4. Based on these assumptions, Q3 EPS from continuing operations is estimated to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.29 per diluted share compared to $0.27 per diluted share a year ago.
Turning to the fourth quarter, we are forecasting a comp sales increase in the range of 2% to 4% against our best comp of the year last year at 5.1%. In a moment, Steve will touch on some of the drivers for our Q4 comp. Additionally, we expect to benefit from one additional shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
We expect our Q4 gross margin rate will be down to last year, driven by higher domestic and import freight costs and lower IMU in certain deals and nine weeks of Christmas strategies designed to drive excitement and for traffic to our stores. From an expense standpoint, we anticipate leverage in most major expense areas, including store payroll, distribution and transportation, health insurance, utilities and advertising.
This favorability is assumed to be partially offset by higher debit card fees, resulting from rate hikes being passed on by network providers. Based on these assumptions, Q4 EPS from continuing operations is estimated to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.45 per diluted share compared to $1.31 per diluted share last year.
For the full year, we've raised our guidance and now expect income from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 to be in the range of $2.82 to $2.90 per diluted share compared to our previous guidance of $2.75 to $2.85 per diluted share.
We've raised the midpoint of our annual guidance to reflect our Q2 beat to the midpoint of guidance, slightly higher sales and operating profit modeled for the fall and the impact of the opportunistic share repurchase activity that I mentioned earlier. This range of EPS is same as in average annual diluted share count of approximately 80 million shares and does not contemplate any further opportunistic share repurchase activity past close of business yesterday.
We now estimate net interest expense for the year of approximately $1 million. And given the later timing of capital expenditures, we now expect depreciation expense for the year to be approximately $80 million versus prior guidance of $80 million to $85 million. For the full year of fiscal 2010, we expect a comparable store sales increase in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%.
Now I'll turn it over to Chuck for an update on real estate.

During the second quarter, we opened 18 new stores and closed 11 stores, leaving us with 1,374 stores and total selling square footage of 29.5 million at the end of the quarter. 11 of the new stores were traditional Big Lots, meaning in secondary or tertiary locations and primarily in strip centers. We also opened seven new A type locations.
We're on track to our goal to open 80 new stores in 2010, 50 in traditional locations and 30 in A type locations. Year-to-date, we've opened 25 new stores, and we've executed lease agreements on the remaining 55 sites to open this year. We anticipate the majority of the remaining 55 stores will open in the October-November timeframe or prior to Thanksgiving.
Year-to-date, we've closed 12 stores and still anticipate closing 40 stores in total for 2010. A number of the stores closing are order stores that are being relocated to higher traffic areas and better strip centers. Additionally, several of these stores were previously too small for a full-sized furniture department and will be relocated to a larger space to accommodate our full furniture assortment.
As Steve mentioned earlier, our store refresh program is moving along on schedule, and year-to-date we've completed 76 of the planned 105 stores. The layout changes and capital improvements in the remaining stores are underway and are targeted to be completed by mid-September. Although still very early, overall we're experiencing sales lifts in the low single digit for completed refresh stores.
Results vary widely on a store-by-store basis, and we're analyzing performance across several key attributes, including sales volume, store management store age, store size and the extent of merchandized category repositioning within the store to determine the combination of attributes to drive the largest sales increases.
Identifying the attributes most correlated with success and compiling learnings from our store management teams will aid us in planning any future refresh programs.
Now back to Steve for some closing remarks.

I am confident our merchants have delivered much improved content and I see those efforts continuing on into the holiday season.
To begin Q3, we have certain larger sized noticeable deals that we believe will be key comp drivers, particularly in furniture with the road show event which was a highly successful and new event in Q1. You'll see a significant branded underwear that will carry through to holiday.
In electronics, video gaming, a much improved DVD assortment with more current titles, printers and of late some activity with GPS units in our stores, this business is well positioned for Q3. There is the next space of a book deal in stores today with better titles. A similar deal was good for our business in the first half of 2010.
Aside from the deals I just mentioned, the content and quality of our import and day-in and day-out business continues to get better and better. In particular, seasonal and home have been strong, and we expect will continue to be good throughout holiday as the customers are recognizing extreme value we are offering in these two key categories.
Looking ahead to Q4 and the nine weeks of Christmas, you will see a much more focused key item business than in years past. This is a strategy that was tested last year in our how-high-is-high testing. You will see focused key item presentations on end-caps, palette positions and the four-way merchandisers in the front of the store. I'm confident that our stores will look better than they ever have in terms of presentation, cleanliness and from a customer service standpoint.
We've upgraded our in-store standards along with adding talent to the stores organization, and the pay-off from that investment should be now when volume, customers and customer service needs are at their peak. Additionally, our merchants have done an amazing job improving the inventory flow, and we have more goods coming in pre-ticketed and in PDQs than in any other time in our history, which should make this holiday easier for our stores to execute than in years past.
And I'm confident we have a strong marketing message for holiday with incremental rewards activities, a new media campaign and plenty of ad support featuring the best of what Big Lots has to offer in the all important nine weeks of Christmas. We will execute in the aspects of our business that we can control that I am sure of.
With that I'll turn it back to T.J.

And I think we've done a relatively good job maintaining costs. Commodity prices have been challenging when it comes overseas and domestically when it comes to steel and when it comes to cotton prices. So those things have been slightly challenged.
The other issue from the orient has been a challenge fro a wage rate standpoint. People are getting paid more and of course the fact that a number of factories over the last 18 months have closed overseas. So the strong have survived but there is a cost of doing a business with the strong that are surviving over there. But preplanning that business gives us a unique opportunity to know what kind of value we need to be retailing merchandise. And what we continue to do and we've done year-over-year-over-year and will continue to do going forward is put more value in merchandise if prices have to go up for one reason or another.
So we're doing the best job we possibly can along with every other retailer I think, and around the world. And fighting the fight and fighting the battles.

It's not overall consumables that are not performing quite as well. It is certain segments of the business really, the health and beauty aids part and the organization parts, plastic and things like that, paper, continue to see really good deals and continue to perform very, very well. I think we're a little bit more challenged right this second. And frankly, I have heard that other retailers are not as happy about their parts of the businesses really and the food part of the business.
We're pretty active on what's going on there, although a want a flat business to be up 3% and a 3% business to be up 5%, 6% or 7%. We're very vigilant about really making sure that our offerings are as great and extreme value as other parts of our business.

So we do need some level of comp to continue to leverage that part of the business. That's been our guidance for the last couple of quarters.
I guess what's unique about third quarter is we had these two large initiatives last year that generated significant leverage for the past 12 months. We're starting to anniversary those at a time when quite frankly the outbound and inbound parts of our business are at their peak, as we're looking to holiday season. We're receiving or shipping a lot of goods on the lowest sales base throughout the year. So it's the more challenging quarter. It always has been from the leverage standpoint in D&TS.
We're forecasting that leverage to return, albeit not at the same rate in fourth quarter. So from a productivity standpoint, all distribution centers are challenged, the merchants continue to be challenged on how they are delivering goods and the carton value or the case pack value there to try to make our buildings more efficient.
We have certain another smaller initiatives in place going into next year to try to save on costs. But I guess going forward, we've looking at continuing to try to leverage that part of the business albeit at not the same rate where we've been for the last two or three years. I mean we did what I think most people would do when they have looked at the cost structure at business. We took the biggest ideas first and executed them, and executed them very well. Now we need a little improvement on the sales line and some of the initiatives will be of smaller dollar amounts.

Forgetting about sales for a minute, real dollars reducing year-over-year in advertising, utilities as you just mentioned and also health benefits, as we redesigned our health plan. And also completed some audit work there on eligible associates. So those three areas we've committed to real dollars being down this year.
Additionally, we continue to see opportunity to leverage store payroll and also distribution transportation cost on an annual basis. So we know those dollars are going to increase, because as Steve has said a number of times we are going to pay for performance, we are going to continue to grant merit increases et cetera. So we know there's going to be some cost increase there.
We just don't see it at the same rate of sales. So we do see leverage and opportunities there going forward. I think it's important to understand even the leverage that we gave today for the year and for the third and fourth quarter those scenarios, we are incurring some pretty hefty increases in expanses, particularly on debit cards, and also in equity related expanses, which as you know we file on our cues so you can see those numbers.
From our view any way, the business performs pretty well as continuing to perform pretty well from an expense standpoint. Here in 2010, now some four plus years later, since we've started some of these initiatives.

Where they were buying in the second quarter and for instance they were buying at the high end, and where they were buying in seasonal, they were buying in a better quality sets in a better quality tools.
So they are not afraid, I'm not real clear in my mind, if that's a function of the fact that they are comfortable doing it or that we're actually attracting a different or an additional customer base that appreciates value that may have not understood us in the past. One of the things that we do is, Joe, as you well know, is we spend an awful lot of time understanding not only our customer, but the customer who shops us frequently and infrequently too.
And the place where we seen to have made the most headway in the last six months, and the last time we actually talked to a customer was a customer that was a more infrequent shopper that we are finally starting to attract. And that's been an initiative over the last six or seven months that we hope to appreciate more going into the third and fourth quarter.
We saw in the fourth quarter of last year, I think it's one of the reasons that comps were as good as they were, in the first quarter and in the second quarter we're attracting a customer that didn't shop us as frequently as before. Clearly our existing core customers are as loyal as they've ever been, and their spend is slightly higher than it's ever been before too. So I think both of those combinations have been very positive for us.

I understand your comment about it's not the time in year; you may interpret that. But people shop for furniture 12 months out of the year. The volume level in the third quarter is not as high as the second quarter or the first quarter.
But we learnt two things that happen for the third quarter, why we're so encouraged and like our position. We had something that we put together in the first quarter that we called the Roadshow, it was exceptional value in upholstery and in dining, and in RTA, and in a little bit of lighting and mattresses that just was outstanding and helped drive the double-digit comp in the first quarter and into the second quarter. And so, we put one together immediately for the third quarter and we're certainly encouraged about that performance. That's number one and that's a piece of the inventory there.
Number two is remember we're in the opportunistic business, and Stratolounger in Stratford, which I can say now is a name that we control beside the fact that we bought the closeout, gave us an opportunity to have name brand closeouts that resonate with the customer that we were never able to have before. And we're going to absolutely take advantage of that when we can.
And that wasn't preplanned for the quarter many months ago. It's one of those typical opportunities where we get a telephone call and the bank says they're looking to reduce inventory. Who wants the inventory the worse than who can take the inventory off of our hands?
And at the same time we were able to negotiate the names, which is something that we think can add great value going into 2011, and further forward, I think it's a name that is national and the consumer understands. So both of those investments are where the real additional inventory is in the third quarter in furniture, and we like our position where we're at an awful lot in both of those deals.

And clearly, I can't share them all with you, but you're going to see continued growth from us and just great deals in the DVD part of the business. That just has been terrific for us. We have seen deals that we've never seen before from GPS opportunities and computers, which we never saw really before. The underwear deal was a huge opportunity, and the quantity was enough to take us through the fourth quarter.
The furniture deals, even though it's good business, to me it's what I've said all along. People think that when business is bad that the deals are better, it's not so; it's when business gets better that the deals get better and better and better, because capital investments are made by companies, and comfort levels of trying new and different things which produce this closeout inventory for us. And that's why I think we're seeing bigger and better deals than we've ever seen before.
So if inventories are backing up for manufacturers, you're just telling me that our telephones are going to continue to ring very strong into the third and the fourth quarter.

I would tell you, it was quite selective by area of the country and not any specific area, but not nearly on a national basis that all the rhetoric and the verbiage that we have seen it. We absolutely took competitive markdowns where we needed to, but I would tell you they were very small numbers, because we're priced right every day as it is. There may have been a selective district that a store manger at a grocery store or at a national discount retailer decided to take a markdown in Tupelo, Mississippi where we met it.

So August, in the month that we're currently in, we are up against comp store sales declines from a year ago. What I would say is similar to what I talked with a number of people about coming out of Q2. The last 10 or 11 weeks of the quarter in Q2, clearly, you can kind of squeeze our comps for trending in that call it mid-threes range.
As we've turned the corner and headed into third quarter, obviously we're looking at those trends very closely and that's what helps set our guidance. Also, we do have an extra ad here in the month of August as Joe mentioned. So let me just give you quarter-to-date August comps.
I wouldn't be giving you a fair comparison, but what I would say is, we took into account trends coming out of second quarter, beginning of August, and the deals and the promotions that we know we have planned for third quarter, and that's how we landed on the 2% to 4% comp guidance for the quarter. And Steve, you want to talk about consumables?

It's the food piece of the business that's a little bit more challenged to this particular point, although I am encouraged about our plan much more for the fourth quarter than I am for the third quarter. So I hope I responded to that piece.
As far as your comment about Wal-Mart, hurting the market or hurting us, I can only respond to that by saying that 30% of our business is consumables, and of the total company's business, only 10% is food. And if I am not mistaken, Wal-Mart just came off of their fifth quarter in a row of comp store decreases. So I am not so sure that they are doing anything to hurt us or the rest of the market. I guess most of the grocery stores could respond to you a little bit better than I could in that part of the business.
I would tell you that I don't believe that a competitor is hurting us. I as always look at how we are executing that part of the business, and I would admit to you that we are responsible for whatever lack of comp store increase we're having in most of our businesses and not so much what other competitors are doing to us. And we are taking a very hard look at ourselves and seeing what can we do better in those aspects of the business to start the comp increases to be more consistent with the rest of the company.

We have been pretty consistent to say that our internal goal, and this is a very strong internal goal of ours, is to continue to expand the operating margin each year and in general that is expected to occur through SG&A leverage.
Do we believe a flat comp as a leverage point will continue for ever? And we've said no, but that is an ongoing goal. So we will continue to strive to find ways to save expenses and continue to keep that leverage point as low as possible. But we are going to continue with store growth plans. So next year, we've said that we'd like to open a few more stores than this year. And to your point, Chuck, that does put some pressure on that leverage point.
Gross margin, we've said that our fourth quarter this year is a perfect example. We'll never manage gross margin rate at the expensive of gross margin dollars. So we always look at expanding gross margin dollars, which we are doing in the fourth quarter this year, and not manage to the gross margin rate.

We continue to stay focused and execute across the organization during the second quarter and I'm very proud of what we were able to accomplish as a team. We recorded our 15th consecutive quarter of record EPS from continuing operations, $0.48 per share versus last year's record at that time of $0.35. 
We grew the top line by over 5% with the comps of 3.8% supplemented by net store growth of 24 stores. Operating profit dollars grew 33% behind the strength of our comp, improvement in gross margin and significant SG&A leverage compared to a year ago. And we were able to repurchase significant amounts of stock in the last 60 days, which we believe is a very good use of shareholder cash and demonstrates the confidence we have in this business and the longer-term potential.
From a sales perspective, our comp of 3.8% for the quarter puts us near the top end of our competitive set and represents very good performance in an environment with a somewhat hesitant consumer. Across retail, it appeared that consumers were more cautious during the June, July time frame. However, it was very interesting to see that the discretionary categories and the higher ticket goods seemed to be the most appealing areas of our store during Q2.
In terms of merchandising, Furniture, Home and Seasonal led the way, and Electronics continued to perform up against some very lofty numbers from a year ago. For the third consecutive quarter, Furniture comped up double digits with broad-based strength across all classifications, Upholstery, RTA, Case Goods and also the Mattresses, which interestingly enough was the strongest business. On average, Furniture represents the highest ticket prices in the store, which suggests our customers willing to spend where they see extreme value and good quality product. 
Home comped up in the low double digits again in Q2 with improved quality, better price points and a very successful Port 7 home event. I'm very pleased with how our merchants in this area have responded to the challenge, and I have every reason to believe that this category has even more upside going forward.
Our Seasonal business, primarily Lawn & Garden and Summer comped up high single digits against multiple years of comp store increases in this all-important category. Seasonal is one of the two top reasons customers come to Big Lots, and we delivered on our promise. Again, the highest price points performed the best, further reinforcing for us that with our customers, it's not about price, it's about value and they're telling us by ringing the register that they see great value in our Seasonal assortments. 
And finally, our Electronics business continues to be good, comping up mid-single digits on top of a comp in the high 30s last year. The chain-wide rollout of our video game software program that occurred last year provided incremental sales in Q2 and the availability of closeout deals like DVDs, digital cameras, printers and even a couple of opportunities with computers and GPS units were part of delivering a good comp in Q2.
Also during the quarter, we made meaningful progress on several other of our key strategic initiatives, Ready for Business and our Store Refresh program and our Rewards loyalty card. Our Ready for Business initiatives continue to get traction, and we estimate that over 80% of our stores are at a standard that we believe is acceptable at this point. We've created a process where executives and their teams are coordinating unannounced visits to stores across the country to hold ourselves accountable to these new standards. I'm pleased to say that we're seeing noticeable differences in store execution, customer service and merchandise presentation compared to this time a year ago. Again, progress, but this is a multiyear initiative we have taken on in our stores.
In terms of our existing store base, our Store Refresh program is moving along the schedule. Chuck will update you on the details in a moment. But at a really high level, we're pleased with the execution and early results. Our store associates and our marketing team are focused on building the Rewards program for the future. The number of active Rewards members now exceeds 5 million customers and continues to build, and the program is still relatively new. Early on, we're seeing some level of positive comp sales impact in the top 100 or so stores in terms of penetration. However, the overall impact to the company comp in Q2 or on year-to-date is an immaterial number. 
The more tangible opportunity, we believe, comes later in the year and on into 2011, when we begin to market directly to customers based on their buying behavior. We're busy testing different ideas and promotions with the goal of improving both transactions and ticket with some of our most loyal customers. 
Now Joe is going to give you some details on the quarter, and how we're looking at our forward guidance."

Sales for the second quarter were $1.142 billion, an increase of 5.1% over the $1.087 billion we reported for the second quarter last year. Comparable store sales increased 3.8%.For Q2 operating profit dollars",1847,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $1.142 billion, an increase of 5.1% over the $1.087 billion we reported for the second quarter last year. Comparable store sales increased 3.8%.
For Q2 operating profit dollars and rate improved over last year. Q2 operating profit dollars were $63.2 million, an increase of approximately $16 million or 33% compared to last year. As expected, our operating profit rate increased by 110 basis points, as both gross margin and expenses improved as a percent of sales.
Looking at gross margin, our dollars grew 6.5%, which is a combination of our 5.1% sales increase plus expansion in the gross margin rate. Our rate for Q2 of 40.5% was 50 basis points above last year. The increase in rate was due to lower markdowns, particularly in Seasonal and Home, given the strength of those businesses. Also, helping the margin rate in the quarter was lower shrink costs and a slightly favorable mix impact, the sales of our higher-margin Seasonal and Home categories became a larger percent of the total sales.
These improvements were partially offset by higher freight costs, both import and domestic. In terms of imports, the increases in container rates have been well documented, and we along with almost every other retailer, will be fighting this battle for the next several quarters. Domestic freight costs are also up to last year, with fuel and rising carrier rates driving the increase.
Total SG&A dollars were $399.2 million or up 3% compared to last year. The second quarter SG&A rate of 34.9% was down 60 basis points to last year. We experienced leverage in most major expense areas. 
And as expected, we saw real dollar reductions in advertising, utilities and health benefits. You recall that each of these three areas have been specific initiatives designed to lower costs. 
Additionally, in advertising, we did have a planned reduction of one ad, which also helped to curtail costs. Partially offsetting these areas of leverage was higher bonus expense incurred during the quarter given our record performance, higher equity-related compensation expense and higher debit card fees from a spike in network rates. 
Net interest expense was $0.3 million for the quarter compared to $0.5 million last year. Our tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 was 38.3% compared to 39.3% last year. The lower tax rate was primarily due to its state income tax settlement.
In total for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we reported income from continuing operations of $38.8 million or $0.48 per diluted share compared to income from continuing operations of $28.6 million or $0.35 per diluted share a year ago. This result were in line with our previously communicated guidance of $0.44 to $0.49. 
Comparing our results to the low end of EPS guidance, $0.01 of the favorability came from a slightly higher gross margin rate, $0.02 came from lower SG&A expenses and the last $0.01 was due to opportunistic share repurchase activity in Q2.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory ended the second quarter of fiscal 2010 at $734 million compared to $668 million last year. Now it's really important to understand our inventory position heading into the third quarter, because the $66 million increase to last year, 10%, is not our usual position. However, approximately $55 million of the $66 million or over 80% can be summarized as timing of import receipts and timing of deals. 
In terms of imports, we made an intentional decision to move up delivery dates and bring in goods early to avoid potential disruption or risk of sales.  Disruption or risk of sales that could have resulted from the container shortages coming out of Asia. 
On the deals front, for those of you who have been in our stores recently, you should have noticed three large deals that we believe will be important sales drivers for Q3: the Furniture Roadshow event, our Stratolounger closeout and also a large branded underwear deal in time for back-to-school. Each of these deals are an important part of our comp expectations for Q3. 
The balance of the inventory increase of about $10 million relates to higher store count as we have 24 more stores than last year at the end of Q2. So as you can see, the inventory build was intentional and designed to position us for sales and earnings growth in Q3.
Cash flow, which we define as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities, decreased by $56 million compared to last year. This was largely attributable to our $66 million increase in year-over-year inventory levels, partially offset by our increase in Q2 earnings. 
We ended the quarter with $171 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to $98 million last year. This change of $73 million is attributable to our cash generated over the last year, partially offset by our year-to-date share repurchase activity.
We were active in the market, repurchasing our stock during Q2, as we invested $83.8 million to purchase 2.5 million shares at a weighted average price of $33.58 per share. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we continued to invest in our repurchase plan and through yesterday, August 23, we've invested $67.9 million in the third quarter of 2010 to repurchase 2.2 million shares at an average price of $31.19, bringing the total number of shares repurchased, excluding our ASR, to 4.7 million shares at an average price of $32.46.
Year-to-date, we've repurchased $301.8 million of company stock, $150 million under the ASR program and $151.8 million through opportunistic repurchases. Although the final settlement of the total number of shares repurchased under our ASR will not be known until the contract ends, had the ASR settled yesterday, August 23, the total amount of shares repurchased under the ASR would have been 4.3 million shares. 
Combining an assumed ASR of 4.3 million shares and our recent opportunistic repurchase efforts of 4.7 million shares, our total number of shares repurchased year-to-date would be 8.9 million or approximately 11% of our outstanding shares. We have $98.2 million remaining under our current authorization to repurchase shares opportunistically in the open market as of today. For the second quarter, capital expenditures totaled $31.1 million, and depreciation expense for the quarter was $18.8 million.
Moving on to guidance, we're forecasting a comp sales increase in the range of 2% to 4% for the third quarter. This is based on recent sales trends, incremental deals and one additional ad circular this year in August, aimed at generating more back-to-school business. We expect our Q3 gross margin rate will be slightly down to last year. You'll recall that last year's rate benefited by approximately 20 basis points from a one-time import duty contingency settlement. Additionally, we're anticipating that a lower markdown rate, favorable merchandise mix impact from higher anticipated sales in our better margin categories and lower shrink expense will be offset by higher domestic and import freight costs.
Our Q3 guidance anticipates expenses will be essentially flat as a percentage of sales. Flattish SG&A as a percent of sales is different from where we've been recently, but we know there are some challenges in Q3 that make this a unique quarter.  From a trend standpoint, what makes Q3 unique? Well, we see differences in three key areas: store openings, distribution and transportation and advertising. 
First, on new store openings. We have 55 stores to open from August through the first couple of weeks in November compared to the 33 stores we opened during the same time frame last year. This will result in approximately $2 million or 20 basis points of incremental pre-opening expense in the third quarter. 
Next, from a distribution and transportation standpoint. We began to anniversary our dedicated outbound fleet contract savings from last year and the closing of our California Furniture DC in Q3 a year ago. For these two reasons, and given the highly volatile market for trucking costs and peak season surcharges, we believe it's prudent to not expect leverage here in Q3. 
And lastly, as I mentioned earlier, we moved an ad circular out of Q2 into Q3. On average, we spent about $2 million for each ad, so $2 million out of Q2 and into Q3 will minimize any leverage opportunity in advertising during Q3. This is a timing difference only. We still expect total advertising dollars to be down for the year with leverage for the year of 20 basis points or so.
Clearly, there are some unique factors to Q3 SG&A that we believe are isolated to the quarter, because in a moment, you'll hear that we expect expense leverage to return in Q4. Based on these assumptions, Q3 EPS from continuing operations is estimated to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.29 per diluted share compared to $0.27 per diluted share a year ago.
Turning to the fourth quarter. We're forecasting a comp sales increase in the range of 2% to 4% against our best comp of the year last year at 5.1%. In a moment, Steve will touch on the some of the drivers for our Q4 comp. Additionally, we expect to benefit from one additional shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas. We expect our Q4 gross margin rate will be down to last year, driven by higher domestic and import freight costs and lower IMU in certain deals and nine weeks of Christmas strategies designed to drive excitement and foot traffic to our stores.
From an expense standpoint, we anticipate leverage in most major expense areas, including store payroll, distribution and transportation, health insurance, utilities and advertising. This favorability is assumed to be partially offset by higher debit card fees, resulting from rate hikes being passed on by network providers. Based on these assumptions, Q4 EPS from continuing operations is estimated to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.45 per diluted share compared to $1.31 per diluted share last year.
For the full year, we've raised our guidance now income from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 to be in the range of $2.82 to $2.90 per diluted share compared to our previous guidance of $2.75 to $2.85 per diluted share. We've raised the midpoint of our annual guidance to reflect our Q2 beat to the midpoint of guidance, slightly higher sales and operating profit modeled for the fall and the impact of the opportunistic share repurchase activity that I mentioned earlier. This range of EPS assumes an average annual diluted share count of approximately 80 million shares and does not contemplate any further opportunistic share repurchase activity past close of business yesterday. 
We now estimate net interest expense for the year of approximately $1 million. And given the later timing of capital expenditures, we now expect depreciation expense for the year to be approximately $80 million versus prior guidance of $80 million to $85 million.  For the full year of fiscal 2010, we expect a comparable store sales increase in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. 
Now I'll turn it over to Chuck for an update on Real Estate."

During the second quarter, we opened 18 new stores and closed 11 stores, leaving us with 1,374 stores and total selling square footage of 29.5 million at the end of the quarter. 11 of the new stores were traditional Big Lots, meaning in secondary or tertiary locations and primarily in strip centers. We also opened seven new A type locations. 
We're on track to our goal to open 80 new stores in 2010, 50 in traditional locations and 30 in A-type locations. Year-to-date, we've opened 25 new stores and we've executed lease agreements on the remaining 55 sites to open this year. We anticipate the majority of the remaining 55 stores will open in the October, November time frame or prior to Thanksgiving.
Year-to-date, we've closed 12 stores and still anticipate closing 40 stores in total for 2010. A number of the stores closing are older stores that are being relocated to higher traffic areas and better strip centers. Additionally, several of the stores were previously too small for a full-sized Furniture department and will be relocated to a larger space that can accommodate our full Furniture assortment. 
As Steve mentioned earlier, our Store Refresh program is moving along on schedule, and year-to-date, we've completed 76 of the planned 105 stores. The layout changes and capital improvements in the remaining stores are underway and are targeted to be completed by mid-September. Although still very early, overall we're experiencing sales lifts in the low single digit for completed Refresh Stores. 
Results vary widely on a store-by-store basis, and we're analyzing performance across several key attributes, including sales volume, store management, store age, store size and the extent of merchandise category repositioning within the store to determine the combination of attributes that drive the largest sales increases. Identifying the attributes most correlated with success and compiling learnings from our store management teams will aid us in planning any future Refresh programs. 
Now back to Steve for some closing remarks."

I'm confident our merchants have delivered much improved content and I see those efforts continuing on into the holiday season. 
To begin, Q3 we have certain larger sized noticeable deals that we believe will be key comp drivers, particularly in Furniture with the Roadshow event which was a highly successful and new event in Q1. You see a significant branded underwear deal that will carry through to holiday.  
In Electronics, video gaming, a much improved DVD assortment with more current titles, printers and of late some activity with GPS units in our stores. This business is well positioned for Q3. There is the next space of a book deal in stores today with better titles. A similar deal was good for our business in the first half of 2010. 
Aside from the deals I just mentioned, the content and quality of our import and day-in and day-out business continues to get better and better. In particular, Seasonal and Home have been strong, and we expect will continue to be good throughout holiday as the customers recognizing extreme value we are offering in these two key categories.
Looking ahead to Q4 and the nine weeks of Christmas, you will see a much more focused key item business than in years past. This is a strategy that was tested last year in our how high is high testing. You will see focused key item presentations on end caps, pallet positions and the four-way merchandisers in the front of the store. I'm confident that our stores will look better than they ever have in terms of presentation, cleanliness and from a customer service standpoint. 
We've upgraded our in-store standards, along with adding talent to the stores organization, and the pay-off from that investment should be now when volume, customers and customer service needs are at their peak. Additionally, our merchants have done an amazing job improving the inventory flow, and we have more goods coming in pre-ticketed and in PDQs than in any other time in our history, which should make this holiday easier for our stores to execute than in years past. 
And I'm confident we have a strong marketing message for holiday with incremental rewards activities, a new media campaign and plenty of ad support featuring the best of what Big Lots has to offer in the all-important nine weeks of Christmas. We will execute in the aspects of our business that we can control, that I am sure of. 
With that, I'll turn it back to TJ."

And I think we've done a relatively good job maintaining costs.

I mean we did what I think most people would do when they look at the cost structure in that business. We took the biggest ideas first and executed them, and executed them very well. Now we're on to -- we need a little improvement on the sales line and some of the initiatives will be of smaller dollar amounts."

Forgetting about sales for a minute, real dollars reducing year-over-year in advertising, utilities as you just mentioned and also health benefits, as we redesigned our health plan. And also completed some audit work there on eligible associates. So those three areas, we've committed to real dollars being down this year. Additionally, we continue to see opportunity to leverage store payroll and also distribution, transportation costs on an annual basis. So we know those dollars are going to increase, because as Steve has said a number of times, we're going to pay for performance, we're going to continue to grant merit increases, et cetera. So we know there's going to be some cost increase there. We just don't see it at the same rate of sales. So we do see leveraging opportunities there going forward. I think too, it's important to understand even the leverage that we gave today for the year and for the third and fourth quarter, those scenarios, we are incurring some pretty hefty increases in expenses, particularly on debit cards, and also in equity-related expenses, which as you know we file on our Q, so you can see those numbers. From our view anyway, the business performs pretty well, is continuing to perform pretty well from an expense standpoint. Here in 2010, now some four-plus years later, since we started some of these initiatives."

I'm not real clear in my mind, if that's a function of the fact that they're comfortable doing it or that we're actually attracting a different or an additional customer base that appreciates value that may have not understood us in the past. One of the things that we do, Joe, as you well know, is we spend an awful lot of time understanding not only our customer, but the customer who shops us frequently and infrequently too. And the place where we seem to have made the most headway in the last six months and the last time we actually talked to a customer was a customer that was a more infrequent shopper that we are finally starting to attract. And that's been an initiative over the last six or seven months that we hope to appreciate more going into the third and fourth quarter. We saw in the fourth quarter of last year, I think it's one of the reasons the comps were as good as they were. In the first quarter and in the second quarter, we're attracting a customer that didn't shop us as frequently as before. Clearly, our existing core customers is loyal as they've ever been, and their spend is slightly higher than it's ever been before too.

I understand your comment about it's not the time of the year, you may interpret that. But people shop for furniture 12 months out of the year. The volume level in the third quarter is not as high as the second quarter or the first quarter. But we learned two things have happened for the third quarter, why we're so encouraged and like our position. We had something that we put together in the first quarter that we called the Roadshow, it was exceptional value in Upholstery and in Dining and in RTA and a little bit of lighting and Mattresses that just was outstanding and helped drive the double-digit comp in the first quarter and into the second quarter. And so we put one together immediately for the third quarter and we're certainly encouraged about that performance. That's number one and that's a piece of the inventory there. Number two is, remember we're in the opportunistic business and Stratolounger and Stratford, which I can say now is a name that we control besides the fact that we brought the closeout, gave us an opportunity to have name brand closeouts that resonate with the customer that we were never able to have before. And we're going to absolutely take advantage of that when we can. And that wasn't pre-planned for the quarter. Many months ago, it's one of those typical opportunities where we get a telephone call and the banks say they're looking to reduce inventory. Who wants the inventory the worst, and who can take the inventory off of our hands? And at the same time we were able to negotiate the names, which is something that we think can add great value going into 2011, and further forward, because it's name that is national and the consumer understands. So both of those investments are where the real additional inventory is in the third quarter in Furniture, and we like the position where we're at an awful lot in both of those deals."

We still think we're underdeveloped on a sales per square foot and on a sales per average store basis, and we have a lot of upside.

We have seen deals that we've never seen before from GPS opportunities and computers, which we never saw really before. The underwear deal was a huge opportunity, and the quantity was enough to take us through the fourth quarter. The Furniture deals, even though it's a good business and to me, it's what I've said all along. People think that when business is bad, that the deals are better. It's not so. It's when business gets better, that the deals get better and better and better, because capital investments are made by companies and comfort levels of trying new and different things which produces closeout inventory us and that's why I think we're seeing bigger and better deals than what we've seen before.

As usual, we start getting questions on the next year about this time of year. We'll speak to specifics about 2011 in March of next year. But we have been pretty consistent to say that our internal goal, and this is a very strong internal goal of ours, is to continue to expand the operating margin each year and in general, that is expected to occur through SG&A leverage. We've also said that, do we believe a flat comp as a leverage point will continue forever? And we've said no, but that is an ongoing goal. So we'll continue to strive to find ways to save expenses and continue to keep that leverage point as low as possible. But we are going to continue with store growth plans. So next year, we said that we'd like to open a few more stores than this year. And to your point, Chuck, that does put some pressure on that leverage point. Gross margin, we've said that our fourth quarter this year is a perfect example. We'll never manage gross margin rate at the expense of gross margin dollars. So we always look at expanding gross margin dollars, which we are doing in the fourth quarter this year and not manage to the gross margin rate. But in general, our goal is to keep maintain our gross margin rate and expand our operating margin for SG&A leverage."

We continued to stay focused and execute across the organization during the second quarter, and I'm very proud of what we were able to accomplish as a team.

We continued to stay focused and execute across the organization during the second quarter, and I'm very proud of what we were able to accomplish as a team. We recorded our 15th consecutive quarter of record EPS from continuing operations, $0.48 per share, versus last year's record at that time of $0.35. 
We grew the top line by over 5%, with the comps of 3.8% supplemented by net store growth of 24 stores. Operating profit dollars grew 33% behind the strength of our comp, improvement in gross margin and significant SG&A leverage compared to a year ago. And we were able to repurchase significant amounts of stock in the last 60 days, which we believe is a very good use of shareholder cash and demonstrates the confidence we have in this business and the longer-term potential.
From a sales perspective, our comp of 3.8% for the quarter puts us near the top end of our competitive set and represents very good performance in an environment with a somewhat hesitant consumer. Across retail, it appeared that consumers were more cautious during the June, July time frame. However, it was very interesting to see that the discretionary categories and the higher-ticket goods seemed to be the most appealing areas of our store during Q2.
In terms of merchandising, Furniture, Home and Seasonal led the way, and Electronics continued to perform up against some very lofty numbers from a year ago. For the third consecutive quarter, Furniture comped up double digits with broad-based strength across all classifications, Upholstery, RTA, Case Goods and also the Mattresses, which, interestingly enough, was the strongest business. On average, Furniture represents the highest-ticket prices in the store, which suggests our customers willing to spend where they see extreme value and good quality product. 
Home comped up in the low double digits again in Q2 with improved quality, better price points and a very successful Port 7 home event. I'm very pleased with how our merchants in this area have responded to the challenge, and I have every reason to believe that this category has even more upside going forward.
Our Seasonal business, primarily Lawn & Garden and Summer, comped up high single digits against multiple years of comp store increases in this all-important category. Seasonal is one of the two top reasons customers come to Big Lots, and we delivered on our promise. Again, the highest price points performed the best, further reinforcing for us that with our customer, it's not about price, it's about value. And they're telling us by ringing the register that they see great value in our Seasonal assortments. 
And finally, our Electronics business continues to be good, comping up mid-single digits on top of a comp in the high 30s last year. The chain-wide rollout of our videogame software program that occurred last year provided incremental sales in Q2, and the availability of closeout deals like DVDs, digital cameras, printers and even a couple of opportunities with computers and GPS units were part of delivering a good comp in Q2.
Also during the quarter, we made meaningful progress on several other of our key strategic initiatives, Ready for Business and our Store Refresh program and our Rewards loyalty card. Our Ready for Business initiatives continue to get traction, and we estimate that over 80% of our stores are at a standard that we believe is acceptable at this point. We've created a process where executives and their teams are coordinating unannounced visits to stores across the country to hold ourselves accountable to these new standards. I'm pleased to say that we're seeing noticeable differences in store execution, customer service and merchandise presentation compared to this time a year ago. Again, progress, but this is a multiyear initiative we have taken on in our stores.
In terms of our existing store base, our Store Refresh program is moving along as scheduled. Chuck will update you on the details in a moment, but at a really high level, we're pleased with the execution and early results. Our store associates and our marketing team are focused on building the Rewards program for the future. The number of active Rewards members now exceeds 5 million customers and continues to build, and the program is still relatively new. Early on, we're seeing some level of positive comp sales impact in the top 100 or so stores in terms of penetration. However, the overall impact to the company comp in Q2 or on year-to-date is an immaterial number. The more tangible opportunity, we believe, comes later in the year and on into 2011 when we begin to market directly to customers based on their buying behavior. We're busy testing different ideas and promotions with the goal of improving both transactions and ticket with some of our most loyal customers. 
Now Joe's going to give you some details on the quarter and how we're looking at our forward guidance."
26949,111997073,75959,"Big Lots Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 24, 2010",2010-08-24,"Earnings Calls","Big Lots, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $1.142 billion, an increase of 5.1% over the $1.087 billion we reported for the second quarter last year. Comparable store sales increased 3.8%.For Q2, operating profit dollars",1842,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $1.142 billion, an increase of 5.1% over the $1.087 billion we reported for the second quarter last year. Comparable store sales increased 3.8%.
For Q2, operating profit dollars and rate improved over last year. Q2 operating profit dollars were $63.2 million, an increase of approximately $16 million, or 33%, compared to last year. As expected, our operating profit rate increased by 110 basis points as both gross margin and expenses improved as a percent of sales.
Looking at gross margin, our dollars grew 6.5%, which is a combination of our 5.1% sales increase plus expansion in the gross margin rate. Our rate for Q2 of 40.5% was 50 basis points above last year. The increase in rate was due to lower markdowns, particularly in Seasonal and Home, given the strength of those businesses. Also helping the margin rate in the quarter was lower shrink costs and a slightly favorable mix impact as sales of our higher-margin Seasonal and Home categories became a larger percent of the total sales.
These improvements were partially offset by higher freight costs, both import and domestic. In terms of imports, the increases in container rates have been well documented, and we, along with almost every other retailer, will be fighting this battle for the next several quarters. Domestic freight costs are also up to last year, with fuel and rising carrier rates driving the increase.
Total SG&A dollars were $399.2 million, or up 3% compared to last year. The second quarter SG&A rate of 34.9% was down 60 basis points to last year. We experienced leverage in most major expense areas, and as expected, we saw real dollar reductions in advertising, utilities and health benefits. You recall that each of these three areas have been specific initiatives designed to lower costs. 
Additionally, in advertising, we did have a planned reduction of one ad which also helped to curtail costs. Partially offsetting these areas of leverage was higher bonus expense incurred during the quarter given our record performance, higher equity-related compensation expense and higher debit card fees from a spike in network rates. 
Net interest expense was $0.3 million for the quarter compared to $0.5 million last year. Our tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 was 38.3% compared to 39.3% last year. The lower tax rate was primarily due to its state income tax settlement.
In total for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we reported income from continuing operations of $38.8 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $28.6 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, a year ago. This result was in line with our previously communicated guidance of $0.44 to $0.49. 
Comparing our results to the low end of EPS guidance, $0.01 of the favorability came from a slightly higher gross margin rate, $0.02 came from lower SG&A expenses and the last penny was due to opportunistic share repurchase activity in Q2.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory ended the second quarter of fiscal 2010 at $734 million compared to $668 million last year. Now it's real important to understand our inventory position heading into the third quarter, because the $66 million increase to last year, 10%, is not our usual position. However, approximately $55 million of the $66 million, or over 80%, can be summarized as timing of import receipts and timing of deals. 
In terms of imports, we made an intentional decision to move up delivery dates and bring in goods early to avoid potential disruption or risk of sales that could have resulted from the container shortages coming out of Asia. 
On the deals front, for those of you who've been in our stores recently, you should have noticed three large deals that we believe will be important sales drivers for Q3: the Furniture Roadshow event, a Stratolounger closeout and also a large branded underwear deal in time for Back to School. Each of these deals are an important part of our comp expectations for Q3. 
The balance of the inventory increase of about $10 million relates to higher store count as we have 24 more stores than last year at the end of Q2. So as you can see, the inventory build was intentional and designed to position us for sales and earnings growth in Q3.
Cash flow, which we define as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities, decreased by $56 million compared to last year. This was largely attributable to our $66 million increase in year-over-year inventory levels, partially offset by our increase in Q2 earnings. 
We ended the quarter with $171 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to $98 million last year. This change of $73 million is attributable to our cash generated over the last year, partially offset by our year-to-date share repurchase activity.
We were active in the market, repurchasing our stock during Q2, as we invested $83.8 million to purchase 2.5 million shares at a weighted average price of $33.58 per share. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we continued to invest in our repurchase plan, and through yesterday, August 23, we've invested $67.9 million in the third quarter of 2010 to repurchase 2.2 million shares at an average price of $31.19, bringing the total number of shares repurchased, excluding our ASR, to 4.7 million shares at an average price of $32.46.
Year-to-date, we've repurchased $301.8 million of company stock, $150 million under the ASR program and $151.8 million through opportunistic repurchases. Although the final settlement of the total number of shares repurchased under our ASR will not be known until the contract ends, had the ASR settled yesterday, August 23, the total amount of shares repurchased under the ASR would have been 4.3 million shares. 
Combining an assumed ASR of 4.3 million shares and our recent opportunistic repurchase efforts of 4.7 million shares, our total number of shares repurchased year-to-date would be 8.9 million, or approximately 11% of our outstanding shares. We have $98.2 million remaining under our current authorization to repurchase shares opportunistically in the open market as of today. For the second quarter, capital expenditures totaled $31.1 million, and depreciation expense for the quarter was $18.8 million.
Moving on to guidance. We're forecasting a comp sales increase in the range of 2% to 4% for the third quarter. This is based on recent sales trends, incremental deals and one additional ad circular this year in August, aimed at generating more back-to-school business. We expect our Q3 gross margin rate will be slightly down to last year. You'll recall that last year's rate benefited by approximately 20 basis points from a one-time import duty contingency settlement. Additionally, we're anticipating that a lower markdown rate, favorable merchandise mix, impact from higher anticipated sales in our better-margin categories and lower shrink expense will be offset by higher domestic and import freight costs.
Our Q3 guidance anticipates expenses will be essentially flat as a percentage of sales. Flattish SG&A as a percent of sales is different from where we've been recently, but we know there are some challenges in Q3 that make this a unique quarter. From a trend standpoint, what makes Q3 unique? Well, we see differences in three key areas: store openings, distribution and transportation and advertising. 
First, on new store openings. We have 55 stores to open from August through the first couple of weeks in November compared to the 33 stores we opened during the same time frame last year. This will result in approximately $2 million, or 20 basis points, of incremental pre-opening expense in the third quarter. 
Next, from a distribution and transportation standpoint. We began to anniversary our dedicated outbound fleet contract savings from last year and the closing of our California furniture DC in Q3 a year ago. For these two reasons, and given the highly volatile market for trucking costs and peak-season surcharges, we believe it's prudent to not expect leverage here in Q3. 
And lastly, as I mentioned earlier, we moved an ad circular out of Q2 into Q3. On average, we spent about $2 million for each ad, so $2 million out of Q2 and into Q3 will minimize any leverage opportunity in advertising during Q3. This is a timing difference only. We still expect total advertising dollars to be down for the year, with leverage for the year of 20 basis points or so.
Clearly, there are some unique factors to Q3 SG&A that we believe are isolated to the quarter, because in a moment, you'll hear that we expect expense leverage to return in Q4. Based on these assumptions, Q3 EPS from continuing operations is estimated to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.29 per diluted share compared to $0.27 per diluted share a year ago.
Turning to the fourth quarter. We're forecasting a comp sales increase in the range of 2% to 4% against our best comp of the year last year at 5.1%. In a moment, Steve will touch on the some of the drivers for our Q4 comp. Additionally, we expect to benefit from one additional shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas. We expect our Q4 gross margin rate will be down to last year, driven by higher domestic and import freight costs and lower IMU in certain deals and nine weeks of Christmas strategies designed to drive excitement and foot traffic to our stores.
From an expense standpoint, we anticipate leverage in most major expense areas, including store payroll, distribution and transportation, health insurance, utilities and advertising. This favorability is assumed to be partially offset by higher debit card fees resulting from rate hikes being passed on by network providers. Based on these assumptions, Q4 EPS from continuing operations is estimated to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.45 per diluted share compared to $1.31 per diluted share last year.
For the full year, we've raised our guidance and now expect income from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 to be in the range of $2.82 to $2.90 per diluted share compared to our previous guidance of $2.75 to $2.85 per diluted share. We've raised the midpoint of our annual guidance to reflect our Q2 beat to the midpoint of guidance, slightly higher sales and operating profit modeled for the fall and the impact of the opportunistic share repurchase activity that I mentioned earlier. This range of EPS assumes an average annual diluted share count of approximately 80 million shares and does not contemplate any further opportunistic share repurchase activity past close of business yesterday. 
We now estimate net interest expense for the year of approximately $1 million. And given the later timing of capital expenditures, we now expect depreciation expense for the year to be approximately $80 million versus prior guidance of $80 million to $85 million. For the full year fiscal 2010, we expect a comparable store sales increase in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. 
Now I'll turn it over to Chuck for an update on Real Estate."

During the second quarter, we opened 18 new stores and closed 11 stores, leaving us with 1,374 stores and total selling square footage of 29.5 million at the end of the quarter. 11 of the new stores were traditional Big Lots, meaning in secondary or tertiary locations and primarily in strip centers. We also opened seven new A-type [ph] locations. 
We're on track to our goal to open 80 new stores in 2010, 50 in traditional locations and 30 in A-type [ph] locations. Year-to-date, we've opened 25 new stores and we have executed lease agreements on the remaining 55 sites to open this year. We anticipate the majority of the remaining 55 stores will open in the October, November time frame or prior to Thanksgiving.
Year-to-date, we've closed 12 stores and still anticipate closing 40 stores in total for 2010. A number of the stores closing are older stores that are being relocated to higher-traffic areas in better strip centers. Additionally, several of these stores were previously too small for a full-sized Furniture department and will be relocated to a larger space that can accommodate our full Furniture assortment. 
As Steve mentioned earlier, our Store Refresh program is moving along on schedule, and year-to-date, we've completed 76 of the planned 105 stores. The layout changes and capital improvements in the remaining stores are underway and are targeted to be completed by mid-September. Although still very early, overall, we're experiencing sales lifts in the low single digits for completed Refresh Stores. 
Results vary widely on a store-by-store basis, and we're analyzing performance across several key attributes, including sales volume, store management, store age, store size and the extent of merchandise category repositioning within the store to determine the combination of attributes that drive the largest sales increases.

I'm confident our merchants have delivered much-improved content, and I see those efforts continuing on into the holiday season. 
To begin Q3, we have certain larger-sized noticeable deals that we believe will be key comp drivers, particularly in Furniture with the Roadshow event, which was a highly successful and new event in Q1. You see a significant branded-underwear deal that will carry through to holiday. 
In Electronics, videogaming, a much improved DVD assortment with more current titles, printers and of late, some activity with GPS units in our stores. This business is well positioned for Q3. There is the next phase of a book deal in stores today with better titles. A similar deal was good for our business in the first half of 2010. 
Aside from the deals I just mentioned, the content and quality of our import and day-in and day-out business continues to get better and better. In particular, Seasonal and Home have been strong and we expect will continue to be good throughout holiday as the customer is recognizing extreme value we are offering in these two key categories.
Looking ahead to Q4 and the nine weeks of Christmas, you will see a much more focused key item business than in years past. This is a strategy that was tested last year in our how high is high testing. You will see focused key item presentations on end caps, pallet positions and the four-way merchandisers in the front of the store. I'm confident that our stores will look better than they ever have in terms of presentation, cleanliness and from a customer service standpoint. 
We've upgraded our in-store standards, along with adding talent to the stores organization, and the payoff from that investment should be now, when volume, customers and customer service needs are at their peak. Additionally, our merchants have done an amazing job improving the inventory flow, and we have more goods coming in pre-ticketed and in PDQs than in any other time in our history, which should make this holiday easier for our stores to execute than in years past. 
And I'm confident we have a strong marketing message for holiday, with incremental rewards activities, a new media campaign and plenty of ad support featuring the best of what Big Lots has to offer in the all-important nine weeks of Christmas. We will execute in the aspects of our business that we can control. That I am sure of. 
With that, I'll turn it back to TJ."

We do believe we'll revert back to a leverage in the fourth quarter.

But the incremental store opening costs are going to account for about 20 basis points. But we certainly want to get those stores open. They're key to our holiday sales growth. And D&TS, distribution and transportation, the third quarter we're starting to anniversary the closing of our California DC last year in the third quarter, and also the dedicated fleet contracts were negotiated in the third quarter of last year. So we're starting to anniversary those benefits. And the volatile market for trucking costs and the prospect of peak-season surcharges, we just think it's prudent not to expect leverage in distribution, transportation. And in advertising, the shift out of one ad circular, each ad circular costs about $2 million, shifting one from second to third quarter.

And I think we've done a relatively good job maintaining costs. Commodity prices have been challenging overseas and domestically when it comes to steel and when it comes to cotton prices. So those things have been slightly challenged. The other issue from the Orient is just with the challenge from a wage rate standpoint. I mean, people are getting paid more and, of course, the fact that a number of factories over the last 18 months have closed overseas. So the strong have survived, but there's a cost of doing business with the strong that are surviving over there. But pre-planning that business gives us a unique opportunity to know what kind of values we need to be retailing merchandise, and what we continue to do and we've done year-over-year-over-year and will continue to do going forward is put more value in merchandise if prices have to go up for one reason or another. So we're doing the best job we possibly can, along with every other retailer, I think, around the world, fighting the fight and fighting the battles. As long as we continue to offer great value as compared to everybody else in the marketplace, we think we're doing a really good job, and we continue to do that."

So we do need some level of comp to continue to leverage that part of the business. That's been our guidance for the last couple of quarters.

We're starting to anniversary those at a time when, quite frankly, the outbound and inbound parts of our business are at their peak. As we're looking to the holiday season, we're receiving or shipping a lot of goods on the lowest sales base throughout the year. So it is a more challenging quarter. It always has been from a leverage standpoint in D&TS. We are forecasting that leverage to return, albeit not at the same rate in fourth quarter. So from a productivity standpoint, all distribution centers are challenged. The merchants continue to be challenged on how they're delivering goods and the carton value or the case pack value, there, to try to make our buildings more efficient. We have certain other smaller initiatives in place going into next year to try to save on costs.

And the place where we seem to have made the most headway in the last six months and the last time we actually talked to a customer was a customer that was a more infrequent shopper that we are finally starting to attract. And that's been an initiative over the last six or seven months that we hope to appreciate more going into the third and fourth quarter. We saw it in the fourth quarter of last year. I think it's one of the reasons the comps were as good as they were in the first quarter and in the second quarter. We're attracting a customer that didn't shop us as frequently as before. Clearly, our existing core customer is as loyal as they've ever been, and their spend is slightly higher than it's ever been before too. So I think both of those combinations have been very positive for us."

I understand your comment about it's not the time of the year, you may interpret that. But people shop for furniture 12 months out of the year. The volume level in the third quarter is not as high as the second quarter or the first quarter. But two things have happened for the third quarter, why we're so encouraged and like our position: We had something that we put together in the first quarter that we called the Roadshow. It was exceptional value in Upholstery and in Dining and in RTA and a little bit of lighting and Mattresses that just was outstanding and helped drive the double-digit comp in the first quarter and into the second quarter. And so we put one together immediately for the third quarter, and we're certainly encouraged about that performance. That's number one, and that's a piece of the inventory there. Number two is, remember we're in the opportunistic business, and Stratolounger and Stratford, which I can say now is a name that we control besides the fact that we bought the closeout, gave us an opportunity to have name-brand closeouts that resonate with the customer that we were never able to have before. And we're going to absolutely take advantage of that when we can. And that wasn't pre-planned for the quarter many months ago. It's one of those typical opportunities where we get a telephone call, and the banks say they're looking to reduce inventory. Who wants the inventory the worst, and who can take the inventory off of our hands? And at the same time we were able to negotiate the names, which is something that we think can add great value going into 2011 and further forward, because it's a name that is national and the consumer understands. So both of those investments are where the real additional inventory is in the third quarter in Furniture, and we like our position where we're at an awful lot in both of those deals."

We still think we're underdeveloped on a sales-per-square-foot and on a sales-per-average-store basis, and we have a lot of upside.

And clearly, I can't share them all with you, but you're going to see continued growth from us and just great deals in the DVD part of the business. That just has been terrific for us. We have seen deals that we've never seen before from GPS opportunities and computers, which we never saw, really, before. The underwear deal was a huge opportunity, and the quantity was enough to take us through the fourth quarter. The Furniture deals, even though it's a good business -- and, to me, it's what I've said all along. People think that when business is bad, that the deals are better. It's not so. It's when business gets better, that the deals get better and better and better, because capital investments are made by companies and comfort levels of trying new and different things which produces closeout inventory us. And that's why I think we're seeing bigger and better deals than what we've seen before. So if inventories are backing up for manufacturers, you're just telling me that our telephones are going to continue to ring very strong into the third and the fourth quarter.

So I hope I responded to that piece. As far as your comment about Walmart hurting the market or hurting us, I can only respond to that by saying 30% of our business is Consumables, and of the total company's business, only 10% is food. And if I'm not mistaken, Walmart just came off of their fifth quarter in a row of comp store decreases. So I'm not so sure that they're doing anything to hurt us or the rest of the market. I guess most of the grocery stores could respond to you a little bit better than I could in that part of the business. I would tell you that I don't believe that a competitor is hurting us. I, as always, look at how we are executing that part of the business, and I would admit, too, that we are responsible for whatever lack of comp store increase we're having in most of our businesses and not so much what other competitors are doing to us.

We continued to stay focused and execute across the organization during the second quarter, and I'm very proud of what we were able to accomplish as a team. We recorded our 15th consecutive quarter of record EPS fro",825,"Thanks, TJ, and good morning, everyone. We continued to stay focused and execute across the organization during the second quarter, and I'm very proud of what we were able to accomplish as a team. We recorded our 15th consecutive quarter of record EPS from continuing operations, $0.48 per share, versus last year's record at that time of $0.35. 
We grew the top line by over 5%, with the comps of 3.8% supplemented by net store growth of 24 stores. Operating profit dollars grew 33% behind the strength of our comp, improvement in gross margin and significant SG&A leverage compared to a year ago. And we were able to repurchase significant amounts of stock in the last 60 days, which we believe is a very good use of shareholder cash and demonstrates the confidence we have in this business and the longer-term potential.
From a sales perspective, our comp of 3.8% for the quarter puts us near the top end of our competitive set and represents very good performance in an environment with a somewhat hesitant consumer. Across retail, it appeared that consumers were more cautious during the June, July time frame. However, it was very interesting to see that the discretionary categories and the higher-ticket goods seemed to be the most appealing areas of our store during Q2.
In terms of merchandising, Furniture, Home and Seasonal led the way, and Electronics continued to perform up against some very lofty numbers from a year ago. For the third consecutive quarter, Furniture comped up double digits with broad-based strength across all classifications, Upholstery, RTA, Case Goods and also the Mattresses, which, interestingly enough, was the strongest business. On average, Furniture represents the highest-ticket prices in the store, which suggests our customers willing to spend where they see extreme value and good quality product. 
Home comped up in the low double digits again in Q2 with improved quality, better price points and a very successful Port 7 home event. I'm very pleased with how our merchants in this area have responded to the challenge, and I have every reason to believe that this category has even more upside going forward.
Our Seasonal business, primarily Lawn & Garden and Summer, comped up high single digits against multiple years of comp store increases in this all-important category. Seasonal is one of the two top reasons customers come to Big Lots, and we delivered on our promise. Again, the highest price points performed the best, further reinforcing for us that with our customer, it's not about price, it's about value. And they're telling us by ringing the register that they see great value in our Seasonal assortments. 
And finally, our Electronics business continues to be good, comping up mid-single digits on top of a comp in the high 30s last year. The chain-wide rollout of our videogame software program that occurred last year provided incremental sales in Q2, and the availability of closeout deals like DVDs, digital cameras, printers and even a couple of opportunities with computers and GPS units were part of delivering a good comp in Q2.
Also during the quarter, we made meaningful progress on several other of our key strategic initiatives, Ready for Business and our Store Refresh program and our Rewards loyalty card. Our Ready for Business initiatives continue to get traction, and we estimate that over 80% of our stores are at a standard that we believe is acceptable at this point. We've created a process where executives and their teams are coordinating unannounced visits to stores across the country to hold ourselves accountable to these new standards. I'm pleased to say that we're seeing noticeable differences in store execution, customer service and merchandise presentation compared to this time a year ago. Again, progress, but this is a multiyear initiative we have taken on in our stores.
In terms of our existing store base, our Store Refresh program is moving along as scheduled. Chuck will update you on the details in a moment, but at a really high level, we're pleased with the execution and early results. Our store associates and our marketing team are focused on building the Rewards program for the future. The number of active Rewards members now exceeds 5 million customers and continues to build, and the program is still relatively new. Early on, we're seeing some level of positive comp sales impact in the top 100 or so stores in terms of penetration. However, the overall impact to the company comp in Q2 or on year-to-date is an immaterial number. The more tangible opportunity, we believe, comes later in the year and on into 2011 when we begin to market directly to customers based on their buying behavior. We're busy testing different ideas and promotions with the goal of improving both transactions and ticket with some of our most loyal customers. 
Now Joe's going to give you some details on the quarter and how we're looking at our forward guidance."
26949,111997073,76027,"Big Lots Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 24, 2010",2010-08-24,"Earnings Calls","Big Lots, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $1.142 billion, an increase of 5.1% over the $1.087 billion we reported for the second quarter last year. Comparable store sales increased 3.8%.For Q2, operating profit dollars",1842,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $1.142 billion, an increase of 5.1% over the $1.087 billion we reported for the second quarter last year. Comparable store sales increased 3.8%.
For Q2, operating profit dollars and rate improved over last year. Q2 operating profit dollars were $63.2 million, an increase of approximately $16 million, or 33%, compared to last year. As expected, our operating profit rate increased by 110 basis points as both gross margin and expenses improved as a percent of sales.
Looking at gross margin, our dollars grew 6.5%, which is a combination of our 5.1% sales increase plus expansion in the gross margin rate. Our rate for Q2 of 40.5% was 50 basis points above last year. The increase in rate was due to lower markdowns, particularly in Seasonal and Home, given the strength of those businesses. Also helping the margin rate in the quarter was lower shrink costs and a slightly favorable mix impact as sales of our higher-margin Seasonal and Home categories became a larger percent of the total sales.
These improvements were partially offset by higher freight costs, both import and domestic. In terms of imports, the increases in container rates have been well documented, and we, along with almost every other retailer, will be fighting this battle for the next several quarters. Domestic freight costs are also up to last year, with fuel and rising carrier rates driving the increase.
Total SG&A dollars were $399.2 million, or up 3% compared to last year. The second quarter SG&A rate of 34.9% was down 60 basis points to last year. We experienced leverage in most major expense areas, and as expected, we saw real dollar reductions in advertising, utilities and health benefits. You recall that each of these three areas have been specific initiatives designed to lower costs. 
Additionally, in advertising, we did have a planned reduction of one ad which also helped to curtail costs. Partially offsetting these areas of leverage was higher bonus expense incurred during the quarter given our record performance, higher equity-related compensation expense and higher debit card fees from a spike in network rates. 
Net interest expense was $0.3 million for the quarter compared to $0.5 million last year. Our tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 was 38.3% compared to 39.3% last year. The lower tax rate was primarily due to its state income tax settlement.
In total for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we reported income from continuing operations of $38.8 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $28.6 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, a year ago. This result was in line with our previously communicated guidance of $0.44 to $0.49. 
Comparing our results to the low end of EPS guidance, $0.01 of the favorability came from a slightly higher gross margin rate, $0.02 came from lower SG&A expenses and the last penny was due to opportunistic share repurchase activity in Q2.
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory ended the second quarter of fiscal 2010 at $734 million compared to $668 million last year. Now it's real important to understand our inventory position heading into the third quarter, because the $66 million increase to last year, 10%, is not our usual position. However, approximately $55 million of the $66 million, or over 80%, can be summarized as timing of import receipts and timing of deals. 
In terms of imports, we made an intentional decision to move up delivery dates and bring in goods early to avoid potential disruption or risk of sales that could have resulted from the container shortages coming out of Asia. 
On the deals front, for those of you who've been in our stores recently, you should have noticed three large deals that we believe will be important sales drivers for Q3: the Furniture Roadshow event, a Stratolounger closeout and also a large branded underwear deal in time for Back to School. Each of these deals are an important part of our comp expectations for Q3. 
The balance of the inventory increase of about $10 million relates to higher store count as we have 24 more stores than last year at the end of Q2. So as you can see, the inventory build was intentional and designed to position us for sales and earnings growth in Q3.
Cash flow, which we define as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities, decreased by $56 million compared to last year. This was largely attributable to our $66 million increase in year-over-year inventory levels, partially offset by our increase in Q2 earnings. 
We ended the quarter with $171 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to $98 million last year. This change of $73 million is attributable to our cash generated over the last year, partially offset by our year-to-date share repurchase activity.
We were active in the market, repurchasing our stock during Q2, as we invested $83.8 million to purchase 2.5 million shares at a weighted average price of $33.58 per share. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we continued to invest in our repurchase plan, and through yesterday, August 23, we've invested $67.9 million in the third quarter of 2010 to repurchase 2.2 million shares at an average price of $31.19, bringing the total number of shares repurchased, excluding our ASR, to 4.7 million shares at an average price of $32.46.
Year-to-date, we've repurchased $301.8 million of company stock, $150 million under the ASR program and $151.8 million through opportunistic repurchases. Although the final settlement of the total number of shares repurchased under our ASR will not be known until the contract ends, had the ASR settled yesterday, August 23, the total amount of shares repurchased under the ASR would have been 4.3 million shares. 
Combining an assumed ASR of 4.3 million shares and our recent opportunistic repurchase efforts of 4.7 million shares, our total number of shares repurchased year-to-date would be 8.9 million, or approximately 11% of our outstanding shares. We have $98.2 million remaining under our current authorization to repurchase shares opportunistically in the open market as of today. For the second quarter, capital expenditures totaled $31.1 million, and depreciation expense for the quarter was $18.8 million.
Moving on to guidance. We're forecasting a comp sales increase in the range of 2% to 4% for the third quarter. This is based on recent sales trends, incremental deals and one additional ad circular this year in August, aimed at generating more back-to-school business. We expect our Q3 gross margin rate will be slightly down to last year. You'll recall that last year's rate benefited by approximately 20 basis points from a one-time import duty contingency settlement. Additionally, we're anticipating that a lower markdown rate, favorable merchandise mix, impact from higher anticipated sales in our better-margin categories and lower shrink expense will be offset by higher domestic and import freight costs.
Our Q3 guidance anticipates expenses will be essentially flat as a percentage of sales. Flattish SG&A as a percent of sales is different from where we've been recently, but we know there are some challenges in Q3 that make this a unique quarter. From a trend standpoint, what makes Q3 unique? Well, we see differences in three key areas: store openings, distribution and transportation and advertising. 
First, on new store openings. We have 55 stores to open from August through the first couple of weeks in November compared to the 33 stores we opened during the same time frame last year. This will result in approximately $2 million, or 20 basis points, of incremental pre-opening expense in the third quarter. 
Next, from a distribution and transportation standpoint. We began to anniversary our dedicated outbound fleet contract savings from last year and the closing of our California furniture DC in Q3 a year ago. For these two reasons, and given the highly volatile market for trucking costs and peak-season surcharges, we believe it's prudent to not expect leverage here in Q3. 
And lastly, as I mentioned earlier, we moved an ad circular out of Q2 into Q3. On average, we spent about $2 million for each ad, so $2 million out of Q2 and into Q3 will minimize any leverage opportunity in advertising during Q3. This is a timing difference only. We still expect total advertising dollars to be down for the year, with leverage for the year of 20 basis points or so.
Clearly, there are some unique factors to Q3 SG&A that we believe are isolated to the quarter, because in a moment, you'll hear that we expect expense leverage to return in Q4. Based on these assumptions, Q3 EPS from continuing operations is estimated to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.29 per diluted share compared to $0.27 per diluted share a year ago.
Turning to the fourth quarter. We're forecasting a comp sales increase in the range of 2% to 4% against our best comp of the year last year at 5.1%. In a moment, Steve will touch on the some of the drivers for our Q4 comp. Additionally, we expect to benefit from one additional shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas. We expect our Q4 gross margin rate will be down to last year, driven by higher domestic and import freight costs and lower IMU in certain deals and nine weeks of Christmas strategies designed to drive excitement and foot traffic to our stores.
From an expense standpoint, we anticipate leverage in most major expense areas, including store payroll, distribution and transportation, health insurance, utilities and advertising. This favorability is assumed to be partially offset by higher debit card fees resulting from rate hikes being passed on by network providers. Based on these assumptions, Q4 EPS from continuing operations is estimated to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.45 per diluted share compared to $1.31 per diluted share last year.
For the full year, we've raised our guidance and now expect income from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 to be in the range of $2.82 to $2.90 per diluted share compared to our previous guidance of $2.75 to $2.85 per diluted share. We've raised the midpoint of our annual guidance to reflect our Q2 beat to the midpoint of guidance, slightly higher sales and operating profit modeled for the fall and the impact of the opportunistic share repurchase activity that I mentioned earlier. This range of EPS assumes an average annual diluted share count of approximately 80 million shares and does not contemplate any further opportunistic share repurchase activity past close of business yesterday. 
We now estimate net interest expense for the year of approximately $1 million. And given the later timing of capital expenditures, we now expect depreciation expense for the year to be approximately $80 million versus prior guidance of $80 million to $85 million. For the full year fiscal 2010, we expect a comparable store sales increase in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. 
Now I'll turn it over to Chuck for an update on Real Estate."

During the second quarter, we opened 18 new stores and closed 11 stores, leaving us with 1,374 stores and total selling square footage of 29.5 million at the end of the quarter. 11 of the new stores were traditional Big Lots, meaning in secondary or tertiary locations and primarily in strip centers. We also opened seven new A-type [ph] locations. 
We're on track to our goal to open 80 new stores in 2010, 50 in traditional locations and 30 in A-type [ph] locations. Year-to-date, we've opened 25 new stores and we have executed lease agreements on the remaining 55 sites to open this year. We anticipate the majority of the remaining 55 stores will open in the October, November time frame or prior to Thanksgiving.
Year-to-date, we've closed 12 stores and still anticipate closing 40 stores in total for 2010. A number of the stores closing are older stores that are being relocated to higher-traffic areas in better strip centers. Additionally, several of these stores were previously too small for a full-sized Furniture department and will be relocated to a larger space that can accommodate our full Furniture assortment. 
As Steve mentioned earlier, our Store Refresh program is moving along on schedule, and year-to-date, we've completed 76 of the planned 105 stores. The layout changes and capital improvements in the remaining stores are underway and are targeted to be completed by mid-September. Although still very early, overall, we're experiencing sales lifts in the low single digits for completed Refresh Stores. 
Results vary widely on a store-by-store basis, and we're analyzing performance across several key attributes, including sales volume, store management, store age, store size and the extent of merchandise category repositioning within the store to determine the combination of attributes that drive the largest sales increases. Identifying the attributes most correlated with success and compiling learnings from our store management teams will aid us in planning any future Refresh programs. 
Now back to Steve for some closing remarks."

I'm confident our merchants have delivered much-improved content, and I see those efforts continuing on into the holiday season. 
To begin Q3, we have certain larger-sized noticeable deals that we believe will be key comp drivers, particularly in Furniture with the Roadshow event, which was a highly successful and new event in Q1. You see a significant branded-underwear deal that will carry through to holiday. 
In Electronics, videogaming, a much improved DVD assortment with more current titles, printers and of late, some activity with GPS units in our stores. This business is well positioned for Q3. There is the next phase of a book deal in stores today with better titles. A similar deal was good for our business in the first half of 2010. 
Aside from the deals I just mentioned, the content and quality of our import and day-in and day-out business continues to get better and better. In particular, Seasonal and Home have been strong and we expect will continue to be good throughout holiday as the customer is recognizing extreme value we are offering in these two key categories.
Looking ahead to Q4 and the nine weeks of Christmas, you will see a much more focused key item business than in years past. This is a strategy that was tested last year in our how high is high testing. You will see focused key item presentations on end caps, pallet positions and the four-way merchandisers in the front of the store. I'm confident that our stores will look better than they ever have in terms of presentation, cleanliness and from a customer service standpoint. 
We've upgraded our in-store standards, along with adding talent to the stores organization, and the payoff from that investment should be now, when volume, customers and customer service needs are at their peak. Additionally, our merchants have done an amazing job improving the inventory flow, and we have more goods coming in pre-ticketed and in PDQs than in any other time in our history, which should make this holiday easier for our stores to execute than in years past. 
And I'm confident we have a strong marketing message for holiday, with incremental rewards activities, a new media campaign and plenty of ad support featuring the best of what Big Lots has to offer in the all-important nine weeks of Christmas. We will execute in the aspects of our business that we can control. That I am sure of.

And I think we've done a relatively good job maintaining costs. Commodity prices have been challenging overseas and domestically when it comes to steel and when it comes to cotton prices. So those things have been slightly challenged. The other issue from the Orient is just with the challenge from a wage rate standpoint. I mean, people are getting paid more and, of course, the fact that a number of factories over the last 18 months have closed overseas. So the strong have survived, but there's a cost of doing business with the strong that are surviving over there. But pre-planning that business gives us a unique opportunity to know what kind of values we need to be retailing merchandise, and what we continue to do and we've done year-over-year-over-year and will continue to do going forward is put more value in merchandise if prices have to go up for one reason or another. So we're doing the best job we possibly can, along with every other retailer, I think, around the world, fighting the fight and fighting the battles. As long as we continue to offer great value as compared to everybody else in the marketplace, we think we're doing a really good job, and we continue to do that."

So we do need some level of comp to continue to leverage that part of the business. That's been our guidance for the last couple of quarters. I guess what's unique about third quarter, however, is we had those two large initiatives last year that generated significant leverage for the past 12 months. We're starting to anniversary those at a time when, quite frankly, the outbound and inbound parts of our business are at their peak. As we're looking to the holiday season, we're receiving or shipping a lot of goods on the lowest sales base throughout the year. So it is a more challenging quarter. It always has been from a leverage standpoint in D&TS. We are forecasting that leverage to return, albeit not at the same rate in fourth quarter. So from a productivity standpoint, all distribution centers are challenged. The merchants continue to be challenged on how they're delivering goods and the carton value or the case pack value, there, to try to make our buildings more efficient. We have certain other smaller initiatives in place going into next year to try to save on costs. But I guess going forward, we're looking at continuing to try to leverage that part of the business, albeit at not the same rate where we've been for the last two or three years. I mean we did what I think most people would do when they look at the cost structure in that business. We took the biggest ideas first and executed them and executed them very well.

One of the things that we do, Joe, as you well know, is we spend an awful lot of time understanding not only our customer, but the customer who shops us frequently and infrequently, too. And the place where we seem to have made the most headway in the last six months and the last time we actually talked to a customer was a customer that was a more infrequent shopper that we are finally starting to attract. And that's been an initiative over the last six or seven months that we hope to appreciate more going into the third and fourth quarter. We saw it in the fourth quarter of last year. I think it's one of the reasons the comps were as good as they were in the first quarter and in the second quarter. We're attracting a customer that didn't shop us as frequently as before.

I understand your comment about it's not the time of the year, you may interpret that. But people shop for furniture 12 months out of the year. The volume level in the third quarter is not as high as the second quarter or the first quarter. But two things have happened for the third quarter, why we're so encouraged and like our position: We had something that we put together in the first quarter that we called the Roadshow. It was exceptional value in Upholstery and in Dining and in RTA and a little bit of lighting and Mattresses that just was outstanding and helped drive the double-digit comp in the first quarter and into the second quarter. And so we put one together immediately for the third quarter, and we're certainly encouraged about that performance. That's number one, and that's a piece of the inventory there. Number two is, remember we're in the opportunistic business, and Stratolounger and Stratford, which I can say now is a name that we control besides the fact that we bought the closeout, gave us an opportunity to have name-brand closeouts that resonate with the customer that we were never able to have before. And we're going to absolutely take advantage of that when we can. And that wasn't pre-planned for the quarter many months ago. It's one of those typical opportunities where we get a telephone call, and the banks say they're looking to reduce inventory. Who wants the inventory the worst, and who can take the inventory off of our hands? And at the same time we were able to negotiate the names, which is something that we think can add great value going into 2011 and further forward, because it's a name that is national and the consumer understands. So both of those investments are where the real additional inventory is in the third quarter in Furniture, and we like our position where we're at an awful lot in both of those deals."

But our business isn't about, well, we were up 5% and we're worried about this year. Our business is all about how much higher can we take our business? We still think we're underdeveloped on a sales-per-square-foot and on a sales-per-average-store basis, and we have a lot of upside. And we learned a tremendous amount last Christmas, even on that 5-plus percent computer, that there is huge upside opportunity when we offer extreme value in the right merchandise. And we are absolutely laser-focused on those opportunities for this year, and we are committed to and plan with some real good history telling us that we can perform at that level."

And clearly, I can't share them all with you, but you're going to see continued growth from us and just great deals in the DVD part of the business. That just has been terrific for us. We have seen deals that we've never seen before from GPS opportunities and computers, which we never saw, really, before. The underwear deal was a huge opportunity, and the quantity was enough to take us through the fourth quarter. The Furniture deals, even though it's a good business -- and, to me, it's what I've said all along. People think that when business is bad, that the deals are better. It's not so. It's when business gets better, that the deals get better and better and better, because capital investments are made by companies and comfort levels of trying new and different things which produces closeout inventory us. And that's why I think we're seeing bigger and better deals than what we've seen before. So if inventories are backing up for manufacturers, you're just telling me that our telephones are going to continue to ring very strong into the third and the fourth quarter. We have ample Open-To-Buy set aside specifically for closeout deals that are part of our process that I can tell you we haven't had a phone call on yet, but we will in the next week or two weeks or three weeks or four weeks.

So I hope I responded to that piece. As far as your comment about Walmart hurting the market or hurting us, I can only respond to that by saying 30% of our business is Consumables, and of the total company's business, only 10% is food. And if I'm not mistaken, Walmart just came off of their fifth quarter in a row of comp store decreases. So I'm not so sure that they're doing anything to hurt us or the rest of the market. I guess most of the grocery stores could respond to you a little bit better than I could in that part of the business. I would tell you that I don't believe that a competitor is hurting us. I, as always, look at how we are executing that part of the business, and I would admit, too, that we are responsible for whatever lack of comp store increase we're having in most of our businesses and not so much what other competitors are doing to us.

During the third quarter, our customers continued to be selective in their purchases but were to spend money where they saw a tremendous values as evidenced by the continued strength in certain of our higher ticket, discretionary categories. From a merchandising perspective, Furniture, Seasonal and Home continue to lead the way. 
For the fourth consecutive quarter, Furniture comped up double digits with a very solid execution across all classifications. In particular Upholstery was excellent Stratolounger closeout deal and the Furniture Roadshow supplemented by solid performance in our day in and day out assortment. Closeout deals are a nice shot in the arm when we get them but the real strength is our everyday assortment at a value and quality level that makes us an industry leader in the low to moderate price point furniture business.
Our Seasonal category comped up high single digits for the second quarter in a row. Lawn & Garden particularly our tailgating assortment was strong early in the quarter and each of our fall Seasonal business has comped up mid-to high singles. And there I'm referring to Halloween, harvest and early Christmas selling. Again, this is one of the higher price points in the store, further reinforcing to us that we're presenting great value and we think this bodes well for the holiday season.
Home comped up in the low single digits, on top of improving trends from a year ago so comp-on-comp which I believe is an indicator of category gaining momentum. Results were driven by a combination of good deals and improving quality on consistency product. 
We experienced improving trends in some of our hardlines classifications like tools, appliances and home maintenance, offset by a slight decline in our Electronics business as we anniversaried the very successful launch of our videogame software program a year ago. Our most challenged business was Consumables, where we comped down in the low single digits. For those of you who have followed us for a while, you know that we don't make excuses for our performance. In this situation, I don't believe we executed as well as we're capable off and did not provide the customer with the offering that they've come to expect from us. The team is working very hard and swiftly to make changes to prepare us for the new year.
So we posted a positive comp for Q3 but we always want to do better. Having said that, clearly, there's some very encouraging performances in the third quarter. Now Joe's going to give you some details on the quarter and how we're looking at our forward guidance. Joe?"

Our rate for Q3 of 40.5% was 10 basis points above last year and better than our guidance. The rate increase was due to lower markdowns, lower shrink costs and a slightly favorable mix impact. In particular the favorable merchandise mix impact on lower markdowns were the direct result of better performance in certain of our discretionary categories particularly Seasonal and Home. These improvements were partially offset by higher freight costs, both domestic and import.
Total expense dollars were $401 million, an increase of $18 million or approximately 5% compared to last year. We believe there were certain unique factors in the third quarter and we do expect expense leverage to return in the fourth quarter. During Q3, we were able to flex down certain expenses to match our lower-than-expected sales base. However, we continue to make the necessary investments to open new stores, refresh existing stores and prepare for the all-important Q4 holiday selling season. 
In terms of new stores, we opened 55 new stores from August through November compared to 33 new stores during the same timeframe last year. And with the additional 22 new store openings came incremental costs, payroll, occupancy training supplies transportation and obviously as you can see from our P&L, higher depreciation on those new assets.
We also completed this year's class of refreshed stores during Q3 which was incremental activity to last year and there was some associated costs. And finally, maybe the most important element that makes Q3 unique from our focus was our focus on preparing for the holiday selling season. Heavy shipments of goods processed from our DC stores a more planful approach to setting foreceps and endcaps and hiring seasonal associates to help with the workload and all of those costs were incurred during Q3 in advance of the significant spike in sales we experienced in November and December.
Net interest expense was $0.7 million for the quarter compared to $0.5 million last year. Our tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was 32.3% compared to 35.2% last year with the lower tax rate principally due to higher tax credit in certain jurisdictions. In total for the third quarter fiscal 2010, we reported income from continuing operations of $17.7 million or $0.23 per diluted share compared to income from continuing operations of $22.1 million or $0.27 per diluted share a year ago. This result was below our previously communicated guidance of $0.25 to $0.29. At a high level the shortfall to the model was top line-driven, partially offset by better-than-expected gross margin performance and a slight positive impact in both the tax rate and share count. 
Our original guidance called for our Q3 SG&A rate to be flattish to last year, principally due to the investments in holiday preparation I indicated before. The expense deleverage not included in our original guidance was principally due to the shortfall in sales. Expenses flexed as expected on a lower sales base but not to the extent of the planned SG&A rate. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory ended the third quarter fiscal 2010 at $1.006 billion compared to $918 million last year. Of the $88 million increase to last year approximately $75 million was inventory to support higher store count and the intentional decision to move up delivery dates and bring import merchandise in early to avoid potential disruption that could have resulted from the container shortages coming out of Asia.
Inventory levels were up 6% per store when considering stores open at the end of the quarter and stores open in the month of November. We view this level of increase as timing related and would expect our inventory per store at the end of the fourth quarter to be flat to slightly up to last year. 
Cash flow which we define as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities decreased by $89 million for the quarter compared to last year. This is largely attributable to the timing of inventory flow that I mentioned earlier and the higher CapEx related to new stores.
We ended the quarter with $51 million of cash and cash equivalents and $129 million of borrowings under our credit facility compared to $46 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1 million of borrowings under our credit facility last year. The increased level of borrowings is directly related to the share repurchase activity and fiscal 2010 and increased inventory investment due to timing is a mentioned earlier partially offset by cash generated by operations over the past 12 months.
During Q3, we invested $108 million to opportunistically for just 3.5 million shares at a weighted average price of $31.15 per share. Year-to-date, we've repurchased opportunistically $192 million of stock or 6.0 million shares at a weighted average price of $32.16 per share. You may also recall that we executed $150 million accelerated share repurchase program or ASR in March of this year although the final settlement of the total number of shares repurchased under our ASR or will not be known until the contract ends. Had the ASR settled at the end of our fiscal third quarter the total amount of shares repurchased under the ASR would have been 4.4 million shares. Combining our opportunistic activity with an assumed ASR of 4.4 million shares, our total number of shares repurchased year-to-date would be 10.4 million or approximately 13% of our outstanding shares at the beginning of fiscal 2010.
We currently have $58 million remaining under our current authorization to repurchase shares opportunistically in the open market as of today. For the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $41 million compared to $23 million last year with the increase of $18 million primarily focused on new stores, refreshed stores and investments in energy management systems for our stores. Depreciation expense for the quarter was $19.6 million, an increase of $1.4 million, corresponding with the significant investments made in our business over the last 12 months.
Moving on to guidance, we are forecasting a total sales increase of 4% to 6% for the fourth quarter. This level of increase correlates to total sales of between $1.52 billion to $1.55 billion and is based on comparable store sales in the range of flat to up 2% supplemented by some very successful new store performance which Chuck will touch on in a moment. Additionally, we expect to benefit from one additional shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Consistent with our prior guidance we expect the fourth quarter gross margin rate will be below last year due to higher domestic and import freight costs as well as lower IMU in certain deals and holiday strategies designed to drive excitement and foot traffic to our stores. From an expense standpoint in Q4, we still anticipate leverage in most major expense areas including store payroll, distribution and transportation, utilities and advertising. This favorability is assumed to be partially offset by higher debit card fees resulting from rate hikes being passed on by network providers. Based on these assumptions, Q4 EPS from continuing operations is now estimated to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.42 per diluted share compared to $1.31 per diluted share last year. 
For the full year we now expect income from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.81 per diluted share which I believe is consistent with the most recent first call consensus estimates.
This compares to our previous guidance of $2.82 to $2.90 per diluted share with the variance directly attributable with softer sales in third quarter which are assumed to continue through the fourth quarter. This range of EPS assumes an average annual diluted share count of approximately 79 million shares and does not contemplate any utilization of the $58 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. We now estimate our inventory turnover at 3.7x, cash flow of approximately $200 million and net interest expense of approximately $2 million. For the full year of fiscal 2010 we expect the comparable store sales increase in the range of 3.0% to 3.5%. Now I'll turn it over to Chuck for an update on Real Estate."

During the third quarter we opened 28 new stores and closed 15 stores leaving us with 1389 stores and total selling square footage of 29.9 million at the end of the quarter. Subsequent to the end of Q3, we opened an additional 27 new stores in November bringing our total openings for the year to 80 stores.
Of the 80 store openings 33 were new A-type locations with the balance in more traditional centers. Year-to-date we've closed 26 stores and anticipate closing 16 more stores in Q4, bringing the total for the year to 42 closings in fiscal 2010. Of the closings, 23 are actually relocations and are either order stores being relocated to higher traffic areas in better strip centers or stores previously too small for a full-size furniture department being relegated to a larger space accommodate our full Furniture assortment. As Joe mentioned we've been very encouraged by the performance of our new stores opened this year. For new stores with enough history to trend we're forecasting annualized sales above our initial plans both in terms of dollars and productivity per foot. Clearly, we're finding and securing better sites to open but a large portion of this success is attributed to better store opening process beginning to end from merchandising to marketing to allocation of product through to store operations.
In terms of the A-type locations, we continue to be pleased with the performance to date which has validated our decision to move aggressively into better locations. Additionally, as we've said on a number of occasions we believe we're attracting a meaningful amount of new customers to our A-store format, customers who have may not shopped at Big Lots in the past or have a store in their normal shipping pattern. Our traditional locations are trending better than we anticipated even though this locations are not classified as an A-type locations it's fair to say that a large majority of these stores are in better locations than we may have opened the past. In particular both A-type and traditional stores opened in October and November have experienced a significant surge in business by combining grand opening activity along with the natural spike in holiday traffic we experienced in our stores during the fourth quarter. Now back to Steve for some closing remarks."

Our total sales forecast for the Q4 of 46% would represent some very good performance on top of our record quarter a year ago. There are several encouraging trends which could impact not only holiday but also highlight longer-term opportunities for the company. First and foremost in merchandising early customer response to our nine weeks of Christmas strategies has been pretty solid. In particular, the comp strengthen Furniture Seasonal and Home has continued on into Q4 as has the improvements in certain of our hardlines categories. Early selling in toys has been very competitive which was not unexpected but we have sufficient dry powder to be aggressive. The merchandising strategies focused on key items in our how high is high testing are validating to us that we are on the right path. In terms of stores from my visits I do believe our execution continues to improve our stores are becoming easier to shop, our merchants have delivered more floor-ready merchandise and PDQs to help in presentation and more attracting a more talented team to Big Lots. From a marketing perspective we're now approaching 7 million Rewards club members and our testing efforts are well underway to understand what generates the best and most productive response from our customers taken And I feel particularly good about our direction in Real Estate and the sales volume we're experiencing with some of our new locations It reinforces that new stores are likely to be the best investments we're making right now for the future of the company. Store growth is at the top of the priority list for allocation of capital. With that I'll turn it back to TJ."

I would tell you David and I kind of spoke to it on the last conference call and I would speak to it again today that although we're concerned always about businesses but are having what we consider to be challenges. The food part of our business is probably the thing that I'm most focused. It's the single most important business out of all the Consumables and about 10% of our total business on a normal year. The good news is that in the fourth quarter Consumables isn't as near a percent to total as it is in the first three quarters of the year. And we're cranking on cylinders on the businesses that we eed to be cranking on into the fourth quarter right now. But you're going to see a lot of newness and a lot of change in our food business coming in to the first quarter. I really can't speak to it yet and don't want too but there's going to be a lot of creativity, a lot of newness and a lot of excitement on the things that are selling in this particular point. If you go through the stores a lot of the specialty foods that we really keyed into for Christmas right now. They're doing well. It's the day in and day out business I think we're not the only ones struggling. I may be wrong about this. And again you guys know the business a lot better than I do, but the guys who have Consumables, particularly the discount has a very hight percent total. In the last five or six quarters have struggled a lot more than we have on the top line of our business and our consumables business particularly food is much as double what it is in our business. So I don't know that we're the only one struggling. The consumers are feeling a pinch. Prices are up across the board. One of the things that I wanted to make sure of is that our customer knows that even though prices are going up at other major discounters and grocery stores that there's still that price-value relationship and that distance between us and anybody else in that 10% to 50% savings rate and I think we're working very hard to understand that piece of it, too. So we're pretty consumed with all of Consumables. There's still a lot of great deals out there. There's still great deals in the stores There's still going to be great deals going into January and in the fourth quarter that we're working on all the time and the consumer products companies are coming to us constantly on. So I'm encouraged what I think we're capable of doing going into the first quarter."

And by the way we continue to do raise the ring and how high is high in this Christmas to just because we did it last Christmas We made some major investments in a couple of categories that I would tell you is doing quite well and I'll speak to maybe three areas. Number one is fireplace. And we really went after the fireplace business This is the third year in a row that we think we dominate the best value out there in that business and that is doing quite well is partially indicative of what happened in the third quarter in the Furniture business although Furniture crossed the space and all four of the businesses were good. That was very exciting. I will tell you that we had a good Thanksgiving weekend. We were really pleased with the Thanksgiving weekend and that had a lot to do with how high is high because we had an exceptional three-day Thanksgiving weekend a year ago and to be able to comp-on-comp 
on those two three big days of the year, maybe the three biggest days of the year although I have to go back and verify that so don't hold me to that. We are really pleased. Fireplace, I just dropped my In Home, particularly some of the better goods that we tested how high is high blankets, microfiber things like that in the $15 to $20 range that did quite well and there was a third issue I wanted to talk to you about and I just went blank. Seasonal, trim-a-tree particularly in the lighting business where we were testing how high is high. And I think I alluded in the last quarterly call that how we were really encouraged about what we thought we could do in Christmas trees and we kept challenging ourselves on how high is high there and the fact that there's a lot of changes in the lighting business that we are in to that business or a great customer. Everybody needs new LED lighting this year and those investments have proven so far to this point to be really good investments in how high is high testing."

As you mentioned eight opened in 2009 So we only have a few stores that had been opened for a full year. As we've gone through 2010 and opened 30 or so, what we've learned is an A store all A stores aren't going to be the same and some of them, it's an A store in the market where they reside. So we can't have an A store with company average volume but it would be higher average volume than the surrounding market. And we can also have A stores that you've seen our a store Polaris in Columbus where it performs significantly above company average. So it's an A based on location. Does it have co-tenants that can help draw traffic. Does it have population density. Those kind of attributes so we have been very pleased but beyond the A stores we've been pleased with what we call the traditional stores that we've opened in 2010. And what shocks team and the finance team is working together to the turbine is that really what are the key attributes that have been driving that success and how can we replicate it with that one necessarily start ramping up store growth and assumes that all new stores are going to produce like they did in 2010. But if you from a modeling standpoint when you see the spread between total sales and comp store sales, you can tell that there's been a little that the new stores are now becoming productive. That's encouraging to us. As sad we do want to be delivered as we open new stores we want to make sure we develop the talent in the field that can support the new store openings and also that economics of the new stores continued to be favorable for the profitability of the company."

A lot of the items that we are focused in the ad in the Thursday and Friday and Saturday specials did very well a lot of those items or items our test in the prior year and that's what what we feel very good about going into the balance of holiday and clearly that's a little bit different trend that what you're communicating with late September in October I think that's about as much as we can say on that this point.

I mentioned some of the things happening in Home like anything were related, Seasonal trees, lights. Actually Seasonal specialty food even though our Food business is not been a strong but that piece it has been very, very good. Toys are all over the board. It's eerily competitive Christmas I think that's the best thing to say about that right now and we are going to see how the consumer decides to vote at the registers it will be interesting to see how people talk about their toy business. Where the basic type business we are not in the electronic by business and the business is shifting what the author wants to the it's got a plug on it you can put it in your ear or something like that that's what they like although I can send Electronics part of the business the MP3 players continue to be really, really strong for us the camera business continues to be the digital camera business in particular and in the little jazz video camera the way around Thanksgiving they that we will come back again with one more time between now and Christmas time was just off the wall that was a good example of how high is high to the quantity that we sold of that item. So I think one of the things I am continuing to be more and more encouraged about his we really understand I've always said that we just never understood how much really self anyone thing and we continue to get better and better and closer to working to understand what the consumer really wants from us and quantities the recliner Thanksgiving day that we've been pretty traditional we've done that for this could have been our fifth year in a row, we sold probably more of those down almost as many as we had on hand to sell a year ago what this particular point. So we really are getting better in understanding what our customer wants in buying into it. Now it comes from an inventory perspective we stuck our necks out on inventory and I know that some of you didn't like the inventory levels bought our perspective is that we've got No. 1 be prepared for the customer and No. 2 have enough dry powder when these deals have of our business become available to us and one of the reasons Joe Gibney I do is for the answer of the fourth quarter that we plan on being on about inventory were slightly off we've got try powder on deals we know we waited for telephone calls we just don't know were and you're going to be there is we've always said we've got to buy the deals are right for the consumer and not play to the end of the quarter metric for one reason or another swiping that's why it was being a little bit cautious and rightly so to you expecting that's a pretty good recap."

August, we outperformed that in September and October we saw some softening which we've seen some improvement over those two months trend in November and we are encouraged by that pic what we are looking at very, very closely right now is how our shoppers shopping after the Black Friday weekend and week one of December and week two of December are very, very important there to see how strong will they come back in the stores after-tax pretty successful weekend across retail that just Big Lots.

During the third quarter, our customers continued to be selective in their purchases, but were willing to spend money where they saw tremendous values as evidenced by the continued strength in certain of our higher ticket discretionary categories.
From a merchandising perspective, furniture, seasonal and home continued to lead the way. For the fourth consecutive quarter furniture comped up double digits with a very solid execution across all classifications. In particular, upholstery was excellent, Stratolounger closeout deal and the furniture road show supplemented by solid performance and our day in and day out assortment.
Close out deals are a nice shot in the arm when we get them, but the real strength is our everyday assortment at a value and quality level that makes us an industry leader in the low to moderate price point furniture business.
Our seasonal category comped up high single digits for the second quarter in a row. Lawn and garden, particularly our tailgating assortment was strong early in the quarter, and each of our fall seasonal businesses comped up mid to high singles. There I’m referring to Halloween, Harvest and early Christmas selling. Again, this is one of the higher price points in the store, further reinforcing to us that we’re presenting great value and we think this bodes well for the holiday season.
Home comped up in the low single digits on top of improving trends from a year ago. So comp on comp, which I believe is an indicator, a category gaining momentum. Results were driven by a combination of good deals and improving quality on consistency product.
We experienced improving trends in some of our hardlines classifications like tools, appliances and home maintenance offset by a slight decline in our electronics business, as we anniversaried the very successful launch of our video game software program a year ago.
Our most challenged business was consumables, where we comped down in the low single digits.
For those of you who have followed us for a while, you know that we don't make excuses for our performance. In this situation, I don't believe we executed as well as we're capable of, and did not provide the customer with the offering that they've come to expect from us. The team is working very hard and swiftly to make changes to prepare us for the New Year. So we posted a positive comp for Q3, but we always want to do better. Having said that, clearly there are some very encouraging performances in the third quarter.
Now, Joe is going to give you some details on the quarter, and how we're looking at our forward guidance. Joe?

Sales for the third quarter were $1.056 billion, an increase of 2.0%, over the $1.035 billion we reported for the third quarter of last year. Comparable store sales increased 0.7%.For Q3 operating profit dollars",1468,"Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $1.056 billion, an increase of 2.0%, over the $1.035 billion we reported for the third quarter of last year. Comparable store sales increased 0.7%.
For Q3 operating profit dollars were $27 million, a decrease of approximately $8 million compared to last year's gross margin growth - gross margin dollar growth was offset by an increase in expense dollars. In terms of gross margin our dollars grew by approximately $10 million, or 2.4% due to a combination of total sales growth and expansion in the gross margin rate.
Our rate for Q3 up 40.5% was 10 basis points above last year and better than our guidance. The rate increase was due to lower markdowns, lower shrink costs and a slightly favorable mix impact. In particular, the favorable merchandise mix impact in lower markdowns were the direct result of better performance in certain of our discretionary categories, particularly seasonal and home. These improvements were partially offset by higher freight costs both domestic and import.
Total expense dollars were $401 million, an increase of $18 million or approximately 5% compared to last year. We believe there were certain unique factors in the third quarter and we do expect to expense leverage to return in the fourth quarter.
During Q3, we were able to flex down certain expenses to match our lower than expected sales base, however we continued to make the necessary investments to open new stores, refresh existing stores and prepare for the all important Q4 holiday selling season.
In terms of new stores, we opened 55 new stores from August through November compared to 33 new stores during the same timeframe last year, and with the additional 22 new store openings came incremental costs, payroll, occupancy, training, supplies, transportation and obviously as you can see from our P&L higher depreciation on those new assets. We also completed this year’s class of refresh stores during Q3 which was incremental activity to last year and there were some associated costs.
Finally, may be the most important element that makes Q3 unique from our focus was our focus on preparing for the holiday selling season. Heavy shipments of goods process from our DC Store stores are more planful approach to setting floor sets and encaps and hiring seasonal associates to help with the work load, and all of those costs were incurred during Q3 and advance of the significant spike in sales we experienced in November and December.
Net interest expense was $0.7 million for the quarter compared to $0.5 million last year. Our tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was 32.3% compared to 35.2% last year with the lower tax rate principally due to hiring tax credits in certain jurisdictions.
In total for the third quarter fiscal 2010, we recorded income from continuing operations of $17.7 million or $0.23 per diluted share compared to income from continuing operations of $22.1 million or $0.27 per diluted share a year ago. This result was below our previously communicated guidance of $0.25 to $0.29. At a high level, the shortfall to the model was top line driven, partially offset by better than expected gross margin performance and a slight positive impact in both the tax rate and share count.
Our original guidance called for a Q3 SG&A rate to be flattish to last year, principally due to the investments in holiday preparation I indicated before. The expense deleverage not included in our original guidance was principally due to the shortfall in sales. Expenses flexed as expected on a lower sales base, but not to the extent of the planned SG&A rate.
Turning to the balance sheet, inventory ended the third quarter of fiscal 2010 at $1.006 billion compared to $918 million last year. Of the $88 million increase to last year, approximately $75 million was inventory to support higher store count and the intentional decision to move up delivery dates and bring import merchandise in early to avoid potential disruption that could have resulted from the container shortages coming out of Asia.
Inventory levels were up 6% per store when considering stores opened at the end of the quarter and stores opened in the month of November. We view this level of increase as timing related and would expect our inventory per store at the end of the fourth quarter to be flat to slightly up to last year.
Cash flow, which we define as cash provided by operating activities, less cash used in investing activities decreased by $89 million for the quarter compared to last year. This is largely attributable to the timing of inventory flow that I mentioned earlier and the higher CapEx related to new stores.
We ended the quarter with $51 million of cash and cash equivalents and $129 million of borrowings under our credit facility compared to $46 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1 million of borrowings under our credit facility last year. The increased level of borrowings is directly related to the share repurchase activity in fiscal 2010 and the increased inventory investment due to timing, as I mentioned earlier, partially offset by cash generated by operations over the past 12 months.
During Q3, we invested $108 million to opportunistically purchase 3.5 million shares at a weighted average price of $31.15 per share. Year-to-date, we’ve repurchased opportunistically $192 million of our stock or 6.0 million shares at a weighted average price of $32.16 per share. You may also recall that we executed $150 million accelerated share repurchase program or ASR in March of this year.
Although the final settlement of the total number of shares repurchased under our ASR will not be known until the contract ends. Had the ASR settled at the end of our fiscal third quarter, the total amount of shares repurchased under the ASR would have been 4.4 million shares. Combining our opportunistic activity within the same day ASR of 4.4 million shares, our total number of shares repurchased year-to-date would be 10.4 million or approximately 13% of our outstanding shares at the beginning of fiscal 2010.
We currently have $58 million remaining under our current authorization to repurchase shares opportunistically in the open market as of today.
For the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $41 million compared to $23 million last year with the increase of $18 million primarily focused on new stores, refreshed stores and investments in energy management systems for our stores.
Depreciation expense for the quarter was $19.6 million, an increase of $1.4 million corresponding with the significant investments made in our business over the last 12 months.
Moving on to guidance, we are forecasting a total sales increase of 4% to 6% for the fourth quarter. This level of increase correlates to total sales between $1.52 billion to $1.55 billion, and is based on comparable store sales in a range of flat to up 2%, supplemented by some very successful new store performance which Chuck will touch on in a moment.
Additionally, we expect to benefit from one additional shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect the fourth quarter gross margin rate will be below last year, due to higher domestic and import freight costs as well as lower IMU in certain deals, and holiday strategies designed to drive excitement infill traffic to our stores.
From an expense standpoint in Q4, we still anticipate leverage in most major expense areas, including store payroll, distribution and transportation, utilities and advertising. This favorability is assumed to be partially offset by higher debit card fees, resulting from rate hikes being passed on by network providers.
Based on these assumptions, Q4 EPS from continuing operations is now estimated to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.42 per diluted share compared to $1.31 per diluted share last year.
For the full year, we now expect income from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.81 per diluted share, which I believe is consistent with the most recent first call consensus estimates.
This compares to our previous guidance of $2.82 to $2.90 per diluted share with the variance directly attributable with softer sales in third quarter which were assumed to continue through the fourth quarter. This range of EPS assumes an average annual diluted share count of approximately 79 million shares and does not contemplate any utilization of the $58 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. We now estimate our inventory turnover at 3.7 times, cash flow of approximately $200 million and net interest expense of approximately $2 million. For the full year fiscal 2010, we expect the comparable store sales increase in the range of 3.0% to 3.5%.
Now I will turn it over to Chuck for an update on real estate.

During the third quarter, we opened 28 new stores and closed 13 stores leaving us with 1,389 stores and total selling square footage of 29.9 million at the end of the quarter. Subsequent to the end of Q3, we opened an additional 27 new stores in November bringing our total number of new store openings for the year to 80 stores. Of the 80 store opening, 33 were new A type locations with the balance in more traditional centers. Year-to-date, we’ve closed 26 stores and anticipate closing six [ph] new more stores in Q4 bringing the total for the year to 42 closing in fiscal 2010.
Of the closings, 23 are actually relocations and are either older stores being relocated to higher traffic areas in better strip centers or stores previously too small for a full-size furniture department being relocated to a larger space to accommodate our full furniture assortment.
As Joe mentioned, we’ve been very encouraged by the performance of our new stores opened this year. For new stores with enough history to trend, we are forecasting annualized sales above our initial plans both in terms of dollars and productivity per foot.
Clearly, we are finding and securing better sites to open but a large portion of the success is attributed to a better store opening process beginning it to end; from merchandising to marketing to allocation of product through to store operations.
In terms of the A type locations, we continue to be pleased with performance to-date which has validated our decision to move aggressively in the better locations. Additionally, as we've said on a number of occasions, we believe we're attracting a meaningful amount of new customers to our A store format. Customers who have may not have shopped at Big Lots in the past or had a store in their normal shopping pattern.
Our traditional locations are also trending better than we anticipated. Even though these locations are not classified as an A type location, it's fair to say that a large majority of these stores are in better locations than we may have opened in the past. In particular, both A type and traditional stores opened in October and November have experienced a significant surge in business by combining grand opening activity along with the natural spike in holiday traffic we experienced in our stores during the fourth quarter.

Our total sales forecast for the Q4 of 4% to 6% would represent some very good performance on top of our record quarter a year ago. There are several encouraging trends, which could impact not only holiday but also highlight longer term opportunities for the company.
First and foremost, in merchandising early customer response to our nine weeks of Christmas strategies has been pretty solid, in particular the comp, strength and furniture, seasonal and home has continued on into Q4 as has the improvements in certain of our hardlines categories. Early selling in toys has been very competitive, which was not unexpected, but we have sufficient dry power to be aggressive.
The merchandising strategy is focused on key items in our how high is high testing are validating to us that we're on the right path. In terms of stores from my visits, I do believe our execution continues to improve. Our stores are becoming easier to shop. Our merchants have delivered more floor-ready merchandise in PDQs to help in presentation and we’re attracting a more talented team to Big Lots.
From a marketing perspective, we’re now approaching seven million rewards club members and our testing efforts are well underway to understand what generates the best and most productive response from our customers. I feel particularly good about our direction in real estate and the sales volume we’re experiencing in some of our new locations. It reinforces that new stores are likely the best investment we can be making right now for the future of the company. Store growth is at the top of the priority list for allocation of capital.
With that, I’ll turn it back to T.J.

We thought some of those name brand items and you’re speaking specifically on the Paper Jamz and Zhu Zhu Pets, which, by the way, we are complete sellout on, that our intention is not to be undercut. We've always been a leader not only in toys and but in every product category that we're in. We take in and reacted to all the pricing that we felt that we needed to adjust. 
I think if you're in our stores today, you're going to find we're more aggressive than we potentially were over that weekend on a couple of those key items and on even more items. I think you'll find one of the interesting things about our marketing businesses is that we can work very close to the West and in fact we went through the Thanksgiving weekend and we were still able to react to the last week of December's piece the week before Christmas and make any kind of price adjustments that we needed to make. So along with the fact that you're going to see us extremely aggressive in print in the next four weeks, you're also going to see us extremely aggressive online. 
If you are awards member, we have done some really unique things. All along the way we planned on testing and finding out some of the things that really will excite our rewards members, but we can react on a day-to-day basis by putting items up online and changing prices. You're going to see that throughout the balance of the Christmas season.

I would tell you, David, and I kind of spoke to it on the last conference call and I would speak to it again today that although we're concerned always about businesses that are having what we consider to be challenges, the food part of our business is probably the thing that I'm most focused on, it's single most important business out of all of consumables and about 10% of our total business on a normal year. 
The good news is this in the fourth quarter consumables isn't near as a percent to total as it is in the first three quarters of the year and we're cranking on cylinders on the businesses that we need to be cranking on into the fourth quarter right now. But you are going to see a lot of newness and a lot of change in our food business coming into the first quarter. I really can’t speak to it yet and don’t want to, but there is going to be a lot of creativity, a lot of newness and a lot of excitement on the things that are selling at this particular point. If you go through the stores, a lot of the specialty foods that we really keyed into for Christmas right now, they are doing well. It's the day-in and day-out business. 
I think we're not the only one struggling. I may be wrong about this. Again, you guys know the business a lot better than I do, but the guys who have consumables, particularly the discounters is a very high percent total, and the last five or six quarters have struggled a lot more than we have on the top line of our business and they are consumables business and particularly food is much as double as what it is in our business. So, I don’t know that we are the only one struggling. The consumer is feeling the pinch. Prices were up across the board. 
One of the things that I want to make sure of is this that our customer knows that even though prices are going up at major discounters and grocery stores that there is still that price value relationship and that distance between us and everybody else in that 10% to 50% savings range, and I think we are working very hard to understand that piece of it too. So, we are pretty consumed with all of consumables. There is still lot of great deals out there. There is still great deals in the stores. There is still going to be great deals going into January and into the first quarter that we are working on all the time and the consumer products companies are coming to us constantly on. So, I’m encouraged what I think we are going to be capable of doing going into the first quarter.

They've actually been calling out consumables as being their top performing category the last few years. I mean, there does seem to be demand for that business. Do you think there is a risk that a retail format that focuses on the close-outs and treasure hunts maybe it doesn't work for that day in, day out customer thinking about the mom and the band with two kids, and she has 10 or 15 minutes to shop.

Number one, from a location standpoint, I have said and I would say again that I believe although the Dollar Stores are doing a great job of executing. The Dollar Stores are kind of like the convenient store of choice today. Dan, I think probably the major big box retailers would say the same thing to you. Although, I think they are doing a great job, I think they are experiencing the fact that the challenged economic consumer has only x amount of money to spend and it's easier to go into a local Dollar Store and pick up that $8, $9, $10, $11, $12 worth of what I need today and can only afford today groceries versus how we execute a strategy or some of the other traditional retailers or grocery stores do. 
I don't think that it's not a strategy that's not important to us that we'll continue to. One of the things that's different between our customers and the customer that you alluded to is that our average customer spends as much as 35 minutes in our store. So they don't come to us for a quick pick up and a quick shop that could be challenging to us today. But in the long run, we'll still do a lot of consumables business and we'll still be a great place to come to for the best values you can possibly find.

I think we run a great consumables business. I think we have been focused and executed slightly the way that we have in the past, in the way of showing great deals to our customer, and we’ll get back on course. But I don’t think we’re over spaced in consumables right now and I will tell you that there are other businesses that I think that we’ve challenged ourselves that we might be over spaced and we have already reduced some of the highly competitive plastic space in the last 12 months and reallocated it to pets, and are getting a great return on investment. 
Without speaking before we have a really good plan, I think you’re going to see a shift in some of our businesses going into next fall. Into some of the businesses we continue to grow at a faster pace and are very successful in i.e. seasonal. We absolutely know that we need to expand our seasonal space in the third and the fourth quarter of next year. I think we do a pretty good job in the first and second quarter in lawn and garden and trim. That’s clearly going to have to come out of some businesses that are underperforming right now. But I’d rather not speak to that until we have a really solid plan in place, maybe in another quarter or two.

I will tell you that we had a good Thanksgiving weekend. We were really pleased with the Thanksgiving weekend and that had a lot to do with how high is high because we had an exceptional three days Thanksgiving weekend a year ago and to be able to comp on comp on those two, three big days of the year maybe the three biggest days of the year, although I'd have to go back and verify that, so don't hold me to that.

We've indicated that we've been certainly been pleased and encouraged by the performance of the A stores, as you mentioned eight opened in 2009, so we only have a few stores that have been open for a full year. As we've gone through 2010 and opened 30 or so, what we've learned is an A store - all A stores aren't going to be the same and some of them - it's an A store in the market where they reside. So, we can have an A store with company average volume, but it would be higher average volume than the surrounding market, and we can also have A stores that you've seen them. Our A stores here at the Polaris in Columbus where it performs significantly above company average. 
So, it's an A based on location. Does it have cotenants that can help draw traffic? Does it have population density? Those kind of attributes. So, we have been very pleased. But beyond the A stores we've been pleased with what we call the traditional stores that we've opened in 2010 and what Chuck's team and the finance team are working together to determine is really what are the key attributes that have been driving that success and how can we replicate it. We don't want to necessarily start ramping up new store growth and assume that all new stores are going to produce like they did in 2010. 
But if you - from a modeling standpoint when you see the spread between total sales and comp store sales, you can tell that there has been a little that the new stores and our comp stores are becoming more productive, and that’s encouraging to us. But as Chuck said, we still want to be deliberate as we open new stores. We want to make sure we develop the talent in the field that can support the new store openings, and also that the economics in the new stores continue to be favorable for the profitability of the company.

I mean, it does sound like there has been some inflection or pickup in the business since the end of the second quarter. So, I was just wondering if you could speak to that. Then the second question is just on the holiday, I mean in addition to let’s say, it sounds like Zhu Zhu Pets are doing pretty well again this year. I’m just wondering if you can talk about some of the other hot items may be as we get a little bit closer to Christmas either in Toys or elsewhere may be Electronics or Home any call outs there just on an item basis?

Specifically, on the Thanksgiving weekend I know there has been a lot written about those few days and certainly the month of November, the sales numbers were out yesterday and were probably pretty encouraging for most. I think what we're trying to communicate is when traffic really picked up and was at its peak rate in the month around Thanksgiving, clearly we had a great value proposition to pull people in and we did very well on that week on top of some pretty impressive numbers a year ago. So a lot of the items that were focused in the ad in the Thursday and Friday and Saturday specials did very well. A lot of those items were items that were tested in the prior year. 
So that's what we feel very good about going into the balance of holiday, and clearly, that's a little bit different trend than what we were communicating with late September and October. I think that's about as much as we can say on that at this point. So really to be able to look at fourth quarter and see a little bit of improvement compared to September and October and good response to categories or items that we need good response for where we've really made an investment and inventory was encouraging to us. But in terms of the holiday and hot items, I'll let Steve speak to it those best about.

I mentioned some of the things happening in the home, like anything warmth [ph] related, seasonal trees lights, actually seasonal specialty food even though our food business has not been as strong, but that piece has been very, very good. Toys are all over the board. It’s a really competitive Christmas. I think that's the best thing to say about that right now. We're going to see how the consumer decides to vote at the registers and there will be very interesting to see how a lot of people talk about their toy business. We're in the basic toy business. We're not in the electronic toy business. 
The business is shifting what a youngster wants today, if it’s got a plug on it, you can put it in your ear or something like that, that’s what they like. Although I will say, in the electronics part of the business, the MP3 players continue to be really, really strong for us. The camera business continues to be - the digital camera business in particular and then the little Jazz video camera that we ran on Thanksgiving day, that we will come back again with one more time, between now and Christmas time was just off the wall. That was a good example of how high is high, too, the number - the quantity that we sold of that item. 
I think one of the things I’m continuing to be more and more encouraged about is, is we really understand, and I’ve always said that we just never understood how much we could really sell off any one thing. We continue to get better and better and closer to working to understand what the consumer really wants from us in quantities. The recliner Thanksgiving Day that we’ve been pretty traditional, we’ve done that for - this could have been our fifth year in a row, we sold probably more of those than almost as many as we had on hand to sell a year ago at this particular point. So we’re really getting better in understanding what our customer wants and buying into it. 
That comes at across from an inventory perspective, we stuck our necks out on inventory and I know that some of you didn’t like the inventory levels, but our perspective is, is we’ve got, number one, be prepared for the customer and number two, have enough dry powder when these deals or half of our business become available to us. One of the reasons, Joe gave guidance for the end of the fourth quarter that we plan on being on about inventory or slightly up, this is that we’ve got dry powder in there for deals that we know we’re going to get or we’re waiting for the telephone calls to happen. We just don’t know when they’re going to be there. I’ve always said we’ve got to buy the deals that are right for the consumer and not play to the end of a quarter metric for one reason or another. So I think that's why he was being a little bit cautious and rightly so to you. So, I think that's a pretty good recap.

But on the new store growth looking out, at the beginning of the year, we gave a three-year view that talked about square footage growth of 3% to 4% in each of the next three years. We talked about 80 new stores this year, which we'll clearly deliver in a number more likely 90 stores or more in the next couple of years after that. That's about as much as we've given at this point. 
Obviously, we'll fill in the blanks come March. Along with that though you should expect that the closing number might go up a little bit also as we get more and more opportunities to relocate into some of these more productive locations. But, overall, that the net number of new stores opened next year and the year after ought to grow from where we are today. Looking at some of the more recent store openings, it is still fairly recent as we said, but I guess what we're encouraged by John is when we normally open a new store we're looking at that initial lease term of five to seven years, and saying are we delivering a good return or are we delivering return in closed store or better than our weighted average cost of capital which we estimate loosely to be around 12%. 
All we can really comment on at this point is based on sales, and it's early, year one sales were the most important - one of the most important numbers on that pro forma and we are ahead of pace. I think, that’s about as much as we are comfortable saying right now. We're going to watch them through the holiday season, and we ought to be a lot more smarter the next time we speak.

We had a good week four in November. We had a good Thanksgiving week but are flat to 2% guidance, what that represents is fairly consistent performance through week four of December, and then you have an extra shopping day. So, take out week four November and then kind of run through pretty consistent weeks one, two and three in November and then the first part of December. When we talked about - we've seen some improvement in November that's really off September and October. It's not necessarily - we're not projecting significant improvement off the third quarter trend, it's just that we saw a slowdown coming out of August. 
So, when you look at the 0.7 for the third quarter, that's a three month comp obviously; August, we outperform that and then September and October, we saw some softening which we've seen some improvement over those two months trends in November and we're encouraged by that. What we're looking at very, very closely right now is how are shoppers shopping after the Black Friday weekend and week one of December and week two of December are very, very important there to see how strong will they come back in the stores after that pretty successful weekend for across retail wouldn't just Big Lots. So, we believe our comp guidance is the best we know today. Then, of course, we roll into January where we had a very strong January of 2010 and we're comping on top of that. Now, our assortment going in there seems very compelling, we're very encouraged by it, but there is a lot of sales ahead of us hence our guidance.

We don’t play in it like the big boys play in it. I don’t know that that’s been a vibrant category for anybody right now, prices are extremely competitive and they’ll buy when there is a great deal, but we don’t make a lot of money doing it. Actually I think there is piece in this weekend feast and pre-print that you’ll see that we think is pretty sharp, and you’ll probably see something else between now and the end of the holiday. But it's not a category that we run after unless it’s really offered to us. So, I would tell you that’s a category that scares the heck out of me, we’re not specialist in it. 
I’ve said in many occasions, if you stick a plug into the wall it's very low margin, no matter what it is and it always makes this shutter a little bit. Seasonal is doing well; we continue to see that driving our business in the fourth quarter. Home is doing well; we continue to see that driving our business in the fourth quarter. Toys, what I mentioned, was that it was competitive. We’ll see how challenging it is between now and the 25th of December. Again, we don’t play in the electronics part of the toy business, we just play in the pure toy business, and we need to understand that. 
That’s been a challenge, not only this year but it has been for the last three or four years, and it’s probably somewhat of a down trending business to be quite honest with you. We need to understand how we want to position that toy business going forward. Well, consumables is consumables, I can beat it up the way you want to beat it up. I wish it was better for us than it's been. But it's a smaller piece as a percent of total of our business in the fourth quarter, and it's the lowest margin piece of our business. 
Overall, it a division in the company. I'll tell what's been slightly encouraging and I think I slightly mentioned it, the automotive business, our hard goods part of the business. When it comes to hardware, the toolset business has been terrific and we did a real strategic program for Christmas there on how high is high at price points and they're doing quite well. The electrical part of the business, the maintenance part of the business, the heater part of the business, particularly where it's been cool. If it doesn't snow like it did on the East Coast and they can get to the stores like yesterday. But that's part of the game. There's going to be weather, so we can't get too worried about that. You're not getting a weather report from us. Those have been good and encouraging. So I like all of those parts of the business.

So to be quite honest with you, it will take us a little while to find our way down the road there. But I would say product offering more than anything else. 
The fact that I think the consumer was challenged, I really do. I mean, everybody is playing off of us. I don't think we're the only ones whose consumable business is tough. I know that Dollar Stores are doing well. I think it's a convenience aspect, but that's my point of view, everybody else can say whatever they want to say. But the comps at the largest retailer in the world in the last six quarters have been down and 55% to 65% of their business is consumable.

During the third quarter, our customers continued to be selective in their purchases, but were willing to spend money where they saw tremendous values as evidenced by the continued strength in certain of our higher ticket, discretionary categories. From a merchandising perspective, Furniture, Seasonal and Home continued to lead the way. 
For the fourth consecutive quarter, Furniture comped up double digits with a very solid execution across all classifications. In particular, Upholstery was excellent, Stratolounger closeout deal, and the Furniture Roadshow supplemented by solid performance in our day-in and day-out assortment. Closeout deals are a nice shot in the arm when we get them, but the real strength is our everyday assortment at a value and quality level that makes us an industry leader in the low to moderate price point Furniture business.
Our Seasonal category comped up high single digits for the second quarter in a row. Lawn & Garden, particularly our tailgating assortment, was strong early in the quarter and each of our fall Seasonal business has comped up mid to high singles. And there, I'm referring to Halloween, harvest and early Christmas selling. Again, this is one of the higher price points in the store, further reinforcing to us that we're presenting great value, and we think this bodes well for the holiday season.
Home comped up in the low single digits on top of improving trends from a year ago. So comp-on-comp which I believe is an indicator, a category gaining momentum. Results were driven by a combination of good deals and improving quality on consistency product. We experienced improving trends in some of our Hardlines classifications, like tools, appliances and home maintenance, offset by a slight decline in our Electronics business, as we anniversaried the very successful launch of our video game software program a year ago. 
Our most challenged business was Consumables, where we comped down in the low single digits. For those of you who have followed us for a while, you know that we don't make excuses for our performance. In this situation, I don't believe we executed as well as we're capable off and did not provide the customer with the offering that they've come to expect from us. The team is working very hard and swiftly to make changes to prepare us for the new year. So we posted a positive comp for Q3, but we always want to do better. Having said that, clearly, there's some very encouraging performances in the third quarter. 
Now Joe is going to give you some details on the quarter and how we're looking at our forward guidance. Joe?"

Sales for the third quarter were $1.056 billion, an increase of 2.0% over the $1.035 billion we reported for the third quarter of last year. Comparable store sales increased 0.7%.For Q3, operating profit",1463,"Well, thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $1.056 billion, an increase of 2.0% over the $1.035 billion we reported for the third quarter of last year. Comparable store sales increased 0.7%.
For Q3, operating profit dollars were $27 million, a decrease of approximately $8 million compared to last year's gross margin growth. Gross margin dollar growth was offset by an increase in expense dollars. In terms of gross margin, our dollars grew by approximately $10 million or 2.4% due to a combination of total sales growth and expansion in the gross margin rate. Our rate for Q3 of 40.5% was 10 basis points above last year and better than our guidance. The rate increase was due to lower markdowns, lower shrink costs and a slightly favorable mix impact. In particular, the favorable merchandise mix impact on lower markdowns were the direct result of better performance in certain of our discretionary categories, particularly Seasonal and Home. These improvements were partially offset by higher freight costs, both domestic and import.
Total expense dollars were $401 million, an increase of $18 million or approximately 5% compared to last year. We believe there were certain unique factors in the third quarter and we do expect expense leverage to return in the fourth quarter. During Q3, we were able to flex down certain expenses to match our lower-than-expected sales base. However, we continued to make the necessary investments to open new stores, refresh existing stores and prepare for the all-important Q4 holiday selling season. 
In terms of new stores, we opened 55 new stores from August through November compared to 33 new stores during the same time frame last year. And with the additional 22 new store openings came incremental costs, payroll, occupancy, training, supplies, transportation and obviously, as you can see from our P&L, higher depreciation on those new assets.
We also completed this year's class of refresh stores during Q3, which was incremental activity to last year and there was some associated costs. And finally, maybe the most important element that makes Q3 unique from our focus, was our focus on preparing for the holiday selling season. Heavy shipments of goods processed from our DCs [distribution centers] through our stores, a more planful approach to setting forceps and end caps and hiring seasonal associates to help with the workload and all of those costs were incurred during Q3 in advance of the significant spike in sales we experienced in November and December.
Net interest expense was $0.7 million for the quarter compared to $0.5 million last year. Our tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was 32.3% compared to 35.2% last year with the lower tax rate principally due to hiring tax credits in certain jurisdictions. In total, for the third quarter fiscal 2010, we reported income from continuing operations of $17.7 million or $0.23 per diluted share compared to income from continuing operations of $22.1 million or $0.27 per diluted share a year ago. This result was below our previously communicated guidance of $0.25 to $0.29. At a high level the shortfall to the model was top line driven, partially offset by better-than-expected gross margin performance and a slight positive impact in both the tax rate and share count. 
Our original guidance called for our Q3 SG&A rate to be flattish to last year, principally due to the investments in holiday preparation I indicated before. The expense deleverage not included in our original guidance was principally due to the shortfall in sales. Expenses flexed as expected on a lower sales base, but not to the extent of the planned SG&A rate. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory ended the third quarter of fiscal 2010 at $1.006 billion compared to $918 million last year. Of the $88 million increase to last year approximately $75 million was inventory to support higher store count and the intentional decision to move up delivery dates and bring import merchandise in early to avoid potential disruption that could have resulted from the container shortages coming out of Asia.
Inventory levels were up 6% per store when considering stores open at the end of the quarter and stores open in the month of November. We view this level of increase as timing related and would expect our inventory per store at the end of the fourth quarter to be flat to slightly up to last year. 
Cash flow, which we define as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities, decreased by $89 million for the quarter compared to last year. This is largely attributable to the timing of inventory flow that I mentioned earlier and the higher CapEx related to new stores.
We ended the quarter with $51 million of cash and cash equivalents and $129 million of borrowings under our credit facility compared to $46 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1 million of borrowings under our credit facility last year. The increased level of borrowings is directly related to the share repurchase activity in fiscal 2010 and the increased inventory investment due to timing, as I mentioned earlier, partially offset by cash generated by operations over the past 12 months.
During Q3, we invested $108 million to opportunistically purchase 3.5 million shares at a weighted average price of $31.15 per share. Year-to-date, we've repurchased opportunistically $192 million of stock or 6.0 million shares at a weighted average price of $32.16 per share. You may also recall that we executed $150 million Accelerated Share Repurchase program, or ASR, in March of this year, although the final settlement of the total number of shares repurchased under our ASR will not be known until the contract ends. Had the ASR settled at the end of our fiscal third quarter, the total amount of shares repurchased under the ASR would have been 4.4 million shares. Combining our opportunistic activity with an assumed ASR of 4.4 million shares, our total number of shares repurchased year-to-date would be 10.4 million or approximately 13% of our outstanding shares at the beginning of fiscal 2010.
We currently have $58 million remaining under our current authorization to repurchase shares opportunistically in the open market as of today. For the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $41 million compared to $23 million last year, with the increase of $18 million, primarily focused on new stores, refresh stores and investments in energy management systems for our stores. Depreciation expense for the quarter was $19.6 million, an increase of $1.4 million corresponding with the significant investments made in our business over the last 12 months.
Moving on to guidance. We are forecasting a total sales increase of 4% to 6% for the fourth quarter. This level of increase correlates to total sales between $1.52 billion to $1.55 billion and is based on comparable store sales in a range of flat to up 2% supplemented by some very successful new store performance, which Chuck will touch on in a moment. Additionally, we expect to benefit from one additional shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect the fourth quarter gross margin rate will be below last year due to higher domestic and import freight costs, as well as lower IMU in certain deals and holiday strategies designed to drive excitement and foot traffic to our stores. 
From an expense standpoint in Q4, we still anticipate leverage in most major expense areas, including store payroll, distribution and transportation, utilities and advertising. This favorability is assumed to be partially offset by higher debit card fees resulting from rate hikes being passed on by network providers. Based on these assumptions, Q4 EPS from continuing operations is now estimated to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.42 per diluted share compared to $1.31 per diluted share last year. For the full year, we now expect income from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.81 per diluted share, which I believe is consistent with the most recent First Call consensus estimates.
This compares to our previous guidance of $2.82 to $2.90 per diluted share with the variance directly attributable with softer sales in third quarter, which are assumed to continue through the fourth quarter. This range of EPS assumes an average annual diluted share count of approximately 79 million shares and does not contemplate any utilization of the $58 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. We now estimate our inventory turnover at 3.7x, cash flow of approximately $200 million and net interest expense of approximately $2 million. For the full year of fiscal 2010, we expect the comparable store sales increase in the range of 3.0% to 3.5%. 
Now I'll turn it over to Chuck for an update on Real Estate."

During the third quarter, we opened 28 new stores and closed 13 [ph] stores leaving us with 1,389 stores and total selling square footage of 29.9 million at the end of the quarter. Subsequent to the end of Q3, we opened an additional 27 new stores in November bringing our total number of new store openings for the year to 80 stores.
Of the 80 store openings, 33 were new A-type locations with the balance in more traditional centers. Year-to-date, we've closed 26 stores and anticipate closing 16 more stores in Q4, bringing the total for the year to 42 closings in fiscal 2010. Of the closings, 23 are actually relocations and are either older stores being relocated to higher traffic areas in better strip centers or stores previously too small for a full-size Furniture department being relocated to a larger space to accommodate our full Furniture assortment. 
As Joe mentioned, we've been very encouraged by the performance of our new stores opened this year. Our new stores with enough history to trend, we're forecasting annualized sales above our initial plans both in terms of dollars and productivity per foot. Clearly, we're finding and securing better sites to open, but a large portion of this success is attributed to a better store opening process beginning to end from merchandising to marketing to allocation of product through to store operations.
In terms of the A-type locations, we continue to be pleased with performance to date, which has validated our decision to move aggressively into better locations. Additionally, as we've said on a number of occasions we believe we're attracting a meaningful amount of new customers to our A-store format, customers who have may not shopped at Big Lots in the past or had a store in their normal shipping pattern. Our traditional locations are also trending better than we anticipated, even though these locations are not classified as an A-type location, it's fair to say that a large majority of these stores are in better locations than we may have opened the past. In particular, both A-type and traditional stores opened in October and November have experienced a significant surge in business by combining grand opening activity, along with the natural spike in holiday traffic we experienced in our stores during the fourth quarter.

Our total sales forecast for the Q4 of 4% to 6% would represent some very good performance on top of our record quarter a year ago. There are several encouraging trends, which could impact not only holiday, but also highlight longer-term opportunities for the company. 
First and foremost, in merchandising, early customer response to our nine weeks of Christmas strategies has been pretty solid. In particular, the comp, strength in Furniture, Seasonal and Home has continued on into Q4 as has the improvements in certain of our Hardlines categories. Early selling in Toys has been very competitive, which was not unexpected, but we have sufficient dry powder to be aggressive. The merchandising strategies focused on key items in our how high is high testing are validating to us that we're on the right path. 
In terms of stores from my visits, I do believe our execution continues to improve. Our stores are becoming easier to shop, our merchants have delivered more floor-ready merchandise and PDQs to help in presentation and we're attracting a more talented team to Big Lots. 
From a marketing perspective, we're now approaching 7 million Rewards club members and our testing efforts are well underway to understand what generates the best and most productive response from our customers. And I feel particularly good about our direction in Real Estate and the sales volume we're experiencing in some of our new locations. It reinforces that new stores are likely the best investments we can be making right now for the future of the company. Store growth is at the top of the priority list for allocation of capital.

We thought some of those name brand items and you're speaking specifically on the Paper Jamz and Zhu Zhu Pet, which by the way, we had a complete sellout on, that our intention is not to be undercut. We've always been a leader, not only in Toys, but in every product category that we're in. We've taken and reacted to all the pricing that we felt we needed to adjust and I think if you're in our stores today you're going to find we're more aggressive than we potentially were over that weekend on a couple of those key items and on even more items. And I think you'll find -- one of the interesting things about our Marketing business is that we can work very close to divest and, in fact, we went through the Thanksgiving weekend and we were still able to react to the last week of December's piece, the week before Christmas and make any kind of price adjustments that we needed to make. So along with the fact that you're going to see us extremely aggressive in print in the next four weeks, you're also going to see us extremely aggressive online. If you're a Rewards member, we have done some really unique things all along the way. We planned on testing and finding out some of the things that really will excite our Rewards members, but we can react on a day-to-day basis by putting items up online and changing prices and you're going to see that throughout the balance of the Christmas season."

I would tell you, David, and I kind of spoke to it on the last conference call and I would speak to it again today that although we're concerned always about businesses that are having what we consider to be challenges. The food part of our business is probably the thing that I'm most focused on. It's the single most important business out of all the Consumables and about 10% of our total business on a normal year. The good news is, is in the fourth quarter Consumables isn't near as a percent to total as it is in the first three quarters of the year. And we're cranking on cylinders on the businesses that we need to be cranking on into the fourth quarter right now. But you're going to see a lot of newness and a lot of change in our Food business coming into the first quarter. I really can't speak to it yet and don't want too, but there's going to be a lot of creativity, a lot of newness and a lot of excitement on the things that are selling at this particular point. If you go through the stores, a lot of the specialty foods that we really keyed into for Christmas right now. They're doing well. It's the day-in and day-out business. I think we're not the only one struggling. I may be wrong about this. And again, you guys know the business a lot better than I do, but the guys who have Consumables, particularly the discount has a very high percent total. In the last five or six quarters have struggled a lot more than we have on the top line of our business and their Consumables business and particularly food is, is much as double as what it is in our business. So I don't know that we're the only one struggling. The consumers are feeling a pinch. Prices are up across the board. One of the things that I want to make sure of is that our customer knows that even though prices are going up at other major discounters and grocery stores that there's still that price-value relationship and that distance between us and anybody else in that 10% to 50% savings range and I think we're working very hard to understand that piece of it, too. So we're pretty consumed with all of Consumables. There's still a lot of great deals out there. There's still great deals in the stores. There's still going to be great deals going into January and into first quarter that we're working on all the time, and the consumer products companies are coming to us constantly on. So I'm encouraged what I think we're going to be capable of doing going into the first quarter."

Number one, from a location standpoint, I have said and I would say, again, that I believe, although the dollar stores are doing a great job of executing, the dollar stores are kind of like the convenient store of choice today. Dan, I think probably the major big-box retailers would say the same thing to you. Although, I think they're doing great job. I think they're experiencing the fact that the challenged economic consumer has only x amount of money to spend and it's easier to go into a local dollar store and pick up that $8, $9, $10, $11, $12 worth of what I need today and can only afford today groceries versus how we execute a strategy or some of the other traditional retailers or grocery stores do. I don't think that it's not a strategy that's not important to us that we'll continue to. One of the things that's different between our customers and the customer that you alluded to is that our average customer spends as much as 35 minutes in our store. So they don't come to us for a quick pick up and a quick shop. That could be challenging to us today. But in the long run, we'll still do a lot of Consumables business and we'll still be a great place to come to for the best values you can possibly find."

We really went after the Fireplace business. This is the third year in a row that we think we dominate the best value out there in that business and that is doing quite well is partially indicative of what happened in the third quarter in the Furniture business, although Furniture crossed the space and all four of the businesses were good and that was very exciting. I will tell you that we had a good Thanksgiving weekend. We were really pleased with the Thanksgiving weekend and that had a lot to do with how high is high because we had an exceptional three-day Thanksgiving weekend a year ago and to be able to comp-on-comp on those two three big days of the year, maybe the three biggest days of the year, although I'd have to go back and verify that. So don't hold me to that, we were really pleased. Fireplace, I just dropped my train of thought. In Home, particularly some of the better goods that we tested how high is high, blankets, microfiber things like that in the $15 to $20 range, that did quite well. And there was a third issue, I wanted to talk to you about and I just went blank. I'm sorry. Seasonal, trim-a-tree, particularly in the Lighting business, where we were testing how high is high. And I think I alluded in the last quarterly call that how we were really encouraged about what we thought we could do in Christmas trees and we keep challenging ourself on how high is high there and the fact that there's a lot of change in the Lighting business.

As you mentioned, eight opened in 2009, so we only have a few stores that had been opened for a full year. As we've gone through 2010 and opened 30 or so, what we've learned is an A store -- all A stores aren't going to be the same and some of them -- it's an A store in the market where they reside. So we can't have an A store with company average volume, but it would be higher average volume than the surrounding market. And we can also have A stores that you've seen them -- our A store, the Polaris in Columbus, where it performs significantly above company average. So it's an A based on location, doesn't have co-tenants that can help draw traffic, doesn't have population density, those kind of attributes. So we have been very pleased. But beyond the A stores, we've been pleased with what we call the traditional stores that we've opened in 2010. And what Chuck's team and the finance team are working together to determine is really what are the key attributes that have been driving that success and how can we replicate it. We don't want to necessarily start ramping up store growth and assumes that all new stores are going to produce like they did in 2010. But if you -- from a modeling standpoint, when you see the spread between total sales and comp store sales, you can tell that there's been a little -- that the new stores are now comp stores are becoming productive and that's encouraging to us.

Specifically on the Thanksgiving weekend, I know there's been a lot written about those few days and certainly the month of November, the sales numbers were out yesterday and we're probably pretty encouraging for most. I think what we're trying to communicate is when traffic really picked up and was at its peak late in the month around Thanksgiving. Clearly, we had a great value proposition that pulled people in and we did very well on that week on top of some pretty impressive numbers a year ago. So a lot of the items that were focused in the ad in the Thursday and Friday and Saturday specials did very well, a lot of those items or items were tested in the prior year, so that's what we feel very good about going into the balance of holiday. And clearly, that's a little bit different trend than what we were communicating with late September and October. I think that's about as much as we can say on that at this point. So really to be able to look at fourth quarter and see a little bit of improvement compared to September and October and good response to categories or items that we need good response for where we've really made an investment in inventory was encouraging to us. But in terms of the holiday and hot items, so I'll let Steve speak to those best about."

Actually, Seasonal specialty food, even though our Food business is not been a strong, but that piece has been very, very good. Toys are all over the board. It's a really competitive Christmas. I think that's the best thing to say about that right now, and we're going to see how the consumer decides to vote at the registers and it'll be very interesting to see how a lot of people talk about their Toy business. We're in the basic Toy business. We're not in the Electronic Toy business and the business is shifting what a youngster wants today, if it's got a plug on or you can put it in your ear or something like that, that's what they like. Although I will say in the Electronics part of the business, the MP3 players continue to be really, really strong for us. The Camera business continues to be the Digital Camera business, in particular, and then the little Jazz video camera that we ran Thanksgiving day, that we will come back again with one more time between now and Christmas time was just off the wall. That was a good example of how high is high to the quantity that we sold of that item. So I think one of the things I'm continuing to be more and more encouraged about is we really understand. I've always said that we just never understood how much we could really sell of any one thing, and we continue to get better and better and closer to working to understand what the consumer really wants from us in quantities. The recliner, Thanksgiving day, that we've been pretty traditional. We've done that for -- this could have been our fifth year in a row, we sold probably more of those than -- almost as many as we had on hand to sell a year ago at this particular point. So we're really getting better in understanding what our customer wants and buying into it. Now it comes at a cost from an inventory perspective, and we stuck our necks out on inventory and I know that some of you didn't like the inventory levels, but our perspective is, is we've got: number one, be prepared for the customer; and number two, have enough dry powder when these deals that -- half of our business become available to us. And one of the reasons Joe gave guidance for the end of the fourth quarter that we plan on being on about inventory or slightly up is that we've got dry powder in there for deals that we know we're going to get or we're waiting for the telephone calls to happen. We just don't know when they're going to be there. And I've we've always said, we've got to buy the deals that are right for the consumer and not play to the end of a quarter metric for one reason or another. So I think that's why he was being a little bit cautious and rightly so to you, so I think that's a pretty good recap."

But on the new store growth looking out -- at the beginning of the year, we gave a three-year view that talked about square footage growth of 3% to 4% in each of the next three years. We talked about 80 new stores this year, which we clearly delivered and a number, more likely 90 stores or more, in the next couple of years after that. That's about as much as we've given at this point. Obviously, we'll fill in the blanks come March. Along with that, you should expect that the closing number might go up a little bit also as we get more and more opportunities to relocated into some of these more productive locations. But overall, that the net number of new stores open next year and the year after ought to growth from where we are today. In looking at some of the more recent store openings, it is still very fairly recent, as we just said, but I guess what we're encouraged by, John, is when we normally work at a new store, we're looking at that initial lease term of five to seven years and saying, are we delivering a good return or are we delivering a return close store or better than our weighted average cost of capital, which we estimate loosely to be around 12%. All we can really comment on at this point is based on sales and it's early, year one sales are the most important, one of the most important number is on that pro forma and we're ahead of pace. I think that's about as much as we're comfortable saying right now, we're going to watch them through the holiday season and we ought to be a lot more smarter the next time we speak."

We had a good Thanksgiving week. But our flat to 2% guidance, what that represents is fairly consistent performance through week four of December and then you have an extra shopping day. So take out week four of November and then kind of run through pretty consistent weeks one, two and three in November, and then the first part of December. When we talked about we've seen some improvement in November, that's really off September and October. It's not necessarily -- we're not projecting significant improvement off the third quarter trend it's just that we saw a slowdown coming out of August. But when you look at the 0.7% for the third quarter, that's a three-month comp obviously. August, we outperformed that and then September and October, we saw some softening, which we've seen some improvement over those two months trend in November and we're encouraged by that. What we're looking at very, very closely right now is how our shoppers shopping after the Black Friday weekend and week one of December and week two of December are very, very important there to see how strong will they come back in the stores after that pretty successful weekend for across retail. It wasn't just Big Lots. So we believe our comps, our comp guidance is the best we know today and then, of course, we roll in the January where we had a very strong January of 2010 and we're comping on top of that. Now our assortment going in there seems very compelling, we're very encouraged by it. But there's a lot of sales ahead of us, hence our guidance."

We don't play in it like the big boys playing in it and I don't know that, that's been a vibrant category for anybody right now. Prices are extremely competitive and they'll buy when there's a great deal, but we don't make a lot of money doing it. Actually, I think there's a piece in this weekend's tease in pre-print that you'll see that we think is pretty sharp and you'll probably see something else between now and the end of the holiday. But it's not a category that we run after unless it's really offered to us. So I would tell you that's a category that scares the heck out of me. We're not specials in it. And I've said in many occasions, if you stick a plug into the wall, it's very low margin, no matter what it is, it always makes a shutter a little bit. Seasonal is doing well. We continue to see that driving our business in the fourth quarter. Home is doing well. We continue to see that driving our business in the fourth quarter. Toys what I mentioned was, it was competitive. We'll see how challenging it is between now and the 25th of December. But again, we don't play in the Electronics part of the Toy business, we just play in the pure Toy business and we need to understand that. And that's been a challenge, not only this year, but it has been for the last three or four years and it's probably somewhat of a down trending business to be quite honest with you. We need to understand how we want to position that Toy business going forward. Consumables. Well, Consumables is Consumables. I mean, I can beat it up the way you want to beat it up. I wish it was better for us than it's been. But it's a smaller piece as a percent of total of our business in the fourth quarter and is the lowest margin piece of our business, overall, as a division in the company. So I'll tell you what's been slightly encouraging and I think I slightly mention it. The Automotive business, the hard goods part of the business, when it comes to hardware, the Toolset business has been terrific and we did a real strategic program for Christmas there on how high is high at price points and they're doing quite well. The electrical part of the business, the maintenance part of the business, the heater part of the business, particularly where it's been cool, and if it doesn't snow like it did on the East Coast, they can get to the stores like yesterday, but that's part of the game. I mean, there's going to be weather, so we can't get too worried about that. You're not getting a weather report from us. Those have been good and encouraging, so I like all those parts of the business."

So to be quite honest with you, it will take us a little while to find our way down the road there, but I would say, product offering, more than anything else and the fact that I think the consumer is challenged. I really do. I mean everybody is playing off of us. I don't think we're the only ones whose Consumables businesses is tough. I know the dollar stores are doing well. I think it's a convenience aspect, but that's my point of view, everybody else can see whatever they want to say. But the comps, at the largest retailer in the world, in the last six quarters, have been down and 55% to 65% of their business is Consumables.

During the third quarter, our customers continued to be selective in their purchases, but were willing to spend money where they saw tremendous values as evidenced by the continued strength in certain of our higher ticket, discretionary categories. From a merchandising perspective, Furniture, Seasonal and Home continued to lead the way. 
For the fourth consecutive quarter, Furniture comped up double digits with a very solid execution across all classifications. In particular, Upholstery was excellent, the Stratolounger closeout deal, and the Furniture Roadshow supplemented by solid performance in our day-in and day-out assortment. Closeout deals are a nice shot in the arm when we get them, but the real strength is our everyday assortment at a value and quality level that makes us an industry leader in the low to moderate price point Furniture business.
Our Seasonal category comped up high-single digits for the second quarter in a row. Lawn & Garden, particularly our tailgating assortment, was strong early in the quarter and each of our fall Seasonal businesses comped up mid to high singles. And there, I'm referring to Halloween, harvest and early Christmas selling. Again, this is one of the higher price points in the store, further reinforcing to us that we're presenting great value, and we think this bodes well for the holiday season.
Home comped up in the low-single digits on top of improving trends from a year ago. So comp-on-comp which I believe is an indicator, a category gaining momentum. Results were driven by a combination of good deals and improving quality on consistency product. We experienced improving trends in some of our Hardlines classifications, like tools, appliances and home maintenance, offset by a slight decline in our Electronics business, as we anniversaried the very successful launch of our video game software program a year ago. 
Our most challenged business was Consumables, where we comped down in the low-single digits. For those of you who have followed us for a while, you know that we don't make excuses for our performance. In this situation, I don't believe we executed as well as we're capable of and did not provide the customer with the offering that they've come to expect from us. The team is working very hard and swiftly to make changes to prepare us for the new year. So we posted a positive comp for Q3, but we always want to do better. Having said that, clearly, there's some very encouraging performances in the third quarter. 
Now Joe is going to give you some details on the quarter and how we're looking at our forward guidance. Joe?"

Sales for the third quarter were $1.056 billion, an increase of 2.0% over the $1.035 billion we reported for the third quarter of last year. Comparable store sales increased 0.7%.For Q3, operating profit",1465,"Well, thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $1.056 billion, an increase of 2.0% over the $1.035 billion we reported for the third quarter of last year. Comparable store sales increased 0.7%.
For Q3, operating profit dollars were $27 million, a decrease of approximately $8 million compared to last year's gross margin growth. Gross margin dollar growth was offset by an increase in expense dollars. In terms of gross margin, our dollars grew by approximately $10 million or 2.4% due to a combination of total sales growth and expansion in the gross margin rate. Our rate for Q3 of 40.5% was 10 basis points above last year and better than our guidance. The rate increase was due to lower markdowns, lower shrink costs and a slightly favorable mix impact. In particular, the favorable merchandise mix impact on lower markdowns were the direct result of better performance in certain of our discretionary categories, particularly Seasonal and Home. These improvements were partially offset by higher freight costs, both domestic and import.
Total expense dollars were $401 million, an increase of $18 million or approximately 5% compared to last year. We believe there were certain unique factors in the third quarter and we do expect expense leverage to return in the fourth quarter. During Q3, we were able to flex down certain expenses to match our lower-than-expected sales base. However, we continued to make the necessary investments to open new stores, refresh existing stores and prepare for the all-important Q4 holiday selling season. 
In terms of new stores, we opened 55 new stores from August through November compared to 33 new stores during the same time frame last year. And with the additional 22 new store openings came incremental costs, payroll, occupancy, training, supplies, transportation and obviously, as you can see from our P&L, higher depreciation on those new assets.
We also completed this year's class of refresh stores during Q3, which was incremental activity to last year and there were some associated costs. And finally, maybe the most important element that makes Q3 unique from our focus, was our focus on preparing for the holiday selling season. Heavy shipments of goods processed from our DCs [distribution centers] to our stores, a more planful approach to setting floor sets and end caps and hiring seasonal associates to help with the workload and all of those costs were incurred during Q3 in advance of the significant spike in sales we experience in November and December.
Net interest expense was $0.7 million for the quarter compared to $0.5 million last year. Our tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was 32.3% compared to 35.2% last year with the lower tax rate principally due to hiring tax credits in certain jurisdictions. In total, for the third quarter fiscal 2010, we reported income from continuing operations of $17.7 million or $0.23 per diluted share compared to income from continuing operations of $22.1 million or $0.27 per diluted share a year ago. This result was below our previously communicated guidance of $0.25 to $0.29. At a high level the shortfall to the model was top line driven, partially offset by better-than-expected gross margin performance and a slight positive impact in both the tax rate and share count. 
Our original guidance called for our Q3 SG&A rate to be flattish to last year, principally due to the investments in holiday preparation I indicated before. The expense deleverage not included in our original guidance was principally due to the shortfall in sales. Expenses flexed as expected on a lower sales base, but not to the extent of the planned SG&A rate. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory ended the third quarter of fiscal 2010 at $1.006 billion compared to $918 million last year. Of the $88 million increase to last year approximately $75 million was inventory to support higher store count and the intentional decision to move up delivery dates and bring import merchandise in early to avoid potential disruption that could have resulted from the container shortages coming out of Asia.
Inventory levels were up 6% per store when considering stores open at the end of the quarter and stores open in the month of November. We view this level of increase as timing related and would expect our inventory per store at the end of the fourth quarter to be flat to slightly up to last year. 
Cash flow, which we define as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities, decreased by $89 million for the quarter compared to last year. This is largely attributable to the timing of inventory flow that I mentioned earlier and the higher CapEx related to new stores.
We ended the quarter with $51 million of cash and cash equivalents and $129 million of borrowings under our credit facility compared to $46 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1 million of borrowings under our credit facility last year. The increased level of borrowings is directly related to the share repurchase activity in fiscal 2010 and the increased inventory investment due to timing, as I mentioned earlier, partially offset by cash generated by operations over the past 12 months.
During Q3, we invested $108 million to opportunistically purchase 3½ million shares at a weighted average price of $31.15 per share. Year-to-date, we've repurchased opportunistically $192 million of our stock or 6.0 million shares at a weighted average price of $32.16 per share. You may also recall that we executed $150 million Accelerated Share Repurchase program, or ASR, in March of this year. Although the final settlement of the total number of shares repurchased under our ASR will not be known until the contract ends, had the ASR settled at the end of our fiscal third quarter, the total amount of shares repurchased under the ASR would have been 4.4 million shares. Combining our opportunistic activity with an assumed ASR of 4.4 million shares, our total number of shares repurchased year-to-date would be 10.4 million or approximately 13% of our outstanding shares at the beginning of fiscal 2010.
We currently have $58 million remaining under our current authorization to repurchase shares opportunistically in the open market as of today. For the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $41 million compared to $23 million last year, with the increase of $18 million, primarily focused on new stores, refresh stores and investments in energy management systems for our stores. Depreciation expense for the quarter was $19.6 million, an increase of $1.4 million corresponding with the significant investments made in our business over the last 12 months.
Moving on to guidance. We are forecasting a total sales increase of 4% to 6% for the fourth quarter. This level of increase correlates to total sales between $1.52 billion to $1.55 billion and is based on comparable store sales in a range of flat to up 2% supplemented by some very successful new store performance, which Chuck will touch on in a moment. Additionally, we expect to benefit from one additional shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect the fourth quarter gross margin rate will be below last year due to higher domestic and import freight costs, as well as lower IMU in certain deals and holiday strategies designed to drive excitement and foot traffic to our stores. 
From an expense standpoint in Q4, we still anticipate leverage in most major expense areas, including store payroll, distribution and transportation, utilities and advertising. This favorability is assumed to be partially offset by higher debit card fees resulting from rate hikes being passed on by network providers. Based on these assumptions, Q4 EPS from continuing operations is now estimated to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.42 per diluted share compared to $1.31 per diluted share last year. For the full year, we now expect income from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.81 per diluted share, which I believe is consistent with the most recent First Call consensus estimates.
This compares to our previous guidance of $2.82 to $2.90 per diluted share with the variance directly attributable to softer sales in third quarter, which are assumed to continue through the fourth quarter. This range of EPS assumes an average annual diluted share count of approximately 79 million shares and does not contemplate any utilization of the $58 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. We now estimate our inventory turnover at 3.7x, cash flow of approximately $200 million and net interest expense of approximately $2 million. For the full year of fiscal 2010, we expect a comparable store sales increase in the range of 3.0% to 3.5%. 
Now I'll turn it over to Chuck for an update on Real Estate."

During the third quarter, we opened 28 new stores and closed 13 [ph] stores leaving us with 1,389 stores and total selling square footage of 29.9 million at the end of the quarter. Subsequent to the end of Q3, we opened an additional 27 new stores in November bringing our total number of new store openings for the year to 80 stores.
Of the 80 store openings, 33 were new A-type locations with the balance in more traditional centers. Year-to-date, we've closed 26 stores and anticipate closing 16 more stores in Q4, bringing the total for the year to 42 closings in fiscal 2010. Of the closings, 23 are actually relocations and are either older stores being relocated to higher traffic areas in better strip centers or stores previously too small for a full-size Furniture department being relocated to a larger space to accommodate our full Furniture assortment. 
As Joe mentioned, we've been very encouraged by the performance of our new stores opened this year. For new stores with enough history to trend, we're forecasting annualized sales above our initial plans both in terms of dollars and productivity per foot. Clearly, we're finding and securing better sites to open, but a large portion of this success is attributed to a better store opening process beginning to end from merchandising to marketing to allocation of product through to store operations.
In terms of the A-type locations, we continue to be pleased with performance to date, which has validated our decision to move aggressively into better locations. Additionally, as we've said on a number of occasions we believe we're attracting a meaningful amount of new customers to our A-store format, customers who have may not shopped at Big Lots in the past or had a store in their normal shipping pattern. Our traditional locations are also trending better than we anticipated, even though these locations are not classified as an A-type location, it's fair to say that a large majority of these stores are in better locations than we may have opened in the past. In particular, both A-type and traditional stores opened in October and November have experienced a significant surge in business by combining grand opening activity, along with the natural spike in holiday traffic we experienced in our stores during the fourth quarter.

Our total sales forecast for the Q4 of 4% to 6% would represent some very good performance on top of our record quarter a year ago. There are several encouraging trends, which could impact not only holiday, but also highlight longer-term opportunities for the company. 
First and foremost, in merchandising, early customer response to our nine weeks of Christmas strategies has been pretty solid. In particular, the comp strength in Furniture, Seasonal and Home has continued on into Q4 as has the improvements in certain of our Hardlines categories. Early selling in Toys has been very competitive, which was not unexpected, but we have sufficient dry powder to be aggressive. The merchandising strategies focused on key items in our how high is high testing are validating to us that we're on the right path. 
In terms of stores from my visits, I do believe our execution continues to improve. Our stores are becoming easier to shop, our merchants have delivered more floor-ready merchandise and PDQs to help in presentation and we're attracting a more talented team to Big Lots. 
From a marketing perspective, we're now approaching 7 million Rewards club members and our testing efforts are well underway to understand what generates the best and most productive response from our customers. And I feel particularly good about our direction in Real Estate and the sales volume we're experiencing in some of our new locations. It reinforces that new stores are likely the best investment we can be making right now for the future of the company. Store growth is at the top of the priority list for allocation of capital.

I would tell you, David, and I kind of spoke to it on the last conference call and I would speak to it again today that although we're concerned always about businesses that are having what we consider to be challenges, the food part of our business is probably the thing that I'm most focused on. It's the single most important business out of all of Consumables and about 10% of our total business on a normal year. The good news is, is in the fourth quarter Consumables isn't near as a percent to total as it is in the first three quarters of the year. And we're cranking on cylinders on the businesses that we need to be cranking on into the fourth quarter right now. But you're going to see a lot of newness and a lot of change in our Food business coming into the first quarter. I really can't speak to it yet and don't want to, but there's going to be a lot of creativity, a lot of newness and a lot of excitement on the things that are selling at this particular point. If you go through the stores, a lot of the specialty foods that we really keyed into for Christmas right now. They're doing well. It's the day-in and day-out business. I think we're not the only one struggling. I may be wrong about this. And again, you guys know the business a lot better than I do, but the guys who have Consumables, particularly the discounters, there’s a very high percent total, in the last five or six quarters have struggled a lot more than we have on the top line of our business and their Consumables business and particularly food is, is much as double as what it is in our business. So I don't know that we're the only one struggling. The consumer’s feeling the pinch. Prices are up across the board. One of the things that I want to make sure of is this: that our customer knows that even though prices are going up at other major discounters and grocery stores that there's still that price-value relationship and that distance between us and everybody else in that 10% to 50% savings range, and I think we're working very hard to understand that piece of it, too. So we're pretty consumed with all of Consumables. There's still a lot of great deals out there. There's still great deals in the stores. There's still going to be great deals going into January and into the first quarter that we're working on all the time, and the consumer products companies are coming to us constantly on. So I'm encouraged what I think we're going to be capable of doing going into the first quarter."

Number one, from a location standpoint, I have said and I would say, again, that I believe, although the dollar stores are doing a great job of executing, the dollar stores are kind of like the convenient store of choice today. Dan, I think probably the major big-box retailers would say the same thing to you. Although, I think they're doing a great job, I think they're experiencing the fact that the challenged economic consumer has only x amount of money to spend and it's easier to go into a local dollar store and pick up that $8, $9, $10, $11, $12 worth of what I need today and can only afford today groceries versus how we execute a strategy or some of the other traditional retailers or grocery stores do. I don't think that it's not a strategy that's not important to us that we'll continue to. One of the things that's different between our customers and the customer that you alluded to is that our average customer spends as much as 35 minutes in our store. So they don't come to us for a quick pick up and a quick shop. That could be challenging to us today. But in the long run, we'll still do a lot of Consumables business and we'll still be a great place to come to for the best values you can possibly find."

We really went after the Fireplace business. This is the third year in a row that we think we dominate the best value out there in that business and that is doing quite well, is partially indicative of what happened in the third quarter in the Furniture business, although Furniture crossed the space and all four of the businesses were good and that was very exciting. I will tell you that we had a good Thanksgiving weekend. We were really pleased with the Thanksgiving weekend and that had a lot to do with how high is high because we had an exceptional three-day Thanksgiving weekend a year ago and to be able to comp-on-comp on those two, three big days of the year, maybe the three biggest days of the year, although I'd have to go back and verify that. So don't hold me to that, we were really pleased. Fireplace, I just dropped my train of thought. In Home, particularly some of the better goods that we tested how high is high, blankets, microfiber things like that in the $15 to $20 range, that did quite well. And there was a third issue, I wanted to talk to you about and I just went blank. I'm sorry. Seasonal, trim-a-tree, particularly in the Lighting business, where we were testing how high is high. And I think I alluded in the last quarterly call about how we were really encouraged about what we thought we could do in Christmas trees and we keep challenging ourself on how high is high there and the fact that there's a lot of change in the Lighting business. If you're a student of that business or a great customer, everybody needs new LED lighting this year and those investments have proven so far to this point to be really good investments in how high is high testing."

As you mentioned, eight opened in 2009, so we only have a few stores that have been open for a full year. As we've gone through 2010 and opened 30 or so, what we've learned is an A store -- all A stores aren't going to be the same and some of them -- it's an A store in the market where they reside. So we can't have an A store with company average volume, but it would be higher average volume than the surrounding market. And we can also have A stores that, you've seen them -- our A store, the Polaris in Columbus, where it performs significantly above company average. So it's an A based on location, does it have co-tenants that can help draw traffic, does it have population density, those kind of attributes. So we have been very pleased. But beyond the A stores, we've been pleased with what we call the traditional stores that we've opened in 2010. And what Chuck's team and the finance team are working together to determine is really what are the key attributes that have been driving that success and how can we replicate it. We don't want to necessarily start ramping up new store growth and assume that all new stores are going to produce like they did in 2010. But if you -- from a modeling standpoint, when you see the spread between total sales and comp store sales, you can tell that there's been a little -- that the new stores are now comp stores are becoming more productive and that's encouraging to us. But as Chuck said, we still want to be deliberate as we open new stores. We want to make sure we develop the talent in the field that can support the new store openings and also that the economics in the new stores continue to be favorable for the profitability of the company."

Actually, Seasonal specialty food, even though our Food business has not been as strong, but that piece has been very, very good. Toys are all over the board. It's a really competitive Christmas. I think that's the best thing to say about that right now, and we're going to see how the consumer decides to vote at the registers and it'll be very interesting to see how a lot of people talk about their Toy business. We're in the basic Toy business. We're not in the Electronic Toy business and the business is shifting what a youngster wants today. If it's got a plug on or you can put it in your ear or something like that, that's what they like. Although I will say in the Electronics part of the business, the MP3 players continue to be really, really strong for us. The Camera business continues to be, the Digital Camera business, in particular, and then the little Jazz video camera that we ran Thanksgiving day, that we will come back again with one more time between now and Christmas time was just off the wall. That was a good example of how high is high too, the quantity that we sold of that item. So I think one of the things I'm continuing to be more and more encouraged about is we really understand. I've always said that we just never understood how much we could really sell of any one thing, and we continue to get better and better and closer to working to understand what the consumer really wants from us in quantities. The recliner, Thanksgiving day, that we've been pretty traditional. We've done that for -- this could have been our fifth year in a row, we sold probably more of those than -- almost as many as we had on hand to sell a year ago at this particular point. So we're really getting better at understanding what our customer wants and buying into it. Now that comes at a cost from an inventory perspective, and we stuck our necks out on inventory and I know that some of you didn't like the inventory levels, but our perspective is, is we've got to number one, be prepared for the customer; and number two, have enough dry powder when these deals that -- half of our business become available to us. And one of the reasons Joe gave guidance for the end of the fourth quarter that we plan on being on about inventory or slightly up is that we've got dry powder in there for deals that we know we're going to get or we're waiting for the telephone calls to happen. We just don't know when they're going to be there. And I've always said, we've got to buy the deals that are right for the consumer and not play to the end of a quarter metric for one reason or another. So I think that's why he was being a little bit cautious and rightly so to you, so I think that's a pretty good recap."

But on the new store growth looking out -- at the beginning of the year, we gave a three-year view that talked about square footage growth of 3% to 4% in each of the next three years. We talked about 80 new stores this year, which we clearly delivered and a number, more likely 90 stores or more, in the next couple of years after that. That's about as much as we've given at this point. Obviously, we'll fill in the blanks come March. Along with that though, you should expect that the closing number might go up a little bit also as we get more and more opportunity to relocated into some of these more productive locations. But overall, that the net number of new stores opened next year and the year after ought to grow from where we are today. In looking at some of the more recent store openings, it is still fairly recent, as we just said, but I guess what we're encouraged by, John, is when we normally look at a new store, we're looking at that initial lease term of five to seven years and saying, are we delivering a good return or are we delivering a return close to or better than our weighted average cost of capital, which we estimate loosely to be around 12%. All we can really comment on at this point is based on sales and it's early. Year one sales are the most important, one of the most important numbers on that pro forma and we're ahead of pace. I think that's about as much as we're comfortable saying right now. We're going to watch them through the holiday season, and we ought to be a lot more smarter the next time we speak."

We had a good Thanksgiving week. But our flat to 2% guidance, what that represents is fairly consistent performance through week four of December and then you have an extra shopping day. So take out week four of November and then kind of run through pretty consistent weeks one, two and three in November, and then the first part of December. When we talked about we've seen some improvement in November, that's really off September and October. It's not necessarily -- we're not projecting significant improvement off the third quarter trend it's just that we saw a slowdown coming out of August. But when you look at the 0.7% for the third quarter, that's a three-month comp obviously. August, we outperformed that and then September and October, we saw some softening, which we've seen some improvement over those two months trends in November and we're encouraged by that. What we're looking at very, very closely right now is how are shoppers shopping after the Black Friday weekend, and week one of December and week two of December are very, very important there to see how strong will they come back in the stores after that pretty successful weekend for across retail. It wasn't just Big Lots. So we believe our comps, our comp guidance is the best we know today and then, of course, we roll into January where we had a very strong January of 2010 and we're comping on top of that. Now our assortment going in there seems very compelling, we're very encouraged by it. But there's a lot of sales ahead of us, hence our guidance."

We don't play in it like the big boys play in it and I don't know that, that's been a vibrant category for anybody right now. Prices are extremely competitive and they'll buy when there's a great deal, but we don't make a lot of money doing it. Actually, I think there's a piece in this weekend's tease in pre-print that you'll see that we think is pretty sharp and you'll probably see something else between now and the end of the holiday. But it's not a category that we run after unless it's really offered to us. So I would tell you that's a category that scares the heck out of me. We're not specialists in it. And I've said on many occasions, if you stick a plug into the wall, it's very low margin, no matter what it is, and it always makes us shudder a little bit. Seasonal is doing well. We continue to see that driving our business in the fourth quarter. Home is doing well. We continue to see that driving our business in the fourth quarter. Toys, what I mentioned was, is it was competitive. We'll see how challenging it is between now and the 25th of December. But again, we don't play in the Electronics part of the Toy business, we just play in the pure Toy business and we need to understand that. And that's been a challenge, not only this year, but it has been for the last three or four years and it's probably somewhat of a down-trending business to be quite honest with you. We need to understand how we want to position that Toy business going forward. Consumables. Well, Consumables is Consumables. I mean, I can beat it up the way you want to beat it up. I wish it was better for us than it's been. But it's a smaller piece as a percent to total of our business in the fourth quarter and it’s the lowest margin piece of our business, overall, as a division in the company. So I'll tell you what's been slightly encouraging and I think I slightly mentioned it. The Automotive business, the hard goods part of the business, when it comes to hardware, the Toolset business has been terrific and we did a real strategic program for Christmas there on how high is high at price points and they're doing quite well. The electrical part of the business, the maintenance part of the business, the heater part of the business, particularly where it's been cool, and if it doesn't snow like it did on the East Coast, and they can get to the stores like yesterday, but that's part of the game. I mean, there's going to be weather, so we can't get too worried about that. You're not getting a weather report from us. Those have been good and encouraging, so I like all those parts of the business."

So to be quite honest with you, it will take us a little while to find our way down the road there, but I would say, product offering, more than anything else and the fact that I think the consumer is challenged. I really do. I mean everybody is playing off of us. I don't think we're the only ones whose Consumables business is tough. I know the dollar stores are doing well. I think it's a convenience aspect, but that's my point of view, everybody else can say whatever they want to say. But the comps, at the largest retailer in the world, in the last six quarters, have been down and 55% to 65% of their business is Consumables.
