And since we saw many of you at our Education Day in November and today's announcement doesn't include enrollment results, we'll make an effort to be brief this afternoon and get to your questions.So we're pleased to announce that the continued execution of our growth in diversification strategy and our focus on investing in academic quality has produced successful student outcomes and another quarter of strong financial results. In the increase that we saw in enrollments in December translated into exceptional revenue growth in the quarter, which drove margin improvement and record earnings. At the same time, we continued to invest in our programs and student services to drive future growth. At DeVry's home office, this quarter has been a busy one for us as we recently moved into our new offices in Downers Grove in Oak Brook, Illinois, and we moved out our data center to its new location as well. Our new home office is a co-location with the DeVry University Center and houses a classroom of the future. The new offices are designed to be open and collaborative with state-of-the-art amenities for our employees and are another part of our strategy to be the employer of choice in education and we'd like to invite you to come visit us when you can.I'd like to spend a few minutes here on our expectations for the rest of 2010 and beyond in the context of the overarching economic conditions that we're seeing. Because there certainly are some optimistic signs that the worst of this recession is behind us. But with the government announcement, for example, the 85,000 jobs were lost in December, it remains clear that meaningful economic recovery is not a foregoing conclusion here in 2010. As I outlined during our Education Day, we believe DeVry is well-positioned in both good and bad times.Our confidence is bolstered by two factors. But first, our operating philosophy namely that “Quality Leads to Growth”. At DeVry, our institutions educate students  for positions across a variety of industries, but they have one thing in common. Each provides high-quality programs and services to our students. And as we continue to invest in quality, academic outcomes improve. The continued success of our students drives enrolment and retention, which leads to financial growth, and this is true in both good times and in bad times. And we, in turn, put those earnings right back to work by investing them in the quality of our programs. A case in point, we're planning to invest over $100 million this year in capital expenditures on our programs, services and facilities. In today's world of state budget cuts and declining endowment, this investment is an example of the important role that private sector schools, like DeVry, are playing in today's educational system. And the second factor is our diversification strategy, which has us well-positioned to deliver consistent and sustainable growth, again, through both good and bad economic times. Some of our operations are co-cyclical, like Becker, which has been negatively affected by the weak economy's. At the same time, schools like those of U.S. Education are more countercyclical. And in addition, DeVry has schools like, such as Chamberlain College of Nursing and Ross University, that are entirely non-cyclical. In fact, DeVry is the only publicly-traded education provider that has a medical school or a veterinary school. So taken as a whole, the DeVry family of schools is best characterized as non-cyclical. And so given our philosophy of quality leads to growth, and our ability to mitigate risks through our diverse family of schools, I believe we'll continue to experience sustainable growth when the economy recovers.And just an illustration of this, I'd like to share with you how our largest school, DeVry University, grew during the strongest economic recovery in the postwar era, the 90s. And for this, please refer to the chart that you'll find in today's press release. Because if you take a look at that chart, you'll see that at the end of the recession in 1992 and moving forward for 10 years in 2001, the job market improved with unemployment falling from a high of 7.4%, down to 4.2% over that period. And taking a look at DeVry University's total enrolment over that same period, our enrolment continued to grow, in fact, the rate of growth increased. And keep in mind that that was in the 90s, when we weren't as diversified as we are today. I think a lot of people think we're more countercyclical than we really are, and this example demonstrates that we are able to grow in an economic recovery.And so with that introduction, let me turn the call over to Rick for the financial results."
27536,82628612,47024,"DeVry, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jan-26-2010",2010-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Adtalem Global Education Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Daniel, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to take the next several minutes to highlight our strong financial performance for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2010. I'm pleased and encouraged to see the very positive impact from ou",1376,"Thanks, Daniel, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to take the next several minutes to highlight our strong financial performance for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2010. I'm pleased and encouraged to see the very positive impact from our investments in academic quality and customer service, which have resulted in strong revenue growth, along with significantly-improved margins and profitability. Record quarterly revenue of $473 million was up about 28% versus prior year. This is primarily organic growth as we've anniversaried the U.S. Education acquisition in September, with revenues still up 25% in the quarter, excluding our more recent acquisition of DeVry Brazil. Revenue to the first half of the fiscal year was up about 34% and 25% when you exclude both DeVry Brazil and U.S. Education.Net income and earnings per share were both up about 69% in the quarter and 64% year-to-date. Earnings per share were $1 in the quarter, marking the first time we've broken through the dollar threshold. It's also interesting to note that our earnings per share were only $0.61 for the entire year in fiscal 2006, just 3.5 years ago. The pretax income margin for the first half was 21%, up 470 basis points versus the 16.3% margin achieved a year ago. Now fiscal 2010 is really shaping up to be a breakthrough year, and we expect to significantly surpass our historical peak margin of 17.1% this year. These results were driven by the excellent enrolment growth and retention results across our schools, while our Professional Education segment continues to be negatively impacted by the economy. The financials reflect the power of operating leverage, which is helping drive the significant profitability improvement. For your reference, second quarter results include expense related to share-based payments of approximately $2.1 million pretax or $1.8 million net of tax, a bit higher than last year. Our overall effective tax rate was 33.6% in the quarter and 32.9% year-to-date, up from the 30.4% rate for full-year fiscal 2009, primarily due to the continued increase in domestic source income.For a perspective, we're now paying over $100 million in federal and state taxes on an annualized basis. Cost of educational service expense increased by 20% versus prior year in the quarter. And student services and administrative expense increased by 17%, both grew on a double-digit rate, but less than the revenue growth with or without the acquisitions. We continue to make prudent, targeted investments while still delivering leverage and efficiencies.With that, as a highlight, let me walk you through some of the operating segment results, which are further detailed in our earnings release. First, the Business, Technology, and Management Segment achieved a very strong top- and bottom-line results. Revenue was up 26% versus prior year in the quarter and 25% year-to-date, driven by the strong enrolment growth and increased retention driven by our focus on student services. The segment operating income of $78 million in the quarter and $134 million year-to-date more than doubled versus prior year. This improvement was driven by revenue growth and a resulting operating leverage. The segment margin was 24.9% in the quarter and 22.5% year-to-date. While we're continuing to make investments to support academic quality and customer service, our incremental earnings flow through for the segment has been over 60% year-to-date. This shows the power of operating leverage on our cost base from the very strong top-line growth. Within the Medical and Healthcare segment, revenue was up 28% in the quarter, driven by the enrolment growth and pricing at Ross University and Chamberlain College of Nursing, along with continued good results at Apollo College and Western Career College. Second quarter operating income for this segment of $31.2 million was up 17% versus last year. The margin was a bit lower than prior year, driven by business mix within the segment, with the addition of U.S. Education and very strong growth at Chamberlain, both which have lower margins than Ross University.Our Professional Education segment results continue to reflect the impact of the soft economy on the accounting and finance professions. Revenue was down 6.3% in the quarter and down 4.6% year-to-date versus last year. Operating income was down about 28% in the quarter and 21% year-to-date. Once again, we don't expect performance to improve materially in calendar 2010, or really until the economy recovery takes hold and positively impacts hiring and training within the accounting and finance professions.We are closely managing cost [ph] in the short term and recently completed the consolidation of a number of positions in the marketing and sales area. But at the same time, we're planning to cease the opportunity when the industry does rebound. Lastly, results of our Other Educational Services segment reflected top-line contributions to growth from Advanced Academics in DeVry Brazil. The segment delivered operating income of $700,000 in the second quarter, following the first quarter loss due to the seasonal flow of the segment.Shifting to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable security balance was $334 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $263 million last year. Cash flow from operations for the first half was $267 million versus $139 million last year, driven by our improved earnings and working capital.These strong cash results enabled us to continue to decrease our outstanding debt to $45 million, down from $155 million a year ago and $105 million last quarter, and also invest back in the business, as capital spending to the first half of the year was $62 million versus $25 million spent last year. The spending has been focused on Project Delta, which we believe will further enhance our ability to provide best-in-class service to our students, as well as on facility improvements within DeVry University and U.S. Education, an expansion within Ross University and Chamberlain College of Nursing. We're committed to investing in educational technology and capacity needed to serve our students, so total capital spending is still expected to exceed $100 million this fiscal year.Our net accounts receivable balance actually decreased to $135 million versus $138 million last year. In fact, if you exclude DeVry Brazil, our net receivable balance would've decreased by $7 million. Receivables per account within DeVry University were down compared to the higher balances last year during the conversion of our financial aid processing system, but they were also lower than our balances two years ago. While we had some issues initially, the new processing system is having a positive impact. So this is a good example of how our investments in new technology are paying off and improve customer service and productivity. Year-to-date, our bad debt rate increased slightly versus last year to 3.2%, driven by the U.S. Education and DeVry Brazil acquisitions. We have not experienced any deterioration with bad debt in our legacy operations, so our receivables per students are down and our bad debt rate is essentially unchanged. We see this as another marker of quality and would like to recognize the outstanding performance of our teams in managing this area, particularly during these tough economic times.Finally, during the quarter, we completed the execution of our second share repurchase program, buying back $50 million of common stock over the last year or about 1 million shares at an average cost of $40.67 per share. Our Board of Directors approved the third repurchase program in November of $50 million. We have not commenced this program yet since we have been in the close trading window. We plan to begin repurchasing once again when the window opens up later this week.So that concludes my overview of the very strong results for the first half of the year. We're obviously off to a tremendous start and are confident in our ability to deliver a strong top- and bottom-line results for the balance of the fiscal year, all driven by academic quality. As we've said in the past, our long-term financial objective is to deliver earnings per share growth of roughly 20% per year. Our strong first half performance puts us in a position to exceed this goal as we believe earnings will continue to grow in excess of 20% over the balance of this fiscal year.  Now let me turn the call back over to Daniel for some more color on the operating results."

Let me begin net operating review with our Business Technology and Management segment, which is DeVry University and it's Keller Graduate School of Management. And since we didn't have a conference call in December when we have reported the fall enrolment, I'd like to comment on the strong growth at DeVry University experienced during that period with new undergraduate enrolment of more than 19% and total undergraduate enrolment rising nearly 23%.  These results in our continued strong execution, position us well for the remainder of 2010. And it's important to note that we're seeing broad-based contributions at DeVry University, some online and on-site in both graduate and undergraduate, and across our business, technology and healthcare programs. This quarter, DeVry University continued to focus on its positioning as the career university. Over the coming months, we plan to hire additional career advisors beyond the 150 we already have in place. To further improve persistence, we're hiring more student coaches as we implement our innovative Student Central concept across our campus locations. Student Central brings all key services together in one place and proactively supports our students from the time they enroll to when they graduate. Other growth initiatives include our plans to open new locations in Glendale, Arizona and Houston, Texas in the next few months. At Keller Graduate School of Management, total course-takers in the November session increased more than 15.5% from a year ago. As part of our initiative to increase awareness at Keller, we'll be investing a bit more in the communications campaign. Our goal is to align Keller more closely with our student familiarity with traditional business schools and to reinforce Keller's high-quality reputation. We're very excited for this new campaign in the beginning of spring.Moving on to our Medical and Healthcare segment, at Chamberlain College of Nursing, enrolment in the fall increased 67% and we continue to invest in facilities to meet the huge demand for qualified nurses around the country. In addition to our newest campus in Jacksonville, that opened seven months ago, Chamberlain's new Chicago and Crystal City, Virginia locations are on pace to open this summer, pending approvals. And after 80 years, Chamberlain is also moving its St. Louis location to a brand-new building in nearby Maryland Heights. All four of these campuses are co-locations with DeVry University, pretty interesting. In addition, we're launching a new RN to MSN bridge program in July. This program will be part of Chamberlain's expanding online offerings, and it provides a great option for RNs, Registered Nurses, who want to earn a master's degree. And in line with our emphasis on doing well by doing good, Chamberlain's mission in November to Brazil was a great success, as Chamberlain partnered with DeVry Brazil to set up a local clinic in the city of Madalena. A second trip is happening this week and we plan on expanding the program to three trips a year, very proud of that. At U.S. Education, that's Apollo College and Western Career College, we continue to invest in new programs and to focus on integration and efficiency. During the quarter, we launched a physical therapy assistant program in Apollo Colleges Mesa, Arizona campus. We expect to bring this program to other campuses pending approvals, and we've hired new program directors to support that goal. Now that the integration of Apollo College and Western Career College, filling its final phase, we're focusing on expanding student enrollments both on-site and online, and we're also looking at other areas of value creation. As one example, we recently consolidated U.S. Education service centers in Phoenix and its accounting function in our Mission Viejo office that streamlines our operations and supports future expansion. Another example, we're also seeing efficiency through higher capacity utilization. You noticed that while we were very well-utilized in the mornings, the afternoon and evening classes were less so. So this led us to initiate a program aimed in helping students find the class time that work best with their schedule. The result has been much more evenly-dispersed classes in the afternoons and evenings and greater campus utilization.So now let me move to our Professional Education segment, where the economy continues to dramatically affect the accounting and finance fields that Becker serves. During this quarter, Becker's CPA group targeted a 0% financing initiative to help recent college graduates who are most affected by the current job market. The initial results of this program have been pretty promising and could be expanded once we have a chance to thoroughly review the program. In December, at Becker, we also signed an exclusive partnership with China Distance Educational Holdings Ltd. to distribute Becker's materials in China. This partnership offers great potential to expand our CPA courses in China and could eventually include our Stalla CFA program as well, a chartered financial analyst. While times are tough, it's tough for Becker's competitors, too. One key advantage for Becker is being part of a diversified organization that can support its long-term growth. Most of Becker's competitors are small and don't have this advantage, so we believe this positions Becker very well for when the accounting and finance fields start to [indiscernible]. And our final segment, Other Educational Services.  As we announced in Education Day, while we have been calling Fanor, we're now calling DeVry Brazil which includes three colleges. There is Fanor, there is Ruy Barbosa and Area1. Our people in Brazil see tremendous value in the DeVry name and are very excited about the change. We are also in the process of launching several new programs in high demand healthcare fields such as nursing, physiotherapy and nutrition. Classes should be available beginning next month.So to summarize, as you can see, our diversification strategy and our focus on investing in quality continue to lead to growth, strong student academic outcomes and another quarter of solid financial results. The investments we've talked about over the last couple of years are paying off. From time to time, we've heard feedback on occasion, let's say, to be effective, I think you should invest less and show more to your near-term margin, that kind of thing. What we're demonstrating here is that by investing in quality, we're getting great academic outcomes as well as growth and margin. In sum, “Quality Leads to Growth”. And so I'd like to close by thanking the 114,000 students across all DeVry schools. It's truly our privilege to help them achieve their career goals. And I'd also like to thank the 17,000 members of the DeVry family for their dedication to our students and for their vital role that they play in our success. And so with that, Joan, we're happy to take questions."

It really does speak to, not only the quality of the fundamental value proposition that students are receiving, but it takes a lot of processing and a lot of customer service to make that happen. So the systems investments that we've made have had a positive impact there. And so as we look forward to implementing Project Delta, we're looking forward to similar types of results. And maybe there was a little misunderstanding there -- and not the next couple of quarters, I'd say it's a little bit longer-term than that. It's several quarters in rolling out.

If you think of Project Delta, if going forward here beyond the piece that we mentioned earlier in two main areas, one is the student information system, the SIS; and the other is the constituent relationship management, the CRM. In some other institutes, they call that customer relationship management, but it's similar concept. Both of those areas have both back office, you might say, as well as student phasing or other constituent phasing components to them. So for example, in the student information system, you tend to think of that as a back office system that helps you keep of all your students and where they are in your program and everything like that. There's also a self-service registration component that flows out of that and that directly is available to students and helps improve service levels. Many students prefer to register themselves rather than talk to anybody, and we want to make that available. So that has both in-house and customization. Likewise, the constituent relationship management directly affects both sides of the coin there. So it's a big project, it's a big investment, we're very excited about the customer service improvements, the student service improvement, and the internal productivity and efficiency that we anticipate from that."

We think that it's good that there are many, many points of view represented there. And we support that we feel honored, actually, to have a representative and I'm one of the teams, and we're obviously engaged in both of the teams.  So that's part of the normal process that the department has run through over the course of many, many years. And it is a fluid process and we really can't speculate and won't speculate on the final outcome other than to say, based on many years of past experience and several rounds of this and we have the benefit of sharing Thomas Parrot's experience at our Education Day, we do expect that common sense will prevail. In terms of the debt flows and the value proposition, we feel very good about the value proposition that our students achieve at our schools, the DeVry schools. Let me just give you an example of that. Just consider a graduate of Chamberlain College of Nursing who would pay somewhere around $68,000 in tuition and fees and leaves school with debt of about $34,000 on average. Now he or she would typically make about $55,000 a year and that's starting, obviously, it goes up from there because they have excellent lifelong career prospects and that's all enabled by the education that they received at Chamberlain. So we've done an ROI, we've returned an educational investment analysis of that and it comes out to about 28% return on educational investment over the 30-year career. That is a very strong value proposition. I don't know about you, but other than DeVry, I don't have anything in my portfolio so I expect that kind of a return. So students and parents understand that and that's really what supports the value proposition across other schools."

And the reason is the statistics won't really change dramatically from period to period, but we spend a lot of staff time going through all of that, getting ready for that reporting. So it's not really worth it. So it's an increase to staff productivity and reduces the amount of collateral materials that are produced from each locations that are three times a year to one time a year.

And we feel that we built over the last couple of years a very, very strong function there of internal resources and external resources to assess potential mergers, acquisitions, to do very, very thorough due diligence and then to apply very focused acquisition integration once the school becomes part of the DeVry family. And so we feel very good about those resources, in our track record in this regard, and that we continue to look for acquisitions in the future. One of the things that I commented on recently in Education Day was over the last couple of years, we are sort of building the framework for the house. And now we largely built that, and the focus is shifting a little bit more to kind of filling in the framework that we built. So those are the kinds of acquisitions that we might see to continue filling out at the international framework, continue filling out at the pre-baccalaureate level and those kinds of things. In terms of an impact from the current discussions that are going on in negotiated rule-making process, I can't say that I've seen them have a significant impact one way or the other in our review of potential acquisitions."

But yes, we're building the identity, building the awareness of Keller. One of the things I think we talked about back at the Education Day was down the undergraduates side. DeVry University has quite a high awareness, and we need to work on its consideration. Whereas Keller, specifically the Graduate School of DeVry University, has -- when you know about it, you have very high consideration. It's just none of the people know about, so we need to increase the awareness. So that's the strategy there. In terms of some of the tools that we'd use to increase that awareness and identity, we would use a very -- because we know not a lot of new inventions under the sun here. We've used the same sorts of identity-building activities that traditional universities you might see, billboards or television ads or online ad. Certainly, the social media, social marketing is a newer area. And we are very well versed in the opportunities there. So those are all the kinds of opportunities that we have. One opportunity we don't have that some of the traditionals have, a big-time sports team. We can't pull that lever real hard.

And since we saw many of you at our Education Day in November and today's announcement doesn't include enrollment results, we'll make an effort to be brief this afternoon and get to your questions.So we're pleased to announce that the continued execution of our growth in diversification strategy and our focus on investing in academic quality has produced successful student outcomes and another quarter of strong financial results. In the increase that we saw in enrollments in December translated into exceptional revenue growth in the quarter, which drove margin improvement and record earnings. At the same time, we continued to invest in our programs and student services to drive future growth. At DeVry's home office, this quarter has been a busy one for us as we recently moved into our new offices in Downers Grove in Oak Brook, Illinois, and we moved out our data center to its new location as well. Our new home office is a co-location with the DeVry University Center and houses a classroom of the future. The new offices are designed to be open and collaborative with state-of-the-art amenities for our employees and are another part of our strategy to be the employer of choice in education and we'd like to invite you to come visit us when you can.I'd like to spend a few minutes here on our expectations for the rest of 2010 and beyond in the context of the overarching economic conditions that we're seeing. Because there certainly are some optimistic signs that the worst of this recession is behind us. But with the government announcement, for example, the 85,000 jobs were lost in December, it remains clear that meaningful economic recovery is not a foregoing conclusion here in 2010. As I outlined during our Education Day, we believe DeVry is well-positioned in both good and bad times.Our confidence is bolstered by two factors. But first, our operating philosophy namely that “Quality Leads to Growth”. At DeVry, our institutions educate students  for positions across a variety of industries, but they have one thing in common. Each provides high-quality programs and services to our students. And as we continue to invest in quality, academic outcomes improve. The continued success of our students drives enrolment and retention, which leads to financial growth, and this is true in both good times and in bad times. And we, in turn, put those earnings right back to work by investing them in the quality of our programs. A case in point, we're planning to invest over $100 million this year in capital expenditures on our programs, services and facilities. In today's world of state budget cuts and declining endowment, this investment is an example of the important role that private sector schools, like DeVry, are playing in today's educational system. And the second factor is our diversification strategy, which has us well-positioned to deliver consistent and sustainable growth, again, through both good and bad economic times. Some of our operations are co-cyclical, like Becker, which has been negatively affected by the weak economy's. At the same time, schools like those of U.S. Education are more countercyclical. And in addition, DeVry has schools like, such as Chamberlain College of Nursing and Ross University, that are entirely non-cyclical. In fact, DeVry is the only publicly-traded education provider that has a medical school or a veterinary school. So taken as a whole, the DeVry family of schools is best characterized as non-cyclical. And so given our philosophy of quality leads to growth, and our ability to mitigate risks through our diverse family of schools, I believe we'll continue to experience sustainable growth when the economy recovers.And just an illustration of this, I'd like to share with you how our largest school, DeVry University, grew during the strongest economic recovery in the postwar era, the 90s. And for this, please refer to the chart that you'll find in today's press release. Because if you take a look at that chart, you'll see that at the end of the recession in 1992 and moving forward for 10 years in 2001, the job market improved with unemployment falling from a high of 7.4%, down to 4.2% over that period. And taking a look at DeVry University's total enrolment over that same period, our enrolment continued to grow, in fact, the rate of growth increased. And keep in mind that that was in the 90s, when we weren't as diversified as we are today. I think a lot of people think we're more countercyclical than we really are, and this example demonstrates that we are able to grow in an economic recovery.And so with that introduction, let me turn the call over to Rick for the financial results."
27536,82628612,47025,"DeVry, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jan-26-2010",2010-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Adtalem Global Education Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Daniel, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to take the next several minutes to highlight our strong financial performance for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2010. I'm pleased and encouraged to see the very positive impact from ou",1376,"Thanks, Daniel, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to take the next several minutes to highlight our strong financial performance for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2010. I'm pleased and encouraged to see the very positive impact from our investments in academic quality and customer service, which have resulted in strong revenue growth, along with significantly-improved margins and profitability. Record quarterly revenue of $473 million was up about 28% versus prior year. This is primarily organic growth as we've anniversaried the U.S. Education acquisition in September, with revenues still up 25% in the quarter, excluding our more recent acquisition of DeVry Brazil. Revenue to the first half of the fiscal year was up about 34% and 25% when you exclude both DeVry Brazil and U.S. Education.Net income and earnings per share were both up about 69% in the quarter and 64% year-to-date. Earnings per share were $1 in the quarter, marking the first time we've broken through the dollar threshold. It's also interesting to note that our earnings per share were only $0.61 for the entire year in fiscal 2006, just 3.5 years ago. The pretax income margin for the first half was 21%, up 470 basis points versus the 16.3% margin achieved a year ago. Now fiscal 2010 is really shaping up to be a breakthrough year, and we expect to significantly surpass our historical peak margin of 17.1% this year. These results were driven by the excellent enrolment growth and retention results across our schools, while our Professional Education segment continues to be negatively impacted by the economy. The financials reflect the power of operating leverage, which is helping drive the significant profitability improvement. For your reference, second quarter results include expense related to share-based payments of approximately $2.1 million pretax or $1.8 million net of tax, a bit higher than last year. Our overall effective tax rate was 33.6% in the quarter and 32.9% year-to-date, up from the 30.4% rate for full-year fiscal 2009, primarily due to the continued increase in domestic source income.For a perspective, we're now paying over $100 million in federal and state taxes on an annualized basis. Cost of educational service expense increased by 20% versus prior year in the quarter. And student services and administrative expense increased by 17%, both grew on a double-digit rate, but less than the revenue growth with or without the acquisitions. We continue to make prudent, targeted investments while still delivering leverage and efficiencies.With that, as a highlight, let me walk you through some of the operating segment results, which are further detailed in our earnings release. First, the Business, Technology, and Management Segment achieved a very strong top- and bottom-line results. Revenue was up 26% versus prior year in the quarter and 25% year-to-date, driven by the strong enrolment growth and increased retention driven by our focus on student services. The segment operating income of $78 million in the quarter and $134 million year-to-date more than doubled versus prior year. This improvement was driven by revenue growth and a resulting operating leverage. The segment margin was 24.9% in the quarter and 22.5% year-to-date. While we're continuing to make investments to support academic quality and customer service, our incremental earnings flow through for the segment has been over 60% year-to-date. This shows the power of operating leverage on our cost base from the very strong top-line growth. Within the Medical and Healthcare segment, revenue was up 28% in the quarter, driven by the enrolment growth and pricing at Ross University and Chamberlain College of Nursing, along with continued good results at Apollo College and Western Career College. Second quarter operating income for this segment of $31.2 million was up 17% versus last year. The margin was a bit lower than prior year, driven by business mix within the segment, with the addition of U.S. Education and very strong growth at Chamberlain, both which have lower margins than Ross University.Our Professional Education segment results continue to reflect the impact of the soft economy on the accounting and finance professions. Revenue was down 6.3% in the quarter and down 4.6% year-to-date versus last year. Operating income was down about 28% in the quarter and 21% year-to-date. Once again, we don't expect performance to improve materially in calendar 2010, or really until the economy recovery takes hold and positively impacts hiring and training within the accounting and finance professions.We are closely managing cost [ph] in the short term and recently completed the consolidation of a number of positions in the marketing and sales area. But at the same time, we're planning to cease the opportunity when the industry does rebound. Lastly, results of our Other Educational Services segment reflected top-line contributions to growth from Advanced Academics in DeVry Brazil. The segment delivered operating income of $700,000 in the second quarter, following the first quarter loss due to the seasonal flow of the segment.Shifting to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable security balance was $334 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $263 million last year. Cash flow from operations for the first half was $267 million versus $139 million last year, driven by our improved earnings and working capital.These strong cash results enabled us to continue to decrease our outstanding debt to $45 million, down from $155 million a year ago and $105 million last quarter, and also invest back in the business, as capital spending to the first half of the year was $62 million versus $25 million spent last year. The spending has been focused on Project Delta, which we believe will further enhance our ability to provide best-in-class service to our students, as well as on facility improvements within DeVry University and U.S. Education, an expansion within Ross University and Chamberlain College of Nursing. We're committed to investing in educational technology and capacity needed to serve our students, so total capital spending is still expected to exceed $100 million this fiscal year.Our net accounts receivable balance actually decreased to $135 million versus $138 million last year. In fact, if you exclude DeVry Brazil, our net receivable balance would've decreased by $7 million. Receivables per account within DeVry University were down compared to the higher balances last year during the conversion of our financial aid processing system, but they were also lower than our balances two years ago. While we had some issues initially, the new processing system is having a positive impact. So this is a good example of how our investments in new technology are paying off and improve customer service and productivity. Year-to-date, our bad debt rate increased slightly versus last year to 3.2%, driven by the U.S. Education and DeVry Brazil acquisitions. We have not experienced any deterioration with bad debt in our legacy operations, so our receivables per students are down and our bad debt rate is essentially unchanged. We see this as another marker of quality and would like to recognize the outstanding performance of our teams in managing this area, particularly during these tough economic times.Finally, during the quarter, we completed the execution of our second share repurchase program, buying back $50 million of common stock over the last year or about 1 million shares at an average cost of $40.67 per share. Our Board of Directors approved the third repurchase program in November of $50 million. We have not commenced this program yet since we have been in the close trading window. We plan to begin repurchasing once again when the window opens up later this week.So that concludes my overview of the very strong results for the first half of the year. We're obviously off to a tremendous start and are confident in our ability to deliver a strong top- and bottom-line results for the balance of the fiscal year, all driven by academic quality. As we've said in the past, our long-term financial objective is to deliver earnings per share growth of roughly 20% per year. Our strong first half performance puts us in a position to exceed this goal as we believe earnings will continue to grow in excess of 20% over the balance of this fiscal year.  Now let me turn the call back over to Daniel for some more color on the operating results."

Let me begin net operating review with our Business Technology and Management segment, which is DeVry University and it's Keller Graduate School of Management. And since we didn't have a conference call in December when we have reported the fall enrolment, I'd like to comment on the strong growth at DeVry University experienced during that period with new undergraduate enrolment of more than 19% and total undergraduate enrolment rising nearly 23%.  These results in our continued strong execution, position us well for the remainder of 2010. And it's important to note that we're seeing broad-based contributions at DeVry University, some online and on-site in both graduate and undergraduate, and across our business, technology and healthcare programs. This quarter, DeVry University continued to focus on its positioning as the career university. Over the coming months, we plan to hire additional career advisors beyond the 150 we already have in place. To further improve persistence, we're hiring more student coaches as we implement our innovative Student Central concept across our campus locations. Student Central brings all key services together in one place and proactively supports our students from the time they enroll to when they graduate. Other growth initiatives include our plans to open new locations in Glendale, Arizona and Houston, Texas in the next few months. At Keller Graduate School of Management, total course-takers in the November session increased more than 15.5% from a year ago. As part of our initiative to increase awareness at Keller, we'll be investing a bit more in the communications campaign. Our goal is to align Keller more closely with our student familiarity with traditional business schools and to reinforce Keller's high-quality reputation. We're very excited for this new campaign in the beginning of spring.Moving on to our Medical and Healthcare segment, at Chamberlain College of Nursing, enrolment in the fall increased 67% and we continue to invest in facilities to meet the huge demand for qualified nurses around the country. In addition to our newest campus in Jacksonville, that opened seven months ago, Chamberlain's new Chicago and Crystal City, Virginia locations are on pace to open this summer, pending approvals. And after 80 years, Chamberlain is also moving its St. Louis location to a brand-new building in nearby Maryland Heights. All four of these campuses are co-locations with DeVry University, pretty interesting. In addition, we're launching a new RN to MSN bridge program in July. This program will be part of Chamberlain's expanding online offerings, and it provides a great option for RNs, Registered Nurses, who want to earn a master's degree. And in line with our emphasis on doing well by doing good, Chamberlain's mission in November to Brazil was a great success, as Chamberlain partnered with DeVry Brazil to set up a local clinic in the city of Madalena. A second trip is happening this week and we plan on expanding the program to three trips a year, very proud of that. At U.S. Education, that's Apollo College and Western Career College, we continue to invest in new programs and to focus on integration and efficiency. During the quarter, we launched a physical therapy assistant program in Apollo Colleges Mesa, Arizona campus. We expect to bring this program to other campuses pending approvals, and we've hired new program directors to support that goal. Now that the integration of Apollo College and Western Career College, filling its final phase, we're focusing on expanding student enrollments both on-site and online, and we're also looking at other areas of value creation. As one example, we recently consolidated U.S. Education service centers in Phoenix and its accounting function in our Mission Viejo office that streamlines our operations and supports future expansion. Another example, we're also seeing efficiency through higher capacity utilization. You noticed that while we were very well-utilized in the mornings, the afternoon and evening classes were less so. So this led us to initiate a program aimed in helping students find the class time that work best with their schedule. The result has been much more evenly-dispersed classes in the afternoons and evenings and greater campus utilization.So now let me move to our Professional Education segment, where the economy continues to dramatically affect the accounting and finance fields that Becker serves. During this quarter, Becker's CPA group targeted a 0% financing initiative to help recent college graduates who are most affected by the current job market. The initial results of this program have been pretty promising and could be expanded once we have a chance to thoroughly review the program. In December, at Becker, we also signed an exclusive partnership with China Distance Educational Holdings Ltd. to distribute Becker's materials in China. This partnership offers great potential to expand our CPA courses in China and could eventually include our Stalla CFA program as well, a chartered financial analyst. While times are tough, it's tough for Becker's competitors, too. One key advantage for Becker is being part of a diversified organization that can support its long-term growth. Most of Becker's competitors are small and don't have this advantage, so we believe this positions Becker very well for when the accounting and finance fields start to [indiscernible]. And our final segment, Other Educational Services.  As we announced in Education Day, while we have been calling Fanor, we're now calling DeVry Brazil which includes three colleges. There is Fanor, there is Ruy Barbosa and Area1. Our people in Brazil see tremendous value in the DeVry name and are very excited about the change. We are also in the process of launching several new programs in high demand healthcare fields such as nursing, physiotherapy and nutrition. Classes should be available beginning next month.So to summarize, as you can see, our diversification strategy and our focus on investing in quality continue to lead to growth, strong student academic outcomes and another quarter of solid financial results. The investments we've talked about over the last couple of years are paying off. From time to time, we've heard feedback on occasion, let's say, to be effective, I think you should invest less and show more to your near-term margin, that kind of thing. What we're demonstrating here is that by investing in quality, we're getting great academic outcomes as well as growth and margin. In sum, “Quality Leads to Growth”. And so I'd like to close by thanking the 114,000 students across all DeVry schools. It's truly our privilege to help them achieve their career goals. And I'd also like to thank the 17,000 members of the DeVry family for their dedication to our students and for their vital role that they play in our success. And so with that, Joan, we're happy to take questions."

So the systems investments that we've made have had a positive impact there. And so as we look forward to implementing Project Delta, we're looking forward to similar types of results.

If you think of Project Delta, if going forward here beyond the piece that we mentioned earlier in two main areas, one is the student information system, the SIS; and the other is the constituent relationship management, the CRM. In some other institutes, they call that customer relationship management, but it's similar concept. Both of those areas have both back office, you might say, as well as student phasing or other constituent phasing components to them. So for example, in the student information system, you tend to think of that as a back office system that helps you keep of all your students and where they are in your program and everything like that. There's also a self-service registration component that flows out of that and that directly is available to students and helps improve service levels. Many students prefer to register themselves rather than talk to anybody, and we want to make that available. So that has both in-house and customization.

We think that it's good that there are many, many points of view represented there. And we support that we feel honored, actually, to have a representative and I'm one of the teams, and we're obviously engaged in both of the teams.  So that's part of the normal process that the department has run through over the course of many, many years. And it is a fluid process and we really can't speculate and won't speculate on the final outcome other than to say, based on many years of past experience and several rounds of this and we have the benefit of sharing Thomas Parrot's experience at our Education Day, we do expect that common sense will prevail. In terms of the debt flows and the value proposition, we feel very good about the value proposition that our students achieve at our schools, the DeVry schools. Let me just give you an example of that. Just consider a graduate of Chamberlain College of Nursing who would pay somewhere around $68,000 in tuition and fees and leaves school with debt of about $34,000 on average. Now he or she would typically make about $55,000 a year and that's starting, obviously, it goes up from there because they have excellent lifelong career prospects and that's all enabled by the education that they received at Chamberlain. So we've done an ROI, we've returned an educational investment analysis of that and it comes out to about 28% return on educational investment over the 30-year career. That is a very strong value proposition. I don't know about you, but other than DeVry, I don't have anything in my portfolio so I expect that kind of a return. So students and parents understand that and that's really what supports the value proposition across other schools."

Whereas Keller, specifically the Graduate School of DeVry University, has -- when you know about it, you have very high consideration. It's just none of the people know about, so we need to increase the awareness. So that's the strategy there. In terms of some of the tools that we'd use to increase that awareness and identity, we would use a very -- because we know not a lot of new inventions under the sun here. We've used the same sorts of identity-building activities that traditional universities you might see, billboards or television ads or online ad.

And since we saw many of you at our Education Day in November and today's announcement doesn't include enrollment results, we'll make an effort to be brief this afternoon and get to your questions.So we're pleased to announce that the continued execution of our growth in diversification strategy and our focus on investing in academic quality has produced successful student outcomes and another quarter of strong financial results. In the increase that we saw in enrollments in December translated into exceptional revenue growth in the quarter, which drove margin improvement and record earnings. At the same time, we continued to invest in our programs and student services to drive future growth. At DeVry's home office, this quarter has been a busy one for us as we recently moved into our new offices in Downers Grove in Oak Brook, Illinois, and we moved out our data center to its new location as well. Our new home office is a co-location with the DeVry University Center and houses a classroom of the future. The new offices are designed to be open and collaborative with state-of-the-art amenities for our employees and are another part of our strategy to be the employer of choice in education and we'd like to invite you to come visit us when you can.I'd like to spend a few minutes here on our expectations for the rest of 2010 and beyond in the context of the overarching economic conditions that we're seeing. Because there certainly are some optimistic signs that the worst of this recession is behind us. But with the government announcement, for example, the 85,000 jobs were lost in December, it remains clear that meaningful economic recovery is not a foregoing conclusion here in 2010. As I outlined during our Education Day, we believe DeVry is well-positioned in both good and bad times.Our confidence is bolstered by two factors. But first, our operating philosophy namely that “Quality Leads to Growth”. At DeVry, our institutions educate students  for positions across a variety of industries, but they have one thing in common. Each provides high-quality programs and services to our students. And as we continue to invest in quality, academic outcomes improve. The continued success of our students drives enrollment and retention, which leads to financial growth, and this is true in both good times and in bad times. And we, in turn, put those earnings right back to work by investing them in the quality of our programs. A case in point, we're planning to invest over $100 million this year in capital expenditures on our programs, services and facilities. In today's world of state budget cuts and declining endowment, this investment is an example of the important role that private sector schools, like DeVry, are playing in today's educational system. And the second factor is our diversification strategy, which has us well-positioned to deliver consistent and sustainable growth, again, through both good and bad economic times. Some of our operations are co-cyclical, like Becker, which has been negatively affected by the weak economy's. At the same time, schools like those of U.S. Education are more countercyclical. And in addition, DeVry has schools like, such as Chamberlain College of Nursing and Ross University, that are entirely non-cyclical. In fact, DeVry is the only publicly-traded education provider that has a medical school or a veterinary school. So taken as a whole, the DeVry family of schools is best characterized as non-cyclical. And so given our philosophy of quality leads to growth, and our ability to mitigate risks through our diverse family of schools, I believe we'll continue to experience sustainable growth when the economy recovers.And just an illustration of this, I'd like to share with you how our largest school, DeVry University, grew during the strongest economic recovery in the postwar era, the 90s. And for this, please refer to the chart that you'll find in today's press release. Because if you take a look at that chart, you'll see that at the end of the recession in 1992 and moving forward for 10 years in 2001, the job market improved with unemployment falling from a high of 7.4%, down to 4.2% over that period. And taking a look at DeVry University's total enrollment over that same period, our enrollment continued to grow, in fact, the rate of growth increased. And keep in mind that that was in the 90s, when we weren't as diversified as we are today. I think a lot of people think we're more countercyclical than we really are, and this example demonstrates that we are able to grow in an economic recovery. And so with that introduction, let me turn the call over to Rick for the financial results."
27536,82628612,47691,"DeVry, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jan-26-2010",2010-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Adtalem Global Education Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Daniel, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to take the next several minutes to highlight our strong financial performance for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2010. I'm pleased and encouraged to see the very positive impact from ou",1380,"Thanks, Daniel, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to take the next several minutes to highlight our strong financial performance for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2010. I'm pleased and encouraged to see the very positive impact from our investments in academic quality and customer service, which have resulted in strong revenue growth, along with significantly-improved margins and profitability. Record quarterly revenue of $473 million was up about 28% versus prior year. This is primarily organic growth as we've anniversaried the U.S. Education acquisition in September, with revenues still up 25% in the quarter, excluding our more recent acquisition of DeVry Brazil. Revenue to the first half of the fiscal year was up about 34% and 25% when you exclude both DeVry Brazil and U.S. Education.Net income and earnings per share were both up about 69% in the quarter and 64% year-to-date. Earnings per share were $1 in the quarter, marking the first time we've broken through the dollar threshold. It's also interesting to note that our earnings per share were only $0.61 for the entire year in fiscal 2006, just 3.5 years ago. The pretax income margin for the first half was 21%, up 470 basis points versus the 16.3% margin achieved a year ago. Now fiscal 2010 is really shaping up to be a breakthrough year, and we expect to significantly surpass our historical peak margin of 17.1% this year. These results were driven by the excellent enrollment growth and retention results across our schools, while our Professional Education segment continues to be negatively impacted by the economy. The financials reflect the power of operating leverage, which is helping drive the significant profitability improvement. For your reference, second quarter results include expense related to share-based payments of approximately $2.1 million pretax or $1.8 million net of tax, a bit higher than last year. Our overall effective tax rate was 33.6% in the quarter and 32.9% year-to-date, up from the 30.4% rate for full-year fiscal 2009, primarily due to the continued increase in domestic source income.For a perspective, we're now paying over $100 million in federal and state taxes on an annualized basis. Cost of educational service expense increased by 20% versus prior year in the quarter. And student services and administrative expense increased by 17%, both grew on a double-digit rate, but less than the revenue growth with or without the acquisitions. We continue to make prudent, targeted investments while still delivering leverage and efficiencies.With that, as a highlight, let me walk you through some of the operating segment results, which are further detailed in our earnings release. First, the Business, Technology, and Management Segment achieved a very strong top- and bottom-line results. Revenue was up 26% versus prior year in the quarter and 25% year-to-date, driven by the strong enrollment growth and increased retention driven by our focus on student services. The segment operating income of $78 million in the quarter and $134 million year-to-date more than doubled versus prior year. This improvement was driven by revenue growth and a resulting operating leverage. The segment margin was 24.9% in the quarter and 22.5% year-to-date. While we're continuing to make investments to support academic quality and customer service, our incremental earnings flow through for the segment has been over 60% year-to-date. This shows the power of operating leverage on our cost base from the very strong top-line growth. Within the Medical and Healthcare segment, revenue was up 28% in the quarter, driven by the enrollment growth and pricing at Ross University and Chamberlain College of Nursing, along with continued good results at Apollo College and Western Career College. Second quarter operating income for the segment of $31.2 million was up 17% versus last year. The margin was a bit lower than prior year driven by business mix within the segment with the addition of U.S. Education and very strong growth at Chamberlain, both which have lower margins than Ross University.Our Professional Education segment results continue to reflect the impact of the soft economy on the accounting and finance professions. Revenue was down 6.3% in the quarter and down 4.6% year-to-date versus last year. Operating income was down about 28% in the quarter and 21% year-to-date. Once again, we don't expect performance to improve materially in calendar 2010, or really until the economy recovery takes hold and positively impacts hiring and training within the accounting and finance professions.We are closely managing costs in the short term and recently completed the consolidation of a number of positions in the marketing and sales area. But at the same time, we're planning to cease the opportunity when the industry does rebound. Lastly, results of our Other Educational Services segment reflect the top line contributions to growth from Advanced Academics in DeVry Brazil. The segment delivered operating income of $700,000 in the second quarter following the first quarter loss due to the seasonal flow of the segment.Shifting to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable security balance was $334 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $263 million last year. Cash flow from operations for the first half was $267 million versus $139 million last year, driven by our improved earnings and working capital.These strong cash results enable us to continue to decrease our outstanding debt to $45 million, down from $155 million a year ago and $105 million last quarter and also invest back in the business as capital spending to the first half of the year was $62 million versus $25 million spent last year. The spending has been focused on Project Delta, which we believe will further enhance our ability to provide best-in-class service to our students. As well as on facility improvements within DeVry University and U.S. Education, an expansion within Ross University and Chamberlain College of Nursing. We're committed to investing in educational technology and capacity needed to serve our students, so total capital spending is still expected to exceed $100 million this fiscal year.Our net accounts receivable balance actually decreased to $135 million versus a $138 million last year. In fact, if you exclude DeVry Brazil, our net receivable balance would have decreased by $7 million. Receivables per account within DeVry University were down compared to the higher balances last year during the conversion of our financial aid processing system, but they were also lower than our balances two years ago. While we had some issues initially, the new processing system is having a positive impact. So this is a good example of how our investments in new technology are paying off and improve customer service and productivity. Year-to-date, our bad debt rate increased slightly versus last year to 3.2%, driven by the U.S. Education and DeVry Brazil acquisitions. We have not experienced any deterioration with bad debt in our legacy operations. So our receivables per students are down and our bad debt rate is essentially unchanged. We see this as another marker of quality and would like to recognize the outstanding performance of our teams in managing this area, particularly during these tough economic times.Finally, during the quarter we completed the execution of our second share repurchase program, buying back $50 million of common stock over the last year or about 1 million shares at an average cost of $48.67 per share. Our Board of Directors approved the third repurchase program in November of $50 million. We have not commenced this program yet since we have been in the close trading window, but plan to begin repurchasing once again when the window opens up later this week.So that concludes my overview of the very strong results for the first half of the year. We're obviously off to a tremendous start and are confident in our ability to deliver a strong top and bottom line results for the balance of the fiscal year, all driven by academic quality. As we've said in the past, our long-term financial objective is to deliver earnings per share growth of roughly 20% per year. Our strong first half performance puts us in a position to exceed this goal as we believe earnings will continue to grow in excess of 20% over the balance of this fiscal year. Now let me turn the call back over to Daniel for some more color on the operating results."

Let me begin net operating review with our Business Technology and Management segment, which is DeVry University and is Keller Graduate School of Management. And since we didn't have a conference call in December when we have reported the fall enrollment, I'd like to comment on the strong growth that DeVry University experienced during that period with new undergraduate enrollment of more than 19% and total undergraduate enrollment rising nearly 23%.These results and our continued strong execution position us well for the remainder of 2010. And it's important to note that we're seeing broad-based contributions at DeVry University from online and on-site in both graduate and undergraduate and across our business, technology and healthcare program. This quarter, DeVry University continued to focus on its positioning as the career university. Over the coming months, we plan to hire additional career advisors beyond the 150 we already have in place. To further improve persistence, we're hiring more student coaches as we implement our innovative Student Central concept across our campus location. Student Central brings all key services together in one place and proactively supports our students from the time they enroll to when they graduate. Other growth initiatives include our plans to open new locations in Glendale, Arizona and Houston, Texas in the next few months. At Keller Graduate School of Management, total coursetakers in the November session increased more than 16.5% from a year ago. As part of our initiative to increase awareness at Keller, we'll be investing a bit more in the communications campaign. Our goal is to align Keller more closely with our student familiarity with traditional business schools and to reinforce Keller's high-quality reputation. We're very excited for this new campaign and it begins in the spring.Moving on to our Medical and Healthcare segment, at Chamberlain College of Nursing, enrollment in the fall increased 67% and we continue to invest in facilities to meet the huge demand for qualified nurses around the country. In addition to our newest campus in Jacksonville that opened seven months ago, Chamberlain's new Chicago and Crystal City, Virginia locations are on pace to open this summer, pending approvals. And after 80 years, Chamberlain is also moving its St. Louis location to a brand-new building in nearby Maryland Heights. All four of these campuses are co-locations with DeVry University, pretty interesting. In addition, we're launching a new RN to MSN bridge program in July. This program will be part of Chamberlain's expanding online offerings, and it provides a great option for RNs, Registered Nurses, who want to earn a master's degree. And in line with our emphasis on doing well by doing good, Chamberlain's mission in November to Brazil was a great success as Chamberlain partnered with DeVry Brazil to set up a local clinic in the city of Madalena. A second trip is happening this week and we plan on expanding the program to three trips a year, very proud of that. At U.S. Education, that's Apollo College and Western Career College, we continue to invest in new programs and to focus on integration and efficiency. During the quarter, we launched a Physical Therapy Assistant program in Apollo College's Mesa, Arizona campus. We expect to bring this program to other campuses pending approval and we've hired new program directors to support that goal. Now that the integration of Apollo College and Western Career College doing its final phase, we're focusing on expanding student enrollments both on-site and online, and we're also looking at other areas of value creation. As one example, we recently consolidated U.S. Education service centers in Phoenix and its accounting function in our Mission Viejo office that streamlines our operations and supports future expansion. Another example, we're also seeing efficiency through higher capacity utilization. You notice that while we were very well utilized in the mornings, the afternoon and evening classes were less so. So this led us to initiate a program aimed in helping students find the class time that work best with their schedule. The result has been much more evenly dispersed classes in the afternoons and evenings and greater campus utilization.So now let me move to our Professional Education segment, where the economy continues to dramatically affect the accounting and finance fields that Becker serves. During this quarter, Becker's CPA group piloted a 0% financing initiative to help recent college graduates who are most affected by the current job market. The initial results of this program have been pretty promising and could be expanded once we have a chance to thoroughly review the program. In December, at Becker we also signed an exclusive partnership with China Distance Educational Holdings Ltd. to distribute Becker's materials in China. This partnership offers great potential to expand our CPA courses in China and could eventually include our Stalla CFA program as well, a chartered financial analyst. While times are tough, it's tough for Becker's competitors, too. One key advantage for Becker is being part of a diversified organization that can support its long-term growth. Most of Becker's competitors are small and don't have this advantage, so we believe this positions Becker very well for when the accounting and finance fields start to [indiscernible]. And our final segment, Other Educational Services.  As we announced in Education Day, what we have been calling Fanor, we're now calling DeVry Brazil which includes three colleges. There is Fanor, there is Ruy Barbosa and Area 1. Our people in Brazil see tremendous value in the DeVry name and are very excited about the change. We're also in the process of launching several new programs in high demand healthcare fields such as nursing, physiotherapy and nutrition. Classes should be available beginning next month.So to summarize, as you can see, our diversification strategy and our focus on investing in quality continue to lead to growth, strong student academic outcomes and another quarter of solid financial results. The investments we've talked about over the last couple of years are paying off. From time to time, we've heard feedback on occasion, let's say, to be effective, I think you should invest less and show more to your near-term margin, that kind of thing. What we're demonstrating here is that by investing in quality, we're getting great academic outcomes as well as growth and margin. In sum, “Quality Leads to Growth”. And so I'd like to close by thanking the 114,000 students across all DeVry schools. It's truly our privilege to help them achieve their career goals. And I'd also like to thank the 17,000 members of the DeVry family for their dedication to our students and for their vital role that they play in our success. And so with that, Joan, we're happy to take questions."

So, no, we haven't seen any impact on the operations because it hasn't launched. And Rick was referring to a part of our overall systems, technology investment, which was in the student finance area that we have seen have a positive impact, and to be able to report that our accounts receivable was actually down in this economy. It really does speak to, not only the quality of the fundamental value proposition that students are receiving, but it takes a lot of processing and a lot of customer service to make that happen. So the systems investments that we've made have had a positive impact there. And so as we look forward to implementing Project Delta, we're looking forward to similar types of results. And maybe there was a little misunderstanding there -- and not the next couple of quarters, I'd say it's a little bit longer-term than that. It's several quarters in rolling out. And the thing that I can assure you is that we're not going to roll any system out until it's ready."

If you think of Project Delta, if going forward here beyond the piece that we mentioned earlier in two main areas, one is the student information system, the SIS; and the other is the constituent relationship management, the CRM. In some other institutes, they call that customer relationship management, but it's similar concept. Both of those areas have both back office, you might say, as well as student phasing or other constituent phasing components to them. So for example, in the student information system, you tend to think of that as a back office system that helps you keep of all your students and where they are in your program and everything like that. There's also a self-service registration component that flows out of that and that directly is available to students and helps improve service levels. Many students prefer to register themselves rather than talk to anybody, and we want to make that available. So that has both in-house and customization. Likewise, the constituent relationship management directly affects both sides of the coin there. So it's a big project, it's a big investment, we're very excited about the customer service improvements, the student service improvement, and the internal productivity and efficiency that we anticipate from that."

We think that it's good that there are many, many points of view represented there. And we support that we feel honored, actually, to have a representative and I'm one of the teams, and we're obviously engaged in both of the teams.  So that's part of the normal process that the department has run through over the course of many, many years. And it is a fluid process and we really can't speculate and won't speculate on the final outcome other than to say, based on many years of past experience and several rounds of this and we have the benefit of sharing Thomas Parrot's experience at our Education Day, we do expect that common sense will prevail. In terms of the debt flows and the value proposition, we feel very good about the value proposition that our students achieve at our schools, the DeVry schools. Let me just give you an example of that. Just consider a graduate of Chamberlain College of Nursing who would pay somewhere around $68,000 in tuition and fees and leaves school with debt of about $34,000 on average. Now he or she would typically make about $55,000 a year and that's starting, obviously, it goes up from there because they have excellent lifelong career prospects and that's all enabled by the education that they received at Chamberlain. So we've done an ROI, we've returned an educational investment analysis of that and it comes out to about 28% return on educational investment over the 30-year career. That is a very strong value proposition. I don't know about you, but other than DeVry, I don't have anything in my portfolio so I expect that kind of a return. So students and parents understand that and that's really what supports the value proposition across other schools."

And we certainly think very highly of our curriculum and of our professors. But if you have that, you don't have the supporting student services to surround the classroom and support the student then especially with working adults students or other non-traditional students in the same deposit. You need both in order to support those students and help them to succeed, and persist and graduate. And that's why we are investing in areas like Student Central, which provides the kinds of support services in a very clear, easy-to-access kind of format for our students, and many other sort of curriculum changes and academic changes as well to keep that focus. So when we talk about investments, this is one of the most important areas that we're constantly looking for ideas from our professors and from our service people. Give us ideas, give us projects, so we can pile the capacity to invest in. Those are the highest-return projects that we can invest in.

It's just none of the people know about, so we need to increase the awareness. So that's the strategy there. In terms of some of the tools that we'd use to increase that awareness and identity, we would use a very -- because we know not a lot of new inventions under the sun here.

We're pleased to announce another quarter of strong performance, driven by the continued execution of our diversification strategy and by our operating philosophy. And namely, that is that ""Quality Leads to Growth"". During the quarter, total undergraduate enrolment for DeVry University was up nearly 26% from the year-ago period, to a record of 66,909 students. These results flow directly from the investments we’ve made and the quality of our programs and services.
And we’re being careful stewards of our resources. An example of that is co-location. In today's press release, we highlighted two co-locations between DeVry University and Chamberlain College of Nursing in Crystal City, Virginia and in Chicago. These co-locations will further optimize utilization at those existing facilities and it’ll enhance academic student experience. 
Now if there was a theme this quarter, it would be healthcare. First of all, of course, we saw the passage of the new healthcare reform legislation. This law potentially means that 32 million more Americans will have health insurance by 2014.
This will put even more demand on an already strained system. Our schools are well positioned to educate the professionals who will be serving America's growing healthcare needs into the future. And Chamberlain College of Nursing is a great example of how we’ll help to meet this demand. Because even before this law was signed, it was forecasted that we would be 1 million nurses short by the end of this decade. And yet our nation's nursing schools are turning away almost 100,000 qualified applicants each and every year because there aren't enough seats to meet the demand. So Chamberlain is a great example of how DeVry and the private sector as a whole are meeting the capacity needs that we have. 
And likewise, in the world of medical education, it’s expected that we'll be 125,000 physicians short within 15 years. Ross University School of Medicine is helping to fulfill this critical need. And there's also a growing shortage of ancillary care and allied health professionals. And recently we made a change that we think paves the way to significantly meet the needs of these professionals as well because, during this quarter, we announced the name change of the two schools that make up U.S. Education: Western Career College and Apollo College. 
On July 1, the two will become Carrington College. It will be Carrington College California and Carrington College, respectively. And so taken together our medical and healthcare group is serving nearly 24,000 students and we’re a leading educator at all levels of healthcare, from the medical assistant to the nurse to the physician.
As millions of Americans become insured under healthcare reform, we expect to play an important role in meeting the need for healthcare professionals in this country. So with that brief introduction, let me turn the call over to Rick and we’ll go through the financial results."

We once again delivered strong revenue and earnings results this quarter, while making investments in academic quality.

We once again delivered strong revenue and earnings results this quarter, while making investments in academic quality. Our strong revenue growth continued to be a key source of operating leverage in improved margins and profitably. 
Record quarterly revenue of $504 million was up about 29% versus prior year, with revenues still up 27%, excluding our acquisition of DeVry Brazil at April. Year-to-date revenue was up 32% and 26% when you exclude the impact of both DeVry Brazil and U.S. Education, which became part of DeVry in September of 2008.
Net income and earnings per share were both up about 60% in the quarter versus prior year on a reported basis, and up 51% after excluding a charge for a lease buyout from last year's results. Year-to-date earnings were up 63% on a reported basis and 59%, excluding last year's discrete item.
Pretax income margins for the first nine months was 22.1%, up 450 basis points versus the 17.6% margin achieved a year ago. We're obviously on our way to significantly surpass our historical full year peak margin of 17.1% this year and should exceed 20% by the end of the year as well. 
For your reference, third quarter results include expense related to share-based payments of approximately $2.2 million pretax or $1.8 million net of tax, a bit higher than last year. And our overall effective tax rate was 33.8% in the quarter and 33.3% year-to-date, up from our 30.4% rate for full fiscal year 2009, primarily due to the continued increase in domestic source income. 
Cost of Educational Services expense in the quarter increased by about 20% versus prior year, excluding last year's real estate charge and student service and administrative expense increased by 22%, both growing at double-digit rates, but less than revenue growth, with or without the acquisitions.
We continue to make prudent, targeted investments while still delivering leverage and efficiencies. With that let me now walk you through some of the key highlights of our operating segments, which are further detailed in our earnings release.
First, the Business, Technology, and Management segment continues to deliver very strong top and bottom line results. Revenue in the quarter was up about 29% versus prior year and 26% year-to-date, driven by the strong enrolment growth and increased retention, driven by our focus on student services. Segment operating income of $86 million in the quarter and $220 million year-to-date more than doubled versus prior year. The segment margin of 23.6% year-to-date was up about 900 basis points versus last year, reflecting the power of operating leverage on our cost base from the very strong top line growth.
Within the Medical and Healthcare segment, revenue was up 26% in the quarter driven by enrolment growth and pricing at Ross University and Chamberlain College of Nursing, along with good, but decelerating growth at U.S. Education. Third quarter operating income for the segment of $31 million was up about 19% versus last year. The margin was a bit lower than prior year driven by continued mix shift in the business mix within the segment with the growth of Chamberlain and U.S. Education, both which currently have lower margins than Ross University.
Also note that in Q4, we are planning increased spending associated with the start ups for Chamberlain in Chicago and Crystal City, Virginia as well as cost associated with the name change and geographic expansion within U.S. Education. 
Our Professional Education segment results continue to reflect the impact of the soft economy on the accounting and finance professions, with some slight signs of improvement. Revenue was up 1% in the quarter and down about 2% year-to-date versus last year. Operating income was down about 15% in the quarter and down 18% year-to-date. Once again, we don't expect performance to improve materially in calendar 2010, or really until the economic recovery takes hold and positively impacts hiring and training within these professions.
Lastly, our Other Educational Services segment contributed about $14 million of revenue in the quarter, but with an operating loss of $1.4 million. Advanced Academics had increased marketing spending in the quarter to drive future growth and our fiscal third quarter represents a seasonal low point for tuition revenue at DeVry Brazil. No classes were held for most of January, given the academic calendar in Brazil resulting in only about two months of revenue recognition in the quarter. This segment is expected to deliver operating income again in the fourth quarter.
Shifting to cash flow in the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for the first nine months was $481 million versus $288 million last year driven by improved earnings and working capital. These strong cash flow results drove our cash and marketable securities balance to $502 million at the end of the third quarter, compared to $297 million last year. And our outstanding debt was $45 million, which is level with last quarter and down from $135 million last year.
Capital expenditures the first nine months was $102 million, about double the amount we spent last year. The spending has been focused on project Delta, which we believe will further enhance our ability to provide best-in-class service to our students, as well as on facility improvements within DeVry University and U.S. Education, and expansion within Ross University and Chamberlain College of Nursing. 
We also completed our home office move in January to two new locations here in the western suburbs of Chicago. We’re committed to investing in educational technology and capacity needed to serve our students and we've been successful in completing projects pending this year. Total capital spending is expected to be in the $130 million to $140 million range by the end of the year.
Our net accounts receivable balance continued to run lower than prior year despite our strong revenue growth. Net accounts receivable decreased to $156 million versus $180 million last year. Receivables per account within DeVry University were actually down compared to the balances last year as well as two years ago. 
Our year-to-date bad debt rate increased slightly versus last year to 3.1%, driven by the U.S. Ed. and DeVry Brazil additions. We have not experienced really any significant deterioration with bad debt in our legacy operations.
These results can be attributed to the impact of our financial aid processing system, focus on customer service and a tremendous effort of our campus and student finance teams. And I really do want to commend these people. When you factor in the tough economy to bring down receivables per account, let alone total receivables is a huge, huge achievement. 
Finally during the quarter, we began executing our third share repurchase program buying back about 100,000 shares at an average cost of $63.37 per share. So that concludes my comments and the strong results for the quarter and the first nine months of the year. Fiscal 2010 is going to be a breakthrough year for the organization, significantly surpassing our long-term financial goals given the power of operating leverage. The fourth quarter will continue to show margin improvement, albeit at a lower rate of growth than we achieved in the nine-month period. 
As we look ahead to fiscal 2011, we expect the Business, Technology and Management segment to continue to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth, driven by the flow-through of our recent strong enrolment growth and continued operating leverage. The Medical and Healthcare segment earnings, however, will likely be flat to maybe even slightly down next year. This is driven by capacity and enrolment constraints within Ross' Medical School that Daniel will discuss in a few minutes, along with startup costs associated with geographic expansion at Chamberlain and U.S. Education. 
In addition, we anticipate existing campus growth at U.S. Education to slow down as the economy recovers and unemployment levels decline. Finally, we hope to see improved top and bottom line results within Professional Education segment as the economy recovers and anticipate that the Other Educational Services segment will contribute more to revenue and earnings growth.
Overall, our diversification is serving us well as we expect to deliver results in line with our long-term financial goals for DeVry Inc. of double-digit revenue growth and roughly 20% earnings per share growth in fiscal 2011. With that, let me now turn the call back to Daniel for some color on the operating results."

Let me start with Business, Technology and Management segment, which, of course, is DeVry University and its Keller Graduate School of Management. This is another strong quarter of positive academic outcomes and excellent enrolment growth. 
We were especially pleased to see contributions across all curriculum areas, degree levels and delivery modes. Let me give you some color on that. Total undergraduate enrolment in DeVry University’s Business programs grew 22%, Technology programs grew 27% and the Healthcare programs grew 46%.
We're also seeing significant enrolment growth at the graduate level as coursetakers rose 17% for the January session and more than 15% in March. 17% is the highest growth rate in total graduate coursetakers since 2003. We believe this demonstrates the strong return on the investments we're making to raise awareness of the quality of our graduate degree programs. 
The total number of online coursetakers at DeVry University the March session, this includes undergraduate and graduate together, increased 21.5% from the prior year and the campuses and centers grew nicely well. So we're seeing contributions to our overall strong growth rates at DeVry University from all channels, that’s curriculum areas, degree levels and delivery modes.
DeVry University continues to position itself as the career university and in line with this we've making investments in expanding career services for our students and hiring more career advisors. The most recent employment rate for DeVry University graduates in the active job market, who are employed within their field of study within six months of graduation, remained steady at 87.7%. And we believe this demonstrates that employers continue to see tremendous value in our graduates, despite the continued weakness in the job market. 
We also accelerated the rollout of our next generation student central location to better support our students from the time they enroll until they graduate. This innovative student central concept will be in all of our campuses by the end of fiscal 2010.
And DeVry University is continuing to invest in new location. Thus far in fiscal 2011, we expect to open new campuses near Houston and Phoenix as part of our plans to open five or six new locations in total at DeVry University next year. 
Now the key to DeVry University's strong performance is the quality of the learning experience we offer to our students. And the backbone of providing that quality is our highly-talented faculty. So I'm particularly proud of the talent we have teaching at DeVry University and wanted to highlight that beginning this month we'll be establishing a recurring faculty symposium. This will be another great arena for DeVry University’s thought leaders to learn from one another, presenting white papers and essential topics such as student retention, blended learning and many others.
Now I'd like to update you on Project Delta. As most of you know, this is a major student systems migration that will greatly improve productivity and student service at both DeVry University and at Chamberlain College of Nursing. Now as with any major systems project I've ever been involved in, we've experienced some delays and cost overruns. But as we’ve said many times, success means getting it right. And that's the most important thing. We will not launch any of the phases until they're fully tested and ready. Now we do expect initial phases to rollout in the coming months and we're excited about the capabilities Project Delta will provide to us and to our students.
Let me turn now to our Medical and Healthcare segment. At Ross University, we’ve continued to see growth as new student enrolment in January at the Med and Vet schools was up more than 14% and total student enrolment increased 8% from year ago. As those of you have been following us know, part of the growth strategy at Ross University School of Medicine is the development of a clinical education center located in Freeport, Grand Bahamas. One of the attractions of the clinical site, which opened in January of last year, was that it was expected to play a role in alleviating capacity constraints at Ross' main campus in Dominica. This hasn't gone according to plan. There's a few reasons for this. 
One reason has to do with student’s reaction to a funding difference. Title IV funding has not been available to students studying in Freeport. We knew this and so as a result, we developed an institutional loan alternative that alleviated any impact per student. But from a perception point of view, the fact that there was a difference, lead to a more cautious outlook on the part of existing students who were considering Freeport. 
And there was also a delay in the California review process. So just background on that. Four states, including California, require approval of international medical school programs in order to license graduates to participate in clinicals in their states. They also require notification for new locations. So Ross made the proper notification, but California later concluded that Freeport was subject to a more extensive evaluation process. Now we've heard nothing that would indicate that the California Medical Board has any concerns about the Freeport location or its academics or operations. It's just that it’s a process that you have to go through and we hope to receive formal approval by the end of the year.
And these things have combined to reduce the number of students in Freeport well below what we had been planning, which means that we need to add investment and resources in Dominica. So as we continue to work on the Freeport location, we're adding capacity in Dominica. We're adding additional classrooms, laboratory, space and faculty. We are committed to providing the resources our students need to receive a high-quality education. 
What all of this will mean is we're lowering new student enrolment for at least the upcoming May and September terms. And we’ll keep you informed of our progress on all these fronts as they unfold. In the meantime, we expect that our well-diversified portfolio of programs will enable DeVry overall to achieve its long-term performance goals. And to give you some perspective on that, we anticipate that the slowing of enrolment growth at Ross will affect earnings by approximately $5 million in fiscal 2011.
So we believe this is a prudent step and will allow Ross to manage through the near term and prepare for growth longer term. The situation reminds me of when we first acquired Ross and we made the conscious decision to slow enrolment growth for a time in order to improve outcomes for students. That investment laid the foundation for the excellent academic outcomes and the strong growth in applications that we've seen ever since. 
But here, although it's a different situation, we're making a similar investment for the short term that will allow us to better serve our existing student population and manage for long-term growth. 
So moving on within the segment, our Chamberlain College of Nursing continues to grow as enrolment was up 72% over the prior year. Chamberlain experienced strong growth at each of its campuses and across all of its programs. We continue to invest in geographic expansion at Chamberlain. 
For the two co-locations I mentioned earlier, we recently received approval from the Boards of Nursing in both Illinois and in Virginia. Both campuses received wonderful feedback from accreditor and nursing board review team.
Last week, I had the honor of keynoting the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the relocated campus in St. Louis, which is yet another co-location with DeVry University. As we toured this wonderful campus, it felt like we were in a hospital with nursing stations and ICU, patient simulators. And these simulators give our students the opportunity to learn in a life-like yet safe environment and provide an excellent academic experience. I discussed with the local government officials what a privilege it is to open a new 55,000 square-foot plus facility with state-of-the-art equipment at a time when public universities are capacity constrained. 
And then at Apollo College and Western Career College, soon-to-be Carrington Colleges, new enrolments dipped 2% while total enrollments were up 10% for the period. New enrollments were affected by several factors including a moderation in enrolment as the economy recovers, and a tougher comparison to last year's very strong growth, execution issues, which have been addressed, and near-term capacity constraints as we develop new locations. 
Later this year, U.S. Education is going to going to co-locate with DeVry University in Pomona, California. That'll be our first location in Southern California for what’s soon-to-be-called Carrington College of California.
Turning to our Professional Education segment. The economy continues to affect the accounting and finance fields that Becker Professional Education serves. But we're seeing early indications that the worst is over as our CPA segment is beginning to show modest growth. We believe Becker is well positioned for long-term growth. This is evident when you look at Accounting Today's list of the Top 100 Firms and see that Becker has relationships in place with 97 of them. 
Our Stalla Review for the CFA exam recently entered into partnerships with the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and with UBS to serve as their preferred partner. 
And then finally moving to our Other Educational Services segment. I’d like to comment on DeVry Brazil. Total enrollments were flat because of tougher comparisons in graduate student enrolment and the delay in the rollout of several new programs. 
Even though it's small today, we believe DeVry Brazil continues to have great potential for long-term growth. Right now, we're focused on building our infrastructure, including student services and online delivery, in order to build upon our quality offerings there and to foster future growth.
During the quarter, we received approvals for numerous new courses in the healthcare field in Brazil, including nursing, physiotherapy and nutrition and these should contribute positively to the future enrolment growth. We're also exploring further expansion options to the new locations. 
And I'd like to mention that we're building upon a strong foundation of academic quality at DeVry Brazil. For example, based on outcomes of the OAB exam, which is the equivalent of the bar exam in the U.S., for the second year in a row, Ruy Barbosa student test scores were number one in Salvador and number one among all private institutions in Brazil countrywide.
And so to wrap it up. Overall, we're very pleased with the results in the quarter. As more than anything they demonstrate that our diversification strategy is serving us well. While we discussed some near-term challenges at Ross University and a countercyclical moderation at U.S. Education, these are more than offset by the out-performance at DeVry University and at Chamberlain College of Nursing. 
So taken together, we're very well positioned to meet our near term and our long-term goals. So with that, we'd be happy to take questions. Joan?"

And is it reasonable to think that while it probably slows that this can remain at low double-digits or high-single to low double-digit grower as we look out over the next two to three years even in a stronger economy?"

It's really interesting, Gary, that DeVry University has been able to grow through good times and bad times. In fact, back in the vaunted '90s and the 20 plus percent earnings growth for 10 years in a row, 40 quarters, the average enrolment growth was less than 10%. It was about 7%, 7.5%. And I think we shared last time that if you look at DeVry University's total enrollment growth, after the last recession we showed very good growth throughout and as that ended and we had falling unemployment. In an improving economy, DeVry University performed very, very well. So DeVry University's programs are really a lot less countercyclical than I think some people think. And when you think about that it makes sense because you got business programs, you've got technology programs and you’ve got an increasing cadre of health and healthcare technology programs at DeVry University. So there are programs that appeal to students across economic cycles. The other thing is DeVry University has a nice complement of both working adult students, like many others have, but also a lot of traditional college-age students coming directly from high school. And they don't stop making 18-year-olds in good or bad economic cycles, right? And so you have a nice stable base of 18-year-olds coming through. And that's a differentiator for DeVry University relative to many others as well. So we feel very confident in DeVry University's have ability to grow and serve students throughout good and bad economic cycles."

We will not roll out any module into the system until it's fully tested and ready. And that we've done the change management, which is something we teach at DeVry University and Keller Graduate School of Management, which is sort of academic term for training and making sure that everyone knows how to use the system properly. And so we're putting a big investment -- we’ve increased the investment in training and change management, which again kind of speaks to a little bit -- we’re a little bit over time, a little bit over budget. But I can tell you sometimes the wind isn't coming in under budget and under time. It's coming in a little over budget and a little bit over time, like you didn't blow anything up in the process. And from my experience, I can tell you that sometimes that is the definition of success with these larger systems projects and business change projects. So that's how we're approaching it. At the same time, I can tell you that over the last few months, I've seen the demos. I participated in some of the training and I've been blown away by the opportunity here, the opportunity for enhanced service to our students as well as internal productivity. But also, through that change management and training we’ve seen a level of excitement and enthusiasm from people that I've rarely seen in the many systems projects that I've been involved with both as a client and as consultant when I used to be with Accenture. Usually, it’s: oh gosh, when do we have to do this thing. This has been: wow, we can't wait, we can’t wait for the new system.

So there's a sharing of resources there, which benefits our students and actually enriches the learning as well as having efficiencies. And many of the other student services can be shared or if not totally shared, there can be just some back office or common frameworks, common infrastructure: student services, financial aid, packaging. Financial aid packaging is pretty similar whether you're going to a nursing college or engineering program. When you do your financial aid packaging, it looks kind of the same and so there can be sharing there. So those are just to give you a little color and some of the reasons that the co-location is adding value and is part of this diversification strategy that we're pursuing here at DeVry."

It's interesting, Sara, that seems like ancient history, just a year ago or six or months ago whatever it was that everyone was all in a panic that the reduction in private lending, that was going to be the thing that was going to kill the private sector or whatever. And of course we said, we don't think that's going to happen and I think that's proven to be the case. So the private loans as a percent of total tuition or anyway you look at that, is very small, a couple of percent. So it hasn't -- it really has not had an impact on our current students or on our ability to attract new students. I think when you look at our student numbers you’ve seen that. So likewise the other part of your question about direct lending and it's really more of an issue for the banks or other people. It does not have an impact on the schools or on the students themselves. So we don't anticipate hiccups or problems. We've been working collaboratively with the Department of Education from an administrative point of view to ensure a seamless transition for our students. And that’s the key thing to make sure it doesn't impact the students."

We're pleased to announce another quarter of strong performance, driven by the continued execution of our diversification strategy and by our operating philosophy. And namely, that is that ""Quality Leads to Growth"". During the quarter, total undergraduate enrolment for DeVry University was up nearly 26% from the year-ago period, to a record of 66,909 students. These results flow directly from the investments we’ve made and the quality of our programs and services.
And we’re being careful stewards of our resources. An example of that is co-location. In today's press release, we highlighted two co-locations between DeVry University and Chamberlain College of Nursing in Crystal City, Virginia and in Chicago. These co-locations will further optimize utilization at those existing facilities and it’ll enhance academic student experience. 
Now if there was a theme this quarter, it would be healthcare. First of all, of course, we saw the passage of the new healthcare reform legislation. This law potentially means that 32 million more Americans will have health insurance by 2014.
This will put even more demand on an already strained system. Our schools are well positioned to educate the professionals who will be serving America's growing healthcare needs into the future. And Chamberlain College of Nursing is a great example of how we’ll help to meet this demand. Because even before this law was signed, it was forecasted that we would be 1 million nurses short by the end of this decade. And yet our nation's nursing schools are turning away almost 100,000 qualified applicants each and every year because there aren't enough seats to meet the demand. So Chamberlain is a great example of how DeVry and the private sector as a whole are meeting the capacity needs that we have. 
And likewise, in the world of medical education, it’s expected that we'll be 125,000 physicians short within 15 years. Ross University School of Medicine is helping to fulfill this critical need. And there's also a growing shortage of ancillary care and allied health professionals. And recently we made a change that we think paves the way to significantly meet the needs of these professionals as well because, during this quarter, we announced the name change of the two schools that make up U.S. Education: Western Career College and Apollo College. 
On July 1, the two will become Carrington College. It will be Carrington College California and Carrington College, respectively. And so taken together our medical and healthcare group is serving nearly 24,000 students and we’re a leading educator at all levels of healthcare, from the medical assistant to the nurse to the physician.
As millions of Americans become insured under healthcare reform, we expect to play an important role in meeting the need for healthcare professionals in this country. So with that brief introduction, let me turn the call over to Rick and we’ll go through the financial results."

We once again delivered strong revenue and earnings results this quarter, while making investments in academic quality.

We once again delivered strong revenue and earnings results this quarter, while making investments in academic quality. Our strong revenue growth continued to be a key source of operating leverage in improved margins and profitably. 
Record quarterly revenue of $504 million was up about 29% versus prior year, with revenues still up 27%, excluding our acquisition of DeVry Brazil at April. Year-to-date revenue was up 32% and 26% when you exclude the impact of both DeVry Brazil and U.S. Education, which became part of DeVry in September of 2008.
Net income and earnings per share were both up about 60% in the quarter versus prior year on a reported basis, and up 51% after excluding a charge for a lease buyout from last year's results. Year-to-date earnings were up 63% on a reported basis and 59%, excluding last year's discrete item.
Pretax income margins for the first nine months was 22.1%, up 450 basis points versus the 17.6% margin achieved a year ago. We're obviously on our way to significantly surpass our historical full year peak margin of 17.1% this year and should exceed 20% by the end of the year as well. 
For your reference, third quarter results include expense related to share-based payments of approximately $2.2 million pretax or $1.8 million net of tax, a bit higher than last year. And our overall effective tax rate was 33.8% in the quarter and 33.3% year-to-date, up from our 30.4% rate for full fiscal year 2009, primarily due to the continued increase in domestic source income. 
Cost of Educational Services expense in the quarter increased by about 20% versus prior year, excluding last year's real estate charge and student service and administrative expense increased by 22%, both growing at double-digit rates, but less than revenue growth, with or without the acquisitions.
We continue to make prudent, targeted investments while still delivering leverage and efficiencies. With that let me now walk you through some of the key highlights of our operating segments, which are further detailed in our earnings release.
First, the Business, Technology, and Management segment continues to deliver very strong top and bottom line results. Revenue in the quarter was up about 29% versus prior year and 26% year-to-date, driven by the strong enrolment growth and increased retention, driven by our focus on student services. Segment operating income of $86 million in the quarter and $220 million year-to-date more than doubled versus prior year. The segment margin of 23.6% year-to-date was up about 900 basis points versus last year, reflecting the power of operating leverage on our cost base from the very strong top line growth.
Within the Medical and Healthcare segment, revenue was up 26% in the quarter driven by enrolment growth and pricing at Ross University and Chamberlain College of Nursing, along with good, but decelerating growth at U.S. Education. Third quarter operating income for the segment of $31 million was up about 19% versus last year. The margin was a bit lower than prior year driven by continued mix shift in the business mix within the segment with the growth of Chamberlain and U.S. Education, both which currently have lower margins than Ross University.
Also note that in Q4, we are planning increased spending associated with the start-ups for Chamberlain in Chicago and Crystal City, Virginia as well as cost associated with the name change and geographic expansion within U.S. Education. 
Our Professional Education segment results continue to reflect the impact of the soft economy on the accounting and finance professions, with some slight signs of improvement. Revenue was up 1% in the quarter and down about 2% year-to-date versus last year. Operating income was down about 15% in the quarter and down 18% year-to-date. Once again, we don't expect performance to improve materially in calendar 2010, or really until the economic recovery takes hold and positively impacts hiring and training within these professions.
Lastly, our Other Educational Services segment contributed about $14 million of revenue in the quarter, but with an operating loss of $1.4 million. Advanced Academics had increased marketing spending in the quarter to drive future growth, and our fiscal third quarter represents a seasonal low point for tuition revenue at DeVry Brazil. No classes were held for most of January, given the academic calendar in Brazil resulting in only about two months of revenue recognition in the quarter. This segment is expected to deliver operating income again in the fourth quarter.
Shifting to cash flow in the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for the first nine months was $481 million versus $288 million last year driven by improved earnings and working capital. These strong cash flow results drove our cash and marketable security balance to $502 million at the end of the third quarter, compared to $297 million last year. And our outstanding debt was $45 million, which is level with last quarter and down from $135 million last year.
Capital spending through the first nine months was $102 million, about double the amount we spent last year. The spending has been focused on project Delta, which we believe will further enhance our ability to provide best-in-class service to our students, as well as on facility improvements within DeVry University and U.S. Education and expansion within Ross University and Chamberlain College of Nursing. 
We also completed our home office move in January to two new locations here in the western suburbs of Chicago. We’re committed to investing in educational technology and capacity needed to serve our students, and we've been successful in completing project spending this year. Total capital spending is expected to be in the $130 million to $140 million range by the end of the year.
Our net accounts receivable balance continued to run lower than prior year despite our strong revenue growth. Net accounts receivable decreased to $156 million versus $180 million last year. Receivables per account within DeVry University were actually down compared to the balances last year as well as two years ago. 
Our year-to-date bad debt rate increased slightly versus last year to 3.1%, driven by the U.S. Ed. and DeVry Brazil additions. We have not experienced really any significant deterioration with bad debt in our legacy operations.
These results can be attributed to the impact of our financial aid processing system, focus on customer service and a tremendous effort of our campus and student finance teams. And I really do want to commend these people. When you factor in the tough economy to bring down receivables per account, let alone total receivables is a huge, huge achievement. 
Finally during the quarter, we began executing our third share repurchase program buying back about 100,000 shares at an average cost of $63.37 per share. So that concludes my comments and the strong results for the quarter and the first nine months of the year. Fiscal 2010 is going to be a breakthrough year for the organization, significantly surpassing our long-term financial goals given the power of operating leverage. The fourth quarter will continue to show margin improvement, albeit at a lower rate of growth than we achieved in the nine-month period. 
As we look ahead to fiscal 2011, we expect the Business, Technology and Management segment to continue to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth, driven by the flow-through of our recent strong enrollment growth and continued operating leverage. The Medical and Healthcare segment earnings, however, will likely be flat to maybe even slightly down next year. This is driven by capacity and enrollment constraints within Ross' Medical School that Daniel will discuss in a few minutes, along with start-up costs associated with geographic expansion at Chamberlain and U.S. Education. 
In addition, we anticipate existing campus growth at U.S. Education to slow down as the economy recovers and unemployment levels decline. Finally, we hope to see improved top and bottom line results within Professional Education segment as the economy recovers and anticipate that the Other Educational Services segment will contribute more to revenue and earnings growth.
Overall, our diversification is serving us well as we expect to deliver results in line with our long-term financial goals for DeVry Inc. of double-digit revenue growth and roughly 20% earnings per share growth in fiscal 2011. With that, let me now turn the call back to Daniel for some color on the operating results."

Let me start with Business, Technology and Management segment, which, of course, is DeVry University and its Keller Graduate School of Management. This is another strong quarter of positive academic outcomes and excellent enrolment growth. 
We were especially pleased to see contributions across all curriculum areas, degree levels and delivery modes. Let me give you some color on that. Total undergraduate enrolment in DeVry University’s Business programs grew 22%, Technology programs grew 27% and the Healthcare programs grew 46%.
We're also seeing significant enrolment growth at the graduate level as coursetakers rose 17% for the January session and more than 15% in March. 17% is the highest growth rate in total graduate coursetakers since 2003. We believe this demonstrates the strong return on the investments we're making to raise awareness of the quality of our graduate degree programs. 
The total number of online coursetakers at DeVry University the March session, this includes undergraduate and graduate together, increased 21.5% from the prior year and the campuses and centers grew nicely well. So we're seeing contributions to our overall strong growth rates at DeVry University from all channels, that’s curriculum areas, degree levels and delivery modes.
DeVry University continues to position itself as the career university and in line with this we've making investments in expanding career services for our students and hiring more career advisors. The most recent employment rate for DeVry University graduates in the active job market, who are employed within their field of study within six months of graduation, remained steady at 87.7%. And we believe this demonstrates that employers continue to see tremendous value in our graduates, despite the continued weakness in the job market. 
We also accelerated the rollout of our next generation student central location to better support our students from the time they enroll until they graduate. This innovative student central concept will be in all of our campuses by the end of fiscal 2010.
And DeVry University is continuing to invest in new location. Thus far in fiscal 2011, we expect to open new campuses near Houston and Phoenix as part of our plans to open five or six new locations in total at DeVry University next year. 
Now the key to DeVry University's strong performance is the quality of the learning experience we offer to our students. And the backbone of providing that quality is our highly-talented faculty. So I'm particularly proud of the talent we have teaching at DeVry University and wanted to highlight that beginning this month we'll be establishing a recurring faculty symposium. This will be another great arena for DeVry University’s thought leaders to learn from one another, presenting white papers and essential topics such as student retention, blended learning and many others.
Now I'd like to update you on Project Delta. As most of you know, this is a major student systems migration that will greatly improve productivity and student service at both DeVry University and at Chamberlain College of Nursing. Now as with any major systems project I've ever been involved in, we've experienced some delays and cost overruns. But as we’ve said many times, success means getting it right. And that's the most important thing. We will not launch any of the phases until they're fully tested and ready. Now we do expect initial phases to rollout in the coming months and we're excited about the capabilities Project Delta will provide to us and to our students.
Let me turn now to our Medical and Healthcare segment. At Ross University, we’ve continued to see growth as new student enrolment in January at the Med and Vet schools was up more than 14% and total student enrolment increased 8% from year ago. As those of you have been following us know, part of the growth strategy at Ross University School of Medicine is the development of a clinical education center located in Freeport, Grand Bahamas. One of the attractions of the clinical site, which opened in January of last year, was that it was expected to play a role in alleviating capacity constraints at Ross' main campus in Dominica. This hasn't gone according to plan. There's a few reasons for this. 
One reason has to do with student’s reaction to a funding difference. Title IV funding has not been available to students studying in Freeport. We knew this and so as a result, we developed an institutional loan alternative that alleviated any impact per student. But from a perception point of view, the fact that there was a difference, lead to a more cautious outlook on the part of existing students who were considering Freeport. 
And there was also a delay in the California review process. So just background on that. Four states, including California, require approval of international medical school programs in order to license graduates to participate in clinicals in their states. They also require notification for new locations. So Ross made the proper notification, but California later concluded that Freeport was subject to a more extensive evaluation process. Now we've heard nothing that would indicate that the California Medical Board has any concerns about the Freeport location or its academics or operations. It's just that it’s a process that you have to go through and we hope to receive formal approval by the end of the year.
And these things have combined to reduce the number of students in Freeport well below what we had been planning, which means that we need to add investment and resources in Dominica. So as we continue to work on the Freeport location, we're adding capacity in Dominica. We're adding additional classrooms, laboratory, space and faculty. We are committed to providing the resources our students need to receive a high-quality education. 
What all of this will mean is we're lowering new student enrolment for at least the upcoming May and September terms. And we’ll keep you informed of our progress on all these fronts as they unfold. In the meantime, we expect that our well-diversified portfolio of programs will enable DeVry overall to achieve its long-term performance goals. And to give you some perspective on that, we anticipate that the slowing of enrolment growth at Ross will affect earnings by approximately $5 million in fiscal 2011.
So we believe this is a prudent step and will allow Ross to manage through the near term and prepare for growth longer term. The situation reminds me of when we first acquired Ross and we made the conscious decision to slow enrolment growth for a time in order to improve outcomes for students. That investment laid the foundation for the excellent academic outcomes and the strong growth in applications that we've seen ever since. 
But here, although it's a different situation, we're making a similar investment for the short term that will allow us to better serve our existing student population and manage for long-term growth. 
So moving on within the segment, our Chamberlain College of Nursing continues to grow as enrolment was up 72% over the prior year. Chamberlain experienced strong growth at each of its campuses and across all of its programs. We continue to invest in geographic expansion at Chamberlain. 
For the two co-locations I mentioned earlier, we recently received approval from the Boards of Nursing in both Illinois and in Virginia. Both campuses received wonderful feedback from accreditor and nursing board review team.
Last week, I had the honor of keynoting the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the relocated campus in St. Louis, which is yet another co-location with DeVry University. As we toured this wonderful campus, it felt like we were in a hospital with nursing stations and ICU, patient simulators. And these simulators give our students the opportunity to learn in a life-like yet safe environment and provide an excellent academic experience. I discussed with the local government officials what a privilege it is to open a new 55,000 square-foot plus facility with state-of-the-art equipment at a time when public universities are capacity constrained. 
And then at Apollo College and Western Career College, soon-to-be Carrington Colleges, new enrolments dipped 2% while total enrollments were up 10% for the period. New enrollments were affected by several factors including a moderation in enrolment as the economy recovers, and a tougher comparison to last year's very strong growth, execution issues, which have been addressed, and near-term capacity constraints as we develop new locations. 
Later this year, U.S. Education is going to going to co-locate with DeVry University in Pomona, California. That'll be our first location in Southern California for what’s soon-to-be-called Carrington College of California.
Turning to our Professional Education segment. The economy continues to affect the accounting and finance fields that Becker Professional Education serves. But we're seeing early indications that the worst is over as our CPA segment is beginning to show modest growth. We believe Becker is well positioned for long-term growth. This is evident when you look at Accounting Today's list of the Top 100 Firms and see that Becker has relationships in place with 97 of them. 
Our Stalla Review for the CFA exam recently entered into partnerships with the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and with UBS to serve as their preferred partner. 
And then finally moving to our Other Educational Services segment. I’d like to comment on DeVry Brazil. Total enrollments were flat because of tougher comparisons in graduate student enrollment and the delay in the rollout of several new programs. 
Even though it's small today, we believe DeVry Brazil continues to have great potential for long-term growth. Right now, we're focused on building our infrastructure, including student services and online delivery, in order to build upon our quality offerings there and to foster future growth.
During the quarter, we received approvals for numerous new courses in the healthcare field in Brazil, including nursing, physiotherapy and nutrition and these should contribute positively to the future enrollment growth. We're also exploring further expansion options to the new locations. 
And I'd like to mention that we're building upon a strong foundation of academic quality at DeVry Brazil. For example, based on outcomes of the OAB exam, which is the equivalent of the bar exam in the U.S., for the second year in a row, Ruy Barbosa student test scores were number one in Salvador and number one among all private institutions in Brazil countrywide.
And so to wrap it up, overall, we're very pleased with the results in the quarter as more than anything they demonstrate that our diversification strategy is serving us well. While we discussed some near-term challenges at Ross University and a countercyclical moderation at U.S. Education, these are more than offset by the outperformance at DeVry University and at Chamberlain College of Nursing. 
So taken together, we're very well-positioned to meet our near term and our long-term goals. So with that, we'd be happy to take questions. Joan?"

So there are programs that appeal to students across economic cycles. The other thing is DeVry University has a nice complement of both working adult students, like many others have, but also a lot of traditional college-age students coming directly from high school.

But that's the point is -- and why we're a little bit behind the original schedule and I reported that is actually, to underline the point I think you're getting to, which is sell no wine before its time. We will not roll out any module into the system until it's fully tested and ready. And that we've done the change management, which is something we teach at DeVry University and Keller Graduate School of Management, which is sort of academic term for training and making sure that everyone knows how to use the system properly. And so we're putting a big investment -- we’ve increased the investment in training and change management, which again kind of speaks to a little bit -- we’re a little bit over time, a little bit over budget. But I can tell you sometimes the wind isn't coming in under budget and under time. It's coming in a little over budget and a little bit over time, like you didn't blow anything up in the process. And from my experience, I can tell you that sometimes that is the definition of success with these larger systems projects and business change projects. So that's how we're approaching it. At the same time, I can tell you that over the last few months, I've seen the demos. I participated in some of the training and I've been blown away by the opportunity here, the opportunity for enhanced service to our students as well as internal productivity. But also, through that change management and training we’ve seen a level of excitement and enthusiasm from people that I've rarely seen in the many systems projects that I've been involved with both as a client and as consultant when I used to be with Accenture. Usually, it’s: oh gosh, when do we have to do this thing. This has been: wow, we can't wait, we can’t wait for the new system. So very confident that Project Delta is going to pay off and achieve the kind of returns that we're looking for."

And again, as with everything with DeVry, we're pretty conservative and took a slow approach at the beginning and tested it out in one campus and then another and now given the results of that, that testing phase, we now are proceeding with confidence a little bit more aggressively. Just a few of the reasons that co-location leads to synergy, I’ll just use that word, include the ability to share the facilities, and you spread the facilities costs, including the libraries, the student common, the bookstore, many areas like that. You, in some cases, are able to have students co-sit across institutions like at Chamberlain College of Nursing and DeVry University. Students can actually co-sit in some courses, general education courses. So there's a sharing of resources there, which benefits our students and actually enriches the learning as well as having efficiencies. And many of the other student services can be shared or if not totally shared, there can be just some back office or common frameworks, common infrastructure: student services, financial aid, packaging. Financial aid packaging is pretty similar whether you're going to a nursing college or you’re going to an engineering program. When you do your financial aid packaging, it looks kind of the same and so there can be a sharing there. So those are just to give you a little color and some of the reasons that the co-location is adding value and is part of this diversification strategy that we're pursuing here at DeVry."

We're pleased to announce another quarter and another year of strong performance, which has been driven by the continued execution of our diversification strategy that I want to talk about a little b",858,"Thanks, Joan, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We're pleased to announce another quarter and another year of strong performance, which has been driven by the continued execution of our diversification strategy that I want to talk about a little bit more, and by our focus on academic quality and excellent student services. And we of course are in constant dialogue with many of you and we know that you have questions about the notice of proposed rule-making, the NPRM, and the Senate Health Committee activities. So let me make some remarks about these items right up front.
You've seen our comments on Part I of the proposed Rules and we're analyzing Part II. We've been very consistent over many years in not speculating on the outcomes of pending regulation or how it might impact our schools or our program and we're going to stay with that long-standing policy. I caution you not to read anything negative into this approach, because we continue to be very comfortable with the value proposition offered by our program. We deliver programs that lead to employment and long-term careers for our students. Just a few examples that illustrate why we say this. The top five employers of DeVry University graduates over the past five years are Fortune 100 companies like AT&T, Verizon, General Electric, Intel, IBM, all premier companies that need highly skilled employees.
The overall graduation rate for Carrington College in Carrington College of California is greater than 60%. So most of these students are progressing into the workforce within three years. And Chamberlain College of Nursing, well, you know the story there, a high demand field that commands strong salaries. These are just a few examples of why we're very comfortable that our programs lead to a strong return on educational investment for our students.
Now the comment period on Part II of the Gainful Employment Proposal is still open and we haven't submitted our comments yet. One thing I will say is that we continue to believe that robust disclosure is the most important way to help prospective student consumers make informed decisions. We were pleased to see those provisions included in Part I of the proposed rule. Now let me make a few comments on the so-called incentive compensation proposals, and I say so-called as [ph] (17:55) there seems to be a misperception that the current Safe Harbors allow for employment-based bonuses and that the proposed Rules would ban them, and it's just not so. Such payments are already prohibited. 
Now we support the department's efforts to refine regulations and to ensure Congress's intent per the statute is carried out effectively. Consistent with current regulations, we don't pay commissions or bonuses based on enrollment. We pay salaries to all of our employees, who also receive annual performance reviews and are rewarded on merit.
And while we support the department's intentions, we do think there are three points that could further enhance the proposed Rule. First, quantitative performance measurement should be permitted to play at least some part in the judgments that institutions make about base salary adjustments. 
Second, restrictions on compensation practices should apply only to employees directly engaged in enrollment and in awarding financial aid. And third, we should permit compensation that's linked to shared societal and institutional goals like program persistence and graduation. 
Let me also touch briefly on the Senate Health Committee activities. As you know, we were the only private sector organization invited to testify before the Committee to date. We very much appreciated that opportunity to discuss our views with the Committee. We think it's essential that the Committee's going to get a balanced view of the sector for them to hear from institutions like DeVry that have a proven track record of delivering programs that lead to employment and long-term careers for our students. So we'll continue to work constructively with the Committee and the next aspect of that will be pulling together the information that they've asked for.
And so overall, we understand that there are concerns with unaffordable debt level, with the quality of some programs, with the recruiting practices of some personnel at some institutions. But stepping back, let's remember the big picture. We need more quality educational capacity to meet our workforce goals. In fact just this week, the President reemphasized his goal, our goal, our nation's goal of having 8 million more college graduates by 2020. 
Private sector schools play a vital role in adding capacity with quality outcomes at a lower net cost to taxpayers. All schools, private sector, public sector and independent, must be held accountable for quality outcomes and for value. So we support high standards, rigorously and evenly enforced. The key point is that any policy, regulation or legislation must be crafted not only to address problems but to enhance the ability of compliant schools to deliver this much-needed quality educational capacity. We must avoid unintended consequences.
Let's not throw the baby out with the bath water. And so with that sort of overview, I'd like to turn the call over to Rick for a review of DeVry's financial and operational highlights."
27536,84548198,74432,"DeVry, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-12-2010",2010-08-12,"Earnings Calls","Adtalem Global Education Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Daniel, and good afternoon everyone. Well, another fiscal year's come to a close and we are very proud of our strong performance, driven by our focus on academic quality.

Well, another fiscal year's come to a close and we are very proud of our strong performance, driven by our focus on academic quality. Full-year revenue hit a record $1.915 billion, up approximately 31% versus prior year. Organic revenue growth was about 27% versus prior year, excluding the Carrington and DeVry Brasil acquisitions that occurred last fiscal year. Net income for fiscal 2010 was $280 million, up 63% versus last year, and earnings per share were $3.87, up 64%, excluding last year's discrete items.
Our after-tax income margin for the year was 14.6%, up from 11.3% last year. Over the past 10 years, our after-tax income margin has averaged about 9% with fiscal 2005 as the low point at 2.3%. 
We're real pleased with our performance this year. We will be focusing on our after-tax net income margin as our key margin metric as this accounts for the over $130 million in federal and state income taxes paid during the past year. 
Fourth quarter results were also very strong and reflect strong top line growth, continued operating leverage and a focus on reinvesting the academic quality and long-term growth initiatives. Revenue of $507 million was about 20% versus last year. This was all organic growth as we now overlapped the DeVry Brasil acquisition which occurred April 2009.
Net income of $72 million was up 78% versus last year and earnings per share of $0.99, up 77% excluding last year's discrete items. And our net income margin was 14.1% in the quarter. We referenced fourth quarter results, include expense related to share-based payments of approximately $2.2 million pretax compared to $1 million last year. 
For the full year, share-based expense totaled $10.1 million versus $7.6 million for fiscal 2009. Our overall effective tax rate was 32.2% for the year and 28.6% in the fourth quarter. The full year tax rate was up from the 30.4% tax rate for fiscal 2009, primarily due to the continued increase in domestic source income.
Our fourth quarter rate was lower due to year-end tax true-ups of state tax accruals and reserves. Cost of Educational Services expense increased 23% for the year and student service and administrative expense was up by about 24% for the year. While we're still making investments to drive future growth such as systems improvements, new location and program rollouts and investments in academic quality, we expect expenses to continue to grow at a lower rate than revenue again in fiscal 2011. 
Also for perspective, I'd like to point out that Educational Services expense was 3.7x the amount spent on advertising and marketing for the year. There's a lot of misinformation out there, so I want to be clear, again, that our spending on instruction was 3.7x our advertising and marketing expense.
Now let's move to some of the highlights of our segment results, which are further detailed in our release. The Business, Technology and Management segment had very strong results, with total enrollment up 22%. As expected, new student enrollment has begun to moderate but still up 10% versus the tough comparison in the prior year. As we've stated in the past, our goal is to achieve approximately 20% annual compound earnings growth for DeVry as a whole over the long term. We achieved these results for 40 straight quarters back in the '90s, with enrollment growth of 7.5% on average and expect enrollment growth at DeVry University to return to the high single digits over the long run.
Revenue in the segment was up about 32% versus last year in the quarter and 28% for the fiscal year, driven by continued online expansion and strong on-site enrollments. Segment earnings, which are of course pretax, were up about 140% for the quarter and more than doubled for the year, excluding last year's discrete items, driven primarily by improved operating leverage from the strong enrollment growth.
Persistence at DeVry University improved yet again this quarter, in part because of the success of the Student Central program being implemented across our campus locations. Student Central provides students with a one-stop destination for curricular, career and financial services. We've accelerated the rollout of the program because it's so helpful to our students and it's such a great investment of our resources.
Within the Medical and Healthcare segment, revenue was up 23.5% in the quarter and about 40% for the year. Revenue growth for the year would have been about 33% excluding the impact of the Carrington acquisition. 
The strong revenue growth was driven by strong demand for Chamberlain's nursing program with total enrollment up 65% in the summer. This growth was offset by a modest decline in new students at Carrington during the period as inquiry volume decreased in advance of the name change, and the expected moderation of new student enrollment at Ross University as we make investments in academic quality and capacity. Ross's total enrollment was up 2.1%, which was in line with management's expectations.
Segment earnings were down slightly in the fourth quarter because of startup expenses for the two new Chamberlain locations, which are DeVry University co-locations in Arlington, Virginia and Chicago; also, expenses associated with the Carrington name change and startup costs and investments associated with Carrington's online programs. Segment earnings for the year were up 21%.
Our Professional Education segment results continue to show signs of improvement as revenue was up about 9% in the quarter and up slightly for the year, a nice improvement from the negative trends we've seen in the past 18 months or so. 
While some of this growth may be activity in advance of the CPA exam change in calendar 2011, we are encouraged that the negative impact of the economic downturn may be abetting. Segment earnings were down less than 1% in the quarter and down 13% for the year, but the pretax margin for the segment remained above 30%.
Finally, the other Educational Services revenue was up about 15% in the quarter and contributed about $60 million for the year. Advanced Academics had a challenging quarter as school district budget constraints adversely impacted summer school enrollments. DeVry Brasil experienced good revenue growth. Segment earnings for the quarter were only about $400,000 as Advanced Academics revenue softness and investments to drive future enrollment in both operations negatively impacted earnings. These investments included facilities, training programs for academic support at DeVry Brasil, as well as more efficient processes and student financial aid that we've implemented.
Shifting to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from operations for the year was $392 million versus $250 million last year. These strong cash flow results drove our cash, marketable security and investment balance to $323 million at the end of the fiscal year compared to $225 million last year. This balance includes about $13 million of auction rate securities but this remaining balance was redeemed at par in early July so we no longer own any of these auction rate securities.
We also used our positive cash flow generation to pay off all our outstanding debt. You may recall that we borrowed about $200 million in September 2008 to help fund the U.S. Education now [ph] (28:59) Carrington acquisition and ended up paying off all of the debt in less than two years.
Our net accounts receivable balance was about $119 million versus $104 million last year. The increase can be attributed to strong enrollment in revenue growth in the quarter as receivables per account across our schools are generally aligned or lower than prior year. For example, DeVry University accounts receivable per account was down about 17% versus last year thanks to the focus and efforts of our campuses and student services staff. 
Bad debt expense was 2.6% of revenue for fiscal 2010, which is at the lower end of our historical range of 2.5% to 3%. We're very proud of these results, especially given the difficult economic conditions and believe our program's strong value proposition and return on investment contributes to our students' ability to pay off their account balances.
We continue to invest in quality and growth initiatives such as Project Delta, our new student information system. As an update on Project Delta, we've implemented the first major module in the fourth quarter. Overall, it went very well and we're realizing benefits such as improved response time and service to students as well as increased productivity. 
Other investments in quality and growth include facility improvements in new locations at DeVry University, Carrington, Chamberlain and DeVry Brasil, along with investments in facilities and infrastructure improvements at Ross University to support capacity expansion. We will continue to invest a significant portion of our earnings back into operations to improve the student value proposition. As an illustration of this, while we earned about $165 million in fiscal 2009, our capital spending was over $131 million in fiscal 2010.
So this year's earnings fund next year's investments in quality and growth initiatives. We expect capital spending for fiscal 2011 will likely be in the $140 million to $150 million range. Finally, during the quarter, we continued to execute our third share repurchase program. Through June 30, we've repurchased approximately 422,000 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $25.4 million. We've been repurchasing shares more rapidly under our structured plan given the fairly large stock price movements over the past few months, as I know all of you are very aware of, and are over half-way through our $50 million program at the end of June.
At this pace, we anticipate completing this program well ahead of the December 31, 2011 authorization period, likely by the end of this quarter. As we announced in today's release, DeVry's board has authorized a fourth $50 million program to commence once the existing program is complete so there's no lapse in our programs. Investing in our shares at these levels reflects our belief in the long-term value we're creating. And again, that value is based on delivering value to our students.
Lastly, we anticipate another increase in our effective tax rate next year given the growth in domestic source income, likely up about 200 basis points or so. So after-tax earnings will likely grow at a lower rate than pretax earnings next year. That concludes my overview of the very strong operating and financial results for fiscal 2010. As we look to a new fiscal year, we still feel very comfortable with our long-term financial objective to deliver double-digit revenue growth and roughly 20% compound annual earnings growth over the next few years. 
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Daniel."

Recently, we met with our board and they approved our five-year strategic plan so I'd like to spend a few minutes now sharing some highlights. In recent years, we've set out to diversify and transform the organization so that we're positioned well for the future. We've added Advanced Academics, Carrington Colleges and DeVry Brasil to our family of schools over just the past couple of years. We are now much more diversified across curriculum areas and degree levels. We're well positioned to make investments in our future in order to drive academic quality and student outcomes and to take advantage of opportunities to further expand our programs, services and geographic footprint. So how do we take this momentum and all of these positive attributes and focus them to realize our future objectives while helping to solve society's unmet need for high-quality education. Let me walk you through in broad strokes our strategic plan for the next five years.
Now to start, our vision is that DeVry will become the leading global provider of career-oriented Educational Services. We believe this creates value for society and all of our stakeholders by delivering high-quality educational programs that are supported by best in class student services. Our strategy to accomplish this vision can be summed up in just three words: achieve, grow and build. First, we'll achieve superior student outcomes by providing both high-quality education and student services. This is in line with our operating philosophy that ""Quality Leads to Growth"". 
[Indiscernible] (34:08), as we invest in academic quality, we help students achieve excellent outcomes and we help meet the needs of society and the employers who hire our graduates. This in turn results in better student retention and referrals, and continued enrollment growth, and all of these things generate the financial resources which we reinvest right back into the quality of our programs and services. And so it's a self-reinforcing cycle of sustainable growth. And it all begins with academic quality. An example of this strategy is the Student Central program that's being implemented across all DeVry University campuses and Rick mentioned this earlier. While we've invested nearly $9 million in this initiative, and we've hired approximately 200 additional career services advisors, financial literacy consultants and Student Central personnel. Another example of our strategy at work comes from Becker Professional Education. As you may know, and Rick mentioned earlier this as well, the CPA exam will expand to include a much broader range of subjects for 2011, so in response we're making a major investment in one of Becker's largest redevelopment efforts ever. As a result, all of our programs and materials for the 2011 CPA exam contain the latest information that our students will need to prepare for the new exam. And at Carrington College, by pursuing this strategy of achieving high-quality academic outcomes, eight out of nine eligible campuses qualified for honor roll status.
This was during a reaffirmation of accreditation by Carrington's accreditor ACICS. Given that ACICS awards this honor to less than 20% of its schools, we were very proud to have eight out of nine of our schools. The second strategy is to grow and to diversify into new curriculum areas, degree levels and geography. Chamberlain College of Nursing is expanding locations and launching new programs. The new RN to MSN degree program will respond to the increasing demand for nurses prepared at the Masters level, and through a joint program with DeVry University's Keller Graduate School of Management, Chamberlain is launching an online MSN/MBA program. 
At DeVry Brasil, we're growing by adding 30 new degree programs in the fields of Healthcare, Engineering and IT. These high-demand programs are a tremendous opportunity for us to meet student needs in Brazil. So diversification drives growth and diversification mitigates risk. Because we're less vulnerable to economic cycles and we're not overly dependent in any one program area. In fact, in the back of today's press release, we included some charts showing the progress we've made in our diversification strategy throughout curriculum areas, then there's a chart on degree level and geography. So whereas in 2002, we were 70% Technology programs and zero Healthcare, we're now broadly diversified across Technology, Business and Healthcare curriculum. So achieve student outcome, grow and diversify and, lastly, build a high-quality infrastructure to support our growth and to compete in an increasingly competitive market. This infrastructure comprises four areas: technology, online educational platform, a strong reputation and human resources, HR.
Project Delta is the largest investment we're making in our technology. This large-scale upgrade to DeVry University's and Chamberlain College of Nursing's IT infrastructure will both make our operations more efficient and save our students time that they can use to focus on their studies. Over the past several years, DeVry Online has done an excellent job of providing high-quality centralized services to support DeVry schools. Our strategy is to further leverage this capability at Carrington and by increasing the rate of new program development across all our schools.
The third part of our infrastructure is our reputation, our brand, if you will; what we stand for. When we were building it, it's through [ph] (38:09) increased civic engagement. We're giving back. We recently announced a major partnership with America's Promise Alliance, which was founded by General Colin Powell and with the support of President Obama and Secretary Duncan, the Alliance is focused on solving our country's high school dropout crisis. Over the next three years, DeVry will be donating $1.5 million to the Alliance and making additional in-kind contributions of up to $750,000 per year in each of the 10 cities where the Alliance operates. A key focus of this partnership will be expanding the Advantage Academy dual enrollment model in those cities.
When we announced this partnership, I got emails from across the DeVry family full of excitement and pride. It's emblematic of how DeVry's people are doing well by doing good and that leads me to the fourth element of this growth infrastructure. And that's our human resources.
Our goal is to be the employer of choice in education, and our diversified array of schools offer exceptional career development opportunities for our people. Two recent announcements illustrate this. John Roselli, who will be Becker's new President in the fall, has a tremendous foundation [indiscernible] (39:23) to build upon thanks to the work of his predecessor, Tom Vucinic, whom I personally would like to thank for his many years of exceptional service to DeVry. And also this fall, Steven Riehs will become President of a new organizational structure that will include Advanced Academics, Becker Professional Education, DeVry Brasil and our overall international business development efforts. But part of this HR infrastructure is our culture. DeVry's culture has always been founded on quality and integrity. And so when I think of building the growth infrastructure, I think of building a house. You don't build it from the top down. You start with the foundation, the infrastructure, so that as you build and grow, you're on a solid foundation. 
And so that's our strategy, achieve superior student outcomes through academic quality and student services, grow and diversify into new program areas, levels and geographies and build a high-quality infrastructure to support our growth.
We're heading into next year, into this new fiscal '11 for us. Our priorities are aligned with this strategy. And these are, first, achieving our academic quality goals, including exam results, higher retention and graduation rates as well as expanded student services. Second, in the grow category, expanding our Healthcare programs and locations to address the strong demand for medical professionals, expanding our Becker Professional Education segment into markets, continuing to develop internationally with DeVry Brasil, strengthening our high school programs while increasing synergies between Advanced Academics and our postsecondary schools. And in the build category, continuing to roll out Project Delta, continuing to develop our new online programs and strengthening our talent development and succession planning. So that's our strategy. 
And lastly, I'd like to take a moment to thank the more than 17,000 employees at DeVry who are helping to empower our students to achieve their educational and career goals. We delivered a very strong year of academic results in fiscal 2010 and it was due to their focus on our students. 
So with that, we'd be happy to take any questions. Joan?"

The details of it go far beyond the time that we have available on this call. And although we know our compliance program is very effective overall, we also know that exceptions can occur. That's true for any organization. So what's equally important is what we do when an error occurs or a problem occurs. And the answer is we take immediate corrective action. We walk the walk and we talk the talk on that. Many examples and we talk about that explicitly within DeVry as part of continuing to maintain and enhance our culture of accountability and integrity. An example, several years ago we became aware of an issue at one camp that related to this and once we investigated it, we promptly notified the Department of Education and terminated the employees who were responsible in that case. And so we do the right thing and we deal with it and I think that's what any organization has to do. I was at a meeting of business leaders a couple of months ago and Jeff Immelt of GE was there and he said, ""Look, I got 250,000 employees. I can guarantee you as sure as we're sitting here, 25 or 30 of them are doing something that I don't want them to be doing. The key is making sure that's an exception but also making sure what you do about it when it happens."" So these things can happen. But the key is how you deal with that and the key is how do you make sure you've got an overarching training and compliance program to ensure that, that is very much the exception."

So everybody's getting all squirrely about the economy and worried about that, and might that have a countercyclical tailwind, reemergence for those kinds of programs at Carrington. Again, for the DeVry family overall, not really countercyclical; but for Carrington specifically, yes, a little bit countercyclical. And at the same time we've had internal things going on so it's been a little tough for us to get as strong of a read on that as we normally would because we have data points clouding our instrumentation here. The thing that is particular to us is this name change. We do think that's going to be strong for us. The early read is a very positive response to that and an increase in inquiries from prospective students.

The way we look at tuition and the pricing is from at least two lenses. One is the competitive set and our schools often compete actually a lot less with other publicly held organizations that you might be very familiar with and much more so with many of the publicly sector institutions, state schools, and at Carrington it might be at the community college level, for example. And so we look at the competitive tuition increases that are out there and we've certainly seeing pretty big numbers; here in Illinois, I think like 11%, and I've seen mid-teens, even in California over 30% tuition increases. And so that certainly puts one perspective on it. Like in any endeavor in life, you look at what the competitors and what the others are doing. And then the other lens that we put on it is more internal, looking at our programs and the value proposition that our students receive. And so we've I think previously shared ROI, or ROE, our return an educational investment for our students. We've shared how over a 30 year period of time, if you take a look at the salaries that our graduates achieved, the kind of return on investments that they get, even with paying the tuition that they pay. And that's for many of our schools in the high 20s, even over 30% return on investment. Again, other than DeVry shares I'm not sure what else I could find that would have such a high return on investment. So we look at it from both those perspectives and that continues, no change there."

We're pleased to announce another quarter and another year of strong performance, which has been driven by the continued execution of our diversification strategy that I want to talk about a little bit more, and by our focus on academic quality and excellent student services. And we of course are in constant dialogue with many of you and we know that you have questions about the notice of proposed rule-making, the NPRM, and the Senate Health Committee activities. So let me make some remarks about these items right up front.
You've seen our comments on Part I of the proposed Rules and we're analyzing Part II. We've been very consistent over many years in not speculating on the outcomes of pending regulation or how it might impact our schools or our program and we're going to stay with that long-standing policy. I caution you not to read anything negative into this approach, because we continue to be very comfortable with the value proposition offered by our program. We deliver programs that lead to employment and long-term careers for our students. Just a few examples that illustrate why we say this. The top five employers of DeVry University graduates over the past five years are Fortune 100 companies like AT&T, Verizon, General Electric, Intel, IBM, all premier companies that need highly skilled employees.
The overall graduation rate for Carrington College in Carrington College of California is greater than 60%. So most of these students are progressing into the workforce within three years. And Chamberlain College of Nursing, well, you know the story there, a high demand field that commands strong salaries. These are just a few examples of why we're very comfortable that our programs lead to a strong return on educational investment for our students.
Now the comment period on Part II of the Gainful Employment Proposal is still open and we haven't submitted our comments yet. One thing I will say is that we continue to believe that robust disclosure is the most important way to help prospective student consumers make informed decisions. We were pleased to see those provisions included in Part I of the proposed rule. Now let me make a few comments on the so-called incentive compensation proposals, and I say so-called as [ph] (17:55) there seems to be a misperception that the current Safe Harbors allow for employment-based bonuses and that the proposed Rules would ban them, and it's just not so. Such payments are already prohibited. 
Now we support the department's efforts to refine regulations and to ensure Congress's intent per the statute is carried out effectively. Consistent with current regulations, we don't pay commissions or bonuses based on enrollment. We pay salaries to all of our employees, who also receive annual performance reviews and are rewarded on merit.
And while we support the department's intentions, we do think there are three points that could further enhance the proposed Rule. First, quantitative performance measurement should be permitted to play at least some part in the judgments that institutions make about base salary adjustments. 
Second, restrictions on compensation practices should apply only to employees directly engaged in enrollment and in awarding financial aid. And third, we should permit compensation that's linked to shared societal and institutional goals like program persistence and graduation. 
Let me also touch briefly on the Senate Health Committee activities. As you know, we were the only private sector organization invited to testify before the Committee to date. We very much appreciated that opportunity to discuss our views with the Committee. We think it's essential that the Committee's going to get a balanced view of the sector for them to hear from institutions like DeVry that have a proven track record of delivering programs that lead to employment and long-term careers for our students. So we'll continue to work constructively with the Committee and the next aspect of that will be pulling together the information that they've asked for.
And so overall, we understand that there are concerns with unaffordable debt level, with the quality of some programs, with the recruiting practices of some personnel at some institutions. But stepping back, let's remember the big picture. We need more quality educational capacity to meet our workforce goals. In fact just this week, the President reemphasized his goal, our goal, our nation's goal of having 8 million more college graduates by 2020. 
Private sector schools play a vital role in adding capacity with quality outcomes at a lower net cost to taxpayers. All schools, private sector, public sector and independent, must be held accountable for quality outcomes and for value. So we support high standards, rigorously and evenly enforced. The key point is that any policy, regulation or legislation must be crafted not only to address problems but to enhance the ability of compliant schools to deliver this much-needed quality educational capacity. We must avoid unintended consequences.
Let's not throw the baby out with the bath water. And so with that sort of overview, I'd like to turn the call over to Rick for a review of DeVry's financial and operational highlights."
27536,84548198,75921,"DeVry, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-12-2010",2010-08-12,"Earnings Calls","Adtalem Global Education Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Daniel, and good afternoon everyone. Well, another fiscal year's come to a close and we are very proud of our strong performance, driven by our focus on academic quality. Full-year revenue hit a record $1.915 billion, up approximately 31% versus p",1772,"Thanks, Daniel, and good afternoon everyone. Well, another fiscal year's come to a close and we are very proud of our strong performance, driven by our focus on academic quality. Full-year revenue hit a record $1.915 billion, up approximately 31% versus prior year. Organic revenue growth was about 27% versus prior year, excluding the Carrington and DeVry Brasil acquisitions that occurred last fiscal year. Net income for fiscal 2010 was $280 million, up 63% versus last year, and earnings per share were $3.87, up 64%, excluding last year's discrete items.
Our after-tax income margin for the year was 14.6%, up from 11.3% last year. Over the past 10 years, our after-tax income margin has averaged about 9% with fiscal 2005 as the low point at 2.3%. 
We're real pleased with our performance this year. We will be focusing on our after-tax net income margin as our key margin metric as this accounts for the over $130 million in federal and state income taxes paid during the past year. 
Fourth quarter results were also very strong and reflect strong top line growth, continued operating leverage and a focus on reinvesting the academic quality and long-term growth initiatives. Revenue of $507 million was about 20% versus last year. This was all organic growth as we now overlapped the DeVry Brasil acquisition which occurred April 2009.
Net income of $72 million was up 78% versus last year and earnings per share of $0.99, up 77% excluding last year's discrete items. And our net income margin was 14.1% in the quarter. We referenced fourth quarter results, include expense related to share-based payments of approximately $2.2 million pretax compared to $1 million last year. 
For the full year, share-based expense totaled $10.1 million versus $7.6 million for fiscal 2009. Our overall effective tax rate was 32.2% for the year and 28.6% in the fourth quarter. The full year tax rate was up from the 30.4% tax rate for fiscal 2009, primarily due to the continued increase in domestic source income.
Our fourth quarter rate was lower due to year-end tax true-ups of state tax accruals and reserves. Cost of Educational Services expense increased 23% for the year and student service and administrative expense was up by about 24% for the year. While we're still making investments to drive future growth such as systems improvements, new location and program rollouts and investments in academic quality, we expect expenses to continue to grow at a lower rate than revenue again in fiscal 2011. 
Also for perspective, I'd like to point out that Educational Services expense was 3.7x the amount spent on advertising and marketing for the year. There's a lot of misinformation out there, so I want to be clear, again, that our spending on instruction was 3.7x our advertising and marketing expense.
Now let's move to some of the highlights of our segment results, which are further detailed in our release. The Business, Technology and Management segment had very strong results, with total enrollment up 22%. As expected, new student enrollment has begun to moderate but still up 10% versus the tough comparison in the prior year. As we've stated in the past, our goal is to achieve approximately 20% annual compound earnings growth for DeVry as a whole over the long term. We achieved these results for 40 straight quarters back in the '90s, with enrollment growth of 7.5% on average and expect enrollment growth at DeVry University to return to the high single digits over the long run.
Revenue in the segment was up about 32% versus last year in the quarter and 28% for the fiscal year, driven by continued online expansion and strong on-site enrollments. Segment earnings, which are of course pretax, were up about 140% for the quarter and more than doubled for the year, excluding last year's discrete items, driven primarily by improved operating leverage from the strong enrollment growth.
Persistence at DeVry University improved yet again this quarter, in part because of the success of the Student Central program being implemented across our campus locations. Student Central provides students with a one-stop destination for curricular, career and financial services. We've accelerated the rollout of the program because it's so helpful to our students and it's such a great investment of our resources.
Within the Medical and Healthcare segment, revenue was up 23.5% in the quarter and about 40% for the year. Revenue growth for the year would have been about 33% excluding the impact of the Carrington acquisition. 
The strong revenue growth was driven by strong demand for Chamberlain's nursing program with total enrollment up 65% in the summer. This growth was offset by a modest decline in new students at Carrington during the period as inquiry volume decreased in advance of the name change, and the expected moderation of new student enrollment at Ross University as we make investments in academic quality and capacity. Ross's total enrollment was up 2.1%, which was in line with management's expectations.
Segment earnings were down slightly in the fourth quarter because of startup expenses for the two new Chamberlain locations, which are DeVry University co-locations in Arlington, Virginia and Chicago; also, expenses associated with the Carrington name change and startup costs and investments associated with Carrington's online programs. Segment earnings for the year were up 21%.
Our Professional Education segment results continue to show signs of improvement as revenue was up about 9% in the quarter and up slightly for the year, a nice improvement from the negative trends we've seen the past 18 months or so. 
While some of this growth may be activity in advance of the CPA exam change in calendar 2011, we are encouraged that the negative impact of the economic downturn may be abetting. Segment earnings were down less than 1% in the quarter and down 13% for the year, but the pretax margin for the segment remained above 30%.
Finally, the other Educational Services revenue was up about 15% in the quarter and contributed about $60 million for the year. Advanced Academics had a challenging quarter as school district budget constraints adversely impacted summer school enrollments. DeVry Brasil experienced good revenue growth. Segment earnings for the quarter were only about $400,000 as Advanced Academics revenue softness and investments to drive future enrollment in both operations negatively impacted earnings. These investments included facilities, training programs for academic support at DeVry Brasil, as well as more efficient processes in student financial aid that we've implemented.
Shifting to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for the year was $392 million versus $250 million last year. These strong cash flow results drove our cash, marketable security and investment balance to $323 million at the end of the fiscal year compared to $225 million last year. This balance includes about $13 million of auction rate securities but this remaining balance was redeemed at par in early July so we no longer own any of these auction rate securities.
We also used our positive cash flow generation to pay off all our outstanding debt. You may recall that we borrowed about $200 million in September 2008 to help fund the U.S. Education, now Carrington, acquisition and ended up paying off all of the debt in less than two years.
Our net accounts receivable balance was about $119 million versus $104 million last year. The increase can be attributed to strong enrollment and revenue growth in the quarter as receivables per account across our schools are generally aligned or lower than prior year. For example, DeVry University accounts receivable per account was down about 17% versus last year thanks to the focus and efforts of our campuses and student services staff. 
Bad debt expense was 2.6% of revenue for fiscal 2010, which is at the lower end of our historical range of 2.5% to 3%. We're very proud of these results, especially given the difficult economic conditions and believe our program's strong value proposition and return on investment contributes to our students' ability to pay off their account balances.
We continue to invest in quality and growth initiatives such as Project Delta, our new student information system. As an update on Project Delta, we've implemented the first major module in the fourth quarter. Overall, it went very well and we're realizing benefits such as improved response time and service to students as well as increased productivity. 
Other investments in quality and growth include facility improvements in new locations at DeVry University, Carrington, Chamberlain and DeVry Brasil, along with investments in facilities and infrastructure improvements at Ross University to support capacity expansion. We will continue to invest a significant portion of our earnings back into operations to improve the student value proposition. As an illustration of this, while we earned about $165 million in fiscal 2009, our capital spending was over $131 million in fiscal 2010.
So this year's earnings fund next year's investments in quality and growth initiatives. We expect capital spending for fiscal 2011 will likely be in the $140 million to $150 million range. Finally, during the quarter, we continued to execute our third share repurchase program. Through June 30, we've repurchased approximately 422,000 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $25.4 million. We've been repurchasing shares more rapidly under our structured plan given the fairly large stock price movements over the past few months, as I know all of you are very aware of, and are over halfway through our $50 million program as of the end of June.
At this pace, we anticipate completing this program well ahead of the December 31, 2011 authorization period, likely by the end of this quarter. As we announced in today's release, DeVry's board has authorized a fourth $50 million program to commence once the existing program is complete so there's no lapse in our programs. Investing in our shares at these levels reflects our belief in the long-term value we're creating. And again, that value is based on delivering value to our students.
Lastly, we anticipate another increase in our effective tax rate next year given the growth in domestic source income, likely up about 200 basis points or so. So after-tax earnings will likely grow at a lower rate than pretax earnings next year. That concludes my overview of the very strong operating and financial results for fiscal 2010. As we look to a new fiscal year, we still feel very comfortable with our long-term financial objective to deliver double-digit revenue growth and roughly 20% compound annual earnings growth over the next few years. 
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Daniel."

Recently, we met with our board and they approved our five-year strategic plan so I'd like to spend a few minutes now sharing some highlights. In recent years, we've set out to diversify and transform the organization so that we're positioned well for the future. We've added Advanced Academics, Carrington Colleges and DeVry Brasil to our family of schools over just the past couple of years. We are now much more diversified across curriculum areas and degree levels. We're well positioned to make investments in our future in order to drive academic quality and student outcomes and to take advantage of opportunities to further expand our programs, services and geographic footprint. So how do we take this momentum and all of these positive attributes and focus them to realize our future objectives while helping to solve society's unmet need for high-quality education. Let me walk you through in broad strokes our strategic plan for the next five years.
Now to start, our vision is that DeVry will become the leading global provider of career-oriented Educational Services. We believe this creates value for society and all of our stakeholders by delivering high-quality educational programs that are supported by best in class student services. Our strategy to accomplish this vision can be summed up in just three words: achieve, grow and build. First, we'll achieve superior student outcomes by providing both high-quality education and student services. This is in line with our operating philosophy that ""Quality Leads to Growth"". 
[Indiscernible] (34:08), as we invest in academic quality, we help students achieve excellent outcomes and we help meet the needs of society and the employers who hire our graduates. This in turn results in better student retention and referrals, and continued enrollment growth, and all of these things generate the financial resources which we reinvest right back into the quality of our programs and services. And so it's a self-reinforcing cycle of sustainable growth. And it all begins with academic quality. An example of this strategy is the Student Central program that's being implemented across all DeVry University campuses and Rick mentioned this earlier. While we've invested nearly $9 million in this initiative, and we've hired approximately 200 additional career services advisors, financial literacy consultants and Student Central personnel. Another example of our strategy at work comes from Becker Professional Education. As you may know, and Rick mentioned earlier this as well, the CPA exam will expand to include a much broader range of subjects for 2011, so in response we're making a major investment in one of Becker's largest redevelopment efforts ever. As a result, all of our programs and materials for the 2011 CPA exam contain the latest information that our students will need to prepare for the new exam. And at Carrington College, by pursuing this strategy of achieving high-quality academic outcomes, eight out of nine eligible campuses qualified for honor roll status.
This was during a reaffirmation of accreditation by Carrington's accreditor ACICS. Given that ACICS awards this honor to less than 20% of its schools, we were very proud to have eight out of nine of our schools. The second strategy is to grow and to diversify into new curriculum areas, degree levels and geography. Chamberlain College of Nursing is expanding locations and launching new programs. The new RN to MSN degree program will respond to the increasing demand for nurses prepared at the Masters level, and through a joint program with DeVry University's Keller Graduate School of Management, Chamberlain is launching an online MSN/MBA program. 
At DeVry Brasil, we're growing by adding 30 new degree programs in the fields of Healthcare, Engineering and IT. These high-demand programs are a tremendous opportunity for us to meet student needs in Brazil. So diversification drives growth and diversification mitigates risk. Because we're less vulnerable to economic cycles and we're not overly dependent in any one program area. In fact, in the back of today's press release, we included some charts showing the progress we've made in our diversification strategy throughout curriculum areas, then there's a chart on degree level and geography. So whereas in 2002, we were 70% Technology programs and zero Healthcare, we're now broadly diversified across Technology, Business and Healthcare curriculum. So achieve student outcome, grow and diversify and, lastly, build a high-quality infrastructure to support our growth and to compete in an increasingly competitive market. This infrastructure comprises four areas: technology, online educational platform, a strong reputation and human resources, HR.
Project Delta is the largest investment we're making in our technology. This large-scale upgrade to DeVry University's and Chamberlain College of Nursing's IT infrastructure will both make our operations more efficient and save our students time that they can use to focus on their studies. Over the past several years, DeVry Online has done an excellent job of providing high-quality centralized services to support DeVry schools. Our strategy is to further leverage this capability at Carrington and by increasing the rate of new program development across all our schools.
The third part of our infrastructure is our reputation, our brand, if you will; what we stand for. When we were building it, it's through [ph] (38:09) increased civic engagement. We're giving back. We recently announced a major partnership with America's Promise Alliance, which was founded by General Colin Powell and with the support of President Obama and Secretary Duncan, the Alliance is focused on solving our country's high school dropout crisis. Over the next three years, DeVry will be donating $1.5 million to the Alliance and making additional in-kind contributions of up to $750,000 per year in each of the 10 cities where the Alliance operates. A key focus of this partnership will be expanding the Advantage Academy dual enrollment model in those cities.
When we announced this partnership, I got emails from across the DeVry family full of excitement and pride. It's emblematic of how DeVry's people are doing well by doing good and that leads me to the fourth element of this growth infrastructure. And that's our human resources.
Our goal is to be the employer of choice in education, and our diversified array of schools offer exceptional career development opportunities for our people. Two recent announcements illustrate this. John Roselli, who will be Becker's new President in the fall, has a tremendous foundation [indiscernible] (39:23) to build upon thanks to the work of his predecessor, Tom Vucinic, whom I personally would like to thank for his many years of exceptional service to DeVry. And also this fall, Steven Riehs will become President of a new organizational structure that will include Advanced Academics, Becker Professional Education, DeVry Brasil and our overall international business development efforts. But part of this HR infrastructure is our culture. DeVry's culture has always been founded on quality and integrity. And so when I think of building the growth infrastructure, I think of building a house. You don't build it from the top down. You start with the foundation, the infrastructure, so that as you build and grow, you're on a solid foundation. 
And so that's our strategy, achieve superior student outcomes through academic quality and student services, grow and diversify into new program areas, levels and geographies and build a high-quality infrastructure to support our growth.
We're heading into next year, into this new fiscal '11 for us. Our priorities are aligned with this strategy. And these are, first, achieving our academic quality goals, including exam results, higher retention and graduation rates as well as expanded student services. Second, in the grow category, expanding our Healthcare programs and locations to address the strong demand for medical professionals, expanding our Becker Professional Education segment into markets, continuing to develop internationally with DeVry Brasil, strengthening our high school programs while increasing synergies between Advanced Academics and our postsecondary schools. And in the build category, continuing to roll out Project Delta, continuing to develop our new online programs and strengthening our talent development and succession planning. So that's our strategy. 
And lastly, I'd like to take a moment to thank the more than 17,000 employees at DeVry who are helping to empower our students to achieve their educational and career goals. We delivered a very strong year of academic results in fiscal 2010 and it was due to their focus on our students. 
So with that, we'd be happy to take any questions. Joan?"

The details of it go far beyond the time that we have available on this call. And although we know our compliance program is very effective overall, we also know that exceptions can occur. That's true for any organization. So what's equally important is what we do when an error occurs or a problem occurs. And the answer is we take immediate corrective action. We walk the walk and we talk the talk on that. Many examples and we talk about that explicitly within DeVry as part of continuing to maintain and enhance our culture of accountability and integrity. An example, several years ago we became aware of an issue at one camp that related to this and once we investigated it, we promptly notified the Department of Education and terminated the employees who were responsible in that case. And so we do the right thing and we deal with it and I think that's what any organization has to do. I was at a meeting of business leaders a couple of months ago and Jeff Immelt of GE was there and he said, ""Look, I got 250,000 employees. I can guarantee you as sure as we're sitting here, 25 or 30 of them are doing something that I don't want them to be doing. The key is making sure that's an exception but also making sure what you do about it when it happens."" So these things can happen. But the key is how you deal with that and the key is how do you make sure you've got an overarching training and compliance program to ensure that, that is very much the exception and not the norm."

Looked like it was getting better and now, just today we had new unemployment claims go up again. So everybody's getting all squirrely about the economy and worried about that, and might that have a countercyclical tailwind, reemergence for those kinds of programs at Carrington. Again, for the DeVry family overall, not really countercyclical; but for Carrington specifically, yes, a little bit countercyclical. And at the same time we've had internal things going on, so it's been a little tough for us to get as strong of a read on that as we normally would because we have data points clouding our instrumentation here. The thing that is particular to us is this name change. We do think that's going to be strong for us. The early read is a very positive response to that and an increase in inquiries from prospective students. So yes, it's possible, and certainly that's what we're working toward, is to turn that around and get the positive new student and of course maintain total student enrollment growth at Carrington Colleges Group."

One is the competitive set and our schools often compete actually a lot less with other publicly held organizations that you might be very familiar with and much more so with many of the publicly sector institutions, state schools, and at Carrington it might be at the community college level, for example. And so we look at the competitive tuition increases that are out there and we've certainly seeing pretty big numbers; here in Illinois, I think like 11%, and I've seen mid-teens, even in California over 30% tuition increases. And so that certainly puts one perspective on it. Like in any endeavor in life, you look at what the competitors and what the others are doing. And then the other lens that we put on it is more internal, looking at our programs and the value proposition that our students receive. And so we've I think previously shared ROI, or ROE, our return an educational investment for our students. We've shared how over a 30 year period of time, if you take a look at the salaries that our graduates achieved, the kind of return on investments that they get, even with paying the tuition that they pay. And that's for many of our schools in the high 20s, even over 30% return on investment. Again, other than DeVry shares I'm not sure what else I could find that would have such a high return on investment. So we look at it from both those perspectives and that continues, no change there."

I'll do a brief introduction, and Rick will discuss our financial and enrollment result. And then, I'll provide a few operational highlights in the quarter, and then we'll up to questions. 
During the first quarter our continued focus on academic quality produced excellent student outcomes and strong financial results. In particular, our diversification strategy has enabled us to perform well throughout economic cycle and to be well positioned in these uncertain regulatory times. Let me step back and spend a few minutes in the vital role of private sector colleges in our higher education system. Because 20 years ago, the U.S. was first in the world in college attainment. Today, we ranked 12. 
Clearly, we're falling behind in terms of producing college graduates and part of the reason for this is insufficient educational capacity at our colleges. Is lack of capacity comes at a time when more good jobs have never require a college degree. President Obama has recognized the need to regain our educational leadership and recently said an ambitious goal of getting the U.S. back to number one in college attainment by increasing the number of people with college degrees by more than 8 million by 2020. 
Where is the capacity going to come from to educate America's work force? One of the great strengths is of the American System Higher Education is that the public sector, the private sector and independent universities also different niches that provide diversity of choice for students. In particular, the U.S. has a vibrant private sector that has shown a great ability to nimbly add capacity, good quality outcomes at a lower net cost to taxpayers. 
Last year, 54% of all new allied health workers and 10% of new nurses received their degrees from private sector colleges and universities. As you can see from Chart 1 of the press release, our public sector colleges cost tax payers $15,500 per student, private sector colleges cost taxpayers only $2,400 per student and this is after accounting for the cost of student loan default. And in fact, the private sectors schools pay taxes. This data, by the way, comes from an August 2010 study by Sonocom and it demonstrates the concerns about disproportionate assistance to private sector schools are misplaced. So increasing capacity is critical. The debt capacity must be of high quality. 
When it comes to measuring the outcomes, the students are in players evaluate the quality base in a new institution. Tax status for its lending source. Clearly, they don't. They look at measures like test scores or graduation rates and employment outcomes. In terms of employment outcomes, at DeVry University, we hold ourselves accountable to a goal that nine out of 10 graduates in the active job market will find employment in a chosen field of study within six months of graduation and we don't always hit the goal. This last year with a tough economy as you can see in today's release, 88.9% of DeVry University's graduate in the active job market were employed in their field of study within six months of graduation. 
Over the past 35 years, we have averaged over 90% and we hold ourselves accountable and do everything we can to help our students graduate and achieve their career goals across all our schools. If, for example, Karen Tater [ph] is one of several students we featured in our 2010 annual report. She recently the graduated with the BSN from DeVry Chamberlain College of Nursing. In credit to the support, she received from Chamberlain faculty and staff as being a major influence on her, as she prepared to enter the nursing profession. Karen is now employed as a trauma nurse at the Grant Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio. She's a greater representative Chamberlain's graduate. 
Another example is Shamsa Chaudhry who earned her bachelor's in Business Administration from DeVry University in 2002. She comes from an immigrant family and needed a school that will give her a quality education and the flexibility to work full-time. She found that DeVry University enable her to combine her creativity with technology in the digital world, and the result, she's the founder and CEO of Mojo Inc. and Interactive ad agency. These students are often called non-traditional, but they make up 75% of today's college graduates in today's college students. 
DeVry University has two campuses ranked in the top 10 schools producing African-American Bachelor's Degrees in Business. So DeVry and other private sector colleges are increasing access to many students who otherwise wouldn't have the opportunity, and we recognize that there is concerns with some private sector programs. We respect the students pay a lot of tuition and deserve value and the taxpayer dollars are involved. But it's critical that regulatory changes be done right and need to be based on facts and analysis and the need to consider the student population being served. Solutions must not unintentionally penalized quality programs and in so doing actually reduced access for students in this time of need. 
As a matter of policy, we should treat all students and all schools with the same standards of accountability and that's quality outcomes. No matter of the funding source. When we support the Education Department's recent announcement of increased enforcement resources, enforcement is an important way to accomplish the goal to holding all schools accountable for delivering quality programs. Now in terms of the ongoing regulatory process, recently the department extended a timeline for the proposed gainful employment regulation. That makes sense. As it's essential for the department to get a balanced view and to hear from schools like the DeVry that have a track record of delivering programs that lead to employment and to long-term careers for our students. 
We continue to have meetings to discuss our comments with the department, including the Secretary Duncan and with other department and administration officials. We appreciate this thoughtful approach by the department to allow for further dialogue to help ensure we get it right.  
In concurrent with looking with the department, we also have teams developing strategies to where we might need to make adjustments based on the new regulation depending on how they evolved. However, we aren't making large operational changes in anticipation of the new rules. Part of the reason for this is that DeVry is always focus on quality even though that it meant slower growth sometimes. For example, DeVry University is not an open enrollment institution. So we already turned away applicants who don't meet our admission standards. It's not like we're now for the first time having to implement these kinds of quality standards and having to go through a long process of figuring out what works. We feel very good about the value proposition offered by all our schools. So again, DeVry's focus on quality while servicing good stead over the long run. So with that introduction, let me turn it over to Rick for a review of DeVry's  financial highlights."

As you see in our press release, we delivered very strong results in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Quarterly revenue of $521 million was up about 21% versus prior year, all organic growth. After tax net in",1475,"Thanks, Daniel, and good afternoon, everyone. As you see in our press release, we delivered very strong results in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Quarterly revenue of $521 million was up about 21% versus prior year, all organic growth. After tax net income of $74 million increased 34% and earnings per share of $1.03 increased about 36% versus last year and our net income margin was 14.1% in the quarter, up 140 basis points versus the 12.7% margin achieved a year ago. We referenced first quarter results including expense related Share-Based Payment of approximately $5.3 million pretax or $4.6 million net of tax higher than last year driven by an increase in the number of retirement eligible awards. 
Our income tax provision this quarter was approximately $39 million and we had $23 million of capital spending, which we use to invest in our schools. Our overall effective tax rate was 34.5% in the quarter, up from 32% rate in the first quarter last year and 32.1% for the full fiscal year 2010, primarily due to the increase in domestic source income.
Cost of Educational Services expense increased by 16% versus prior year and student services and administrative expense increased by 17% in the quarter. Both lower than revenue growth and driving improved margins due to operating leverage. And just to note that educational service expense or cost of construction was approximately four times that of the advertising. We continue to make targeted increases to drive act them with quality and enhance student services consistent with our philosophy of quality leads to growth. Advertising expense, as a percentage of revenue, was 11.9% for the quarter. Now let me walk you through some of the key highlights of our operating segment results which are further detailed in our release.
First, the Business Technology and Management segment revenue was up about 25% versus prior year driven by summer enrollment growth coming from continued online expansion, improved campus enrollments and increased persistence as a result of our focus on student services. Segment earnings were $84.5 million in the quarter, up 51% versus prior year driven by the revenue growth and the resulting operating leverage. Well, of course, take your enrollment  for the September session, the Keller Graduate School of Management was up 14.1% versus prior year continuing the strong trend. 
We will report fall enrollment for DeVry University in December and while we expect Keller to maintain this trend, we expect to report a modest decline in new student enrollment for undergraduate students in this period. This is driven by continuing tough comps with fall 2009 growth of 19.4% on top of growth in fall of 2008 of 19.7%. Assuming a modest decline this fall, new student enrollment would grow at a compound annual rate of 11% to 12% over the past three years. It's also important to note that the new student enrollment will still be near record levels this term. 
During the recent period, we've seen decreased volume of higher quality increase coupled with lower conversion. One potential factor could be the difficult in uncertain external economic environment. Another factor contributing this is that we are below the number of admission advisers, we'd like to employ to serve our new and prospective students. We're actively hiring advisers to ensure we're meeting those students needs. 
And lastly, DeVry University shifted its advertising mix over the past year to include more internet related advertising. This channel hasn't provided as many inquiries as we anticipated and we're making adjustments to maximize our returns in this investment. Further, we believe the upcoming elections have crowded the TV airwaves with political ads making other advertising less effective. Once elections are over, we hope this phenomenon will subside. We do expect DeVry University undergraduate total student enrollment growth to be in the mid to high teens this fall. Our focus on academic quality and student services has continued to improve student persistence and is further aided by the roll out of student central across the system. We still believe that supply-demand relationship in value proposition for our programs remain strong over the long term and see no evidence that the deceleration is a long-term trend. 
Shifting to the Medical and Health Care segment, revenue was up about 17% in the quarter driven by the strong demand for Chamberlain Nursing programs and the opening of two new campuses during the quarter in Chicago and Arlington, Virginia. Segment earnings of $28.2 million were up about 4% versus prior year, generally as expected. As discussed during our last call, we moderated enrollment at Ross Medical School while working to add capacity. September term new student enrollment at Ross University was down 26% and total enrollments were down slightly versus prior year. 
We report near record enrollments in Carrington in December. However, early indications are that new student growth continues to decelerate and should moderately decline versus prior year. We expect a decrease in new student enrollments at Carrington in the mid-single digits and a decrease in total students in the low-single digits. 
In addition to the same type of external factors cited for DeVry University, Carrington continues to ramp up its new brand strategy and associated awareness effort while making internal changes, to complement this new strategy. While the initial feedback on the new name has been encouraging, the change to more brand advertising versus direct response did result in lower inquiry volume this past turn. The same change coupled with other internal changes we've made have contributed to near-term softness in enrollments. However, we're confident these initiatives will strengthen Carrington for the long term. Meanwhile, at Chamberlain College of Nursing, enrollment growth remains strong driven by the supply-demand in Dallas for qualified nurses. 
Within our Professional Education segment, revenue was up 4% versus prior year and segment earnings down just 1% in the quarter. Trends are better than what we saw a year ago, but we believe some of these recent revenue growth is attributed to activity in advance of the CPA exam change that is occurring January 2011. 
Lastly, our other Educational Services segment revenues were up 5% and segment earnings down about $1 million versus prior year. Advance Academic revenues were up primarily due to declines in summer school enrollments and the impact of safe budget deficits. Meanwhile, DeVry Brasil news students enrollment were up 9%, resulting from some of the admissions improvements made over the past year. 
Shifting to cash flow and balance sheet. Cash from operations was $196 million versus $177 million last year. The strong cash generation drove our cash and marketable securities balance to $453 million at the end of the quarter compared to $340 million last year. We also remain debt-free during the quarter compared to having an outstanding debt of $105 million last year. 
Our net accounts receivable balance was $161 million versus $157 million last year. This increase is attributable to revenue growth in the quarter as receivables per account across our schools are generally in line or lower than prior year. Receivables per account in DeVry University were also down compared to two prior years ago due to our efforts and focus of our campus and online student services staff. 
And I'd like to take a second to recognize the outstanding performance of our teams in managing this area, particularly during this tough economic times. Related to this, bad debt was 3% of revenue in the quarter compared to 3.4% a year ago. Another indicator of our students paying back their accounts during the tough times and a strong value proposition of our programs. As I mentioned earlier, capital spending was $23 million during the quarter versus $26.5 million spent last year, a bit lower just due to timing of spending between quarters. 
Spending was focused on Project Delta, facility improvements to better serve students within the DeVry University, Carrington and DeVry Brasil and expansion within Ross University and Chamberlain College of Nursing. So we could educate more doctors and nurses in this great time of need. Total capital spending for the fiscal year is expected to likely be in the $150 million range. 
Finally, during the quarter, we completed our third share repurchase program and seamlessly began executing our fourth program. For our third $50 million program, we repurchased approximately 972,000 shares, an average cost of $51.43 per share. Under the fourth program, we repurchased about 266,000 shares an average cost of $43.95 per share with about $38 million of authorized demand outstanding. 
So that concludes my overview of the strong results for the first quarter. We're up to a good start and our first quarter results put us in a good position to deliver our goal of roughly 20% earnings growth for fiscal 2011. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Daniel for some more color on our operating results."

Despite the potential softness in the fall that Rick described, both Keller Graduate School and Chamberlain expect to report continued solid growth rates and student persistence is up because of the investments we made in academic quality, which continues to drive solid growth in total enrollments. 
And recent example of this is in our Business Technology and Management segment. This is the continued investment we've made in our student central initiatives which provides students with a one-stop destination for curricular, career and financial services. The program has helped drive an increases in student persistence and are near completing our goal of having student central in every DeVry University location. We've received a lot of positive feedback on the career services we offer DeVry University undergraduate students and many have asked us to expand it to our graduate level. 
Well, we listened and in the first quarter, we began offering career services to all of our Keller graduate Schools of management student as well. DeVry University recently opened a new co-location in Pomona, California with Carrington College. In our first tri-location is a new word there between Ross University, DeVry University and Chamberlain is in the planning stages in Miramar, Florida. 
Let me move on to our Medical and Healthcare segment. At Ross University, enrollments were in line with our expectation as we work to expand capacity at Ross Medical School to help ease the growing physician shortage. We're still working to the approval processes with the next step being the medical board of California November meeting regarding our  Freeport, Grand Bahama's location. 
We continue to invest in academic quality at Ross and we are currently constructing new large-scale academic centers both the medical and veterinary school at our campuses in Dominica and in St. Kitts. Chamberlain College of Nursing continues to deliver strong result as the demand for highly skilled nurses has never been higher. Our students continue to value the quality of the course work and the flexibility that Chamberlain's programs provide. 
In September, Chamberlain launched an RN to MSN option that Masters of Science in Nursing. For RN, we already have an associate degree or a diploma in nursing to go up to the master's level. Chamberlain also submitted an application for a new location in Houston to be open in spring of 2011 pending approval. The new campus will be co-located in DeVry University.  
At Carrington, we continue to invest in academic quality and additional capacity. In addition to the new Pomona co-location campus that I mentioned, we expect to open a new campus in Muskie, Texas, which is just outside of Dallas, by the middle of next year pending approval. We're also expanding our program offerings with the launch of physical therapy programs across several new locations and four additional online associate degrees have already begun. 
Now turning to our Professional Education segment. We also continue to make investments in Becker's offering. In order to best position Becker to benefit when the economic climate and financial job market improved. Beginning in November, we'll be offering our revamped courses for the new 2011 CPA exam. We believe this new exam is a great opportunity unlike many of Becker's competitors most of whom are small. We believe our ability to make investments even during this down-cycle is a competitive advantage. 
This is a recurring theme for Becker. Whenever there's a change in the exam, Becker has a competitive advantage given its industry leadership and its access to the resources of DeVry. Becker also recently announced a new three-year partnership with London-based ATC International that will expand Becker's CFA and CPA program offerings into Central and Eastern Europe as well as into Central Asia. 
And finally in our other Educational Services segment, DeVry Brasil delivered solid growth in new student enrollments. When we first started our operations in Brazil, we saw a lot of potential. The team we have in place is doing an exceptional job implementing the processes, programs and facilities that are producing growth that's outpacing the overall Brazil market. As part of our long-term growth and diversification strategy, we'll continue to invest in Brazil. 
During the quarter, we increased the number of admission campus to better serve our current and prospective students. We also focused on expansion as we broke ground on a new campus for our verbose [ph] school. 
So in summary, our strategy are focusing on academic quality and our diversified growth continues to position us for sustainable long-term value creation. We remain extremely confident in our ability to meet our performance goals over the long term as we continue to focus on academic quality and successful student outcomes. With that, we'd be happy take your questions. Joan?"

We don't. We pay a base salary and we expect to continue to pay them a base salary. I don't think they're going to work for free. So no, we do not pay incentives or bonuses. That's one of the things that is so unfortunate about some of the reporting that's out there. Again, based on anecdotes and stories and not based on fact. The fact is that incentive compensation has already been, has been since 1992. There could be changes. We may need to make changes in our evaluation processes depending on the rules that are forthcoming, but we're going from situation where before you are paying a commission and after you're not. You have to make this massive adjustment. That's not the case."

I know it can be confusing sometimes when you talked about economic and cyclicality or counter cyclicality. And the big picture for the DeVry family is that overall our diversified family of schools helps us perform well in good and bad times because we do have some schools that are a little bit counter cyclical and Carrington would be one. On the other hand, we have other schools that have performed better in good times, Becker or Advanced Academics or other thing and then some that really are not cyclical one way or the other like nursing programs being the only publicly held organization with a medical school, veterinary school. That something that's unique to DeVry, that's non-cyclical. With regard to the counter cyclical impact that maybe we saw before, one of the things that we wondered and I think we talked a little bit about this is what happens if a recession persists and we really do not have a President for this. Since the Great Depression when Dr. Herman DeVry started DeVry University back in 1931. So we just have not seen the prolonged recession and the prolonged level of high unemployment to this extent for. So it could be that when it extends this long that the counter-cyclical boost that perhaps Carrington got earlier, maybe that's waning, and you're not seeing that anymore. One other comment on Carrington is that some of its programs are more countercyclical like the certificate level where other programs which has been the focus of our growth initiative at Carrington at the associate degree level and other programs like dental hygiene are not cyclical. So those programs should do well in good times and bad as well. So even in our most countercyclical school which is Carrington, our strategy is to reduce that cyclicality and have more of a steady performance in good times and bad."

We had gone into a marketing strategy about two years ago of putting more of an emphasis on brand marketing, relatively speaking and actually taking a strategy of driving a smaller number of higher quality leads but high-quality in the sense that they're more responsive, they're more likely to respond and to start. That was the thing that they are more less academically qualified something like that, and that cycle led to improved efficiency in our marketing process and then we took those extra resources and fold them back to academic quality initiatives and that cycle worked very well for us a couple of years ago. It worked very well for us last year, and we're just in the recent period of time seeing that didn't translate quite into the same effectiveness as we've seen before. That's where we're having to make some operational adjustments and management adjustment in the marketing operations in the buying that we're doing, but that's what we meant by the quality of inquiries.

So expanding capacity at Ross is a multifaceted approach, and so we are expecting as we used in line  with what we said before that January will continue to be a modest decline in new students and then, in May, we should start to see growth again."

I'll do a brief introduction, and Rick will discuss our financial and enrollment result. And then, I'll provide a few operational highlights in the quarter, and then we'll up to questions. 
During the first quarter our continued focus on academic quality produced excellent student outcomes and strong financial results. In particular, our diversification strategy has enabled us to perform well throughout economic cycle and to be well positioned in these uncertain regulatory times. Let me step back and spend a few minutes in the vital role of private sector colleges in our higher education system. Because 20 years ago, the U.S. was first in the world in college attainment. Today, we ranked 12. 
Clearly, we're falling behind in terms of producing college graduates and part of the reason for this is insufficient educational capacity at our colleges. Is lack of capacity comes at a time when more good jobs have never require a college degree. President Obama has recognized the need to regain our educational leadership and recently said an ambitious goal of getting the U.S. back to number one in college attainment by increasing the number of people with college degrees by more than 8 million by 2020. 
Where is the capacity going to come from to educate America's work force? One of the great strengths is of the American System Higher Education is that the public sector, the private sector and independent universities also different niches that provide diversity of choice for students. In particular, the U.S. has a vibrant private sector that has shown a great ability to nimbly add capacity, good quality outcomes at a lower net cost to taxpayers. 
Last year, 54% of all new allied health workers and 10% of new nurses received their degrees from private sector colleges and universities. As you can see from Chart 1 of the press release, our public sector colleges cost tax payers $15,500 per student, private sector colleges cost taxpayers only $2,400 per student and this is after accounting for the cost of student loan default. And in fact, the private sectors schools pay taxes. This data, by the way, comes from an August 2010 study by Sonocom and it demonstrates the concerns about disproportionate assistance to private sector schools are misplaced. So increasing capacity is critical. The debt capacity must be of high quality. 
When it comes to measuring the outcomes, the students are in players evaluate the quality base in a new institution. Tax status for its lending source. Clearly, they don't. They look at measures like test scores or graduation rates and employment outcomes. In terms of employment outcomes, at DeVry University, we hold ourselves accountable to a goal that nine out of 10 graduates in the active job market will find employment in a chosen field of study within six months of graduation and we don't always hit the goal. This last year with a tough economy as you can see in today's release, 88.9% of DeVry University's graduate in the active job market were employed in their field of study within six months of graduation. 
Over the past 35 years, we have averaged over 90% and we hold ourselves accountable and do everything we can to help our students graduate and achieve their career goals across all our schools. If, for example, Karen Tater [ph] is one of several students we featured in our 2010 annual report. She recently the graduated with the BSN from DeVry Chamberlain College of Nursing. In credit to the support, she received from Chamberlain faculty and staff as being a major influence on her, as she prepared to enter the nursing profession. Karen is now employed as a trauma nurse at the Grant Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio. She's a greater representative Chamberlain's graduate. 
Another example is Shamsa Chaudhry who earned her bachelor's in Business Administration from DeVry University in 2002. She comes from an immigrant family and needed a school that will give her a quality education and the flexibility to work full-time. She found that DeVry University enable her to combine her creativity with technology in the digital world, and the result, she's the founder and CEO of Mojo Inc. and Interactive ad agency. These students are often called non-traditional, but they make up 75% of today's college graduates in today's college students. 
DeVry University has two campuses ranked in the top 10 schools producing African-American Bachelor's Degrees in Business. So DeVry and other private sector colleges are increasing access to many students who otherwise wouldn't have the opportunity, and we recognize that there is concerns with some private sector programs. We respect the students pay a lot of tuition and deserve value and the taxpayer dollars are involved. But it's critical that regulatory changes be done right and need to be based on facts and analysis and the need to consider the student population being served. Solutions must not unintentionally penalized quality programs and in so doing actually reduced access for students in this time of need. 
As a matter of policy, we should treat all students and all schools with the same standards of accountability and that's quality outcomes. No matter of the funding source. When we support the Education Department's recent announcement of increased enforcement resources, enforcement is an important way to accomplish the goal to holding all schools accountable for delivering quality programs. Now in terms of the ongoing regulatory process, recently the department extended a timeline for the proposed gainful employment regulation. That makes sense. As it's essential for the department to get a balanced view and to hear from schools like the DeVry that have a track record of delivering programs that lead to employment and to long-term careers for our students. 
We continue to have meetings to discuss our comments with the department, including the Secretary Duncan and with other department and administration officials. We appreciate this thoughtful approach by the department to allow for further dialogue to help ensure we get it right.  
In concurrent with looking with the department, we also have teams developing strategies to where we might need to make adjustments based on the new regulation depending on how they evolved. However, we aren't making large operational changes in anticipation of the new rules. Part of the reason for this is that DeVry is always focus on quality even though that it meant slower growth sometimes. For example, DeVry University is not an open enrollment institution. So we already turned away applicants who don't meet our admission standards. It's not like we're now for the first time having to implement these kinds of quality standards and having to go through a long process of figuring out what works. We feel very good about the value proposition offered by all our schools. So again, DeVry's focus on quality while servicing good stead over the long run. So with that introduction, let me turn it over to Rick for a review of DeVry's  financial highlights.
"

As you see in our press release, we delivered very strong results in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Quarterly revenue of $521 million was up about 21% versus prior year, all organic growth. After tax net in",1475,"Thanks, Daniel, and good afternoon, everyone. As you see in our press release, we delivered very strong results in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Quarterly revenue of $521 million was up about 21% versus prior year, all organic growth. After tax net income of $74 million increased 34% and earnings per share of $1.03 increased about 36% versus last year and our net income margin was 14.1% in the quarter, up 140 basis points versus the 12.7% margin achieved a year ago. We referenced first quarter results including expense related Share-Based Payment of approximately $5.3 million pretax or $4.6 million net of tax higher than last year driven by an increase in the number of retirement eligible awards. 
Our income tax provision this quarter was approximately $39 million and we had $23 million of capital spending, which we use to invest in our schools. Our overall effective tax rate was 34.5% in the quarter, up from 32% rate in the first quarter last year and 32.1% for the full fiscal year 2010, primarily due to the increase in domestic source income.
Cost of Educational Services expense increased by 16% versus prior year and student services and administrative expense increased by 17% in the quarter. Both lower than revenue growth and driving improved margins due to operating leverage. And just to note that educational service expense or cost of construction was approximately four times that of the advertising. We continue to make targeted increases to drive act them with quality and enhance student services consistent with our philosophy of quality leads to growth. Advertising expense, as a percentage of revenue, was 11.9% for the quarter. Now let me walk you through some of the key highlights of our operating segment results which are further detailed in our release.
First, the Business Technology and Management segment revenue was up about 25% versus prior year driven by summer enrollment growth coming from continued online expansion, improved campus enrollments and increased persistence as a result of our focus on student services. Segment earnings were $84.5 million in the quarter, up 51% versus prior year driven by the revenue growth and the resulting operating leverage. Well, of course, take your enrollment  for the September session, the Keller Graduate School of Management was up 14.1% versus prior year continuing the strong trend. 
We will report fall enrollment for DeVry University in December and while we expect Keller to maintain this trend, we expect to report a modest decline in new student enrollment for undergraduate students in this period. This is driven by continuing tough comps with fall 2009 growth of 19.4% on top of growth in fall of 2008 of 19.7%. Assuming a modest decline this fall, new student enrollment would grow at a compound annual rate of 11% to 12% over the past three years. It's also important to note that the new student enrollment will still be near record levels this term. 
During the recent period, we've seen decreased volume of higher quality increase coupled with lower conversion. One potential factor could be the difficult in uncertain external economic environment. Another factor contributing this is that we are below the number of admission advisers, we'd like to employ to serve our new and prospective students. We're actively hiring advisers to ensure we're meeting those students needs. 
And lastly, DeVry University shifted its advertising mix over the past year to include more internet related advertising. This channel hasn't provided as many inquiries as we anticipated and we're making adjustments to maximize our returns in this investment. Further, we believe the upcoming elections have crowded the TV airwaves with political ads making other advertising less effective. Once elections are over, we hope this phenomenon will subside. We do expect DeVry University undergraduate total student enrollment growth to be in the mid to high teens this fall. Our focus on academic quality and student services has continued to improve student persistence and is further aided by the roll out of student central across the system. We still believe that supply-demand relationship in value proposition for our programs remain strong over the long term and see no evidence that the deceleration is a long-term trend. 
Shifting to the Medical and Health Care segment, revenue was up about 17% in the quarter driven by the strong demand for Chamberlain Nursing programs and the opening of two new campuses during the quarter in Chicago and Arlington, Virginia. Segment earnings of $28.2 million were up about 4% versus prior year, generally as expected. As discussed during our last call, we moderated enrollment at Ross Medical School while working to add capacity. September term new student enrollment at Ross University was down 26% and total enrollments were down slightly versus prior year. 
We report near record enrollments in Carrington in December. However, early indications are that new student growth continues to decelerate and should moderately decline versus prior year. We expect a decrease in new student enrollments at Carrington in the mid-single digits and a decrease in total students in the low-single digits. 
In addition to the same type of external factors cited for DeVry University, Carrington continues to ramp up its new brand strategy and associated awareness effort while making internal changes, to complement this new strategy. While the initial feedback on the new name has been encouraging, the change to more brand advertising versus direct response did result in lower inquiry volume this past turn. The same change coupled with other internal changes we've made have contributed to near-term softness in enrollments. However, we're confident these initiatives will strengthen Carrington for the long term. Meanwhile, at Chamberlain College of Nursing, enrollment growth remains strong driven by the supply-demand in Dallas for qualified nurses. 
Within our Professional Education segment, revenue was up 4% versus prior year and segment earnings down just 1% in the quarter. Trends are better than what we saw a year ago, but we believe some of these recent revenue growth is attributed to activity in advance of the CPA exam change that is occurring January 2011. 
Lastly, our other Educational Services segment revenues were up 5% and segment earnings down about $1 million versus prior year. Advance Academic revenues were up primarily due to declines in summer school enrollments and the impact of safe budget deficits. Meanwhile, DeVry Brasil news students enrollment were up 9%, resulting from some of the admissions improvements made over the past year. 
Shifting to cash flow and balance sheet. Cash from operations was $196 million versus $177 million last year. The strong cash generation drove our cash and marketable securities balance to $453 million at the end of the quarter compared to $340 million last year. We also remain debt-free during the quarter compared to having an outstanding debt of $105 million last year. 
Our net accounts receivable balance was $161 million versus $157 million last year. This increase is attributable to revenue growth in the quarter as receivables per account across our schools are generally in line or lower than prior year. Receivables per account in DeVry University were also down compared to two prior years ago due to our efforts and focus of our campus and online student services staff. 
And I'd like to take a second to recognize the outstanding performance of our teams in managing this area, particularly during this tough economic times. Related to this, bad debt was 3% of revenue in the quarter compared to 3.4% a year ago. Another indicator of our students paying back their accounts during the tough times and a strong value proposition of our programs. As I mentioned earlier, capital spending was $23 million during the quarter versus $26.5 million spent last year, a bit lower just due to timing of spending between quarters. 
Spending was focused on Project Delta, facility improvements to better serve students within the DeVry University, Carrington and DeVry Brasil and expansion within Ross University and Chamberlain College of Nursing. So we could educate more doctors and nurses in this great time of need. Total capital spending for the fiscal year is expected to likely be in the $150 million range. 
Finally, during the quarter, we completed our third share repurchase program and seamlessly began executing our fourth program. For our third $50 million program, we repurchased approximately 972,000 shares, an average cost of $51.43 per share. Under the fourth program, we repurchased about 266,000 shares an average cost of $43.95 per share with about $38 million of authorized demand outstanding. 
So that concludes my overview of the strong results for the first quarter. We're up to a good start and our first quarter results put us in a good position to deliver our goal of roughly 20% earnings growth for fiscal 2011.

Despite the potential softness in the fall that Rick described, both Keller Graduate School and Chamberlain expect to report continued solid growth rates and student persistence is up because of the investments we made in academic quality, which continues to drive solid growth in total enrollments. 
And recent example of this is in our Business Technology and Management segment. This is the continued investment we've made in our student central initiatives which provides students with a one-stop destination for curricular, career and financial services. The program has helped drive an increases in student persistence and are near completing our goal of having student central in every DeVry University location. We've received a lot of positive feedback on the career services we offer DeVry University undergraduate students and many have asked us to expand it to our graduate level. 
Well, we listened and in the first quarter, we began offering career services to all of our Keller graduate Schools of management student as well. DeVry University recently opened a new co-location in Pomona, California with Carrington College. In our first tri-location is a new word there between Ross University, DeVry University and Chamberlain is in the planning stages in Miramar, Florida. 
Let me move on to our Medical and Healthcare segment. At Ross University, enrollments were in line with our expectation as we work to expand capacity at Ross Medical School to help ease the growing physician shortage. We're still working to the approval processes with the next step being the medical board of California November meeting regarding our  Freeport, Grand Bahama's location. 
We continue to invest in academic quality at Ross and we are currently constructing new large-scale academic centers both the medical and veterinary school at our campuses in Dominica and in St. Kitts. Chamberlain College of Nursing continues to deliver strong result as the demand for highly skilled nurses has never been higher. Our students continue to value the quality of the course work and the flexibility that Chamberlain's programs provide. 
In September, Chamberlain launched an RN to MSN option that Masters of Science in Nursing. For RN, we already have an associate degree or a diploma in nursing to go up to the master's level. Chamberlain also submitted an application for a new location in Houston to be open in spring of 2011 pending approval. The new campus will be co-located in DeVry University.  
At Carrington, we continue to invest in academic quality and additional capacity. In addition to the new Pomona co-location campus that I mentioned, we expect to open a new campus in Muskie, Texas, which is just outside of Dallas, by the middle of next year pending approval. We're also expanding our program offerings with the launch of physical therapy programs across several new locations and four additional online associate degrees have already begun. 
Now turning to our Professional Education segment. We also continue to make investments in Becker's offering. In order to best position Becker to benefit when the economic climate and financial job market improved. Beginning in November, we'll be offering our revamped courses for the new 2011 CPA exam. We believe this new exam is a great opportunity unlike many of Becker's competitors most of whom are small. We believe our ability to make investments even during this down-cycle is a competitive advantage. 
This is a recurring theme for Becker. Whenever there's a change in the exam, Becker has a competitive advantage given its industry leadership and its access to the resources of DeVry. Becker also recently announced a new three-year partnership with London-based ATC International that will expand Becker's CFA and CPA program offerings into Central and Eastern Europe as well as into Central Asia. 
And finally in our other Educational Services segment, DeVry Brasil delivered solid growth in new student enrollments. When we first started our operations in Brazil, we saw a lot of potential. The team we have in place is doing an exceptional job implementing the processes, programs and facilities that are producing growth that's outpacing the overall Brazil market. As part of our long-term growth and diversification strategy, we'll continue to invest in Brazil. 
During the quarter, we increased the number of admission campus to better serve our current and prospective students. We also focused on expansion as we broke ground on a new campus for our verbose [ph] school. 
So in summary, our strategy are focusing on academic quality and our diversified growth continues to position us for sustainable long-term value creation. We remain extremely confident in our ability to meet our performance goals over the long term as we continue to focus on academic quality and successful student outcomes. With that, we'd be happy take your questions. Joan?

And in fact, most of our competition comes from the public sector schools the state schools as well as some of the independents that are out there. Only about 10% of the students that we survey at DeVry University specifically report, considering another private sector or proprietary school, quite interesting. So certainly competitive, but not a real drastic change there.

I know it can be confusing sometimes when you talked about economic and cyclicality or counter cyclicality.

That something that's unique to DeVry, that's non-cyclical. With regard to the counter cyclical impact that maybe we saw before, one of the things that we wondered and I think we talked a little bit about this is what happens if a recession persists and we really do not have a President for this.

So we just have not seen the prolonged recession and the prolonged level of high unemployment to this extent for. So it could be that when it extends this long that the counter-cyclical boost that perhaps Carrington got earlier, maybe that's waning, and you're not seeing that anymore. One other comment on Carrington is that some of its programs are more countercyclical like the certificate level where other programs which has been the focus of our growth initiative at Carrington at the associate degree level and other programs like dental hygiene are not cyclical. So those programs should do well in good times and bad as well. So even in our most countercyclical school which is Carrington, our strategy is to reduce that cyclicality and have more of a steady performance in good times and bad.

I think what we were -- let me give a little bit color on that with regard to DeVry University specifically. Something you hear us -- and Dave Pauldine at our Education Day back in Phoenix talk quite a bit about this. We had gone into a marketing strategy about two years ago of putting more of an emphasis on brand marketing, relatively speaking and actually taking a strategy of driving a smaller number of higher quality leads but high-quality in the sense that they're more responsive, they're more likely to respond and to start. That was the thing that they are more less academically qualified something like that, and that cycle led to improved efficiency in our marketing process and then we took those extra resources and fold them back to academic quality initiatives and that cycle worked very well for us a couple of years ago. It worked very well for us last year, and we're just in the recent period of time seeing that didn't translate quite into the same effectiveness as we've seen before. That's where we're having to make some operational adjustments and management adjustment in the marketing operations in the buying that we're doing, but that's what we meant by the quality of inquiries. It is more of the responsiveness and not the sort of academic preparedness.

I'll do a brief introduction, and Rick will discuss our financial and enrollment result. And then, I'll provide a few operational highlights in the quarter, and then we'll open up to questions. 
During the first quarter our continued focus on academic quality produced excellent student outcomes and strong financial results. In particular, our diversification strategy has enabled us to perform well throughout economic cycle and to be well positioned in these uncertain regulatory times. Let me step back and spend a few minutes in the vital role of private sector colleges in our higher education system. Because 20 years ago, the U.S. was first in the world in college attainment. Today, we ranked 12. 
Clearly, we're falling behind in terms of producing college graduates and part of the reason for this is insufficient educational capacity at our colleges. This lack of capacity comes at a time when more good jobs than ever require a college degree. President Obama has recognized the need to regain our educational leadership and recently set an ambitious goal of getting the U.S. back to number one in college attainment by increasing the number of people with college degrees by more than 8 million by 2020. 
Where is the capacity going to come from to educate America's work force? One of the great strengths of the American System Higher Education is that the public sector, the private sector and independent universities also different niches that provide diversity of choice for students. In particular, the U.S. has a vibrant private sector that has shown a great ability to nimbly add capacity, with quality outcomes at a lower net cost to taxpayers. 
Last year, 54% of all new allied health workers and 10% of new nurses received their degrees from private sector colleges and universities. As you can see from Chart 1 of the press release, our public sector colleges cost tax payers $15,500 per student, private sector colleges cost taxpayers only $2,400 per student and this is after accounting for the cost of student loan default. And the fact, the private sectors schools pay taxes. This data, by the way, comes from an August 2010 study by Sonocom and it demonstrates the concerns about disproportionate assistance to private sector schools are misplaced. So increasing capacity is critical. But that capacity must be of high quality. 
When it comes to measuring the outcomes, do students or employers evaluate the quality based on an institution's tax status or its funding source? Clearly, they don't. They look at measures like test scores or graduation rates and employment outcomes. In terms of employment outcomes, at DeVry University, we hold ourselves accountable to a goal that nine out of 10 graduates in the active job market will find employment in a chosen field of study within six months of graduation and we don't always hit the goal. This last year with a tough economy as you can see in today's release, 88.9% of DeVry University's graduate in the active job market were employed in their field of study within six months of graduation. 
Over the past 35 years, we have averaged over 90% and we hold ourselves accountable and do everything we can to help our students graduate and achieve their career goals across all our schools. If, for example, Karen Tater [ph] is one of several students we featured in our 2010 annual report. She recently the graduated with the BSN from DeVry Chamberlain College of Nursing and credited to the support she received from Chamberlain's faculty and staff as being a major influence on her as she prepared to enter the nursing profession. Karen is now employed as a trauma nurse at the Grant Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio. She's a great representative Chamberlain's graduate. 
Another example is Shamsa Chaudhry who earned her bachelor's in Business Administration from DeVry University in 2002. She comes from an immigrant family and needed a school that would give her a quality education and the flexibility to work full-time. She found that DeVry University enable her to combine her creativity with technology in the digital world, and the result, she's the founder and CEO of Mojo, Inc. and Interactive ad agency. These students are often called non-traditional, but they make up 75% of today's college graduates and today's college students. 
DeVry University has two campuses ranked in the top 10 schools producing African-American Bachelor's Degrees in Business. So DeVry and other private sector colleges are increasing access to many students who otherwise wouldn't have the opportunity, and we recognize that there is concerns with some private sector programs. We respect that students pay a lot of tuition and deserve value and the taxpayer dollars are involved. But it's critical that regulatory changes be done right and need to be based on facts and analysis and the need to consider the student population being served. Solutions must not unintentionally penalize quality programs and in so doing actually reduce access for students in this time of need. 
As a matter of policy, we should treat all students and all schools with the same standards of accountability and that's quality outcomes, no matter of the funding source. When we support the Education Department's recent announcement of increased enforcement resources, enforcement is an important way to accomplish the goal to holding all schools accountable for delivering quality programs. Now in terms of the ongoing regulatory process, recently the department extended a timeline for the proposed gainful employment regulation. That makes sense, as it's essential for the department to get a balanced view and to hear from schools like the DeVry that have a track record of delivering programs that lead to employment and to long-term careers for our students. 
We continue to have meetings to discuss our comments with the department, including Secretary Duncan and with other department and administration officials. We appreciate this thoughtful approach by the department to allow for further dialogue to help ensure we get it right.  
And concurrent with working with the department, we also have teams developing strategies to where we might need to make adjustments based on the new regulation depending on how they evolve. However, we aren't making large operational changes in anticipation of the new rules. Part of the reason for this is that DeVry is always focused on quality even though that it meant slower growth sometimes. For example, DeVry University is not an open enrollment institution. So we already turn away applicants who don't meet our admission standards. It's not like we're now for the first time having to implement these kinds of quality standards and having to go through a long process of figuring out what works. We feel very good about the value proposition offered by all our schools. So again, DeVry's focus on quality will serve us in good stead over the long run. So with that introduction, let me turn it over to Rick for a review of DeVry's  financial highlights."

As you see in our press release, we delivered very strong results in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Quarterly revenue of $521 million was up about 21% versus prior year, all organic growth. After tax net in",1471,"Thanks, Daniel, and good afternoon, everyone. As you see in our press release, we delivered very strong results in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Quarterly revenue of $521 million was up about 21% versus prior year, all organic growth. After tax net income of $74 million increased 34% and earnings per share of $1.03 increased about 36% versus last year and our net income margin was 14.1% in the quarter, up 140 basis points versus the 12.7% margin achieved a year ago. We referenced first quarter results including expense related Share-Based Payment of approximately $5.3 million pretax or $4.6 million net of tax higher than last year driven by an increase in the number of retirement eligible awards. 
Our income tax provision this quarter was approximately $39 million and we had $23 million of capital spending, which we used to invest in our schools. Our overall effective tax rate was 34.5% in the quarter, up from 32% rate in the first quarter last year and 32.1% for the full fiscal year 2010, primarily due to the increase in domestic source income.
Cost of Educational Services expense increased by 16% versus prior year and student services and administrative expense increased by 17% in the quarter. Both lower than revenue growth and driving improved margins due to operating leverage. And just to note that educational service expense or cost of construction was approximately four times that of advertising. We continue to make targeted increases to drive academic quality and enhance student services consistent with our philosophy of quality leads to growth. Advertising expense, as a percentage of revenue, was 11.9% for the quarter. Now let me walk you through some of the key highlights of our operating segment results which are further detailed in our release.
First, the Business Technology and Management segment revenue was up about 25% versus prior year driven by summer enrollment growth coming from continued online expansion, improved campus enrollments and increased persistence as a result of our focus on student services. Segment earnings were $84.5 million in the quarter, up 51% versus prior year driven by the revenue growth and the resulting operating leverage. Total coursetaker enrollment  for the September session, the Keller Graduate School of Management was up 14.1% versus prior year continuing the strong trend. 
We will report fall enrollment for DeVry University in December and while we expect Keller to maintain this trend, we expect to report a modest decline in new student enrollment for undergraduate students in this period. This is driven by continuing tough comps with fall 2009 growth of 19.4% on top of growth in fall of 2008 of 19.7%. Assuming a modest decline this fall, new student enrollment would grow at a compound annual rate of 11% to 12% over the past three years. It's also important to note that the new student enrollment will still be near record levels this term. 
During the recent period, we've seen decreased volume of higher quality inquiry flow coupled with lower conversion. One potential factor could be the difficult and uncertain external economic environment. Another factor contributing this is that we are below the number of admission advisors we'd like to employ to serve our new and prospective students. We're actively hiring advisors to ensure we're meeting those students needs. 
And lastly, DeVry University shifted its advertising mix over the past year to include more internet related advertising. This channel hasn't provided as many inquiries as we anticipated and we're making adjustments to maximize our returns on this investment. Further, we believe the upcoming elections have crowded the TV airwaves with political ads making other advertising less effective. Once elections are over, we hope this phenomenon will subside. We do expect DeVry University undergraduate total student enrollment growth to be in the mid to high teens this fall. Our focus on academic quality and student services has continued to improve student persistence and is further aided by the roll out of Student Central across the system. We still believe that supply-demand relationship in value proposition for our programs remain strong over the long term and see no evidence that the deceleration is a long-term trend. 
Shifting to the Medical and Health Care segment, revenue was up about 17% in the quarter driven by the strong demand for Chamberlain's Nursing programs and the opening of two new campuses during the quarter in Chicago and Arlington, Virginia. Segment earnings of $28.2 million were up about 4% versus prior year, generally as expected. As discussed during our last call, we moderated enrollments at Ross Medical School while working to add capacity. September term new student enrollment at Ross University was down 26% and total enrollments were down slightly versus prior year. 
We'll report near record enrollments in Carrington in December. However, early indications are that new student growth continues to decelerate and should moderately decline versus prior year. We expect a decrease in new student enrollments at Carrington in the mid-single digits and a decrease in total students in the low-single digits. 
In addition to the same type of external factors cited for DeVry University, Carrington continues to ramp up its new brand strategy and associated awareness effort while making internal changes to complement this new strategy. While the initial feedback on the new name has been encouraging, the change to more brand advertising versus direct response did result in lower inquiry volume this past term. This name change coupled with other internal changes we've made have contributed to near-term softness in enrollments. However, we're confident these initiatives will strengthen Carrington for the long term. Meanwhile, at Chamberlain College of Nursing, enrollment growth remains strong driven by the supply-demand imbalance for qualified nurses. 
Within our Professional Education segment, revenue was up 4% versus prior year and segment earnings down just 1% in the quarter. Trends are better than what we saw a year ago, but we believe some of these recent revenue growth is attributed to activity in advance of the CPA exam change that is occurring January 2011. 
Lastly, our other Educational Services segment revenues were up 5% and segment earnings down about $1 million versus prior year. Advance Academic revenues were up primarily due to declines in summer school enrollments and the impact of state budget deficits. Meanwhile, DeVry Brasil new student enrollment were up 9%, resulting from some of the admissions improvements made over the past year. 
Shifting to cash flow and balance sheet. Cash from operations was $196 million versus $177 million last year. The strong cash generation drove our cash and marketable securities balance to $453 million at the end of the quarter compared to $340 million last year. We also remain debt-free during the quarter compared to having an outstanding debt of $105 million last year. 
Our net accounts receivable balance was $161 million versus $157 million last year. This increase is attributable to revenue growth in the quarter as receivables per account across our schools are generally in line or lower than prior year. Receivables per account within DeVry University were also down compared to two prior years ago due to our efforts and focus of our campus and online student services staff. 
And I'd like to take a second to recognize the outstanding performance of our teams in managing this area, particularly during this tough economic times. Related to this, bad debt was 3% of revenue in the quarter compared to 3.4% a year ago. Another indicator of our students paying back their accounts during the tough times and a strong value proposition of our programs. As I mentioned earlier, capital spending was $23 million during the quarter versus $26.5 million spent last year, a bit lower just due to timing of spending between quarters. 
Spending was focused on Project Delta, facility improvements to better serve students within the DeVry University, Carrington and DeVry Brasil and expansion within Ross University and Chamberlain College of Nursing, so we can educate more doctors and nurses in this great time of need. Total capital spending for the fiscal year is expected to likely be in the $150 million range. 
Finally, during the quarter, we completed our third share repurchase program and seamlessly began executing our fourth program. For our third $50 million program, we repurchased approximately 972,000 shares, an average cost of $51.43 per share. Under the fourth program, we repurchased about 266,000 shares an average cost of $43.95 per share with about $38 million of authorized amount outstanding. 
So that concludes my overview of the strong results for the first quarter. We're off to a good start and our first quarter results put us in a good position to deliver our goal of roughly 20% earnings growth for fiscal 2011. With that, now let me turn the call back over to Daniel for some more color on our operating results."

Despite the potential softness in the fall that Rick described, both Keller Graduate School and Chamberlain expect to report continued solid growth rates and student persistence is up because of the investments we made in academic quality, which continues to drive solid growth in total enrollments. 
A recent example of this is in our Business Technology and Management segment. This is the continued investment we've made in our Student Central initiatives which provides students with a one-stop destination for curricular, career and financial services. The program has helped drive an increases in student persistence and are near completing our goal of having Student Central in every DeVry University location. We've received a lot of positive feedback on the career services we offer DeVry University undergraduate students and many have asked us to expand it to our graduate level. 
Well, we listened and in the first quarter, we began offering career services to all of our Keller graduate School of management student as well. DeVry University recently opened a new co-location in Pomona, California with Carrington College. In our first tri-location, there's a new word there, between Ross University, DeVry University and Chamberlain is in the planning stages in Miramar, Florida. 
Let me move on to our Medical and Healthcare segment. At Ross University, enrollments were in line with our expectation as we work to expand capacity at Ross Medical School to help ease the growing physician shortage. We're still working through the approval processes with the next step being the medical board of California November meeting regarding our Freeport, Grand Bahama location. 
We continue to invest in academic quality at Ross and we are currently constructing new large-scale academic centers both the medical and veterinary school at our campuses in Dominica and in St. Kitts. Chamberlain College of Nursing continues to deliver strong results as the demand for highly skilled nurses has never been higher. Our students continue to value the quality of the course work and the flexibility that Chamberlain's programs provide. 
In September, Chamberlain launched an RN to MSN option, that's Masters of Science in Nursing for RNs who already have an associate degree or a diploma in nursing to go up to the master's level. Chamberlain also submitted an application for a new location in Houston to be open in spring of 2011 pending approval. The new campus will be co-located with DeVry University.  
At Carrington, we continue to invest in academic quality and additional capacity. In addition to the new Pomona co-location campus that I mentioned, we expect to open a new campus in Mesquite, Texas, which is just outside of Dallas, by the middle of next year pending approvals. We're also expanding our program offerings with the launch of physical therapy programs across several new locations and four additional online associate degrees that have already begun. 
Now turning to our Professional Education segment. We also continue to make investments in Becker's offering. In order to best position Becker to benefit when the economic climate and financial job market improved. Beginning in November, we'll be offering our revamped courses for the new 2011 CPA exam. We believe this new exam is a great opportunity unlike many of Becker's competitors most of whom are small. We believe our ability to make investments even during this down-cycle is a competitive advantage. 
This is a recurring theme for Becker. Whenever there's a change in the exam, Becker has a competitive advantage given its industry leadership and its access to the resources of DeVry. Becker also recently announced a new three-year partnership with London-based ATC International that will expand Becker's CFA and CPA program offerings into Central and Eastern Europe as well as into Central Asia. 
And finally in our Other Educational Services segment, DeVry Brasil delivered solid growth in new student enrollments. When we first started our operations in Brazil, we saw a lot of potential. The team we have in place is doing an exceptional job implementing the processes, programs and facilities that are producing growth that's outpacing the overall Brazil market. As part of our long-term growth and diversification strategy, we'll continue to invest in Brazil. 
During the quarter, we increased the number of admission counselors to better serve our current and prospective students. We also focused on expansion as we broke ground on a new campus for our Ruy Barbosa school. 
So in summary, our strategy of focusing on academic quality and our diversified growth continues to position us for sustainable long-term value creation.

I know it can be confusing sometimes when you talked about economic and cyclicality or counter cyclicality. And the big picture for the DeVry family is that overall our diversified family of schools helps us perform well in good and bad times because we do have some schools that are a little bit counter cyclical and Carrington would be one. On the other hand, we have other schools that have performed better in good times, Becker or Advanced Academics or other thing and then some that really are not cyclical one way or the other like nursing programs being the only publicly held organization with a medical school, veterinary school. That something that's unique to DeVry, that's non-cyclical. With regard to the counter cyclical impact that maybe we saw before, one of the things that we had wondered and I think we talked a little bit about this is what happens if a recession persists and we really do not have a precedent for this since the Great Depression when Dr. Herman DeVry started DeVry University back in 1931. So we just have not seen the prolonged recession and the prolonged level of high unemployment to this extent before. So it could be that when it extends this long that the counter-cyclical boost that perhaps Carrington got earlier, maybe that's waning, and you're not seeing that anymore. One other comment on Carrington is that some of its programs are more countercyclical like the certificate level whereas other programs which has been the focus of our growth initiative at Carrington at the associate degree level and other programs like dental hygiene are not cyclical. So those programs should do well in good times and bad as well. So even in our most countercyclical school which is Carrington, our strategy is to reduce that cyclicality and have more of a steady performance in good times and bad."

That was the thing that they are more less academically qualified something like that, and that cycle led to improved efficiency in our marketing process and then we took those extra resources and plowed them back to academic quality initiatives and that cycle worked very well for us a couple of years ago.

And so our schools that has national accreditations which will be Carrington College as the State of Carrington College in California is nationally accredited and ACICS [Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools] has a process of review and a set of standards for how those employment statistics are tracked and the survey methodology. So there is, there's actually a whole body of knowledge. There's a whole established set of processes which we think, by the way, are a great way of measuring gainful employment, and we have proposed that as an additional set of rules that regulators might want to consider using when they measured gainful employment. So we have very high degree of confidence in the processes and in the audit that goes on top of those processes in the area of employment statistics."

Is it becoming more expensive to acquire the leads that you believe are going to lead to a successful DeVry enrollment and graduate or are you not seeing anything necessarily different in that particular marketplace relative to competition?"
