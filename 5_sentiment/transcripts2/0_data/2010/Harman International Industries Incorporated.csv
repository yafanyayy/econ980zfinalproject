I’m joined in Stanford, Connecticut today by Herbert Parker, our Chief Financial Officer, and Bob Lardon, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Along with our second quarter results outlined in the press release issued this afternoon, I would like to call your attention to a set of supporting slides that has been posted with our press release on www.businesswire.com and in the Investor Relations portion of our company’s website www.harman.com. I will mention several of these slides during our discussion. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Harman’s performance in the second quarter demonstrates that our efforts to increase operational efficiency, accelerate product innovation and optimize our cost structure are delivering results. Combined with some encouraging improvement in key markets, these efforts have translated to growth at the top and bottom line.
Our net sales showed a gain of 24% compared both to last quarter and to the same quarter last year. This general improvement in market demand and significant innovation programs were complemented by our continued efforts to achieve best-in-class cost structure and efficiency.
Our STEP Change program has delivered $285 million in permanent cost savings through December 31, 2009 and it remains ahead of our own target. I’m pleased to say that we have also been successful in driving these cost savings through to the earnings line, demonstrated by an operating profit of $53 million for the quarter.
As you can see by the comparisons on slide four and slide five, we are encouraged both by the double-digit sales increase and by our continued quarter-over-quarter improvement at the earnings line. We continue to take aggressive steps to manage our liquidity and our cash position remains strong.
Our note holders have recently shown an additional vote of confidence by amending a debt covenant that now allows us to revolve our credit facility. By paying down the revolver, we will reduce interest costs while maintaining the flexibility to adjust our cash position as necessary.
To help you better understand the key pillars of our strategy, please turn now to slide six and seven. We have tried to condense our detailed strategy into four strategic pillars. As shown, we will continue to invest in our automotive business to expand our technological leadership and Smart Infotainment Solutions, energy-saving technologies geared to the coming wave of Electric & Hybrid cars, and many similar innovations in the field. We will nurture and grow our leading audio brands across the automotive, professional and consumer segments. We will continue our successful programs to achieve best-in-class capital and cost structures.
Finally, while acknowledging the challenges posted by the fragile global marketplace, we will aggressively position our respective brands to grow our businesses in both traditional and emerging markets. That pretty much captures the strategic initiatives our company is taking.
Before I ask Herbert Parker to offer a closer review of our second quarter performance, I’ll share some other highlights of our business and current strategic initiatives. In our Automotive Division, I’m pleased to say that we once again achieved double-digit sales growth on both a sequential and year-over-year basis.
During the first half of fiscal year 2010, automakers rewarded our track record of program execution and product innovation with more than $2 billion in new business. Including these, we had now secured automotive orders in excess of $10 billion.
During our last call, I shared with you our infotainment wins with Daimler for Mercedes S-Class and C-Class models, with BMW for its full range of future models, including Mini & Rolls Royce, and very important breakthrough with Toyota for vehicles sold in Europe beginning in calendar 2011.
We are continuing our discussions with many leading additional automakers toward additional opportunities that leverage both our premium and mid-market systems. As shown on slide number eight, these in infotainment awards were augmented during the second quarter by new launches of our premium branded auto systems.
Commonwealth now provide a Mark Levinson’s branded Premium Surround Sound system for the 2010 model Lexus GX 460 and JBL branded Premium Sound System for the 2011 Toyota, Sienna in the U.S. market. Chrysler has awarded us recently the Infinity branded audio systems for next-generation premium SRT vehicles, beginning with model year 2012.
We continued to conduct aggressive marketing programs with these and other OEMs to develop and help inform their customers and maximize penetration rates. As we continue to optimize our operations along core competencies the Harman Automotive Division has decided to close down its Portable Navigation Device or PND business altogether.
In this area, in the area of embedded systems and navigation, which is our core competency, we announced a partnership with Neusoft Corporation that is China’s largest information technology solution provider; to gain access to new advanced technologies and to accelerate our own development. This relationship will enable us to downsize and eventually eliminate two engineering sites in Germany.
Please move now to slide number 10 for a recap of our Professional Division achievements. Harman audio systems were utilized during the quarter by such leading names as top GRAMMY winner Taylor Swift, Alice Cooper, Metallica and the world champion New York Yankees.
Harman Professional equipment was commissioned at new audio installations around the world including some worth taking names; New York’s Lincoln Center, The Parliament of Norway and at China’s National Day Celebration. The City Center Las Vegas complex, one of the largest construction projects in the US opened in December with audio systems by Harman.
During the last week end in January, our professional achievements were highlighted to a global audience at the 2010 GRAMMY Awards as our own premium Headphones and Microphone brand AKG take home a GRAMMY for technical achievement, following similar recognition for our JBL loudspeaker brand in 2005. Let me tell you, how proud I’m to share that Harman has now became the only company ever to win two prestigious GRAMMY Awards. 
More than 25 new products were introduced by the professional division during the quarter leveraging the power of Harman’s advanced HiQnet protocol for system integration. Nearly 200 Harman’s professional channels partners met last months to test drive this new technology during the divisions, international business and technology conference and subsequent NAMM division in Los Angels.
Please now move to slide 11 for some highlights from our consumer business. The Harman consumer division successfully launched 15 new products during the quarter including JBL Creature III, Multimedia Speakers and the Harman Kardon GLA-55 Desktop Crystal Speaker System, absolute must for any executive or any audio files to have, each of which was permanently featured at Apple electronics stores worldwide during the holiday shopping season.
The decision was announced in January that it has launched a new JBL Branded docking system for Sony Walkman digital media player in Japan and we are also as we speak featuring selected JBL product in Sony Style stores throughout Canada, that’s another breakthrough for us. Other JBL projects were featured during the holiday season on the very popular Ellen DeGeneres “12 Days of Christmas” television segment reaching an audience of 100 million.
The consumer divisions sound provision initiative with Europe’s largest retailer called Media Saturn Holdings exceeded our own expectation and their own expectation with strong holiday sales for premium virtual surround sound system bundled with flat-screen televisions. Harman store-within-a-store installations also opened in several flagship store in Saturn and holding companies in many cities in Europe. 
Please move now to slide number 12; a new addition to our deck, which is the dashboard of our strategic value drivers. I’m very happy to keep making our slide deck for you a best practice in the Investor Relations and with this dashboard, you can quickly get the glance of what the company is driving, what are the true value creation activities in the company for shareholders.
As shown, we continue to execute ahead of schedule on our STEP Change cost savings program with $285 million in permanent savings realized to-date, to the target of $245 million. To help you better understand how these savings support other key operational metrics, we are adding several elements to the dashboards. These include our global footprint index. 
Our R&D and engineering as a percent of sales is our aggressive strategy to increase Harman’s business in China. To further highlight our strategy, we will host an Investor and Analyst Day in New York City on April 29 this year, following our third quarters result. You will have the opportunity to meet several key members of our team and we will provide mid term targets for fiscal year 2013 during Investor and Analyst Day. Our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker will share additional information on this event in a few minutes. 
In summary ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have built a solid foundation for sustainable improvement. Before I turn it over to Herbert Parker, let me recap our position very quickly. We remain profitable for the first full fiscal year and improving market conditions, our driving sequential and year-over-year top line growth. Our competitive position has never been stronger.
Our Automotive Division enjoyed awarded business in excess of $10 billion. Across all our divisions, new integrated marketing activities are unlocking the real power of Harman’s family event and we will continue to invest strategically in this area. Our investment in innovation is driving customer wins, creating differentiation and gaining market share.
We have ample cash and liquidity to execute on our STEP Change program to innovate and to see new opportunities for growth. We have achieved $285 million permanent cost savings that is money in the bank and we are ahead schedule towards our goal of $400 million permanent savings for the company. Our strategies to expand how much footprint and market share in the emerging markets are well underway and we will continue to deepen our roots in these important reasons.
Thank you for your attention and I will now ask Herbert to provide a closer look at our quarterly results.

Good afternoon everyone. As you have already heard from Dinesh, we turn in a good quarter and our cost saving productivity players continue to be reflected in our financial results and to help you identify the specific improvements related to these cost saving productivity plans. I would now present a few more details on the financials so that this will hopefully give you a better understanding about development during this quarter.
As mentioned in our previous calls and for the benefit of our new investors, most of our financial comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes restructuring costs and goodwill write-offs and as usual, you will find a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results in our press release, which was issued earlier today, but for your ease of reference, these non-GAAP costs totaled $13 million for the quarter.
Okay, let’s start with the top line. In the second quarter our sales increased across all divisions on a year-over-year comparison and this was basically a result of improved global economic conditions that’s combined with market gains.
Now moving on to quantify these improvements, we are pleased to report that our sales for the second quarter were $937 million, which is a 24% increase over the same period of last year. If we exclude foreign currency translation our sales increased 15%.
On a sequential basis our sales increased the same as it did on a year-over-year basis which was 24% as I just mentioned. This significant improvement was led by the automotive division which had a 23% increase. I would like to make it on, that this is a third consecutive quarter we have had sequential improvement on top line.
Now moving on to the production cost area, we reported a gross profit margin of 27.9% compared to 23.7% in the same period last year. This margin increase was primarily due to a higher factory utilization associated with the increased sales and improved productivity as a result of our STEP Change permanent savings cost initiative.
Our SG&A expense for the second quarter was $209 million compared to $195 billion last year of which R&D costs were $82 million and $84 million respectively. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation SG&A expense was basically the same.
Now moving on down to the bottom line, we continued to improve our profitability and we’ve reported an operating profit of $53 million, compared to an operating loss of $16 million last year. Our net income for the second quarter was $28 million; our earnings was $0.40 per share, compared to a net loss of $13 million or $0.21 per share in the same period last year. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34%, which includes the effects of restructuring expenses and goodwill charges.
Moving on to our cash, our December cash in short term investment balance was $630 million, compared to $535 million at the end of September as reported in our prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to positive income from operations during the quarter as well as a decrease in working capital.
Now, I think that is important for me to inform you of a subsequent event through our efficient second quarter results. In mid-January, our cash and short term investment balance was reduced by $223 million, as we paid down the existing balance of our revolving credit facility.
As you may recall, we earlier issued a press release to announce that our note holders have agreed to amend the debt covenant that allows us to revolve our credit facility. This amendment allows us to pay down the revolver, thus minimizing interest cost while still maintain in excess to the liquidity to support our growth initiatives if needed.
Now in closing, we believe files return into a positive earnings per share, underscores our commitment to continuous improvement and a culture of accountability. Also, we now believe that market visibility has been improved to a level that can give us some confidence, make us some reasonable assumptions. Therefore as Dinesh mentioned earlier, we will host an Investor Analyst Day on April 29, and at that time we will issue our mid term targets for our fiscal year 2013.
At this point, I’d like to thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions. Operator, please open the call for questions.

So this will be facing out as we start to build more and more IP and development of embedded systems, and other technology and navigation. 
In terms of savings, you could include that in the STEP Change; I mean we are ahead of our STEP Change. So we’d probably continue to remain ahead of the STEP Change, but right now we are not separating any other initiatives outside of STEP Change Himanshu. In terms of number of people, I believe the total number would be just north of 200 among these two sites in total.

It just seems like either the cost savings are fairly lumpy and maybe you do hit a bit of a plateau near term on the rate of incremental cost savings, or is it fair to say that 400 number needs to be revised up at some stage?

So in few words, we already exceeded our annual target, but we did not stop, so savings continued to come in the second half.
So what I’m saying, we’ll obviously exceed fiscal year 2010 savings target we already have. So count on it that we’ll be inching towards $400 million target. Where do we end up? I don’t know yet. So it’s not lumpy. It is pretty sustainable. As you can see quarter-over-quarter, we are exceeding pretty proportionally same amount.
Other part of your question, should we revise the target $400 million? From the mathematical point of view, one can make a case, but from the philosophy and organizational culture point of view, one should never revise because we’ve made a target, we’ve hold people accountable, people get paid on these deliveries, real money once it’s recognized and CFOs sign off on them.
So we will close this program as of June 30, 2010, which is only five months from now and at that point we would have on a run rate basis, all savings realized, but full savings of 400 in the bottom line, that only happens in fiscal ‘11. Now that does mean we will stop multiple initiatives that are underway or we have recognized few more areas of few additional areas for savings. So at this point it’s safe to save we will exceed $400 million target by how much we will share in the next coming quarter Himanshu.

At this point for the simplicity sake we have broken down these targets by division in the same proportion as our current revenue is. That is 70% to come from automotive, 20% to come from professional and 10% from consumer. 
I have a feeling these numbers will change because all three divisions are going to grow very rapidly, and in terms of branded audio versus infotainment, both will grow rapidly because if you look at any automotive statistics, Chinese infotainment in-dash system and Chinese appetite for branded audio system is the highest or one of the highest in world right now. So, when we start to fairly low number because traditionally we never forecast in China, India, Brazil, we are starting to do that; that’s why this is part of our strategy.
So we are a small number right now. We will easily double and triple in next couple of years organically, but we also have clear desires and we are well underway to acquire either further distribution channel access or for the footprint for some technology access, we’ll acquire small companies, $20 million, $30 million, $50 million; $80 million worth, but the good thing is between the CFO and myself, we both have first hand experience living there and working there for a number of years and we understand how business is done.
So we feel very comfortable to achieve by 2015 this $1 billion target of revenue in China, and as time goes by, we’ll start to share with you in the same dashboard for Brazil and India, but China is the elephant in the room, and I think it’s sufficient we give you that.

So this is a sustainable improvement. As sales go up, don’t expect SG&A to go up the same way. Our R&D engineering on the dashboard has come down. In fiscal ‘09 we had 11.5% of the sales and as of December 31, percent of engineering in R&D our sales is 9.6%. So we’ve been working on all fronts to bring about sustainable, permanent, efficiency gain. So it’s all around improvement in gross margin and also SG&A across all fronts with efficiency gains.

So that continues to sort of create some concerns for us, but Europe did very well for us and international, that is big countries like Brazil, China and India.
They are stepping up aggressively and a lot more to come as we slowly get our self on the ground and operate locally from those countries. So consumer had a strong quarter, because cyclically they always have the second quarter strong, innovation helped STEP Change helped.

Obviously, you’ve taken a lot of cost, you’ve gotten a volume gain as Dinesh was referring to you in terms of the SG&A leverage, but was there anything else that happened in this quarter? Whether it was some inventory fill or temporary margin boost from product mix, or should we continue to see a nice ramp from kind of where we are?

How are Division President’s feel, so we will put our Division President in front of all of you and our major investors on April 29, in New York City, so you can hear directly from them the strategy they are manufacturing, their foot print, how they’re rationalizing many, many things, the operational drivers, and how we are pushing the value drivers and also you will have a chance to listen to a very lengthy and detailed presentation from our Chief Technology Officer, Richard, who is playing a key role in terms of taking a lead over competition.
So until then, we have as we just said to do development in our top line, partially as a pent-up demand, partly as the stimulus, which certainly helped as Europe’s stimulus was continuing to the end of December. So we will have to see when the stimulus disappears in Europe, what sort of impact it would have on the top line of our customers, which will directly sort of influence our top line, but at this point what we could do. 
We have done extremely well, that is rationalizing our cost, bringing much needed efficiency in the company and we continue to streamline that to become truly a best-in-class in our space.
Lastly I would say, Herbert and I have said, we are structuring this company for flat sales. So which means, we are rationalizing our cost structure as there’s no improvement in sales, any improvement in sales that comes is going to help us in the bottom line. So what should you expect, that’s hard to say at this point, plus we’re not giving any guidance.

The world’s largest market for S-Class is China today, believe it or not. So we get the order placed in Germany and the cars and our systems end up in China. The same thing Audi has announced, that second largest market in the world is China for them.
Porsche said in two years time China maybe the second largest market, so we are still seeing clear growth and demand for high end cars and that’s why we are showing our top line growth, but that’s not necessarily coming from matured markets like U.S. or Germany and such its coming from emerging markets like China.

It’s a new day for all of us in Harman and for all of us outside of Harman. With a new and confident face of the company we just launched this morning I am so delighted to host this conference today and I would like to thank you for joining Harman’s Third Quarter 2010 Investor and Analyst Call. 
I am joined here today by Herbert Parker, our Chief Financial Officer, and Bob Lardon, our Vice President, Investor Relations. We look forward to meeting many of you in person later today at our Investor and Analyst conference which is first ever hosted by Harman. And again all of us in management team of Harman are looking forward to having this dialogue with many of you.
Ladies and gentlemen, Harman’s performance in the third quarter is very encouraging and it demonstrates that our efforts to increase operational efficiency, accelerate product innovation and optimize our cost structure are delivering continued results. We grew sales by 42% year-over-year and we improved our operating income by more than $100 million. Prudent cash management, you heard me say cash is king and that will always be our mantra. Prudent cash management has helped us generate $106 million in cash from operations year-to-date for the first nine months of the year.
Our STEP Change program has delivered $321 million in permanent cost savings through March 31st 2010 and it remains ahead of targets we set ourselves. Our rigorous measures to reduce cost and improve productivity have helped us achieve a dramatic turnaround and we are not done yet. We now have the foundation to drive profitable and long-term growth. Since many of you will hear directly from my colleagues, division heads later today and also our Chief Technology Officer later today. I will therefore focus this morning's comments on four major initiatives.
Taken this quarter to support Harman's growth strategy for profitable growth, portfolio management, technology leadership and partnerships and brand penetration. We are taking many proactive steps to further improve our business. Throughout the day, you will hear us reference four strategic pillars. We will stay on the cutting edge of smart infotainment solutions. We will increase market penetration of branded audio solutions. We'll continue to achieve our industry's best-in-class capital and cost structure and very important personally for me, aggressively grow in the emerging markets, that’s where the largest growth opportunities for any company is out there.
So we’ve gotten off to a great start. On the growth front just this morning we announced our first acquisition in the emerging markets, the Brazilian company Selenium is the Latin American leader in the professional and consumer audio markets. This acquisition will give us an instant access to this fast growing emerging market through very well established sales channels, manufacturing footprint, both in the south and north of Brazil and of course a well functioning, extremely efficient engineering centre and I've personally visited this sites. 
In addition to Latin America, just last week we opened a joint research and development centre with China’s largest software technology company. The company is called Neusoft and our Chief Technology Officer Sachin Lawande whom you will hear later today personally was on the spot to cut the ribbon with hundreds of industry leaders as well as customers. This collaboration with New Soft which starts with over 500 engineers will accelerate our innovation and technology development activities and also allows us to expedite our growth in the Chinese automotive market.
These two agreements set the stage for our achievement of our emerging market strategy. As you know connectivity has and will continue to play a major role in the development of cutting edge infotainment solutions or in professional audio or in consumer audio. Recently we announced the sale of operating systems unit QNX to Research In Motion or RIM. RIM is a worldwide leader in mobile connectivity solution. This not only monetize our investment in QNX, but it also accelerates our collaboration with RIM to develop mobile connectivity solution for the automotive and audio space.
The approximately $200 million proceeds from the sale will give us greater flexibility as we pursue focused bolt-on acquisitions such Selenium this morning we announced. that is to compliment our existing portfolio and offerings we bring to the market. This morning we announced a new initiative to update and energize our corporate identity with a modernized Harman brand. This was done with great seriousness, this was done with terrific market intelligence, customer interviews, stakeholder interviews, various generations and various demographies and we found very conclusive result that there was a need to modernize Harman brand and brand architecture definition.
This will improve visibility for the Harman umbrella and its integrated solutions and it strengthen the associates among our individual brands. This is exciting and I would like to ask you to please take a moment to visit our new website which got a wonderful new look and lot of energy or look into today's Wall Street Journal or Financial Times or New York Times with a full page ad explaining our strategy, our brand architecture, our new energy logo.
And please experience the new Harman brand firsthand. We are excited to share with you that Harman has been chosen as an official sound sponsor of the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, supposedly the largest ever in the history which opens in just three days for its six months run. And my colleague, Division President for Professional Division, Blake Ausburger who some of you will meet this afternoon will personally will be there for the opening ceremony to kick it off.
This will showcase our new brand strategy over 70 million visitors from over 200 countries. Finally I am pleased to tell you that Harman is in advanced discussion with a leading global automaker to finalize the second implementation of our recently launched, scalable new generation automotive infotainment system. I am very excited about that. This is starting to be proven lot more successful than our own targets indicated.
We look forward to sharing additional details when the process permits. Looking back to these initiatives, you will see each of the four strategic pillars that we shared with you last quarter are hard at work including cutting-edge development or smart infotainment solutions, increasing market penetration of branded audio solutions, aggressive growth in the emerging markets and achieving our industry’s best in class structure for capital and cost efficiency. I am firm believer and a long time student of what (inaudible) said “to be the profit leader you have got to become the cost leader” they go hand in hand and that’s where we are headed. 
In summary, ladies and gentlemen I believe that we have continued to strengthen our foundation for sustainable improvement and profitable growth. Before I turn it over to my colleague Herbert Parker let me recap quickly our position.
We remain profitable for fiscal year 2010 and improving market conditions are driving sales growth. We enjoy an exceptional competitive position, as illustrated by our more than $10 billion in awarded business from our loyal customers most of the business is a repeat business. And some of the business has come for the first time at the expense of competition an award winning recognition for our premium brands. 
Our decision to continue the robust investment and innovation even during times of challenge is driving customer wins. Differentiation and market share gain. We are complimenting our core expertise with new strategic partners. The new day belong to collaboration strategy. No one can do it all, everyone has to reach out for the suitable partners and pick the best they’ve got and put it together the best solution your customers don’t even ask for, but they deserve. We are delivering on our commitment to aggressively expand in the emerging markets, with new products, new facilities, with talent we are hiring, distribution channels and focused marketing activities.
We had ample cash and liquidity to invest in innovation, this is very important to Dinesh Paliwal, innovation differentiated us in the past and innovation will continue to differentiate Harman from the rest of the pack. And real innovation, we will continue to seize new opportunities for growth in our home market and in emerging markets.
Finally, I think that we have and will continue to build the best management team in the industry. I am proud of this team. Thank you for your attention and I will ask Herbert Parker to provide a closer look at our quarterly results.

But for your ease of reference our restructuring charges totaled $60 million for the quarter.
Its okay, just go up with the top line, in the third quarter our sales increased across all three division o n a year-over-year comparison and primarily as a result of improved global economic conditions but also due to market share gains. Our sales for the third quarter were 848 million, which is 42% increase over the same period of last year. If we exclude foreign currency translation also decreed is 36%. This significant improvement was lead by the automotive division which entered 55% year-over-year increase. While reviewing this performance on a year to date for the first nine months of this fiscal year, our sales were 2.5 billion which was a 14% over the same period of last year or 12% when excluding foreign currency impact. 
Moving over to the production cost area, we reported a gross margin of 26.8% compared to 18.9% in the same period of last year. This margin increase was primarily due to higher factory utilization associated with increased sales and improved productivity as a result of our stiff change permanent cost savings initiatives.
In the control of cost area, our SG&A expense for the third quarter was 191 million, compared to 185 million last year of which R&D cost were 81 million and 79 million respectively. 
Excluding the effect of our currency translation total SG&A expense was essentially flat with the prior year, while R&D decreased by 2%. Now moving on to the bottom line we continue our profitable trend with the reported operating profit of 37 million, compared to an operating loss of $72 million last year. And as Dinesh mentioned earlier, this is a complete turnaround of $100 million improvement from the prior year.
On a year to date basis our operating margin now stands at 3.7% up from the 3.4% reported due to second quarter. Our net income for the third quarter was 22 million or $0.31 per share, compared to a net loss of $54 million or a loss of $0.93 per share in the same period last year.
This brings our year to date EPS to a positive $0.66 for the current fiscal year which is of course the complete turnaround from a lowest of $0.66 per share in the same period last year. 
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 21% which includes the effect of restructuring expenses and goodwill charges. Now, as of March 31st 2010, our total liquidity which we defined as cash plus short term investments, plus available revolving credit facilities was 649 million, compared to 630 million [as a ]period and ended the last period per quarter that is. Year to date positive cash flow from operating activities contributed to this increase. 
In closing, we are pleased to report a second consecutive quarter of positive EPS and I believe this underscores our commitment to continue the improvement and a quarter of account stability.
Visibility into future market conditions has begun to improve we can now make some reasonable assumptions about future performance expectations. As such you have noted our inclusion of mid term financial guidance in this morning’s press release.
In summary, for fiscal year 2013, we are guiding a top line [Cager] between 7 and 10% using our fiscal 2009 sales as our base year. Also we are guiding to an operating profit margin between of 7% and 10% and we are guiding to earnings per share of between $3 and $4. 
Now, at this point, I would like to thank you for your attention and before I ask the operator to open the call for questions, I’d like to say that today there is nick of unique opportunity from interview to have a face to face dialogue with our inter senior management team at our Analyst and Shareholders meeting today. Therefore, I’d encourage you’ll, I would encourage all of you to join the webcast for this event. 
Operator, we are now ready to take your question.

One of the reasons you have to look at it on a year-to-year basis that we have various supplier agreements that we negotiate for price concessions we get from our suppliers and on the other hand you are well aware of the annual price reductions that we have with our customers. The timing of these are normally consistent year-to-year. But they’re not consistent quarter to quarter. So that would be one of the factors that would be a negative and the other one is moving out a higher warranty expense charge in this third quarter compared to our second quarter. So those with distorted numbers. So we feel that our own born was still in [the reasonable good shape] for the margins, in the profit margin area.

In fact, some of you listening would recall, Paliwal has been on record saying we love to have QNX under our company portfolio, but I could do without it very easily. I’ve been saying that since I came in this company for one reason, very good reason. QNX is a great asset, but QNX really belongs to a very large software house with lot of application to grow. And under Harman, we were the restricting this business to grow.
I mean I already took them out from automotive and have them report almost like a independent division to me and allowed them to grow outside of automotive which they started to do. So by us moving them under a great connectivity software technology company, two things will happen. One, there will start to grow in automotive, much faster than they could with us. We standardized the software operating system. So majority of the cars out there, we’ve a leading position at QNX and we will continue to work QNX. Now our competition, lot of other players, they’re already using it.
By the way, Visteon F150 for Ford, that is the based this. Denso has been using QNX, Conti was trying to use QNX, but due to competitive nature probably have to have a little bit of firewall. All of those silo firewalls go away and QNX can start to really expend like a wildfire in automotive space and in other connectivity spaces, good for QNX, good for Harman.
We continue to have the same in-depth relationship and access to the technology, we have long-term development, arms length relationship like we enjoyed between QNX and our Harman Automotive system. We always had arms length relationship. So this has been just wonderful for our shareholders and by the way, I got so many accolades from our customers, German customers saying this was the best thing you did because now QNX can really nurture and grow in automotive space while you don’t have to say it belongs to only Harman.

If we did not have to go through this unprecedented recession, we would hit the double digit margin perhaps sooner in out years than we will now. The market is what market is as we say. Now we have also said and I repeat, we do believe and we will achieve double digit margin. When that happens that’s a question which we are not obviously guiding.
We say it by 2013, the range is 7% to 10% because a whole lot can happen during that period. We will invest very heavily in emerging markets. I have said I'm prepared to invest another $100 million just in China alone because China is a big, big place for all of us and we have to make up for the lost ground. We have been rather slow in the former years to go in China.
But a good thing is this management has a lot of experience. Personally, Herbert and I both have worked in China. So, we know what it takes. So we are going to invest heavily and you’ve seen the signs we formed the partnership with Neusoft. So a lot of those investment will also happen and I repeat what Herbert said. That is our underlying philosophy. Yes 2013 is few years out, but we are really investing in this business for long term and double digit is our goal. So should you look into midpoint? No, that would be too simplified for Himanhsu Patel. You do better job than that. So we let you sort of draw your own conclusions and see how business develops.

You and several, [Alice] just stated that the landscape and automotive has changed from a contribution module point of view meaning the selling price that we get less material costs. Now what we’ve done, we’ve taken a lot of calls out to mitigate some of those losses we lost in price because it is true that we do not enjoy the same margins in today’s time that we did in 2007 and 2006. So you can't take that number and do the math and get to the historical level, to the future on based on the history. What we’re doing is taking it based on the prices we have today and the players we have today to improve our margins. Now of course a lot of that depends on the revenues and our high goals, so that would obviously give us more leverage and it could be to the higher end, if the revenues are lower then it be at the lower end

You say 15 to 16 points or whatever number you used. You should realize that as a year, there is an APR, annual price reduction, anywhere from 3% to 5%, 3% to 6% point that gets deducted from the prices right at the beginning of the year, so you got to make up for that.
That's not just applied to Harman, it's applies to everybody that's why most of the players in infotainment don't even make money, we do make money. So that's the environment we are in, second technology complexity is only going in one direction which we love because that suits us because we are highly innovative, so with that environment and also the price pressure overall in the market place with the economy, it's harder for car manufacturers to sell car at the price they used to. So they are looking for health every year, so that's all compounded into add pricing pressure which we realize and Herbert just mentioned.
Now, we are offsetting that, we are countering that and on top of that we are bringing double digit margin this is what we said, I said when I came in here and we are delivering on that in mid-term guidance. That's what we are and I also say one more thing. I don't think there is any other company who can even come close to that in terms of profitability in our space. So, but again you should expect from us because we have said, and we have always delivered superior shareholder value and we will do that and we are doing right now. So it's a new environment and we are dealing with it and dealing very successfully.

And unless we standardize like most of the industries have, look at GE, look at ABB, look at Siemens, there are certain standards where they create differentiation in the middleware, is in the application, is in the solution.
So operating system doesn’t really make or break in terms of your differentiation, we would like to see this become standard but what we had already achieved with QNX under us for five years or so is in-depth knowledge of QNX, we know the [panel]. We can dig up this damn thing all the way to the source code level which will take several years for anybody else to figure it out.
So with that knowledge, we all will have that unique advantage but now as it spreads, in auto industry and outside, they can invest more into R&D of QNX to give us faster, better products which probably we would have not been able to do ourself. So that’s the bottom line and as I said, I believe what customers say, talk to top three German customers, all in unison said the same thing. Mr. Paliwal you should have done that when you came in this company first. I said no I had to understand the company, so we have made the right choice.
We continue to support QNX very strongly but this doesn't really affect our competitiveness or it doesn't create any competition. Plus we are not afraid of competitive environment because of the QNX. if we are afraid of, we are afraid of is someone going to do better system integration, better application write-up, better connectivity in the car, better multimedia, better sound system, so the whole lot more than just QNX

Our progress has been extremely encouraging; with all key performance indicators are improving. While navigating a deep and persistent global economic downturn, we have clearly demonstrated that our efforts to optimize our business portfolio and global footprint, accelerate product innovation and transform our cost structure are delivering results.
On a year-over-year basis, we grew sales for the quarter by 29% and by 18% for the full year. We are also proud to report that we ceased new growth opportunities in Brazil, India and China, where we grew combined our sales by 330% to more than $0.25 billion level. 
Our order backlog now stands at $12.2 billion, driven largely by increasing demand in the automotive market for our next generation technology platforms we launched in last few quarters. Our non-GAAP operating income of $30 million for the quarter contributed to an increase of more than $200 million for the full fiscal year. And I'm pleased to report that we are ending the year in an extremely strong cash position. Our prudent cash management and the successful sale of QNX Software Systems has helped us improve our cash position to $646 million. While we're still financing the recent acquisition of Selenium, in Brazil, and fully paying down our revolving credit facility, it is quite remarkable. 
We have increased our total liquidity by 48% to $871 million level on a year-on-year basis. Once again, that is a remarkable achievement. That gives us plenty of flexibility for the strategic initiatives we see ahead. As reported in the news, many large electronic component suppliers in Japan, Germany and the United States struggled to meet an unprecedented increase in demand and obviously the life on these suppliers. In order to meet our own production needs, so that we can keep our customer's production lines humming without any interruption, we made the decision to incur additional cost in procurement and logistics during the quarter to ensure that we have sufficient allocation of electronic components and we were successful in making sure our customers had full production lines running 24 X 7 as they desired. 
This upsurge in demand also increased our confidence to accelerate investments in additional production lines, sales, marketing and business development to continue our market share gains. Harman's STEP Change program remains ahead of target and it delivered $350 million in permanent cost savings which is nearly 90% of our total program and those $350 million permanent cost savings were achieved as of fourth quarter and that positions Harman for a new and of best-in-class cost and capital structure.
Herbert Parker will provide a closer look at our quarterly and full year results in few minutes. Meanwhile, I will share a few strategic highlights of our recent activities. I am very pleased to announce two significant new automotive awards worth $1.8 billion as reported in our press release today and it's also on our slide back you might have seen by now. 
Our scalable next generation infotainment system which we launched fall of 2009 calendar year, has scored another big win. With the announcement today that Harman will supply future vehicles worldwide for Chrysler Group and for Fiat Group. This award complements our long standing branded audio and infotainment relationship at Chrysler and brings another exciting global automotive award with Fiat. 
We are also pleased to report another strategic win with the news that Toyota will offer Harman infotainment on its vehicle sold in North America. Ladies and gentlemen that is again a big game changer. This follows a similar Toyota European award that we announced earlier. We are extremely pleased. We are very pleased to win this new comparative infotainment business at Toyota as well as Fiat and Chrysler. And that complements our successful branded audio relationship with Toyota and Chrysler. 
As you know, we also announced a few weeks ago that Harman was selected by BMW to provide the premium entry infotainment system for its entry level luxury vehicles. Many of you know that we have always been the leader in premium high infotainment segment of the market. Now with our successful launch of premium mid, that is our next generation scalable system we launched last year and now the premium entry infotainment system, we have rounded out and expanded our market and we are able to spread now our research and development dollars and engineering costs over a larger base; meaning much bigger scale. That means cost savings and higher efficiencies. This will also mean a significant savings in coming years, not just in this year, and much wider customer in geographic penetration to come. These new projects contribute to an awarded business backlog now at $12.2 billion. That is up by 39% from $8.8 billion at the end of last fiscal year. 
As I noted earlier, we successfully completed the sale of QNX Software Systems and we acquired Selenium Company in Brazil during this fourth quarter. That sharpens our portfolio and gives Harman a strong foothold in the high opportunity markets of Latin America. We will continue to look for strategic bolt-on acquisitions that complement our portfolio with new products and new technologies. And we have number of such very good companies which are accretive to our numbers in our site. 
Many of you have already seen the efforts of our increased brand marketing activities. At the end of April, we launched a new cost identity program which includes those new Harman brand and co-branding across our portfolio of legendary names. That program was launched through a major advertising campaign in Fortune and Financial Times and Wall Street Journal, New York Times and various other leading journals and magazines, and it will continue to roll out globally in aggressive marketing activities across all Harman brands. 
In the professional sector, Harman continues to support leading venues and entertainers while driving customer awareness that carries across to our other businesses. An estimated 70 million visitors are experiencing Harman at the current Shanghai World Expo, where we serve as an official sound partner and our professional audio systems are installed at all of 25 Expo venues. The professional divisions also introduced a record high 100 new products during the fiscal year and several of these products was featured in the very first ever, in the industry, the first ever application of the Ethernet Audio-Video Bridge or which is generally known as Ethernet AVB, for integrated streaming of audio and video. That is going to change the industry we believe. We expect additional opportunities for the professional divisions from our recent acquisition of Selenium in Brazil which makes Harman the market leader for professional loudspeakers in this fast growing region.
The Harman consumer division recently opened a new global product development center in Shenyang, China; putting these operations in close proximity to major suppliers, contract manufacturers and the fastest growing consumer markets. The division also recently appointed China's leading multimedia distributor to support its growth strategy in China. Harman consumer division introduced also record high last five years, 88 new products during the fiscal year, supported by brand advertising and websites of more than 25 languages and new social media platforms; so exciting things to happen.
Looking back to these initiatives, you will again see each of the four strategic pillars that we shared with you earlier. That is number one, including cutting-edge development of smart infotainment solution; number two, increasing market penetration of our branded audio; number three, aggressive growth in the emerging markets; and number four, achieving industry's best-in-class cost structure and capital efficiency.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Harman's fiscal year 2010 performance validates our strategy and positions our company to execute more profitability on its expanding large awarded business and other backlog. We will continue to drive for continuous improvement and we are imagining among the winners as the global recovery finds its footing and Harman delivers on its strategy for increasing shareholder value. 
Before I turn it over to Herbert let me recap our position for fiscal year 2010. All key performance indicators are improving. We posted an increase of 18% in sales for the full year and improved profits by more than $200 million. Our automotive order backlog of more than $12.2 billion to be precise $12.2 billion, provides a healthy revenue stream for the next several years and solidifies Harman's position as the market leader in our space. 
Our executive innovation programs continue to drive new and comparative replacement wins from major customers and gain market share. We grew our sales in Brazil, India and China or BIC countries, BIC, by 330% to a $0.25 billion level. We are rapidly building full capabilities in these emerging markets to continue to outpace our competition and the market growth by itself. 
Our landmark STEP Change program is delivering as expected and both, and we remain ahead of target in achieving $400 million in permanent cost and productivity improvement. 
Our balance sheet remains strong and our cash position provides us with plenty of flexibility for the strategic initiatives to create superior shareholders value. I thank you for your attention and I will now ask my colleague Herbert Parker to provide a closer look at our quarterly results.

Good morning everyone. As you have just heard from Dinesh, we have completed another quarter of good progress towards our goals.

As you have just heard from Dinesh, we have completed another quarter of good progress towards our goals. To help identifying the specific improvements related to these achievements I will now present a few more details on the financials. 
Hopefully, this will give you a better understanding of our developments during the quarter. As mentioned in our previous call, and for the benefit of new investors, most of my financial comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis which excludes restructuring costs and goodwill write-offs. And as usual, you will find a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results in our press release which was issued this afternoon. 
For your easy of reference, our restructuring charges totaled $4 million during the quarter. We have also reclassified our results to reflect the sale of the QNX business which is now shown in discontinued operations. The estimated earnings per share for QNX is included in our results, would have been an additional $0.02 for the quarter and $0.13 for the year. 
I will now focus my attention and the rest of our discussion, focus my discussions on the figures in the results of our continuing operations, unless otherwise noted. Okay, let's start with the top line. In the fourth quarter, our sales increased across all three divisions on a year-over-year basis. Primarily, as a result of improved global economic conditions, but also due to market share gains. 
Our sales for the fourth quarter were $851 million which is a 29% increase over the same period of last year. If we exclude foreign currency translation effect, our sales increased 35%. This significant improvement was led by the automotive division which had a 35% year-over-year increase or 43% excluding foreign currency impact. On a full year basis our sales were $3.4 billion which is an 18% increase over the same period of last year or 17% excluding foreign currency impact.
Now, moving on to the production cost area. We reported a gross profit margin of 26.3% from prior to 20.8% than the same period last year. This margin increase was primarily due to higher factory utilization associated with increased sales and improved productivity as a result of our STEP Change, permanent cost saving initiatives.
In the controllable cost area, our SG&A expense for the fourth quarter declined 3.3 percentage points to 22.8% of sales compared to the prior year. Of our total SG&A expense, R&D cost represented 9.8% of sales compared to 12% of sales in the prior year.
Moving on to the bottom line, we continued our profitable trend reporting an operating profit of $30 million compared to an operating loss of $35 million during the same period last year. The operating margin for the fourth quarter was 3.5%. Our net income for the fourth quarter was $21 million or $0.30 per share compared to the net loss of $25 million or a loss of $0.43 per share in the same period last year. 
This brings our year-to-date earnings per share to $0.85 for the current fiscal year compared to a loss of $1.23 per share last year. And this excludes QNX as I said earlier. 
Our effective annual tax rate for the continuing operation was 17.5% which includes the impact of restructuring expenses and goodwill charges. 
I would like to point out that as of June 30, 2010, our total liquidity, which we define as cash, plus short-term investments and available revolving credit facility was $871 million compared to $649 million as of the end of the prior quarter. This increase is primarily related to the proceeds from the QNX divestment and positive cash flow from our operating activities, less cash used within investment activities to complete the acquisition of Selenium. 
In closing, I would like to say that we are pleased to report a third consecutive quarter of positive earnings per share and we believe this solidifies our commitment to continuous improvement and a culture of accountability. At this point, I would like to thank you for your attention and operator; we are now ready to take your questions.

But we believe based on their commitment that most of the logistics and delivery issues are behind us so we should not have to incur additional cost in supply-chain in automotive. 
For our consumer or actually I would say for the whole company, you should expect us to start to spend some healthy money in marketing our products and brand because we have determined the fairly solid correlation when we market ourselves we see gain in our top-line as well as in our gross profit, and we are seeing a significant increase in the hit rate on our web pages as well as the retention of the web pages and our distributor supply fleet, so you should expect that to go up. But that's a very good investment. It's a payback within a year or so.

We believe we have some more room to improve the profitability of this business while we continue to grow and the reason I say so with conviction because professional market is highly fragmented. We are the largest player in this business and now we are decisively going after smaller players and also since we have the total system approach and we are selling the value of the total system approach to many contractors are turning their attention towards us. 
Number three, emerging market businesses growing very rapidly, especially all the digital, professional audio systems are being implemented or installed in China, and Russia, and Brazil and India, and we have much in a role to play there and by us investing in local organizations, which we are today we have 1,200 people at Harman level in China alone. So that is going to help us expedite gain market share gain while we continue to inch on competition in our home market like US and Europe. So, bottom-line is we are driven to drive the top-line while we still believe we have room to improve the profitability of professional business.

There are components, there are lead times for 16 weeks now. Lead times have gone up to 20 weeks. So we are talking silicon and microchip, microchip controllers, those are in great demand David and what's driving the demand curve higher than ever is the smart phone devices. The growth of HTC Smart Phone Evo, iPhone 4G Phone and various other devices, so they are sucking up the demand and the wafer producers in Japan, Germany and US are scrambling to ramp up the lines. They actually slowed down or even brought down their lines faster than they should have. So that's our issue. In our case we had actually more capacity than customers demanding right now, because we have the same capacity or more what we had in 2008 when we had $3 billion worth of automotive business. So we are constrained with our supplier and we are using the leverage of the large OEMs to put pressure on microchip suppliers and gain benefit on that. So, end of the day, we believe the cost is a small piece because we're investing in our long-term relationship with Audi, BMW, Mercedes by being uniquely in front of all others and fulfilling their production requirements while others are struggling. So having said that, I don't know where you heard the cycle times are reducing, we hope that would be the case in coming quarters, but in fourth quarter, certainly not.

So we are going to be saving lot of R&D dollars and we are going to bring speed. So traditionally, we used to take three years to develop, now with this new schemes approach we have, we will do that in 12 months, the customers are ready. But generally customers need probably 12 to 24 months, that's why our revenue stream would come little later but faster than traditional model would have allowed.

Last quarter we had the same slide Himanshu, if I recall correctly. In fact, we have said almost two years ago that our goal is to achieve double-digit return on sales and that has not changed. Unfortunately this is unprecedented recession that timing got pushed we would have achieved that if we didn't have this once in a life time for me at least, the recession. We would have achieved in fiscal 11 double-digit. So now when we give you the targets on April 29, we say its seven to 10. We say its seven meaning if really things get worse, 10 meaning if this is the norm we are living in we should achieve 10 if things continue to be what we felt they are. 
Now, I mentioned to you earlier, with the new orders we have especially for the next generation scalable and hopefully if schedule perhaps would be hold and I'm not at the liberty to say the timing. We do have a potential upside for the top-line as well as on bottom-line. So we might actually achieve slightly better result if that potential upside comes in. But definitely for the out-years beyond the guidance we have given, we expect that upside to come in.

The way it was, the first year of ramp up, you are talking about 25%, 30% of the full scale volume, then second and third years are really the adulthood of the programs. They run really full speed. Then the fourth and fifth year the stock too declined because by then they are already either doing some sort of a refresh or there is a new technology being worked on. So there is stock to do some other programs with that. 
So the second, third year are the best year symptoms of revenue. That's why these days' life cycles are starting to shrink. It used to be seven year life cycle five, six years ago. Now life cycles are running four to five years. More and more we predict technology leader will drive ourselves the lifecycles to three years, because technology is moving so fast, we will push them and that would work to benefit because if we bring to them new technology online, upload solutions then we have more revenue to gain and we can launch those. So right now four to five years for second and third year is the full, so if you have a full year revenue on a $1.8 billion program, you might be running $500 million to $600 million revenue when fully ramped up.

Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for joining the Harman first quarter 2011 Investor and Analyst Call. I’m joined here in Stamford, Connecticut by Herbert Parker, our Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Lardon, Vice President, Investor Relations.
I’m pleased to report another strong performance by the Harman team, extending our streak of year-over-year improvement to four quarters at both top and bottom line. Our sharp focus on execution, innovation, cost management and capital efficiency is clearly paying off for a number of quarters already.
We continue to see steady and continuous improvement in our served markets. We are taking aggressive steps to strengthen our footprint in the emerging markets.
Year-over-year we grew sales for the first quarter by 19% in local currency. Our non-GAAP operating income of $40 million represents a strong improvement from our return to breakeven just a year ago, as to our first quarter earnings of $0.35 per share. Our total liquidity of $875 million has increased 62% from the same period a year ago.
What a different world we have today, reflecting our intense cost, and capital focus and portfolio management. This puts Harman in a strong position as we execute on our large backlog of $12 billion awarded business, continue our rich innovation programs and evaluate potential growth investments.
It is noteworthy both Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s recognize our hard work and last month they upgraded the company two notches. As you know, our cost and productivity improvement programs and emerging markets focus have been instrumental in achieving this solid progress.
We remain ahead of schedule on our STEP Change program. We captured $373 million in permanent savings through September 30 this year, compared to our own target of $317 million. So we’re way ahead of our own program and we will achieve $400 million in coming quarters.
Last week we announced another key emerging market milestone, as we broke ground for Harman’s largest world class manufacturing and development complex in the northern city of Dandong in China, in order to serve the rapid growth of domestic demand in China.
I’m pretty sure you are all aware of the kind of record numbers we are seeing from Audi, from Mercedes and BMW, they are all our customers and they are all posting 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% growth. So it’s something very wonderful happening in China. I just came back from there after nine days.
So this factory will take advantage of local incentives and a fast track approach to complete this new 430,000 square foot Greenfield facility by summer of 2011. Once again such things don’t happen. Typically it takes a year to two years to build a factory to bring it online, but here we will bring it online in seven to eight months. That’s our speed.
This new complex is part of $100 million in investment that we have set aside for our strategic initiatives in China. We enjoy excellent relationships and strong support from key government officials and other stakeholders in China. This was reinforced by a series of high-profile activities in China last week, in which the entire Harman board of directors and top management participated for over a week.
Along with visits to our Shanghai and Suzhou facilities, Harman executives joined me at the Shanghai World Expo. To experience the Harman professional audio systems that have hosted more than 70 million visitors over the past six months from around the world, we also opened a new Harman flagship showroom in downtown Shanghai and met with top government officials and leading research scientists and think tank both in Shanghai and Beijing.
We wrapped up the week with a VIP event in Shanghai’s Grand Theater, drawing 300-plus key customers, executives, C-level suite and partners from 20 countries around the world. That was a show of confidence and satisfaction in Harman from our customers and partners. I’m very confident that this collaboration with our key stakeholders will generate many new opportunities in one of the world’s most important markets, China and of course the rest of the world.
Earlier in the quarter, we formally inaugurated our acquisition of Selenium in Brazil, at the region’s largest trade fair for audio systems. Our new Latin America unit we have renamed Harman to Brazil, put on a highly professional exhibit under the Harman banner. This will drive distribution of existing and new products from both our professional and consumer divisions to local, Brazilian and Latin American markets.
I’m truly energized by my discussion with local customers and employees as well as with the world-class network of distributors which this acquisition brought to Harman.
The strong local interest in our premium brands is clear, and we intend to aggressively leverage our investment in entire Latin American region towards the goal of $150 million revenue in Brazil by 2012. We feel actually very, very happy about that number now.
As you know, we have received several significant automotive orders early in the first quarter. These include our scalable next-generation infotainment system at Chrysler, Fiat Group and Toyota North America and wireless headphone system technology to complement our latest generation infotainment system at Mercedes-Benz. We intend to continue executing with precision on these awards, as they joined our automotive customers in rolling out their latest offerings.
During this quarter, we supported the model launch of premium Harman systems on a wide range of new vehicles from Ferrari, Hyundai, Kia, Peugeot and Range Rover and many more.
Broadening our innovation pipeline, we also introduced a new in-vehicle computing module developed in collaboration with Intel and we also partnered with Marvell and other Silicon Valley great technology company to launch new mobile Wi-Fi hotspot capability in the car and both the CEOs of Marvell, the Co-CEO as well with us in Shanghai to show strength that we work very closely with Harman and they met with many other partners.
In the Professional segment, our systems welcome visitors to the Shanghai World Expo in China as I mentioned earlier as well as the FIFA as we call it soccer here, but the true football of the world in South Africa and the Commonwealth Games in India.
We also shared the stage at such high profile events as the primetime Emmy Awards, Miss Universe Pageant and MTV Music Video Awards, dozens of new Harman professional products premiered at the Professional Lighting and Sound Association, also known as PLASA show in London during September.
Our Consumer Audio team kicked off the quarter at Berlin Germany at IFA Consumer Electronics show where we booked $25 million on-site, and I was there personally to witness the activity level.
New products from several Harman consumer brands were launched on time for the upcoming holiday shopping season, including a series of Signature AKG headphones developed and launched in cooperation with Music Legend Quincy Jones and Quincy was with us actually as our brand ambassador in IFA Berlin to launch a Signature series headphones that is designed by Harman.
Other new Harman products won two prestigious best product category awards from the European Imaging and Sound Association also known as EISA.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are off to a strong start in this fiscal year. We are well-positioned to have secured profitably on our large order backlog of $12 billion while making the investment that would support continued growth. Before I turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker, let me recap a few key points.
We have fought back from a very challenging global economic cycle with four consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement at top and bottom line. Our automotive order backlog of $12 billion provides excellent visibility into our revenue stream over the next several years.
Since its launch 12 months ago, we have booked $2 billion in orders for our scalable next-generation system and some of you may recall, I said that is going to be a game changer. Ladies and gentlemen it has proven to be a game changer and we’re very pleased with this.
Our leading-edge innovation programs continue to drive new wins and market share gains. Our aggressive emerging markets focus is helping Harman claim its share of new opportunities in Asia and Latin America and of course in emerging markets of Eastern Europe and Russia and we are adding significant capacity to meet this new demand of tomorrow and five years and 10 years out.
Our improved performance and a strong balance sheet are reflected in recent ratings upgrade that would reduce the cost of capital in the future. Our landmark STEP Change program has delivered the permanent savings that will help us achieve of a mid and long-term goals.
I thank you for your attention and I’ll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker to provide you a closer look at our quarterly results. Thank you.

As you’ve just heard from Dinesh, we have completed another quarter of good progress towards our goals. To help identify the specific improvements related to these achievements, I’d now present a few more details on the financials. Hopefully, this would give you a better understanding of our developments during this quarter.
As mentioned in our previous calls and for the benefit of new investors, most of my financial comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes non-restructuring items such as restructuring cost and goodwill write-offs. As usual, you will find a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results in our press release, which was issued this morning.
For your ease and reference, our restructuring activities resulted in a credit of $3 million during the quarter. This was primarily due to a better than expected execution of our restructuring activities.
Let’s start with the top-line. In the first quarter, our sales increased across all three divisions on a year-over-year comparison, primarily as a result of improved global economic conditions, but also due to market share gains and our recent acquisition of Selenium in Brazil. Our sales for the first quarter were at $837 million, which is a 12% increase over the same period of last year. In local currency, our sales increased 19%.
Now moving on to the production cost area. We reported a gross profit margin of 26.7% compared to 25.8% last year. This margin increase was primarily due to higher sales and improved productivity.
In our controllable cost area, our SG&A expense for the first quarter was reduced by 3.4 percentage points to 22% of sales compared to the prior year. Of our total SG&A expense, R&D cost represented 9.1% of sales compared to 10.6% in the prior year.
Moving on to the bottom line, we continued our profitable trend, reported an operating profit of $40 million compared to an operating profit of just $3 million during the same period of last year.
The operating margin for the first quarter was 4.8%, which is a significant improvement over the prior year performance. Our net income for the first quarter was $25 million or $0.35 per share compared to a net loss of $4 million or negative $0.08 per share last year. Our effective quarterly tax rate on a GAAP basis for continuing operations was 21.9%.
Also I’d like to state that at September 30, 2010, our total liquidity which we defined as cash plus short-term investments and available revolving credit facility was $875 million. Year-over-year, our total liquidity increased 62%. This gives us ample flexibility for strategic initiatives.
In closing, I’d like to say that we are pleased to report our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvements and this shows we are well on track to meet our long-term goals.
At this point, I’d like to thank you for your attention and operator we are now ready to take questions.

So, we are not incurring any additional cost for securing the supply and still meeting and exceeding our customers like Audi, BMW, Mercedes, their needs however are still work-in-progress and very challenging.

Volkswagen has been making a lot of cars already and now the latest is Mercedes-Benz and BMW are stepping up and announcing their production plan. So I know I gave you bit more than what you had asked, but I don’t have a specific number.

As you know in the past, we had relationships with our partners. Like in case of Mercedes, we have a global distribution for all our products, so virtually all Mercedes-Benz go out worldwide with Harman system now. That’s not the case Himanshu with every single supplier we work with, so they were just spilt that China, Japan was with Asian supplier, and we had the Europe and America which I believe is also a emerging trend like BMW the latest orders we secured which we already announced, these are global orders and they in fact force us now that we make sure that all language versions of navigation and multimedia and connectivity module worldwide come from Harman not from a supplier.
So we may choose to have either all develop ourselves or still work with suppliers, but go through us which means we will take the revenue for these systems going into China and other places. So BMW is a split between us and a partner from Japan at the moment as an example. Himanshu if I may, this is such an important point to really emphasize. China is growing faster than rest of the world in terms of car sales and of course penetration of infotainment and audio systems is also potential to improve fast speed penetration.
Therefore, brand recognition and joint marketing programs with automotive makers would be a key and that’s something we have been approached by our partner automotive companies that you see 85% to 90% of the cars buyers in China are first-time car owners. They don’t know even how to select the car and what feature functionality.
So part of the $100 million investment we announced last week was to invest in co-marketing activities with our automaker partners and also invest money in car labs, in demos like we have had Harman Kardon in Munich in Stuttgart and Frankfurt and we are working with other companies like AEG and other American company, which the biggest center of Expo would convert into Mercedes-Benz arena and we are the second biggest partner. So it would be Harman Kardon and Mercedes-Benz arena.

I might be preempting some of the questions in advance. We have said that we will manage the company including this explosive growth in some markets by China and other places, around 2.5% of our sales as a capital expenditure. So I am confirming that that is still true, even with our investment in China plus or minus 25 to 50 basis points. There might be a year we will be less than 2.5% by 25 basis points, might be a year 25 to 50 basis point higher. So capital expenditure is not going to be exceeding. When it comes to controllable other costs, that’s a sales and marketing, that’s a good cost actually that generate sales, that creates revenue which is profitable and I’d like to sort of reinforce again.
Our revenue in China is profitable and I don’t want to use anything more than that, that might give us this disadvantage to negotiate later, but it’s a very good business. The more we grow in terms of adding more sales people on the ground, more administration people to take the orders and of course manufacturing, that’s a good one. It’s a payback within 12 months whatever we’re doing including co-marketing activities and R&D centre we have now in Shanghai and Shenzhen, a very well flourishing R&D centre. So they are actually doing work, which is almost immediately productized. So, Himanshu, in net-net what Herbert and I are saying here, we do not have any big step costs coming up from China, it would be part of the working capital as we go, it would be part of the sales generation. In a percent of sales nothing is going to go out of whack.

So that’s a good start because people like to buy, but there you have a quite a spread, because these ranges from very low systems, they are good quality, but low in scope or very high systems like Mercedes Benz.
How much Harman supply? I think that’s a question. I tried to answer last month, before, all Mercedes business is with Harman worldwide. BMW, we share with a partner and going forward with Hyundai, we do it ourselves completely. We do Shanghai GMR sell [ph]. So you should expect lot more to come from Harman in terms of taking bigger share of global supply including China.
When it comes to audio, there is no sharing. We do it ourselves and that’s where we feel our biggest profit making opportunity is. The branded audio we need to push hard like Lexus. Whenever a Lexus or Toyota car is sold, it has Harman audio system. Buick, they carry Harman Kardon system or infinity system. So if we can improve a few percentage of penetration in audio, which is a function of marketing and consumer approach, this is going to create very good bottom line for our business unlike like just infotainment, which is very challenging business to make money.

What sign of the kind of run rate of those two line items going forward? How does that trend down or trend higher, as we grow? And then it looks like the gross margin contribution margin this quarter was about 30%, 35%, is that the right number to be using going forward, and if possible, how does that vary by business unit?

So that’s a goal that we go ahead. So if you are looking on an annualized basis, that’s what you can look at as normal as beating last year’s number. When it comes to the gross margin, we’ve never given out the gross margin guidance, so I can’t give you a number on that one because that’s something we have never stated publicly regarding the gross margin.

That’s not really our number one priority. From my own experience over 30 years, the best return on investment you get is from organic growth. So we will continue to push that hard and we are happy we are seeing that and then of course, we will look at opportunistically any tuck-in bolt-on technology acquisitions or if something gives us great channel access in the marketplace so that we can flow our product through those channel like Selenium. I don’t think we are interested in any large acquisition unless somebody comes with magically compelling case which makes us our cash and our earnings profitability and everything looks so much better. We’ll look at it.
We’re looking as we have said anywhere from $50 million to $200 million worth of companies opportunistically, both in mature markets like U.S. and Europe as well as in emerging markets. U.S. primarily for technology because these are the companies which are not global, we can take them global and take cost out and let them do faster innovation and in emerging markets, primarily for the channel access and faster access to the manufacturing and resources. Now I’ll let Herbert talk about it, is anything else to add about capital.

Good evening. Jennifer, let me then give my closing comments. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased, very pleased with the improvement our team has delivered this quarter, but I am nowhere close to satisfied. We have a long way to go. Focusing on the fundamentals of execution, innovation, cost management and capital efficiency, I hope it comes very clear. We are very clear in our mind what are the four top priorities and we are executing on all our four same time. It’s all about execution. We got this strategy right. It’s all about execution. Our customers and our employees are energized by the progress we are making. They are motivated and we are working aggressively to extend our collaboration with third party innovators.
I am personally very excited by my recent interaction with the stakeholders in several continents in Latin America and Europe and Asia and here in North America and including some government officials who can also play key role, particularly in China where Chinese government is pushing for leadership in electric and hybrid technology, the clean technology, sustainable clean technology and Harman can really help that industry because we do have the green technology. These meetings reveal at all levels our meeting is sprit of mutual respect and collaboration, that is unsurpassed in Harman’s history and we look forward to welcoming new customers as Chris asked earlier through our intense innovation and emerging market programs.
We appreciate your confidence in the company. You are the owners of the company, investors. We continue to work to make Harman a best-in-class performer in technology and market share and reputation.
Let me just recap by saying, we have nearly achieved the best-in-class cost structure in the company. We are getting close to having the best-in-class global footprint and we have global opportunities, because we are truly acting as a global company rather than calling ourselves only Harman International. We have the world-class capabilities in terms of R&D and product development, and there is no question in my mind we are the best when it comes to technology. So with that said, I thank you all for your attention and I appreciate your continuous interest in our company and you have our promise, we’ll continue to work as hard as we have, even harder to improve the company’s performance. I thank you all and have a great day and good evening.
